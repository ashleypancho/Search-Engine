This tutorial shows you how to use displacement mapping to make a simple environment.

# Make a grid. (Add/Mesh/Grid) 32x32 will do just fine.  Be sure to create a Grid instead of a Plane, or you'll end up with just a flat plane!  This is because a Plane only has four vertices to manipulate - one for each corner - while a Grid has many, many more.  A 32x32 Grid, for example, would have over 1000 vertices.  The more vertices there are to manipulate, the more effect displacement mapping will have on the finished product.
# Set it smooth. (Editing/Link and Materials/Set Smooth)
# Make a new material for it. (Shading/Material/Add New)
# Make a new texture for the material. (Shading/Texture/Add New)
# Go to Shading/Texture Buttons. You can see your newly created texture there now.
# Change Texture Type to Clouds.
# Change the name of the texture to be more descriptive. For example GroundDisp or something similar.
# Go back to Shading/Material buttons. You can see our cloud texture applied now, but it's not applied correctly yet.  Let's fix this next.
# Go to Shading/Map To. This defines how the selected texture is mapped on our material. Uncheck Col, check Disp on, and set the Disp slider to a value like 0.200
# Set camera and a few lights to the scene.  (This is already done as part of the default scene in recent versions of Blender, such as 2.49)
# Render.

:: Several individuals, when working through this tutorial, had trouble getting anything more than a flat plane.  A few solutions were proposed (most are still visible on the Talk page), and while each worked in its own way, the vast majority of the time the problem stemmed from creating a Plane instead of a Grid.  Be sure to follow each step very carefully to ensure you don't miss anything or do a step incorrectly.

You can tweak the environment easily by changing Nor value in the Shading/Map To. This defines how strongly the displacement texture affects the material.

You could also add subsurfing to the ground area to get smoother results. Also feel free to tweak the texture and try out different alternatives.

Once your mountain looks good, try adding some Mist.

# Select the &quot;Mist&quot; button on the &quot;Mist/Stars/Physics&quot; Tab among the World buttons
# Add a Cloud Texture to the World and make it blend from white to gray

The end result is something like this:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stephen Covey outlines several concepts before describing the &quot;Seven Habits&quot; in detail.

== Character vs. personality ethic ==
The author describes the difference between what he describes as the '''personality ethic''' and the '''character ethic'''. The character ethic is the idea that a person advances in basis of their character. This was culturally the main idea expressed in the US up until about WWI, when popular literature began to focus more on short-cuts and easy ways to manipulate situations or to get what you want. Character ethic depends on deep changes within each of us, while the personality ethic falls back on methods or techniques. The personality ethic does not challenge us; neither does it bring about deep changes within us. Phrases characteristic of the personality ethic are '''think positive''' and '''believe in yourself'''.

== Paradigms and paradigm shifts ==
Paradigms are the mental maps that we use to describe the world around us. They are the lens that each of us uses to understand everyone and everything. The key of a paradigm isn't as much in the true nature of a thing as much as our perception of the thing.
 
Covey uses the example of a person trying to find his way through Chicago with a map of Detroit. No matter how hard he tries, he will never be successful. In the same way, when we have erroneous ideas of what something is like, we are destined to fail in dealing with whatever it is. We should work to have correct and healthy understandings of the world around us.

A paradigm shift is when we abandon an incorrect paradigm for a correct one. Covey describes how once he was frustrated in the subway to see the very bad behavior of a man's children, but when he found out that they were coming from the hospital where the mother had just died an hour before, his perspective changed completely. 

The key to maintain correct paradigms is to keep an open mind and realize that however much we see, there is always more to the picture.

== Principles ==
Principles are time experimented values that have worked through the ages regardless of social context.  Values such as &quot;seek first to understand, then to be understood&quot; or &quot;the golden rule: do unto others what you would have done unto you&quot; are the values that effective people of all ages have embraced.  They are not quick fixes, not something that you learn and execute over night.  They are values that you have to work on and master in order to become effective.

== Step-by-step development ==

== Raising our level of thinking ==

== Dependence &gt;&gt; Independence &gt;&gt; Interdependence ==
The habits are designed, when you put them in practice, to help you mature as a person. This process of maturing is described below:

:'''Dependence &gt;&gt; Independence &gt;&gt; Interdependence'''

We all start out life as babies completely '''dependent''' on our parents or other person to take care of us. This is a state of weakness and powerlessness.

As we grow up we work to become '''independent''', moving out of our parent's home, earning money for ourselves, etc. A person at this level is able to do things for himself and does not need anyone else to survive. 

The greatest human achievements come from people working at the third level, '''interdependence'''. This is when people work together to achieve a common goal, and is the level of maturity of many people in a mature society or organization. This is how mankind has achieved things together that no single person could do alone. Interdependence is the state of human development of greatest maturity and power.

As we develop our character as people, we grow in each of the seven areas described by the seven habits. In this process we move up the chart from dependence to independence to interdependence.

== Efficiency vs. Effectiveness ==
You can be efficient with things but not people.  With people you must be effective.

== Production vs. Production Capacity ==
Production is referred to as a useful product (either tangible or intangible) that is being produced.  Production Capacity is the process or method in which that product is being produced.  The product is usually a result that is either produced continually or on a regular basis thereby introducing the necessity of keeping P (Production) and PC (Production Capacity) in balance.  True effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced and the producing asset or capacity to produce.

== Financial, economic, and human wealth ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Space and time are two elements that reflect one another. It is important to understand how the two work in terms of visual rhetoric. Space as an element in visual rhetoric is often derived from narrative framing devices. Such a narrative is one that employs the evolution of time. For example, comics are a narrative through the evolution of time, but it is also being told spatially in the positioning of linear boxes and positioning of the subjects within the boxes.

== Static vs. Dynamic Visuals ==
In a static two-dimensional image, time exists only within the mind of the reader. In comic books, photo albums, images, and similar mediums, readers create an order within the content of the image, creating not only a coherent narrative, but also a sense of the passage of time. This task is performed with a large reliance upon shared cultural assumptions about how a page is read, be it left to right or down to up and so on. For purposes of visual rhetoric, the term time comes to mean an indefinite and continuous duration in which events succeed one another. Time can exist in all types of visual images.

=== Photo Albums ===
Compiling photo albums is an example of how visual rhetoric is a narrative through space. The layout and design of images on each page helps convey the intended feeling of how a person felt at one particular time and attributes to how the overall story is perceived. How well or how poorly completed the layout and design are can shape the impact of the message. 

To further elaborate, photo albums are a preservation of an event or time in place. Memories are made in the brain of the individual being and photo albums are a way to utilize space in a capacity separate from the self. It is important to note that with this visual narrative form of communication, the interpretation of certain events in time vary from viewer to viewer. The events that occurred in the images will naturally evoke a different feeling for the subject than it will for the viewer looking in from the outside. The individual viewer’s feelings are based on his or her own experiences through the times in their lives and the places they have been. These places are spaces where events have occurred, which evidently shows that time and space do indeed reflect one another.

=== Film &amp; Video ===
[[File:Film_Reel_Series_by_Bubbels.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|A film reel.]]
Static images are not the only forms of visual rhetoric that utilize time and space. Time within dynamic visuals like film and video in motion-based mediums, is controlled less by the viewer. Time passes before the viewer with the only thinking taking place when scenes change and they must make a connection between their times and places. The viewer doesn't assemble the narrative, but only observes it. A moment on the motion picture screen is only a moment, while a moment on a page is, to the audience viewing it, eternal. While one may read beyond one section of an image, the previous one is still there and still visible. A viewer sees what they choose to see, not only what they are meant to see. Thus, it is possible to view multiple moments at once, from multiple perspectives, and yet still assemble them into a coherent whole. This is an aspect of the viewing of images that works at a level far beyond day-to-day human perception, which is always from a single perspective.

=== Theatrical Productions ===
Like film and video, plays and other theatrical productions are narrative stories told in a space bound by a stage surface. Plays are distinguished from motion pictures through time and space. Plays are a live event happening right in front of the viewer in real-time. Motion pictures are like photo albums in that it is more two-dimensional than three-dimensional. In many cases, theatrical performances transform the audience from the present day into another era. The mentality of the audience is not only affected by the time period of the play, but also by the placement of the actors and as well as the distance between the viewer and the stage. The space between the viewer and the story being told separates reality from fiction, or in some plays, non-fiction.

== Linear vs. Nonlinear Visuals ==
As well as seeing a single perspective, humans also usually view reality in a strictly linear fashion, moment to moment. Viewers will usually assemble an image into a linear narrative, but they can also do it non-linearly if they wish to. Some visuals lend themselves to non-linear readings, as they have no coherent order outside from the overall view they present, while others will only make sense in a straightforward order. The viewer does more work when reading non-linearly, as it is a different way of experiencing reality than we are accustomed to. Of course, the brain is thought to work in a largely non-linear manner, but our senses do not.

=== Comics ===
This idea of viewing reality in a linear fashion can be depicted in comic strips. Comics flow in a linear fashion telling a story through images and text. Many people do not realize that by reading and viewing comic strips they become a part of visual rhetoric. Each comic is compiled of individual boxes displaying images and when put together they go through time to get to an ending, or tell the story. Although they, unlike film and video, are still images, the idea of time is still depicted.

Some aspects of this reading are more intuitive, as the eye will naturally spend more time on a larger image or better focused object. If something is read first, it is read as first in the series of events assembled by the reader. Also, larger segments of the image seem to last longer as they take longer to read. Thus, when it comes to the reading of static images, space becomes equal to time.

== Conclusion ==
We can now see how elements from a variety of mediums can alter the viewers' perceptions by utilizing time and space. Static and dynamic visuals differ in how a viewer absorbs the content. The message that comes from dynamic visuals is fed to the audience more passively than static visuals. In order to understand static visuals, individuals need to be more active in analyzing its spatial components. While humans experience time linearly, media can show subjects to us in a non-linear fashion, silently altering perceptual time and space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Formatting ==
The current formatting makes the introduction 80% wide, leaving a very narrow strip for the TOC; (at the common width of 800 pixels or so) the TOC is hard to read, and the introduction is full of empty space.  I'm going to narrow the introduction somewhat, but it'll look differently broken on various browsers. --[[User:132.206.150.195|132.206.150.195]] 20:40, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I was hoping to add some more text and possibly relevant pictures to the introduction, I just have not gotten to it yet, nor apparently has anyone else. I do however think that the narrowing of the intro box did some good. I'm open to other options too. I like the intro (or at least the idea of an intro) on the main page, and the table of contents is long, but I think it is necessary. If there are any style/formatting experts out there your input would be greatly appreciated. Right now I seem to be the only one doing any major work on this book, which is fine by me for now, but this also means every one has to deal with my god-awful formatting and design style. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 03:49, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)

&lt;!-- according to Google, &quot;cookie sheet&quot; is over 38 times as popular as baking tray --&gt;
[[Image:Oven Tray.jpg|thumb|right|cookie sheet]]

A '''cookie sheet''', sometimes called an '''oven tray''' or '''baking sheet''', is used to hold uncooked food items (typically [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] or [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]) while [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] within an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]. If it has sides, they are very low, to allow fast removal of cookies to a cooling rack. Unlike a typical [[Cookbook:Pizza Pan|pizza pan]], an oven tray is rectangular and usually does not have any holes.

Baking sheets are available in non-stick materials, but these tend to overbrown cookies on the bottom before thoroughly cooking them.  To avoid this, professional bakers use more evenly conductive materials, such as heavy-gauge stainless steel, covered with a sheet of [[Wikipedia:Parchment Paper|parchment paper]] or a silicone baking mat to provide a non-stick effect without altering the sheet's effectiveness.

Many consumer alternatives, such as insulated aerobake sheets, are also available, which will cook more slowly but with similar effectiveness.

A baking sheet should be accompanied by a [[Cookbook:cooling rack|cooling rack]] of similar size which the baked goods can be quickly removed to when they are done cooking.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Expand}}
'''Ajax''' or &quot;Asynchronous JavaScript and XML&quot; is a phrase that was coined in 2005 by Jesse James Garret of [http://www.adaptivepath.com Adaptive Path] in his [http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php introductory article] on the subject.  (For a complete definition of the item, please see the Wikipedia [[w:Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] entry.)

The purpose of this guide is to show how to [http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/chapter1.html unobtrusively] add Ajax into your web application in such a way that your site will continue to function even when [[JavaScript]] is not enabled.  Through intelligently hooking JavaScript triggers to certain elements in your markup, you can successfully add a new layer of interactivity to your site without sacrificing backwards compatibility with browsers which do not support Ajax. In this way, you can enhance your site without cutting off users that choose to not enable JavaScript because of their security concerns (warranted or not) or due to [http://www.quirksmode.org browser quirks]. 

There are several web sites already dedicated to promoting (or denouncing) the use of Ajax.  Therefore, wherever possible, an attempt will be made to list these resources without bias.  Although I fully invite anyone to add to this document, because of intellectual property and copyright reasons, it's just impractical to get the consent of everyone to include their content.  Besides, these sites often showcase the very concept that they are attempting to describe.

When a concept is relative to Ajax it should be described here, but the definitive work should be relegated to other Wikibooks or websites where that concept has already been (or should be) fleshed out.  

In light of this, there are several concepts with which you should become familiar if you want to work with Ajax.  Although, not all of them are expressly required to cut and paste in some sample code, for '''hacking''' out your own code, the following are recommended.

*JavaScript 
**[[JavaScript|Wikibook:JavaScript]] , especially [[JavaScript/XMLHttpRequest]]
**[[Wikipedia:JavaScript]]
*XHTML
**[[Wikipedia:XHTML]]
*XML 
**[[XML|Wikibooks:XML]]
**[[Wikipedia:XML]]
*Document Object Model 
**[[Wikipedia:Document Object Model]]
*Cascading Style Sheets 
**[[CSS Programming|Wikibooks:CSS Programming]]
**[[Wikipedia:Cascading Style Sheets]]
*XSLT

To make programming in Ajax easier, web developers may make use of a JavaScript [http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/javascript/ajax.html library for Ajax]. These JavaScript libraries allow the common problems of browser support for certain required objects to be abstracted, and mean that the developer can get on with the task of writing their application.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I must admit that this book is for fairly selfish reasons.  I've very excited about AJAX, however, roaming the Web and Googling for articles and samples is tedious.  Lots of people have made lists of examples, and there are several how-to's and discussions out there, but many of those are all singular efforts and it makes sense to have someplace that a guide can be written via a colaborative effort.  

Even though I've been working on Web Sites for 8 years now, there are tons and tons of things I don't know.  And the nice thing about these Wiki's is that several minds can come together and make a living book explaining the concepts and fleshing out ideas that can stay fresh with the times.

Well, I would like to spend more time on this right now, but my wife is having contractions :)

==AJAX or Ajax?==
Would you have any major objections to moving the page to [[Programming:Ajax]]?  I have a request for a page move over at [[Wikipedia:Talk:AJAX|Wikipedia]]; in both cases, the original author coined the term using the &quot;Ajax&quot; capitalization, not the &quot;AJAX&quot; one.  It just seems right to respect that use, but of course, I could be wrong! [[User:Delfuego|Jason]] 16:27, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

: Before deciding on a new name, it might be worth reading [[WB:NP]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:33, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:: OK, I don't understand -- the policy doesn't have anything to say about this particular page move question.  The page's name (both the original and the suggested rename) respects the Wikibooks way of naming pages; I'm merely suggesting that we rename the technology-specific portion of the page title to respect the original name of the technology, and not perpetuate the all-caps mistake that's made its way here.  If I'm missing something, please let me know! [[User:Delfuego|Jason]] 23:40, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Sorry. That was a bit terse. What I was implying is that this page still follows the old &quot;bookshelf convention&quot; where the &quot;Programming&quot; part implies it's on the programming bookshelf. The new convention is that a colon (or a slash) should only delimit subpages in a book, not books in a bookshelf. Just rename it to [[Programming Ajax]] or [[Ajax Programming]] instead. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:::: Gotcha -- I get it now. :)  Sorry for the dense moment. [[User:Delfuego|Jason]] 01:33, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

==major criticism==
As I see it:
#The discussion of the Quenya mode does not belong here, since we don't know anything about explicitly second age Quenya writing.
#The mode of Beleriand belongs here, since the mode of Beleriand we know dates from the Second Age only in spite of its name.
#A discussion of the Númenorean mode fragments of DTS 50 belongs here along with the question whether it may be the origin of the attested 'general use'.
#In a related issue, a discussion of Sauron's tengwar use belongs here.
[[User:J. 'mach' wust|J. 'mach' wust]] 23:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:#The NCP mentions a Numenorean Quenya mode where the use of unutixi is demonstrated, when the a-tehta is not used. In order to discuss this mode here, I thought nice to present it in a theoretical table of the intermediate values. Appendix E for example says that Aze became Are and then Esse, but doesn't say about the (brief) period when the letter was Are, before becoming Esse. We also should show the period when Noldo was not ng- or n-, but ñ-. It's also a good place to show that ndy &gt; ny and that maybe these changes were the cause that Tyelpetema began to be not useful. Do you think it should go to the First Age?
:#I disagree. Since the Mode of Beleriand originates from the First Age, I think it proper to go there, despite the fact it might wrongly describe Second Age elements. Since we don't have First Age samples, the gap must be filled with the 'Moria mode'
:#I agree. As for the Numenorean mode, I think you are more qualified, so you can proceed if it's not much trouble.

::#We can't just fill in the gap of the Second Age with all the stuff we don't know where to put. We don't know when these developments took place. And with respect to the a-tehta being left away, this was not only done by the Númenoreans.
::#We don't know anything at all about First Age mode of Beleriand. We'd lie if we'd pretend we did. [[User:J. 'mach' wust|J. 'mach' wust]] 18:27, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Biscuits''' are a type of quickbread sometimes served with [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]] or [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]], especially for an informal or casual meal. Sometimes biscuits are served with [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]]. Often biscuits are served with [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]]. Eaters typically apply [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] to their biscuits. For breakfast, an eater might add a [[Cookbook:Fried Eggs|fried egg]], fried [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] or [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]. 

Biscuits come in two forms, cut and dropped. Cut biscuits use a fairly normal dough that is [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolled]] out and cut with a circular [[Cookbook:Cookie Cutter|cookie cutter]]. Drop biscuits use a somewhat more liquid dough that is dropped onto a [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] with a spoon.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] (2 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/3 c (80 mL) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
*1 c (240 mL) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] for drop biscuits, or 3/4 c (180 mL) milk for cut biscuits

==Procedure==
#Mix the dry ingredients.
#Cut (mix) in the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], preferably as you would for an [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|apple crisp]] or traditional pie crust.
#Add the milk, mixing only as needed to wet the dough or batter.
#If doing drop biscuits, you'll plop the batter by spoonfuls (large spoonfuls) onto the cookie sheet. Otherwise, for cut biscuits:
##Give the dough a quick [[Cookbook:Knead|knead]].
##Roll the dough out to 1/2[[Cookbook:Inch|&quot;]], using flour as needed to avoid sticking.
##Cut circles with a 2.5&quot; cookie cutter, or carve hexagons (a honeycomb pattern) with a knife.
#Space the biscuits 1&quot; apart on the cookie sheet.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] 10 to 12 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Oven_Temperatures|450°F]] [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], stopping when lightly browned on top.
#Serve hot.

'''Tongs''' are used to easily grasp and transfer food.

Cooking and serving tongs consist of shaped &quot;jaws&quot; attached to a pair of long handles equipped with a spring to open or 'release' them.  The 'scissor' style with looped handles and smaller loops on the 'food' end is also popular.

The jaws or ends can have many shapes, ranging from a simple open loop on a bent-rod utensil shown here to gently scalloped and enclosed to grasp food without tearing or breaking the crust.  A good pair will be easy to hold and have very little 'flex' when grasping things like chicken breasts or 6-8 ounce (170-130 g) steaks.  Cheaper tongs will have very little 'hold' on anything of substance and are likely to create more problems than they solve.  Avoid buying anything that cannot easily pick up and manipulate another copy of itself in the store.  

They are commonly made from pressed steel sheet metal, steel rods or plastic. They offer mild protection from hot food mainly from the distance they provide from the cooking and can help a lot in preparing and serving a meal.

Tongs intended for handling food that is heavy or very hot can be made of steel rods, with a rubber-coated scissors-like handle for better control. Stronger versions of the pressed-steel tongs have proven very useful and adept in handling heavier and more cumbersome foods.</text>

[[Image:Sieve.jpg|thumb|right|A sieve]]

A '''sieve''' (also known as a '''strainer''') is a kitchen utensil used to separate liquids or fine dry foods (like flour) from larger particles. It can also be used to break up lumps in dry ingredients (like cocoa powder) or to purée cooked foods by passing them through the sieve. Modern sieves are usually made from fine stainless steel mesh that has been pressed into a hemispherical shape, and then embedded in a plastic or steel carrier with a handle.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
===The Board and Pieces===

The board is the shape of a six point star, with holes for possible moves of the pieces, typically marbles or pegs.  The center of the board forms a hexagon with five holes along each side. Each point forms a triangle with ten (10) holes in four rows;  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.  The points are typically different colors, corresponding to the colors of the pieces.

=== The Object===
The object of the game is to be the first to get all of your pieces from the point in front of you across the board, and completely into the point on the opposite side.

===Starting===
2, 3, 4, or 6 players can play a game. Each player chooses the color of his or her pieces and fills one of the points of the star with his or her pieces as follows:
Two (2) players begin at the opposite ends of the star, across from each other.
Three (3) players set up occupying every other point.
Four (4) players set up with two on one side, across from the other two players.

Players typically agree on the method to determine who plays first, and second.  (The roll of a die, coin tosses, youngest, etc.)  Play usually follows a clockwise or counter-clockwise order. 
 
===Play===
On a player's turn they must move only one piece.  The move may consist of moving one piece into the adjacent empty hole, the piece may jump over one adjacent piece into a empty hole, or can make two or more multiple jumps.  The player can jump over their own pieces, or over the pieces of any of the other players. Each jump in a string of multiple jumps must jump only one adjacent piece landing in an empty hole.  A piece cannot jump over two or more pieces in a line, but a piece can jump zig-zag over two or more pieces. 

Except for the holes along the edges, all (other) holes have six holes around them, corresponding to the direction of the next move or jump.

[[Image:Chinese checkers inicio.png|thumb|Green shows the two most common opening moves in Chinese Checkers; Red shows the next two more common moves.]]
===Opening Moves===
Knowledge of openings is very important to playing Chinese Checkers well -- similar to chess. In play among experienced players there are only a few openings that are commonly seen. Although there are 14 possible first moves (7 if you eliminate symmetrical moves for the first player), experienced players play only two. 


By far the most common first move is to move one of the two marbles on either end of front row of the four forward marbles one space forward and towards the center (as illustrated by green in the picture). This is the first move of the two most common openings the &quot;sidewinder&quot; and &quot;cross caterpillar&quot;, there are many other less common openings.

A much less common first move sometimes played by advanced players is to move one of the marbles in the front row one space forward and away from the centerline (the red marbles in the picture nearby show these moves). This first move leads into &quot;Squad's opening&quot; and other similar openings.

== General hints ==
===Get as far as possible===
One of the most basic strategies of the game is, of course, to get as far as possible. However, during play, it is not always the best move to go to the very end of a jump; sometimes you have to block your opponent. Although they may not like this, it is a real advantage to block them. Of course if you imagine a computer player, they will do this automatically if they think one extra move ahead!

===Keep moves near a center line===
If you split up your pieces at the wrong moment you'll find that you will be left with a lonesome piece that will take you a lot of wasted moves to get to the end. Also, there are always more pieces in the center line than near the edges. So keeping your pieces near the center line is an important advantage as you can always move your pieces.

===Get into the goal area===
If you have your pieces inside the goal area, it is also easier to feed following pieces in. The two outer edges seem to be more of an advantage. Often you may shuffle the pieces inside the goal to get more in, but don't overdo it; you have to get the external pieces in the shortest number of moves.

===The piece furthest away from goal===
This is a major help in play. You should always check your last piece because it can quite rapidly become stranded and you will lose the game. Basically, before making a move always check if you can get the last piece up.

Good luck.

:Why I didn't: because of poor name choice, I though we didn't have a biscuit recipe

:Why we shouldn't: the brownie page is a mess; it should be 1 intro page pointing to 3 recipe pages

:[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:42, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Reasonable enough but more action is required then if I understand.  If the brownie page should be 1 intro page pointing to 3 recipe pages shouldn't the biscuit mess have the same solution?  Do you think we should run this idea through the [[Talk:Cookbook]] page first or just start doing things?[[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 01:47, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::Given that this is just two pages, linking both directions is also reasonable. That was done for Omelet/Omelette, but would not be reasonable for Brownie. The awkward thing about the Brownie page is that history should be preserved to meet the GNU Free Documentation License requirements. It is kind of standard (though yucky) to just copy the history to the new talk page. The biscuit recipes are different enough that they should both stay I think; the usage of egg is major and the new version has a drop-biscuit variation. Maybe &quot;Egg Biscuit&quot; and &quot;Plain Biscuit&quot;? (ick) Oh, the brownie page could use a bit of really simple image manipulation (cropping). If you are the one to do this, please use jpegtran to do it losslessly -- there is a Tk interface if you wish to use a mouse and see what you are doing. BTW, I'm planning to split up the Pizza recipe so that &quot;Pizza&quot; lists the different types of crust and sauce. It's the same problem. So, do you think the biscuit problem merits an intro page or just bidirectional links? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:43, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::Well, I'm probably too lazy to do anything right now so I vote with innaction.  I know, I suck, but it's the truth. :-(  [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 04:53, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
::::Speaking as a newcomer... it seems like having bidirectional links should work, provided not too many more recipes show up. Personally, I have a variation on &quot;Biscuit&quot;, but it's not different enough to warrant a whole new page (half whole wheat, veg. oil for the fat) - there could just be a &quot;variations&quot; section. However, having &quot;Biscuit&quot; and &quot;Biscuits&quot; is confusing, since the difference (from the titles) is totally unclear. &quot;Biscuits (simple)&quot; and &quot;Biscuits&quot;, maybe, since &quot;Biscuit&quot; is fewer ingredients? [[User:Naib|Naib]] 04:33, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

This page and the &quot;Biscuits&quot; page need to be combined. --Anon</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basics of Semiotics ==

'''Signs''' 

A general definition of semiotics is the study of signs and sign systems. The basic unit of meaning is the 'sign': anything which can represent a thing or an idea.  Human beings create meanings for the things they perceive by incorporating ideas into their interpretations of objects which can be triggered by visual cues.  The word sign itself can have multiple meanings. A sign can be anything from a literal sign such as a stop/yield road sign, to knowing that the word 'dog' is representative of an animal with four legs and a tail.

There are three basic kinds of signs: icons, indexes and symbols.  An icon is a sign that resembles its object.  

An Index is a sign that is physically connected to its object.  

A Symbol is an arbitrary representation of an object.    

'''Analogy: How a Sign 'works''''

As part of an introduction to semiotics, it may be helpful to discuss analogy: the relationship between established meaning (experience) and new stimuli through symbols (verbal or visual). Douglas R. Hofstadter, a noted author, cognitive scientist from Indiana University delivered a speech on the subject to an audience at Stanford University as part of the Standford Presidential Lecture series. [[http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/analogy.html]]
Hofstadter starts by explaining how, throughout our lives, we build our &quot;mental lexicon&quot; through what he calls chunking: (par. 18) &quot;taking 'small' concepts and putting them together into bigger and bigger ones, thus recursively building up a giant repertoire of concepts in the mind.&quot; (par. 7) 
To demonstrate first how lexicon building influences our ability to understand symbols and signs through analogy, I'll share a personal story: I have a friend who has a little girl who is just learning to speak. The other day we were on a walk in a local park together enjoying the first signs of spring. During this walk, her daughter started to fuss and I asked her mom what might be the matter. Her mom said that she wanted an &quot;s-n-a-c-k&quot;. This was a real-life demonstration of how a lexicon (in this case, of language) is gradually built. Her daughter knew the word 'snack', when vocalized, so she couldn't say it because she was out of snacks and hearing the word would make her fuss more. To communicate that to me, she spelled it; a function that her daughter had not yet developed because her lexicon was based in sounds, not strings of letters to make the word associated with that sound. Subtle examples of analogy are found in words and images we see and hear every day. Dr. Hofstadter illustrates this as a progressive process starting with single words, then compound words, then phrases, etc. (par. 19) Through what Hofstadter refers to chunking, and also, pattern matching, isomorphism and other functions associated with analogy, we achieve increasingly complex meaning with increasing abstraction from the root of that meaning. Understanding that we interpret 'signs' based on our earliest experiences—even rudimentary shapes, colors, and concepts—helps us know how to approach semiotics in a practical way.

'''Semiotic Theory '''

Semiotic theory explains the process by which meaning is found through perception and interpretation of signs.  The semiotic triangle shows a good representation of how exactly one begins to perceive signs and process the rhetoric.

[[Image:Semiotic.triangle.gif]]

This model explains the way we process a perception of something that exists in the physical world, the concept or idea that object is said to refer to, and a thought or image that is representative in the mind.

'''Semiology and its Relationship to Verbal Text'''

Within semiotics there is a debate between the amount to which the meaning of visual images can be shared and understood in themselves, or if their meaning is instead based on some prior verbal knowledge. In Roland Barthes essay Rhetoric of the Image, he argues that images, and their symbolic meanings, are always contingent upon verbal text. Barthes claims that in order to reach the shared meaning, verbal text must enforce the visual with evidence. While Barthes says that the image or the text can come first, without the text, the visual alone is too ambiguous. 

Kress and van Leeuwen oppose Barthes opinion of semiotics in their book Reading Images. They do not believe that text is unimportant but simply that visual images can accomplish the same message and meaning that text can, but perhaps in a different way.

'''Uncoded Naturalistic Representations v. Stylized Conceptual Images'''

The way that an image is either simplified or generalized can make that image more applicable to standard ideas and culturally shared notions.  A graphic picture of a house which is made standard, rather than a detailed photograph, becomes  more of an analogy of our understanding of a house rather than a specific house.  On the other hand a photograph or a fairly detailed painting is easily interpreted as a representation of something from reality and therefore this is a message without a code.  Images are depicted in specific ways, and with accompanying codes, in order to draw out certain meaning.  If an advertising campaign wants to reach the most people they may try and use a coded picture of a child, making it very standardized and lacking detail, perhaps even in black and white.  This makes the object more of a sign and a representation of a child than having the object seem like a particular person whom they don't actually know and won't be able to relate to as well.

''' Semiotic Modes '''

Semiotic modes vary by the qualities of the medium and backgrounds of each specific type of visual object.

== Social Semiotics ==


Social Semiotics is defined by Kress and van Leeuwen as 'the use of signs, symbols, and icons whose meanings are socially agreed upon and culturally-bound.' Understanding the way semiotics operates starts with understanding the nature in which visual communication is coded. It is coded by the way that we establish social and cultural codes manifested within images. We do not realize how explicitly coded visual images are because they become so ingrained in our understanding and behaviors as easily as walking, talking, waving hello, or driving on the correct side of the road. These are all things that we learn through a constant process of socialization just as we learn what visual images mean. 

Cultural visual rhetoric relies heavily on signs because of how important signs are to every individual. Culture has a great impact on one's use and interpretation of signs. All societies in their nature use signs symbols and other shared ideas and objects in order to create and establish community through commonalties. Visual signs are just another way that societies come to develop and follow a shared culture. 

Signs are intentional and motivated, but their motivations are not universal. Culture has a huge impact on these motivations, and every culture has differences in this regard. Simply put, a visual must be interpreted either by someone from the same culture as the person who created it or by someone who understands the rules and systems that typify that person’s culture. Taken out of a cultural context images and signs can mean very different things. 

Although semiotics and signs can be analyzed and unified by culturally accepted signs, the mediums and manifestations, the type of visual rhetoric be it narrative or conceptual, will all determine the individual interpretations. A picture of a tree will be seen as a tree to each person usually, but it may signify many different things. For one person they may see the tree as clean air, or to someone else history, or to someone else family origins. 

[[Image:Silhouette_of_a_Tree.svg]]

== Semiotics Landscapes ==

As noted earlier in the chapter, semiotics, in its most basic definition, is the study of signs and symbols. The word sign itself has ambiguous meanings depending on what is being analyzed. However we shall use this example again in order to understand how broad of a spectrum interpretation of both images and language is on any level of communication. It is important to understand that every individual has his or her own social history (mental lexicon) and own way (analogy pathways) of interpreting images. In many cases, interpretations of an image or sign may be similar or identical from one person to another; however, it cannot be assumed that this will be the case for every image and every person regardless of culture, history and time. 

Verbal and visual rhetoric are often intertwined when it comes to their interpretation, often-verbal rhetoric triggers some sort of visual depiction in our minds and imagination. The images that we recall when stimulated by various words various from person to person just as an image may inspire different thoughts and ideas. 


'''A Hearty Example'''

When one hears, the word ‘heart’ one is able to correlate images with possible definitions, or interpret and encode the sound to have a particular meaning. The sound for ‘heart’ [hahrt], could potentially mean, the innermost or central part of anything or the center of the total personality, especially with reference to intuition, feeling, or emotion; or in its anatomical form, a hollow, pump-like organ of blood circulation, composed mainly of rhythmically contractile smooth muscle, located in the chest between the lungs and slightly to the left and consisting of four chambers. On the other hand, perhaps hearing the sound for 'heart', you misinterpret it for the word ‘hart’, which could mean a male deer, especially an adult male red deer. Homonyms like these present a particular challenge when hearing alone without the added stability of context, or the additional clarity of their written form. All of these meanings for the verbalized sound, pronounced 'heart' are related and attached through analogy and all have a common source of high abstraction and low complexity. The simplest and most dominant analogy pathway (the path of least resistance) is the first one utilized unless further clarification dictates otherwise. We may start by visualizing a valentine's card or open-heart surgery but end up realizing, through context, that the topic is actually 'hart', an adult male red deer. 

'''Semiotic Landscape: A Defintion'''

A Semiotic Landscape is defined by Kress and Van Leeuwen as the construction of signs and symbols in a way that forms an understanding of meanings within and across cultures.  Any landscape is made up of human and social interaction and production but also the effect of the land itself.  A visual object is made up of its materials and corresponding signs as well as the context of the culture and its unique place among that culture.  

'''Landscaping in Different Cultures'''

There are many cases where visual images can mean many different things depending on the context. The rainbow for example, even within one society, means many different things. The rainbow originates from science and depicts the range of the light spectrum. In nature, the rainbow is simply colors, which exist in light. 

The rainbow came to mean luck and happiness. Seeing a rainbow in the sky holds a particular meaning. The medium of nature makes a rainbow a beautiful and often considered a lucky sighting. Rainbows are seen in many different places representing these things in themselves but taken out of its natural context rainbows have also come to symbolize that a person is or supports the homosexual lifestyle. All of these meanings are true and legitimate within the American culture. Depending on the context, that the rainbow is viewed among people will be able to take away the intended meaning. 

As mentioned previously, interpretations are dependent on the social and cultural background of the individual. Words, images and gestures can hold different meanings for whoever the interpreter is. Similar to the rainbow example, non-verbal communication, including hand gestures and facial expressions, differs accordingly in various cultures. The reason for this is that every cultural group is different; both in the way they assign meaning to 'things' and, in some cases, the meaning that is assigned. It follows then, that the mental lexicon and analogy pathway of a child raised in Europe will differ from that of a child raised in Indochina. The result of this is evident in innumerable ways of experiencing, interpreting, internalizing, and then reacting to the world around them.

==Conclusion==

Visual communication and visual images have many similarities and differences in relation to verbal. In essence verbal communication is based off of visual symbols but the way that these two modes have been defined and thought in our society have caused them to appear stratified. In order to see the connections between the modes we must bring ourselves back to the idea of shared meanings and how we interpret all information that we are presented with. Semiotics, like texts, is based on our prior knowledge of an object or idea, combined with the context it is being presented and ending in a specific meaning or sets of meanings. Semiotics operates on a daily basis and in almost every moment of our lives. Semiotics as we have said before is recognizing simply cues and incorporating them into our lives. In order to understand the way that visual images can be understood similar to verbal images, it is important to start from the building blocks and remember that visual images too have been learned and established over time. 

In essence, any physical sign can constitute visual rhetoric. According to one of the Definitions of Visual Rhetoric, “…using images to convince people instead of using words” is a staple of visual rhetoric. Employing this definition with the definition of a sign, the definition of a sign can be readjusted to say that a sign is actually simply a tool of visual rhetoricians. Therefore, if semiotics is the study of signs, then semiotics is really a study of the building blocks of visual rhetoric. In other words, semiotics is immeasurably important to the study of visual rhetoric.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In their text ''Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design'', Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen propose that all images can be divided into two classifications, narrative and conceptual. These classifications separate images into two categories: those images that have a component of action and those that possess a static, timeless essence. The following chapter defines narrative and conceptual representations within the discussion of [[../Definitions_of_Visual_Rhetoric|Visual Rhetoric]] and provides examples of each.

== Narrative Representations ==
The first type of classification is the narrative representation. While conceptual representations &quot;represent participants in terms of their. . . stable or timeless essence,&quot; narrative representations &quot;present unfolding actions and events, processes of change, and transitory spacial arrangements&quot; (59). That is, while conceptual representations show stable concepts, narrative representations show participants that are connected to one another through lines called vectors. In order for an image to be classified as a narrative representation, then, the participants in the image must be connected with a vector. According to Kress and Leeuwen, “When participants are connected by a vector, they are represented as doing something to or for each other. From here on we will call such vectorial patterns narrative”(56). [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Rhetoric/Rhetorical_Vectors Vectors] represent courses or directions, and because the participants are connected by these invisible lines, the viewer understands the participants to be interacting with one another. This idea of Rhetorical Vectors relationships is the most important concept in separating narrative from conceptual representations. While narrative representations always have a vector between participants, conceptual representations never have these vectors. Despite the name, narrative representations are not always “telling” a story. Rather, the important idea is that the objects in the image are acting on and interacting with one another. 

When an object in the image is viewed as being the active participant in the image, it is called the actor. In order to be an actor, the object must be either creating or interacting with a vector to convey a sense of action. The participant that the actor is interacting with, usually passive in the action process, is known as the Goal. The Goal is that object that the actor's vectors connect with to form some sort of action or interaction. While all narrative representations show some form of action, there are different types of narrative processes to consider.

===Narrative Processes===

As previously stated, the &quot;hallmark of a narrative visual 'proposition' is the presence of a vector&quot; (59). According to Kress and Leeuwen, vectors are &quot;formed by depicted elements that form an oblique line, often a quite strong, diagonal line&quot; (59). These vectors may be formed from a number of objects, from bodies to limbs to tools. There are usually two partipants in a narrative representation. The &quot;Actor&quot; is &quot;the participant from whom or which the vector departs&quot; (59). That is, the &quot;actor&quot; is th object in the image that produces the action on the other object in the image. The passive participant in the action process is called the &quot;goal.&quot; The &quot;goal&quot; is &quot;the participant at which the vector is directed&quot; (74). Kress and Leeuwen distinguish different narrative processes by the types of vectors and the number and kinds of participants involved.

*'''Action Processes''' are those in which &quot;the Actor is the participant from which the vector emanates...or forms the vector&quot; (63). That is, in order to be considered an Action Process, the Actor must either have a vector coming out of it or actually form the vector. According to Kress and Leeuwen, when an image has only one participant, that participant can be considered the Actor. This is called a non-transactional image--there is no Goal in these images and vectors are not &quot;done to or aimed at anyone or anything&quot; (63). If there is only a vector and a Goal shown in the image, than Kress and Leeuwen call the action an Event. Lastly, when there are both an Actor and a Goal that are connected by a vector which stems from the Actor, then this process is called Transactional.

*'''Reactional Processes''' are those in which an eyeline, such as a glance, by one or more of the participants, forms a vector that connects those participants. This process differs from the Action Process in that the vectors are formed solely by the gaze of on of the objects in the image. In this case only, the participant who does the looking is called a Reactor instead of an Actor, and the passive participant is called the Phenomena, not the Goal (67). The Reactor is the participant who forms the vector with his eyes; he does the looking. Reactional Processes can be transactional and nontransactional as well (68).

===A Celestial Example===

The following examples showcase the difference between narrative and conceptual representations. The image found on the left is a photograph taken of the silhouettes of men and women gazing up into the night sky. Between these men and women is a telescope, also pointed towards the very heavens to which the people look. Vectors are formed out of the upward gazes of the men and women. Another vector is formed by the telescope itself, which points diagonally towards the sky. Because of the vectors, the picture on the left exhibits a narrative representation. [[Image:Astronomy_Amateur_3_V2.jpg|thumb|left|A Narrative Representation Shows Action Through Vectors]]

The picture on the right also shows a telescope. However, while the telescope on the left is in use, shown by its placement in the image and the vectors that it forms, the image of the telescope on the right is more of a timeless concept. The element in the image is shown &quot;symmetrically, against a neutral background&quot; (45). In short, the picture of the telescope on the right can be accurately considered a conceptual representation because there is no interaction between elements in the picture. Because of the lack of vectors to visually create action, this picture can only show the timeless concept of an astrological tool. Similarly, there is no actor present in this picture. [[Image:Astronomisches_Fernrohr_%28Moritz_Hensoldt%29.jpg|thumb|right|A Conceptual Representation Shows the Timeless Essence of an Object]]

On the left, the counter-image is a picture of a night scene in which a group of men and women  gather around a telescope while they gaze upwards towards the night sky. Unlike the conceptual representation on the right, this left-hand picture portrays an action that happens between the group of star-gazers, the telescope, and the night sky. Both pictures show the same kind of technology, but the picture on the right is vastly different than the picture on the left. Unlike the picture on the right that represents static technology, the picture on the left represents &quot;technology in action&quot; (46). The participants in the picture on the left (group of star-gazers, the telescope, and the night sky) are represented as active and interacting because of the vectors that connect them with other elements in the image. According to Kress and Leeuwen, while the right picture is &quot;static, this picture [on the left] is dynamic. Where the [right] picture is dry and conceptual, the [left] picture is dramatic&quot; (46).

== Conceptual Representations ==
The second type of representation brought up by Kress and Leeuwen is the conceptual representation. These differ from narrative representations in many ways. Not only do conceptual representations lack vectors that are a vital element of narrative representations, these images also have a component of timelessness and represent their participants in their generalized essence. They represent a static concept rather than engaging their participants in some kind of action. Conceptual representations have three distinct subcategories to further define the way visuals define their participants: Classificatory, Analytical and Symbolical. Each of these three types carries distinct assumptions about the way they represent the world.

===Classificational Processes===
Classificational processes often relate their participants together through a taxonomy. Taxonomies represent the world in terms of a hierarchical order. Its main concern is the ranking of ideas in terms of an overall generalization, whether it is their unifying origin or a higher power. They are grouped by a “kind of” relation (81). Classification processes attempt to present the participants in a way that is often without context and as objective as possible. This type of representation is striving for that timelessness mentioned above and often appears in advertising and textbooks. The three types of taxonomies that are found in conceptual representations are as follows:

* '''Covert Taxonomies''' portray a symmetrical equivalence between all of the elements in an image. Images are shown in an objective, decontextualized way to emphasize their timeless nature. 

* '''Single-Levelled Overt Taxonomies''' introduce the importance of &quot;superordinates&quot; and &quot;subordinates&quot; an an image. The superordinate and subordinate participants in an image show a higher degree of ordering than is present in a covert taxonomy, where all of the particpants are seen as equivalent. In single-levelled overt taxonomies, the participants are shown in a tree structure to indicate the hierarchal relationships. 

[[Image:Composition_of_bone.png|thumb|A Multi-Levelled Overt Taxonomy connects participants through a tree structure with more than two levels]]

* '''Multi-Levelled Overt Taxonomies''' are similar to the previous, except that a participant, &quot;Superordinate,&quot; is connected to other participants through a tree structure with more than two levels. Participants in middle levels are called &quot;Interordinates,&quot; and those at the bottom level are &quot;Subordinates.&quot;

===Analytical Process===
Moving away from the simple objectivity of the classificatory process, the analytical process sets up a part-whole relationship between its participants to strive to make them fit together. The parts are called attributes, and these attributes are part of the whole, which is termed the Carrier (89). Kress and van Leeuwen provide the examples of fashion shots, which display the parts of an &quot;outfit,&quot; and label both the Carrier (&quot;easy-wearing, inexpensive cottons&quot;) and the Possessive Attributes (Laura Ashley trenchcoat, Stuart Membery sweater.)

Another example: maps. In a map of the United States of America, the Carrier is the entire country, and the possessive attributes are the individual states, and both are labeled either inside the image or in a legend or caption. In the case of the fashion shot and the map, neither has a vector or carries a narrative process.

===Symbolic Process===
Symbolical processes move beyond classificational and analytical processes in that they do not try to find relationships between concrete objective images, but they seek to establish what the images mean. Symbolic processes take two forms, symbolic attributive and symbolic suggestive(108).

* '''Symbolic Attributive''' images are composed of two parts, the carrier and the symbolic attribute. The carrier in these instances is that which has its meaning given by the symbolic attribute and the relationship between them. 

* '''Symbolic Suggestive''' usually only have one participant, the Carrier, whose meaning is established in some other manner. These other ways of conveying meaning often establish the difference between an analytic process and a symbolic one. One example is that the colors in a symbolic suggestive image may be muted, blended or otherwise emphasized to create mood. That is to say, these images do not represent a specific moment in time, they are more concerned with create a timeless feeling, an essence of meaning.

== Conclusion ==
This chapter on narrative and conceptual representations merely scratches the surface of the work Kress and Leeuwen have done on this topic. For further information, interested readers should consult their work, ''Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design''. The idea behind this analysis is drawn from the way humans perceive, discuss, and study language (written or verbal), signs, and symbols (See: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Rhetoric/Semiotics_and_Visual_Rhetoric Semiotics and Visual Rhetoric].) Those ideas about language are then transferred and applied to the study of visuals, hence the name &quot;Grammar of Visual Design.&quot; Kress and van Leeuwen maintain that although their study of language is the backbone for finding meaning in images, the two mediums (language and images) are distinct from one another. While they find similarities between the two and attempt to create a &quot;grammar&quot; for images, they do not hold the idea that the two are one and the same, as other scholars may believe. The comparison of language and images creates a framework of discourse that allows scholars working from all perspectives to come together and find a common ground in the field of visual rhetoric.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Virtual Environments==


Many virtual environments are socially oriented. Communication in virtual environments allows for a safe environment to share ideas and cheap access to people worldwide. Virtual environments also allow foreign language learners to make native speaker friends from their homes. They can meet native speakers worldwide in a free space designed to promote discussion of a specific topic or simply socialization. 

By the same token, educators are excited by the possibilities that this new technology offers. They have a new way of encouraging students to write, and they can connect classes worldwide. Virtual Environments offer a new way of examining language and writing.

'''For EFL Learners'''


* [http://www.worlds.com/ Worlds Chat]: &quot;Through the creation of 3D Internet sites, Worlds Chat creates communities of users who form the basis for multi-user chat, e-commerce and advertising forums in a broad range of categories. Worlds 3D internet technology provides a contextual environment to online users, moving the current HTML print paradigm of the Internet, i.e., paging up and down, to a new level of spatial environments more akin to the real world. Within Worlds' immersive environments, online users can speak to each other through voice to voice telephony, standard web pages can be launched from within these 3D environments, supporting archived audio and video streams as well as live feeds. All these features offer a new value added layer to the current 2D internet experience&quot; (quoted from www.worlds.com). Furthermore, this virtual community offers some on-line classes about how to create rooms, and each room has a host to help new users. However, Worlds Chat has a weakness: poor quality audio chat.  



* [http://www.activeworlds.com/ Active Worlds]: &quot;Active Worlds, the web's most powerful virtual reality experience, lets learners visit and chat in incredible 3D worlds that are built by other users. Learners can also create fascinating 3D worlds that others can visit and chat in minutes. The Active Worlds Universe is a community of hundreds of thousands of users that chat and build 3D virtual reality environments in millions of square kilometers of virtual territory&quot; (quoted from www.activeworlds.com). 



* [http://www.thepalace.com/ The Palace]: The Palace is a vast online community of graphical interactive sites for Mac and Window users. &quot;With the Palace User Software, learners can visit a diverse range of communities such as business, training, and learning resources; entertainment and gaming centers; gathering points for special interest groups; and also personal sites where you simply can go to chat and socialize with friends and family. In addition, if learners download the Palace Server, they can even build and customize their own personal Palace site to host other people&quot; (quoted from www.thepalace.com). The weak points of this virtual community are 1) few avatars 2) environments just like pictures 3) no specific guidelines or guiders for new users 4) usually for children, so chat contains slang difficult for EFL learners.  



* [http://schmooze.hunter.cuny.edu/ schMOOze University]: schMOOze University is a small, friendly college. Learners studying English as a second or foreign language could practice English while sharing ideas and experiences with other learners and practicers of English. Students have opportunities for one-on-one and group conversations as well as access to language games such as Scrabble and Boggle, an on-line dictionary, a virtual library and a grammar maze. 



* [http://lingua.utdallas.edu/encore/ enCore] : enCore is &quot;an online virtual learning environment system built on LambdaMOO. It comes with a built in server-side client called Xpress. enCore was primarily designed for educational use, but can also be used for other purposes&quot; (quoted from lingua.utdallas.edu/encore). It is perfect for digital community building, online writing projects, online conferencing, distance education programs, or just about any educational endeavor that aims to incorporate a rich and versatile online presence. 



* [ftp://ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/ProgrammersManual_toc.html LambdaMOO]: LambdaMOO is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive system well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games, conferencing systems, and other collaborative software (quoted from ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/ProgrammersManual_toc.html). 



* [http://moo.du.org:8000/ Diversity University]: &quot;Diversity University MOO campuses are Internet locations for serious experimentation in network-based, interactive teaching, learning and social services&quot; (quoted from moo.du.org:8000/). 



* [http://oit.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/menu/home.ie.htm Planet Oit]: Planet Oit is a geology educational MOO created by the Geology Explorer Project at North Dakota State University.



* [http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~marinau/Zora/ Zora]: &quot;Zora is a 3D graphical multi-user environment to explore identity and values through storytelling and programming. Learners are graphically represented as an avatar and can navigate around the city. In Zora, learners can create their own spaces and can populate the city by creating objects and symbols as well as characters with stories and cherished values. They can program them with storytelling behaviors to engage in conversations with the visitors. At the same time, learners can communicate with each other in real-time&quot; (quoted from xenia.media.mit.edu/~marinau/Zora/).



* [http://www.wbs.net/forums/ WebChat Broadcasting System]: &quot;WBS has hundreds of online communities where its two million members gather to exchange ideas, get advice, and just chat&quot; (quoted from www.wbs.net/forums/). Learners can post individual community announcements; set up a free homepage; or participate in online events. The weakness of this communities is empty chat rooms despite active forums.



-------------------



'''For Virtual-environment-using Teachers and Colleagues'''
 

* [http://tappedin.org/tappedin/ Tapped in]: Tapped in is an on-line community mainly for teachers, development staff, university faculty, and researchers. It has various classes, clubs, and discussions via synchrouse chat, bulletin boards, and e-mail. Even though this community doesn't have any graphic functions, it has many strengths. First, because many members of this community are educators, chats are very valuable for deep conversation and starndard language. Second, the chat log emails the users automatically. Finally, a receptionist in the entrance helps new users.



* [http://teacherbridge.cs.vt.edu/public/TeacherBridge+Home TeacherBridge] : TeacherBridge is an innovative set of collaborative resources for educators. The system allows for very simple access and advanced interactive tools for teachers. Supported activities are &quot;1) Field work: several classes take part in monitoring local wildlife and water quality. Data can be collectively updated in TeacherBridge charts and table: 2) Online Discussion: set up chat workgroups for students to discuss any number of topics. Integrate chat windows with a text or problem to be discussed. These chat sessions can be secured and monitored by teachers: 3) Class management: easily publish assignments, activity guides, due dates, and the like: 4) Curriculum: share lesson plan ideas and collaborate on what works/what doesn't within various contexts: 5) Go Virtual: science fairs, gardens, journals, field trips, quizes/tests... 6) Online Portfolios: class projects, groups, or individual portfolios can be created and edited within TeacherBridge. 7) WebQuests-Classes/students can organize internet research with comments within TeacherBridge&quot; (quoted from teacherbridge.cs.vt.edu/public/).

'''let vs. where'''

You say that (and i quote):
The difference between &quot;let&quot; and &quot;where&quot; lies in the fact that &quot;let foo = 5 in foo + foo&quot; is an expression, but &quot;foo + foo where foo = 5&quot; is not. (Try it: an interpreter will gladly spit out the latter &quot;expression&quot;.)

However, in Hugs (windows Nov. 2003 build, Haskell98 mode), &quot; foo + foo where foo = 5 &quot; (without quotes) evaluates just as well as the let version. Perhaps I misunderstood what you were saying?

Hmmm.  GHCi rejects it.  It may be that Hugs has a different way of turning typed expressions into something evaluatable which lets this through.  I'll have to take out the &quot;try it in an interpreter&quot; bit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==


Writing is a sociocultural phenomenon that reflects a community's values. According to [http://llt.msu.edu/vol4num2/ Murray] (2000), writing is “not a set of skills, whose absence or presence in individuals or communities automatically leads to particular outcomes” (p. 44). In other words, writing is not a context-free, value-neutral set of skills but a set of social or cultural practices and its participants as a community of practice” (Reder, 1994, p. 33). 

[http://www.kolar.org/vygotsky/ Vygotsky] (1978) argues that all learning is inherently social in nature. In fact, Vygotsky's theory implies that writing arises out of and retains the functions of social uses of language. A particular discourse community is characterized by the particular conventions of creating and interacting with texts. Therefore, in order to acquire writing, one needs socialization or acculturation into the distinctive conventions of the particular discourse community. 

Obviously writing practices are not only social but also mental and individual: writing involves a lot more than inscribing words. It is a linguistic process that relies not only on knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, but also on knowledge of textual organization beyond the sentence level, knowledge of genres, and knowledge of conventions of spoken and written language. It is a cognitive process that involves creating links between our knowledge and textual forms and ongoing critical assessment of the quality of those links. It is a social practice, interwoven into larger social practices, that is developed through apprenticeship and shaped by its users to conform with social needs. In sum, writing is seen as a dynamic set of linguistic, social and cognitive processes that are culturally motivated (Kern, 2000).

Furthermore, writing is now situated within computer networks, and the most profound effects of computer technology on writing arise from social interaction made possible by computer networks. Social use of computer technology, especially virtual environments such as [[wikipedia:MOO | MOO]] and [[w:WOO|WOO]], present a new opportunity to enable EFL learners to interact with native speakers in a social community for developing EFL learners' writing ability. 

Seen in this context, virtual environments on computer networks and writing are closely related. Therefore, the basic premise underlying this study is that EFL writing education can be empowered by the potential of virtual environments on computer networks. I examine in more detail the question of how activities in virtual environments enhance EFL learners' writing acquisition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Question what are MTF charts?  I see the reference to them on this page but I have no idea what they are or why I might want to use them?  Does somebody here have the knowledge to fill this in or at least to provide a link to where I might learn more about them.  thx --[[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]] 21:04, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

It was difficult for me to comprehend this module because of its length.  Perhaps it could be split up?

----


I think we can do a lot of people a favor by cutting out the fatty portions of this document that pertain to user, computer, camera, operating system, editing system specific comments. These are supposed to be the basics right? 
(Steve: MTF charts are graphs of how well the lens channels light through itself based on the size of the aperture. The idea is that as the aperture gets smaller - the lens is using less of the glass; conversely, as the aperture gets bigger the lens is using more glass. If the lens uses too much or too little glass - aberrations appear in the transfered light. The range between &quot;too much&quot; and &quot;too little&quot; we can describe as the lens's &quot;sweet spot&quot;.) Again, MTF charts and references to advanced discussions should not be on this page. Steve, feel free to delete this once you've read it. --[[User:Lepercon|Lepercon]] 05:10, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== Working on &quot;how to make an image brighter or darker...&quot; ==

I'm doing a lot of cutting and clarifying. I've taught photography to youth as young as 10 and they get the &quot;big hole&quot; &quot;small hole&quot;; &quot;long shutter&quot; &quot;quick shutter&quot; thing. Its a quick way to get people thinking about how it works. The alternative is: imagine a water pipe that you can constrict the width...

If anyone feels the cuts I'm doing as unjust, please correct me. However, since most of the sections have links to wiki pages that go on at length about the topic... brevity should be our focus. --[[User:Lepercon|Lepercon]] 06:36, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== Camera Shake Section Incorrect ==

In the section discussing camera shake, there is no consideration given to the focal length and sensor size. For long focal lengths, shutter speeds must be faster to compensate for magnification of whatever camera shake exists. For short focal lengths, one can get away with much longer shutter speeds. That's why the rule of thumb is maximum shutter speed = 1 / focal length...</text>

== PORTAL HYPERTENSION ==
=== Definition: ===
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase in portal vein pressure above the normal level of 5 to 10 mmHG.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the resting portal venous pressure is above 10 mmHg.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most commonly due to obstruction:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Somewhere in the portal vein or its tributaries (Prehepatic).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the portal venules and sinusoides in the liver (Hepatic).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the Hepatic veins draining into the inferior vena cava (Post 
    Hepatic).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased blood pressure in portal veins cause oesophageal varices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commonly Liver diseases and thrombosis in the vein causes portal 
  hypertension and due to it occurs massive recurrent hematemesis and melaena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Causes:===

&lt;big&gt;Commonest Causes:&lt;/big&gt;
who puts COMMONEST? Most common
==== Prehepatic: ====
*Congenital absence or abnormality of the portal vein.&lt;/li&gt;
*Thrombosis of the portal vein. &lt;/li&gt;
*Obstruction of the Portal vein.&lt;/li&gt;
====IntraHepatic====
*Cirrhosis.
*Schistosomiasis.
====PostHepatic====
*Constrictive pericarditis.
*Tricuspid valvular incompetence.

====Other detail causes: ====
*Extrahepatic obstruction of portal vein and its tributaries
**Congenital absence or abnormality of portal vein
**Portal vein thrombosis *
***Idiopathic
***Umbilical and portal sepsis
***Malignancy
***Pancreatitis
***Hypercoagulable states
**Splenic vein thrombosis
*Hepatic venous outflow obstruction (Postsinusoidal)
**Suprahepatic
***Budd-Chiari syndrome *
***Constrictive pericarditis
***Right heart failure
***Smaller hepatic veins and venules
**Veno-occlusive disease *
**Sclerosing hyaline necrosis
*Hepatic causes
**Presinusoidal 
***Schistosomiasis *
***       Idiopathic portal hypertension
***       Primary biliray cirrhosis
***       Sarcoid
***       Myeloproliferative disease
***       Fibropolycystic disease
**   Sinusoidal
***       Cirrhosis *
***       Chronic active hepatitis *
***    Alcoholic hepatitis and Fatty liver *
*Increased hepatic blood flow (rare causes)
**       Tropical splenomegaly syndrome
**       Hematological and other conditions with massive splenomegaly
**       Hepato-portal arteriovenous fistula

===Pathogenesis:===
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The portal venous system lacks valves and hence resistance at any level 
  between the right side of heart and splanchnic vessels results in retrograde 
  transmission elevated pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased resistance can occur at 3 levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
====Presinusoidal====
    &lt;li&gt;anatomically outside the liver but at a functional level proximal to the 
    hepatic sinusoids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
====Sinusoidal====
    &lt;li&gt;Occurring within the liver parenchyma, e.g. Cirrhosis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
====Postsinusoidal====
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Occurring outside the liver at the level of the hepatic veins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/u&gt;! &lt;br&gt;
Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
Portal vein obstruction the 2nd most common cause. &lt;br&gt;
Presinusoidal portal obstruction accounts for nearly 20% of all cases and they 
are nearly always young and often a child.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

===Clinical features:===
Some Commonest features:

====ABCDE====
* A: Ascites.
* B: Bleeding (hematemesis, piles).
* C: Caput medusae.
* D: Diminished liver.
* E: Enlarged spleen.

&lt;p&gt;Major clinical manifestations include
*       Bleeding from gastroesophageal varices
*     Splenomegaly with hypersplenism 
*    Ascites
*   Acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these features are related, at least in part, to the development of 
portal-systemic collateral channels.&lt;/p&gt;

===Investigations:===

====Blood examination:====
=====Anemia. =====
*Usually MicroCytic Hypochromic.
*(Almost inevitable in Portal Hypertension)
=====Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia: =====
*Due to splenomegaly and hypersplenism of hypertension
=====Coagulation defect:=====
*Due to thrombocytopenia and impaired synthesis of coagulation factors by damaged liver (Factor V, VII and X).
=====Liver function test:=====
*LFT tests may be entirely normal in the presence of established cirrhosis.
====Endoscopy: ====
*Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the mostly reliable technique.
*It shows the oesophageal varix and bleeding point.
**Oesophageal varix are seen as dilated longitudinal zigzag running.
*Excludes peptic ulcer  as a source of bleeding in a patient with documented varices
====Radiology:====
*Upper gastrointestinal Barium:
**It can  demonstrate oesophageal varices as filling defect in lower end of the oesophagus.
**Not very accurate in the diagnosis of gastric varices but can detect Peptic ulcers disease.
**Can be used when endoscopy is not available.
==== Liver Angiography:====
=====Two main advantages:=====
*Measurement of Portal pressure.
*Visualization of abnormal venous anatomy in case of portal hypertension.

NB! Anemia, Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia may also occur due to bone marrow depression occurred in Alcoholic cirrhotic

===Diagnosis:===
*H/o liver disease and other clinical features of portal hypertension – in maximum number of cases
*Rarely – portal venous pressure is measured by
**Percutaneous transhepatic skinny needle catheterization
**Transjugular cannulation of hepatic vein
**Both free and wedged hepatic venous pressure should be measured 
**WHVP will be raised in Sinusoidal and Postsinusoidal portal hypertension while it will be normal in Presinusoidal Postal hypertension
**Rarely – Mesenteric and hepatic angiography may be necessary



== Management ==
#Resuscitation.
#Diagnosis.
#Specific treatment.
#Treatment of Complications.
&lt;br&gt;
=== Resuscitation of the patient. ===
Same as Upper G.I tract bleeding.
* NB!
**In Coagulation abnormalities: Fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
***Avoid Saline.
*Regular Vitals recording with Input/Output charting.
*Careful with giving sedation in hepatic cases:
**e.g. Valium I.V
**e.g.Librium in Alcohol withdrawals.
*Purgatives and enema.
**Reducing Ammonia before Encephalopathy - good choice.
*Gastric acid secretion should be decreased.
**e.g. Cimetidine.
*If Ascites:
**Strict low-salt diet.
**Spirolactone.
**Paracentasis.
=== Diagnosis:===
* Endoscopy is the main diagnostic tool.
**Before endoscopy Lavage through Ewaled tube is good if too much bleeding.
**Peptic Ulcer bleeding should be excluded.
***NB!
****Bleeding due to gastritis in patients with portal hypertension should be managed as variceal bleeding.
=== Specific Treatment: ===
==== Vasopressin (Pitressin): ====
Controls variceal bleeding by splanchnic vasoconstriction.
*In acute bleeding:
**20 units in 100ml of 5% Dextrose I.V over 20 minutes.
**Followed by  a continuous infusion of 0.4 unit/minute.
===== Side effects: =====
*Cramping pain Abdomen.
*Myocardial Ischemia.
*Raynaud's syndrome.
====Non-Selective Beta-Blockers:====
*e.g. Propranolol.
**Prevents recurrent bleeding.
*NB!
**Non-Selective Beta-Blockers should not be used in decompensated liver disease, and if variceal bleeding occurs during treatment, the failure to mount a sympathetic nervous system response to blood volume loss may precipitate rapid circulatory collapse.
==== Endoscopic Variceal Sclerosis: ====
Revolution in variceal hemorrhage by decreasing mortality rate.
===== In acute bleeding: =====
**Intravariceal injection is preferred.
***e.g. 2.5% sodium morrhuate followed by ethanolamine oleate.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/b&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt;!
=====Complication:=====
*Retrosternal Chest pain  due to phlebitis.
*Local microperforation. Major perforation is rare.
*Pulmonary effusion with fever.
====Balloon temponade: ====
Temporary method to control bleeding.
*Should be used for Short time as possible.
*&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;!
*Oesophageal balloon should be inflated to 45mmHG if the gastric balloon does not control bleeding.
*In good risk patient: Avoiding it will be a good choice and urgent shunt operation will be a good choice.
=====Complications: =====
*Aspiration is common.
*Can produce more bleeding  by sustained pressure on ulceration of gastric and oesophageal mucosa.
*Oesophageal rupture is rare but if occurs it is FATAL.
*Transhepatic Visceral Embolisation:
**It is a temporary step in poor risk patients who continues to bleed following Pitressin therapy, sclerotherapy and tamponade.
**It Occludes the feeding vessels.
**It Causes thrombosis within oesophageal varices.
===Treatment of complication:===
*Shock:
**Barbiturates.
**Fresh blood transfusion.
*Clotting problem:
**Vitamin K.
**Fresh blood transfusion.
====Encephalopathy:====
*Continuous gastric lavage.
*Magnesium sulphate and neomycin (500mg STAT then 2 hourly) through Sangstaken tube.
*High bowel wash.
====Liver failure:====
*Plenty of Carbohydrate Per OS.
*Low Fat diet.

====Ascites:====
*Strict Low salt diet
*Diuretics.

'''Dinner''' is the largest meal of the day. In traditional farming communities, it occurs in the afternoon and is followed by [[Cookbook:Supper|supper]]. Elsewhere, dinner follows [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]] and is the last true meal of the day - this is excluding [[Cookbook:Midnight Snack|midnight snacks]] and such.

Dinner is normally a cooked meal. The primary dish nearly always contains [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] of some sort, possibly [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] or [[Cookbook:Poultry|poultry]]. Dinner is usually ended with [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]].

'''Supper''' is the last true meal of the day in traditional farming communities that do not eat [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]]. Supper comes after [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]] (which is served in the afternoon), but before [[Cookbook:Midnight Snack|midnight snacks]] and such. Since dinner is the largest meal of the day, supper is not.

'''Lunch''' is a meal served near noon or in the early afternoon. Lunch is not served in traditional farming communities that serve [[Cookbook:Supper|supper]]. Lunch comes between [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] and [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]]. Lunch is not a large meal, and is not usually a hot meal. One particularly characteristic lunch food is the [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]].

The '''midnight snack''' is a late meal eaten just before going to bed or after waking up in the middle of the night. Some people have difficulty falling asleep with an empty stomach, especially those who are not &quot;morning people&quot;. Good midnight snacks are high-fat and high-protein foods. Morning people are likely to find that this causes discomfort rather than comfort. Midnight snack foods are usually chosen to serve one person with little preparation effort. Often, leftover food is [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaved]] to reheat it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tool applications use calculators and computer applications such as word processing and spreadsheets to act as tools in the learning process.  These applications may often be the easiest to integrate into the curriculum because teachers can implement these tools without changing the structure of the lesson drasitically.  Since most teachers use tools such as word processing and spreadsheets for professional or personal pruposes, they are able to draw on their own experiences with the tools to aid students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to the Wikipedia entry &quot;[[w:Rich Internet Application|Rich Internet Application]],&quot;

 Rich Internet Applications (RIA) are a cross between
 web applications and traditional desktop applications,
 transferring some of the processing to the client end.

[[w:Macromedia|Macromedia]], the software company which makes, among other programs, Flash and Dreamweaver, is credited with introducing the term in a 2002 whitepaper.

In the context of ATALL, RIAs represent a set of technologies that materials designers (be they practicing classroom teachers, resesarchers, or learners) can use to create ATALL-enabling on-line environments. This section of the ATALL Wikibook will present a specific set of technologies which may be used to support solitary and collaborative ATALL and research into ATALL.

=Technologies=
==Flash MX 2004==
Flash MX 2004 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Macromedia Flash|Flash]]&quot;) is an authoring program which allows users to create graphical user interfaces ([[w:GUI|GUI]]). It features drawing tools (e.g. lines, boxes, ovals, shading, paint brushes), an [[w:Animation|animation]] timeline, and a programming language, [[w:ActionScript|ActionScript]] (version 2.0), which is based on the proposed standard for version 1.5 of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]].

GUI resources include...
*text fields (both plain text and HTML)
*buttons
*movie clips
*audio and video display and capture objects
*custom mouse pointers
*pull-down menus

===Example GUI Designs===
'''Text Chat''': A collaborative application (see discussion of Flash Communication Server) may be easily authored using a multi-line text field (for display of the transcript), a single-line text field (for entry of messages), and a button (for sending a new message entered in the single-line text field).

'''Total Physical Response ([[W:Total_Physical_Response|TPR]]) Tasks''': A solitary activity might use a collection of so-called &quot;[[w:Drag-and-drop|drag-and-drop]]&quot; movie clips as items to be manipulated in response to text and/or audio prompts. Feedback would be provided when each item is moved to the proper location. For example, a learner might hear &quot;Place the table to the left of the chair.&quot; Placing the table anywhere except to the left of the chair would result in the application informing the user that the table had been misplaced.

'''Asynchronous Audio/Video [[W:email|Electronic mail]]''': Flash's audio and/or video capturing functions make it possible for learners to save their speech for later listening and viewing by a partner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This reference is written for a semi-knowledgeable UNIX user who has just come up against a problem and has been advised to use awk to solve it. For more information about awk, see [[An Awk Primer]].
==Versions==
There are three major versions of awk:
* awk or Bell Labs awk
* nawk or new awk
* gawk (GNU awk)
Both nawk and gawk will run awk programs without modification.

==Introduction==

Awk reads from a file or from its standard input, and outputs to its standard output. You will generally want to redirect that into a file, but that is not done in these examples just because it takes up space. awk does not get along with non-text files, like executables and FrameMaker files. If you need to edit those, use a binary editor like hexl-mode in emacs.

A frustrating thing about trying to learn awk is getting your program past the shell's parser. The proper way is to use single quotes around the program, like so:
 '''&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '{print $0}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The single quotes protect almost everything from the shell. In csh or tcsh, you still have to watch out for exclamation marks, but other than that, you're safe.

Another frustrating thing about trying to learn awk is the lovely error messages:
 awk &lt;nowiki&gt;'{print $0,}'&lt;/nowiki&gt; filename
 awk: syntax error near line 1
 awk: illegal statement near line 1
gawk generally has better error messages. At least it tells you where in the line something went wrong:
 gawk &lt;nowiki&gt;'{print $0,}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 gawk: cmd. line:1: {print $0,}
 gawk: cmd. line:1:           ^ parse error
So, if you're having problems getting awk syntax correct, switch to gawk for a while.

==Some basics==
* Awk recognizes the concepts of &quot;file&quot;, &quot;record&quot;, and &quot;field&quot;.
* A file consists of records, which by default are the lines of the file. One line becomes one record.
* Awk operates on one record at a time.
* A record consists of fields, which by default are separated by any number of spaces or tabs.
* Field number 1 is accessed with $1, field 2 with $2, and so forth. $0 refers to the whole record. 

==Some examples==
Perhaps the quickest way of learning awk is to look at some sample programs. The one above will print the file in its entirety, just like cat(1). Here are some others, along with a quick description of what they do.
 '''&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '{print $2,$1}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
will print the second field, then the first. All other fields are ignored.
 '''&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '{print $1,$2,sin($3/$2)}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
will print the first and second fields, and then the sine of the third field divided by the second. So, the second and third field had better be numbers. Awk has other built in math functions like sine; read the manpage to see which ones.
:&quot;I still say awk '{print $1}' a lot.&quot;
:the inventor of PERL, Larry Wall (lwall&amp;#64;netlabs.com)
What if you don't want to apply the program to each line of the file? Say, for example, that you only wanted to process lines that had the first field greater than the second. The following program will do that:
 &gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '$1 &gt; $2 {print $1,$2,$1-$2}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The part outside the curly braces is called the &quot;pattern&quot;, and the part inside is the &quot;action&quot;. The comparison operators include the ones from C:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;== != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= ?:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
If no pattern is given, then the action applies to all lines. This fact was used in the sample programs above. If no action is given, then the entire line is printed. If &quot;print&quot; is used all by itself, the entire line is printed. Thus, the following are equivalent:
 awk '$1 &gt; $2'           filename
 awk '$1 &gt; $2{print}'    filename
 awk '$1 &gt; $2{print $0}' filename
The various fields in a line can also be treated as strings instead of numbers. To compare a field to a string, use the following method:
 &gt; awk '$1==&quot;foo&quot;{print $2}' filename

==Regular expressions==
What if you want lines in which a certain string is found? Just put a regular expression (in the manner of egrep(1) ) into the pattern, like so:
 &gt;awk '/foo.*bar/{print $1,$3}' filename
This will print all lines containing the word &quot;foo&quot; and then later the word &quot;bar&quot;. If you want only those lines where &quot;foo&quot; occurs in the second field, use the ~ (&quot;contains&quot;) operator:
 &gt;awk '$2~/foo/{print $3,$1}' filename
If you want lines where &quot;foo&quot; does not occur in the second field, use the negated ~ operator, !~
 &gt;awk '$2!~/foo/{print $3,$1}' filename
This operator can be read as &quot;does not contain&quot;.

==Booleans==
You can produce complicated patterns with the boolean operators from C, which are ! for &quot;not&quot;, &amp;&amp; for &quot;and&quot;, and || for &quot;or&quot;. Parentheses can be used for grouping.

==Start and End==
There are three special forms of patterns that do not fit the above descriptions. One is the start-end pair of regular expressions. For example, to print all lines between and including lines that contained &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;, you would use
 &gt;awk '/foo/,/bar/' filename

==Begin and End==
The other two special forms are similar; they are the BEGIN and END patterns. Any action associated with the BEGIN pattern will happen before any line-by-line processing is done. Actions with the END pattern will happen after all lines are processed.

But how do you put more than one pattern-action pair into an awk program? There are several choices.
One is to just mash them together, like so:
  &gt; awk 'BEGIN{print&quot;fee&quot;} $1==&quot;foo&quot;{print&quot;fi&quot;}
         END{print&quot;fo fum&quot;}' filename
Another choice is to put the program into a file, like so:
 BEGIN{print&quot;fee&quot;}
 $1==&quot;foo&quot;{print&quot;fi&quot;}
 END{print&quot;fo fum&quot;}
Let's say that's in the file giant.awk. Now, run it using the &quot;-f&quot; flag to awk:
 &gt; awk -f giant.awk filename
A third choice is to create a file that calls awk all by itself. The following form will do the trick:
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN{print&quot;fee&quot;}
 $1==&quot;foo&quot;{print&quot;fi&quot;}
 END{print&quot;fo fum&quot;} 
If we call this file giant2.awk, we can run it by first giving it execute permissions,
 &gt; chmod u+x giant2.awk
and then just call it like so:
 &gt; ./giant2.awk filename
awk has variables that can be either real numbers or strings. For example, the following code prints a running total of the fifth column:
 &gt; awk '{print x+=$5,$0 }' filename
This can be used when looking at file sizes from an &quot;ls -l&quot;. It is also useful for balancing one's checkbook, if the amount of the check is kept in one column.

==Variables==
awk variables are initialized to either zero or the empty string the first time they are used. Which one depends on how they are used, of course.

Variables are also useful for keeping intermediate values. This example also introduces the use of semicolons for separating statements:
 &gt; awk '{d=($2-($1-4));s=($2+$1);print d/sqrt(s),d*d/s }' filename
Note that the final statement, a &quot;print&quot; in this case, does not need a semicolon. It doesn't hurt to put it in, though.
* Integer variables can be used to refer to fields. If one field contains information about which other field is important, this script will print only the important field:
 &gt; awk '{imp=$1; print $imp }' filename
* The special variable NF tells you how many fields are in this record. This script prints the first and last field from each record, regardless of how many fields there are:
 &gt; awk '{print $1,NF }' filename
* The special variable NR tells you which record this is. It is incremented each time a new record is read in. This gives a simple way of adding line numbers to a file:
 &gt; awk '{print NR,$0 }' filename
Of course, there are a myriad of other ways to put line numbers on a file using the various UNIX utilities. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
* The special variable FS (Field Separator) determines how awk will split up each record into fields. This variable can be set on the command line. For example, /etc/passwd has its fields separated by colons.
 &gt; awk -F: '{print $1,$3 }' /etc/passwd
:This variable can actually be set to any regular expression, in the manner of egrep(1). 

The various fields are also variables, and you can assign things to them. If you wanted to delete the 10th field from each line, you could do it by printing fields 1 through 9, and then from 11 on using a for-loop (see below). But, this will do it very easily:
 &gt; awk '{$10=&quot;&quot;; print }' filename
In many ways, awk is like C. The &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, &quot;do-while&quot;, and &quot;if&quot; constructs all exist. Statements can be grouped with curly braces. This script will print each field of each record on its own line.
 &gt; awk '{for(i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++) print $i }' filename
If you want to produce format that is a little better formatted than the &quot;print&quot; statement gives you, you can use &quot;printf&quot; just like in C. Here is an example that treats the first field as a string, and then does some numeric stuff
 &gt; awk '{printf(&quot;%s %03d %02d %.15g\n&quot;,$1,$2,$3,$3/$2); }' filename
Note that with printf, you need the explicit newline character.

We can use &quot;printf&quot; to print stuff without the newline, which is useful in a for loop. This script prints each record with each of its fields reversed. Ok, so it isn't very useful.
 &gt; awk '{for(i=NF;i &gt; 0;i--) printf(&quot;%s&quot;,$i); printf(&quot;\n&quot;); }' filename

==Arrays==
awk has arrays, but they are only indexed by strings. This can be very useful, but it can also be annoying. For example, we can count the frequency of words in a document (ignoring the icky part about printing them out):
 &gt; awk '{for(i=1;i &lt;=NF;i++) freq[$i]++ }' filename
The array will hold an integer value for each word that occurred in the file. Unfortunately, this treats &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;, and &quot;foo,&quot; as different words. Oh well. How do we print out these frequencies? awk has a special &quot;for&quot; construct that loops over the values in an array. This script is longer than most command lines, so it will be expressed as an executable script:
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 {for(i=1;i &lt;=NF;i++) freq[$i]++ }
 END{for(word in freq) print word, freq[word]  }
This loop-over-an-array seems to go in no particular order. Thus, the output from a program like this must often be piped through sort(1) in order to be useful.

Multi-dimensional arrays are implemented in an odd way. The given indices are concatenated together (with a special separator) to get one string, and it is used as the index. This program will print the word-pair frequencies:
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++ }
 END{for(words in freq) print words, freq[words]  }
Unfortunately, this will print out the separator, which is by default not a common character. You can change this by assigning something logical like a space to the variable SUBSEP using nawk or gawk (it's not allowed in plain awk).
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN{SUBSEP=&quot;&quot;}
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++}
 END{for(words in freq) print words, freq[words] }
Unfortunately (that word seems to occur a lot when talking about awk arrays), this doesn't let you refer to the indices individually. The secret to this it to use the &quot;split&quot; function, which breaks a string up into an array.
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN{SUBSEP=&quot;&quot; }
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++}
 END{ for(words in freq)
      {
         split(words,word,SUBSEP); 
         print word[1], freq[words],word[2];
      } 
    }	
When you're using an awk script in a file, you can break your program across multiple lines to make it easier to read. Comments are started the same way as in sh programming, with a #
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 # this program prints the frequencies of word pairs
 BEGIN{SUBSEP=&quot;&quot;} # set the index separator 
                  # to a nice character
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++}
 END{ for(words in freq)
      {
 # just to show we can put a comment in here.
        split(words,word,SUBSEP); # or here
        print word[1], freq[words],word[2];
      } 
 }		
You can use awk to create text, as well as just process existing text. It is useful for quickly generating tables of function values, without the hassle of compiling a C program. For example, it can show that sin(x)/x approaches 1 as x approaches zero:
 &gt; awk '{x=1.0/NR; print x,sin(x)/x;}'
will print a new value each time it reads a new line. So, you can hit return until you have all the values you need. Alternately, if you need a set number of values, you can do
 &gt; awk 'BEGIN{for(i=1;i &lt;=30;i++){x=1.0/i;print x,sin(x)/x;}}' /dev/null
where 30 is the set number of values.

It seems twisted*, but awk can be used to generate C code that one doesn't want to type by hand. For example, this script will generate an explicit 3x3 matrix multiplication routine:
 gawk 'BEGIN{
         for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
          for(j=0;j&lt;3;j++){
            printf(&quot;d[%d][%d]=&quot;,i,j);
            for(k=0;k&lt;3;k++){
              printf(&quot;l[%d][%d]*r[%d][%d]%s&quot;,
                     i,k,k,j,(k&lt;2)?&quot;+&quot;:&quot;;\n&quot;);
            }
          }
      }'

''* ok, maybe it is twisted.''

==Grand example==
And now for a grand example:
 # This awk program collects statistics on two 
 # &quot;random variables&quot; and the relationships 
 # between them. It looks only at fields 1 and 
 # 2 by default Define the variables F and G 
 # on the command line to force it to look at
 # different fields.  For example: 
 # awk -f stat_2o1.awk F=2 G=3 stuff.dat \
 # F=3 G=5 otherstuff.dat
 # or, from standard input: 
 # awk -f stat_2o1.awk F=1 G=3
 # It ignores blank lines, lines where either 
 # one of the requested fields is empty, and 
 # lines whose first field contains a number 
 # sign. It requires only one pass through the
 # data. This script works with vanilla awk 
 # under SunOS 4.1.3.
 BEGIN{
   F=1;
   G=2;
 }
 length($F) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; \
 length($G) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; \
 $1 !~/^#/ {
   sx1+= $F; sx2 += $F*$F;
   sy1+= $G; sy2 += $G*$G;
   sxy1+= $F*$G;
   if( N==0 ) xmax = xmin = $F;
   if( xmin &gt; $F ) xmin=$F;
   if( xmax &lt; $F ) xmax=$F;
   if( N==0 ) ymax = ymin = $G;
   if( ymin &gt; $G ) ymin=$G;
   if( ymax &lt; $G ) ymax=$G;
   N++;
 }
  
 END {
   printf(&quot;%d # N\n&quot;   ,N   );

==Options==
Command-line options aka switches of awk:
* -F ''field-separator'': Use the field-separator regular expression to separate fields.
* -f ''source-file''
* -v var=val: Set the variable to the value. Defined by POSIX; absent in the original awk.

Command-line options aka switches of GNU awk, beyond the bare-bones awk:
* -W gawk-opt
* ...
* --posix
* ...

==Oneliner examples==
Oneliner examples of awk use:
* echo abcd |awk &quot;/b.*d/&quot;
** Outputs lines matching a regular expression, like grep command.
* echo abcd |awk &quot;/b.*d/ {print  $0}&quot;
** Does the same as above, with an explicit print statement. $0 stands for the entire line.
* echo ab&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  cd |awk &quot;/b.*d/ {print $2}&quot;
** For lines matching a regular expression, outputs the second field. Uses a sequence of whitespace as a field separator by default. Thus, outputs &quot;cd&quot;.
* echo abcd,e |awk -F, &quot;/b.*d/ {print $2}&quot;
** For lines matching a regular expression, outputs the second field, using comma as the field separator due to the -F option. Thus, outputs &quot;e&quot;.
* echo abcd,e |awk &quot;{print toupper($0)}&quot;
** Outputs all the lines in uppercase. For lowercase, use &quot;tolower&quot;.
* echo ab cd | awk &quot;NF&gt;=2&quot;
** Outputs lines with the number of fields greater than 2.
* echo ab cd | awk &quot;{print NF}&quot;
** For each line, outputs the number of fields in it.
* echo ab cd | awk &quot;length($2) &gt; 1&quot;
** Outputs all lines such that the length of the 2nd field is greater than one.
* echo ab cd | awk &quot;$2 ˜ /cd/&quot;
** Outputs all lines whose 2nd field matches the regular expression.
* echo ab cd | awk &quot;$1 ˜ /ab/ &amp;&amp; $2 ˜ /cd/&quot;
** Like above, but with two subconditions connected by &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;. Supports some other logical operators known from the C programming language.
* echo abcd | awk &quot;{gsub(/ab/,\&quot;ef\&quot;);print}&quot;
** Replacement aka substitution like in sed command; &quot;g&quot; in gsub stands for global.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> Back to [[Emulation]]
Surprisingly, emulation on macs is fairly easy. There are lots of developers working on projects for mac, and emulation is a well supported task. 

===Emulators===
The best site for mac emulation software is http://www.emulation.net 
You will want to scroll all the way to the bottom of it where they have something that looks like finder and click on the emulation icon. It will fold out to reveal the different systems. (It took me a little while to figure this out :)

====Most popular emulators====
*http://macmame.org/ - Mame for mac (plays arcade games)
*http://www.bannister.org/software/ RockNES
*http://chrisballinger.info/public/snes9x/ SNES9x
*http://stella.sourceforge.net/ -atari emulator
*http://www.daphne-emu.com/ - Plays laserdisc games including Dragons Lair and Space Ace

===Controllers===
Now, if you are doing emulation or any gaming on a mac you should pick up a usb controller. It makes gaming a lot more fun then using the keyboard and mouse. A nice cheap one that I use is the [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005USC6/qid=1114656182/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/102-0876053-5050537?v=glance&amp;s=electronics&amp;n=507846 Belkin Nostromo N45 Dual Analog USB Gamepad].

====Controller Set Up ====
Another thing that is REQUIRED if you are using a controller with a mac is [http://www.carvware.com/gamepadcompanion.html The Gamepad Companion]. It is a piece of software that will map keystrokes and mice to controllers, so if you set J to be the jumpkey for a game, you can set a button on the controller to be mapped to J, so pressing it will make your character jump. You should configure your gamepad to match the controls of [http://www.macmame.com MacMame] and then configure your other emulators to match that. The reason is that there are so many different configureations of controllers possible for mame that its best to go with the default and then bring the other emulators into the same line.

One more note on controllers, you can have any number of them plugged in at once and have each one mapped to a different set of keys, so you can play multiplayer games.

Java has the benefit of being able to be run on most platforms. This means that you can develop an program on one os, and if the JVM exists on another machine, the program can be run there. 

As a result, many emulators have been written in java that can be set up on all types of hardware.

Full list of java emulators:
*http://java-emu.emuunlim.com/projects.html

Keep in mind that many emulator projects in java are struggling. They don't have the same support and java has some extra overhead that makes programming emulators in it a little difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Features of Interaction in Virtual Environments ==


The features of interaction shown below, based on an ESL/EFL literacy researcher’s personal experience, support the potentials of virtual environments to improve not only EFL learners’writing ability but also language development. Furthermore, the features will help EFL learners know how to apply virtual environments to English writing development.      


1) '''Learners can join various authentic writing tasks with authentic audiences.'''

Virtual environments are based on written-language conversation tools such as synchronous chats, e-mails, and bulletin boards. As soon as learners enter virtual environments, they have to write in English for the purpose of communication or to deliver their opinions. In that, virtual environments enable EFL learners to engage in authentic writing tasks with authentic audiences.   

  WORLDSMASTER&gt; Welcome to Worlds! 
  ylim5&gt; hi, there!

2) '''Learners receive direct or indirect feedback on the target language writing from their partners.'''

The feedback plays an important role in language development. However, it is not easy for EFL learners to receive feedback because they do not have many chances to use English, and there are few people who are proficient in English in the environment of the learners. Thus, virtual environments are good places for EFL learners' writing and language development because they allow EFL learners to use English. In addition, the native speakers that the learners meet in virtual environments correct EFL learners' English errors in the natural situations and in the various ways.

  A: right click on my body and you will see some options (Native speaker) 
  B: opetions? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 
  A: options (Native speaker) 

  I made an exam paper. (from a EFL leanrer's e-mail) 
  -&gt; Did you set an exam, or prepare an exam paper.(from the response of a native speaker)



3) '''Learners can learn about the target language society and culture as well as language.'''

Many researchers (e.g. Kern, 2000) in literacy education prove the importance of learning about target language society and culture to develop literacy ability. Virtual environments make possible that EFL learners can learn about them through various communication tools: synchronous chat, e-mail, and bulletin board.

  4 minutes of silence 
  Four RCMP officers were shot and killed after conducting a raid on a marijuana grow operation northwest of     
  Edmonton on Thursday.
  It's the single deadliest incident for Canada's national police force in 120 years. 
  At a news conference in Mayerthorpe, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Bill Sweeney said: &quot;As you can well imagine,  
  the loss of four police officers is unprecedented in recent history in Canada. . . . It's devastating.&quot; 
  He added that not since the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 have so many police officers been killed in the line 
  of duty. (From a native speaker) 



4) '''Learners experience a sense of place, a setting similar to face-to-face conversation with native speakers because learners show what they look like and express their feelings. Furthermore, interaction is much more similar to the discourse and behavior of people gathered anywhere for the purpose of socializing.''' 

  B: can I keep in touch with you? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 
  A: we have a meeting on this Sunday evening (Native speaker) 
  A: really??? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 

  B: nice to meet you (EFL/ESL literacy researcher)  
  A: nice dance (Native speaker)
  B: thanks (EFL/ESL literacy researcher)

  KaiteB: do your students connect internet? (Native speaker)
  WangZ: Yes, but their computer skills are not good. (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 
  KaiteB: if so, it will be not easy because you have to teach everything in detail (Native speaker) 
  WangZ: Do you have any good ideas? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 



5) '''Both the feeling of object ownership as learners create spaces and the permanence of the environment motivate learners to return for continued conversation and community building. it is cooperation that encourages learners to continue developing their writing ability.'''

   Virtual environments look like real life places. For example, when I go back to a virtual environment, nothing has really changed. 
   My own rooms and objects represent me, so I need to always take care of them. 
   (From interview with an EFL/ESL literacy researcher)

'''Vegemite''' is a [[Cookbook:Salt|salty]] strong-flavoured spread commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. It is similar to the [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] spread used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]], but more similar to the [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] spread used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]].

Vegemite is based on [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] and [[Cookbook:Malt|malt]] extracts. Vegemite is a good source of B vitamins including thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), and folate (B6). Vegemite also contains a relatively high proportion of sodium-chloride (table salt) -- luckily the typical serving size is quite small -- one teaspoon or 5g on a slice of bread or toast.


=== Glutamate ===

Vegemite, like many foods including tomatoes, cheese, mushrooms and meat, contains unrefined [[Cookbook:Glutamate|glutamate]][http://www.glutamate.org.au/main.html], ''not to be mistaken with [[Cookbook:MSG|Mono-sodium Glutamate (MSG)]]'' -- a salt-bound, chemically-refined form of this flavour-enhancing natural amino acid. Vegemite contains 1.4% of unbound, natural glutamate amino acid, and an unknown quantity of the bound form, which also occurs naturally in many common foods.</text>

We expect images to relay some kind of truth.  Whether it is a graph or a picture, there are certain qualities that they possess to portray the highest level of truth.  This is the modality of the image.  “Each realism has its naturalism, that is, a realism is a definition of what counts as real, a set of criteria for the real, and it will find its expression in the “right”, the best, the (most) “natural” form of representing that kind of reality, be it a photograph or a diagram.”

In their book Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design, Kress and van Leeuwen identify eight markers that help determine the modality of an image: color saturation, color differentiation, color modulation, contextualization, representation, depth, illumination, and brightness.  They define the following as,

“Color Saturation, a scale running from full color saturation to the absence of color, that is to black and white.

Color differentiation, a scale running from a maximally diversified range of colors to monochrome.

Color modulation, a scale running from fully modulated color, with for example, the use of many different shades of red, to plan, unmodulated color.”

These are the three markers that deal with color.  It is important to realize that high scales of all these will dilute the truth to the image by created a mess of colors; the message will be extremely distorted.

“Contextualization, a scale running from the absence of background to the most fully articulated and detailed background.”  

“Representation, a scale running from maximum abstraction to maximum representation of pictorial detail.”

“Depth, a scale running from the absence of depth to maximally deep perspective.”

“Illumination, a scale running from the fullest respresentation of the play of light and shade to its absence.”

“Brightness, a scale running from a maximum number of different degrees of brightness to just two degrees: black and white, or dark grey and lighter grey, or two brightness values of the same color.”

Kress and van Leeuwen basically argue that any extreme of their particular modality sub-catagories will cause the believability of an image to suffer.  For example, too much color saturation or too much brightness cause an inharent dissonance that conveys a sub-reality.  However, all their catagories have a &quot;Mid-range&quot; and this is where the believability of an image is strongest.

[[Image:Spring Onion.jpg|right|thumb|green onions]]
'''Green onions''' (also known as '''scallions''' and '''spring onions''') are usually one of various members of the onion family that do not form bulbs. Occasionally, whole immature [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]] are used in the same way. Green onions tend to be milder tasting than other onions and are typically used raw in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]].

It is commonly used in Chinese stir-frying, by putting chopped pieces into the hot oil at first to gave the dish more taste.

===Solutions of systems of linear equations===

A solution of a system of linear equations is a set of numbers for each variable that makes every equation true.

{| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot;&gt;
 | style=&quot;background-color:#F3F3FF; border:1px solid #D6D6FF; padding:1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;H2&gt;Number of solutions for a system of linear equations&lt;/H2&gt;
A system can either have
# Zero solutions
# One solution
# Infinitely many solutions
 |}

This can be demonstrated using 2 variable sets of equations.

No solutions

[[Image:Parallel Lines.svg|thumbnail|none|200px|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3x+2y=6\\3x+2y=12\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;]]

One solution

==Why Operators?==

When we work with the Schrödinger Equation, or in any other formulation of Quantum Mechanics, exact values of properties can not be found. Instead we use operators.

The simplest way of expressing Schrödinger's Equation is
&lt;math&gt; \hat \epsilon \Psi = \frac{\hat p^2}{2m}\Psi + V(x)\Psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Showing that energy = kinetic + potential.

Now this could look deceptively simple if we didn't use operators for energy and momentum. We could simply divide by the wave function &amp;Psi;. But like most things, it's never simple. The energy operator acts on the wave function, as does the momentum operator. So we need to find the wave function in order to make any sense of this equation.

==A Look at a Few Common Operators==

Although we could theoretically come up with an infinite number of operators, in practice there are a few which are much more important than any others.
===Momentum===
The Momentum operator is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat p = -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
So the relative part of the Schrödinger Equation will become
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial x}^2} \Psi  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Energy===
Energy Operator
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So Schrödinger's now looks like 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi + V(x)\Psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As you can see this is now a differential equation, which may or may not be easily solved depending on the potential &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this is the one dimensional form of Schrödinger's Equation, it does become more complex for higher dimensions.

===Hamiltonian===
We often call the Right Hand Side of this equation the Hamiltonian Operator.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat H = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial x}^2}  + V(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and it represents the total energy of the particle of mass m in the Potential Field V.

==Expectation Values==
In Quantum Mechanics, everything is probabilistic (e.g., the probability of finding a particle is the square of the amplitude of the wave function). 
So we often want to know the expected value of position, momentum, or anything else, and there is quite a nice method of doing this.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle\hat K\rangle = \int _{-\infty} ^\infty \Psi^* \hat K \Psi dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, for instance, if you knew the wave function and wanted to find the expectation value of momentum you'd use the equation

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle\hat p\rangle = \int _{-\infty} ^\infty \Psi^* \Bigg( -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Bigg) \Psi dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Dirac Notation (Bra-Ket Notation)==
The way we've been writing these above is fine until you have to do it thirty times, so when Quantum was being developed, Paul Dirac came up with a new way of writing this:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|n\rangle \equiv \Psi_n ... \langle n| \equiv \Psi_n^*&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So the expression for the expectation value of momentum can now be written as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle\hat p\rangle = \langle n|\hat p|n\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Which neatens it up substantially

For more on Dirac Notation see [[w:Bra-ket_notation|Wikipedia:Bra-ket_notation]]

==Commutators==
&quot;And you know why four plus minus one plus ten is fourteen minus one?
'Cause addition is commutative, right.&quot; --Tom Lehrer

Commutators are very important in Quantum Mechanics. As well as being how Heisenberg discovered the Uncertainty Principle, they are often used in particle physics. It is known that you cannot know the value of two physical values at the same time if they do not commute.

===Mathematical Definition of Commutator===
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[\hat A,\hat B] = \hat A \hat B - \hat B \hat A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is equal to 0 if they commute and something else if they don't.

As you can probably see all natural numbers will commute. For instance
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[6,7] = 6*7 - 7*6 = 42 -42 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But, if we look at Momentum and Position, things start to get interesting
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
[\hat p,\hat x]\Psi &amp;=&amp; (\hat p \hat x - \hat x \hat p) \Psi \\
&amp;=&amp; - i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x \Psi) + i x \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\Psi) \\
&amp;=&amp; - i \hbar \Psi - i x \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x} + i x \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}\\
&amp;=&amp; -( i \hbar)\Psi
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; [\hat p,\hat x] = -i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
This tells us a few things, one of the most important being that you can't know position and momentum precisely at the same time.

      <comment>/* Folds... */ clarifying some of the issues</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thanks for fixing the fold stuff ==

I hadn't realised that my understanding of folds was quite so broken.

I'm going to add one or two notes to your text though.  We need to explain that &quot; ' &quot; is a valid character in an identifier, and I don't think we've introduced infinite lists yet.

Paul.

== foldl' and foldl1' ==

We did not learn about libraries or modules yet, so I can't use the information about those functions. Importing seems more than Elementary or Basic Haskell. -- gerymate

== Map exercises ==

Are there any answers for the map and scan exercises (in [[Haskell/Answers to exercises]])? I looked through the answer guide using some searches (didn't read the whole thing so as not to spoil later problems), but couldn't find any keywords like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Int]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Anyway, here's what I came up with. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 05:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)


 negatel :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 negatel l = map (negate) l

 factorsl :: [Integer] -&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 factorsl [] = []
 factorsl (l:ls) = factors l : factorsl ls

 factors p = [ f | f &lt;- [1..p], p `mod` f == 0 ]

 negatell :: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; -&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 negatell [] = []
 negatell (l:ls) = map (negate) l : negatell ls

----

 factList :: Int -&gt; [Int]
 factList n = scanl1 (*) [1..n]

== WTF? ==

How come none of the fold examples have fold in them? Can't you give an example of fold in action? It's very confusing....I think this section needs a bit of work. It's not clear.

== Type Signatures ==

Could we please get type signatures for the example functions used? Especially the echoes example. I was very lost when I first read it, and I still don't know what the types would be. And I believe that was the first attempt at an explanation of Lambdas. Would have been nice to know what they were back in the Pattern Matching chapter when they were first mentioned.

== Nonassociative folds? ==

I think that our examples and exercises on folds are impoverished in that the operators used are always associative (and usually even commutative). The difference between &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; is more than just the order of computation but can even affect the result. In general, only one will be correct.

Some possibilities:
* Code &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; using a fold and &lt;code&gt;( : )&lt;/code&gt;; one way will work, while the other will return the original list. (This operator is associative but of course not commutative.)
* Horner's method for evaluating polynomials; this could be extended to converting a string like &lt;code&gt;&quot;8C5a&quot;&lt;/code&gt; from hexadecimal. (This operator is not even associative.)

I can write these as exercises (and write their solutions), but maybe somebody has other or better ideas.

== Folds... ==

One of the exercises is to generate a fact-list.

My very first approach was 
&lt;code&gt;
factList n =  foldr1 (*) ( takeWhile (&lt;=n) [1..]): factList (n-1)&lt;/code&gt;

but this builds a list like [24,6,2,1]. The question would be:

#1 Since factList(n-1) is obviously appended at the very end, how to change the code to append it at the beginning?
#2 What are the risks of it?

add 1) &lt;code&gt;factList n = factList (n-1) ++ foldr1 (*) ( takeWhile (&lt;=n) [1..])&lt;/code&gt;

add 2) Instead of linear complexity, you have quadratic complexity: 
xs ++ ys takes linear time in the length of xs; (([1]++[2])++[3])++[4])++... appends to elements of length 1,2,3,etc, for a total of 1+2+3+...+n = n*(n+1)/2

Although I don't understand in details the thing with the quadratic, cause the opposite is as well a recursion and therefore the same formula applies? I have to confess that statement is from an IRC-session.

I have to admit to have no real clue where to put that kind of information (either ListProcessing, Solutions, Lists, etc.)

:A few things to point out:
:* Your original solution is already quadratic. The uses of both &lt;code&gt;takeWhile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldr1 (*)&lt;/code&gt; are linear in &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, and the solution performs those operations &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; times recursively. As a broader point, folds are meant to capture recursion patterns, so you should not need explicit recursion when you use &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and friends.
:* &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; would also make it quadratic, as explained in the answer to 2) that you mention. The recursion scheme may be in itself linear, but if the operation is also linear in the size of the input the whole thing becomes quadratic. In general it is a bad idea to reverse the order when building a list by replacing &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt;. I don't recall whether we point that out explicitly in some chapter; it would be a good thing to do so.
:* The immediate solution to the problem is to use &lt;code&gt;scanl1&lt;/code&gt;. I can't see a way to write it, or &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt;, as a simple fold without resorting to unpleasant tricks like using &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;. (Though that might just be lack of imagination from myself. I'm still puzzled :))
:* By the way, the solutions to the exercise which asks for implementations of &lt;code&gt;scanr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; use &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; indiscriminately, which isn't good. I will try and tidy them up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spreadsheet software is software designed to create spreadsheets and or worksheets. These spreadsheets and worksheets are created to organize data and complete mathematical computations. Spreadsheets are made up of rows and columns that vertically and horizontally connect to make cells. A group of cells is most associated with the range of certain cells. 
A combination of spreadsheets, and/or worksheets, are called a workbook. Workbooks are commonly used in the accounting and business profession and or may also be used for personal
[[File:Spreadsheet.png|thumb|Spreadsheet]]



Spreadsheets provide a way for students to process data and report results. The word spreadsheet has become almost synonymous with mathematics.  Data is arranged on a grid, in rows and columns, and the program automatically calculates and re-calculates values. This promotes mathematics instruction because once students enter the data they must have a true understanding in order to use the correct computer command or formula to get the needed result.  Data can easily be turned into a graphic which helps with visual learning.  Teachers can use spreadsheets to calculate student marks, create schedules, or to develop examples for math lessons.  Spreadsheet activities can range from easy (shading cells to create a picture) to difficult (calculating interest and payments on a car purchase).

'''Turbinado sugar''' is raw sugar that has been spun in a centrifuge to separate the crystals. It has a light molasses flavor reminiscent of brown sugar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|Sweeteners]] | [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]

'''Fructose''' is the chemical name for the kind of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] found in most [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]]. Sugar found in [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] and human [[Cookbook:Blood|blood]] is called glucose. Normal table sugar, produced from sugar cane or sugar beets, is called sucrose.

Fructose is sweeter than glucose and sucrose. It is thus useful for people who wish to reduce the sugar in their diet without reducing sweetness. It's also useful for people who simply want extra-sweet food. Note that reducing the sugar in a recipe can have bad effects; sugar is used for browning and for mold prevention.

==Warning==
Fructose can cause diarrhea, flatulence, obesity, [[w:Low_density_lipoprotein|elevated LDL cholesterol]] and [[w:Triglyceride|triglycerides]], loss of minerals, and glycation-related cellular damage that may lead to age-related chronic diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tactile sensors measure force applied to them. This can be in an on-off fashion or as a more or less accurate measurement.

==Simple Contact Sensor==
===Bumper switches===
One of the most simple sensors available are contact sensors or bumper switches. These sensors use some form of bumper to press a button when the robot comes in contact with another object. A well built bumper switch is a very reliable sensor, but since these detect by touch, they're not very practical on fast or heavy robots. 

One key point on bumper switches (or any kind of mechanical switches) is that they don't give a clean signal when closed. The contact tends to &quot;bounce&quot; a bit.

===Whiskers===
Whiskers use the same principle as bumper switches, however they give a slightly larger detection range and so avoid the need to bump against other objects. One common design is to mount the whisker through a circular bend wire. When something hits the whisker, it bends and touches the circular bend wire. The electrical contact formed in this way is used to detect the object.

Arabic numerals (how the numbers look) are of two types: the ones used in most of the world which originate from Arabic and those which are used in Arabic today.

==Mozilla/Firefox==
You need a guide for Mozilla/Firefox users (such as myself).
:There already is.. just follow the instructions on the page and it will install the fonts/etc for windows. Firefox will use these fonts. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 05:48, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Unix/X11==
A guide for X11 and Gnome/KDE (Unix, *BSD, Linux) users would be much appreciated.

:^I second that

:Yep. Triple that. I never got an IME working on Linux.

: I'll see if I can get IME working on my machine. If I am able to get it working, I'll write down what I did here. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 14:10, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:I put up a preliminary guide to IMEs under Debian. It could do with somebody testing that all the neccessary packages are listed. I'm afraid I don't know how one enables an IME if you're using some wierd &quot;desktop environment&quot; that doesn't use a .Xsession file.
:The Unix/X11 section could do with lists of packages for other distributions, and also some information on Japanese-specific distributions.

==Windows 2000==
Windows 2000-specific instructions are needed; the steps are not quite the same as XP.  I'd put them up myself, but I already got it working and I forget how :)

== How to use it?  (GNOME) ==

OK, I followed the steps here, and while I'm sure these are useful first things to install, I still need to figure out how to use them.  :-)

A different approach I tried:
* added a GNOME panel object called &quot;Keyboard Indicator&quot;
** right-click, Keyboard Preferences
** Layouts, Add..., Japan / Kana
** (Layout Options has a &quot;Japanese keyboard options&quot;, but I have no clue what they are: &quot;Kana Lock key is locking&quot;, and &quot;NICOLA-F style Backspace&quot;; the help file doesn't mention them)
** (there's a &quot;Default&quot; column, with a circle in each row, but it doesn't seem to do anything)
Now if I click the panel object (it looks like just a label, but it acts sort of like a button!) until it says &quot;Jpn&quot;, I'm typing in Katakana.  Huzzah!  The katakana don't seem to correspond to either Qwerty or Dvorak locations, unfortunately, so it's going to be complete trial-and-error for a couple weeks.

I don't know yet how to type Hiragana (which is what I really wanted), or Kanji (but that sounds really complicated).  It looks like &quot;scim&quot; is what I'll need for this, but I tried running &quot;scim-setup&quot; and it's obviously written for somebody who already knows what they're doing, and I am not (yet) that person.

== Windows Vista ==

How about an input method for vista?

: From what I gather, Microsoft has become more and more i18n friendly and I suppose IMs should be covered. If you have Vista, feel free to research this and [[WB:BB|leave a note]] on how that is done. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:52, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The drone honeybee is the only male resident within a colony of bees. At the beginning of a spring season their population is often below one hundred, with a healthy hive often not having a population greater than a thousand. A good approximation dictates that about 15% of the hive's population is made up of drones. The drone is often described as simply being a fat, lazy bee that is unable to care for himself. 

==Appearance==
Those unfamiliar with distinguishing the sexes of bees many often mistake a drone bee as being a [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee]], as he is noticeably different than his sister  [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker bees]]. In actuality, the drone bee can be easily distinguished from a queen bee by identifying his large round eyes located close together at the top of his head. The drone’s body shape is also more cylindrical than that of the thinner tapering queen’s body.
Though not obviously apparent from casual observation, drone bees also do not have pollen baskets, stingers or wax glands.

==Behavior==
===Beg, Borrow and Steal===
The drone has a reputation for being fat and lazy, this likely comes across due to his manner within the hive. The drone will not help out in brood rearing, comb building, honey curing or storage. Rather the drone does little more than eat. In fact when possible, the drone will beg [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee#Nurse Bee| nurse bees]] to feed them, when unsuccessful a drone will eventually help himself to stored nourishment.
The drone is likely only tolerated within the colony as he is needed to spread the hive’s genetics.

===Leaving the Hive===
In about six days after emerging as a bee, the drone will begin to leave the colony. This however depends on the weather and time of year. As they mature, they will begin to congregate in areas where other drones exist, in hopes of mating with a viable queen.

===Kicked Out===
As the outside weather cools, and mating season comes to an end, most drones that managed to survive unmated will be kicked out of the hive. Drones are a tremendous drain on resources, and are not required for the overwintering process. It is also not uncommon for both adult and brood drone to be kicked out of the hive during a dearth in food collection.

==From Egg to Bee==
===Eggs===
Drones are the result of unfertilized egg and the process of parthenogenesis. Normally, a queen bee will purposely deposit an unfertilized egg into a slightly larger drone cell. A special case also exists where a [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee#Laying Worker| laying worker bee]] may deposit eggs into any brood cell.

===Larval Diet===
After hatching into a larval form, drones begin to eat a mixture of worker jelly, pollen and honey. This food has been called drone jelly, though all beekeepers and researchers have not adopted this term.
===Drone Cell===
Most commonly, drone eggs are deposited in what is known as a drone cell. These cells are similar to worker cells, but are wider. After about six days, the drone larva, within the drone cell is capped. These drone cells can easily be distinguished from worker cells once they their capping is domed shaped and protrude beyond other brood cells.

==Duties==
===Mating===
The drone has only one purpose, after completion of which, he will quickly die. The drone honeybee exists to mate. Once mature, the drone leaves his colony to join other drones within designated mating grounds called drone congregation areas. If the drone is successful, mating will occur somewhere around two hundred feet in the air. Because of the fact that his mating apparatus is barbed, much like the stinger of a worker, it will be ripped from his body after mating, and he will fall towards the earth with the only possible outcome of death.

===Warmth===
It is debated by some, that drone bees may also provide insulation to a hive, making it easier to maintain warmth. If anything this function is incidental, and can likely be more efficiently achieved by worker bees.
==Life Cycle==
;Day 0:An unfertilized egg is laid by either the queen bee or a laying worker.
;Day 3 :The unfertilized egg hatches.
;Day 11 :The drone cell is capped.
;Day 15 :Metamorphosis in to a pupa is complete
;Day 24 :Adult drone emerges.
;Day 30 :The drone begins to leave the colony
;Day 85-06 :The drone dies, if survived unmated

==Quick Facts==
*Many beginning beekeepers practice on drones when learning how to successfully [[Beekeeping/Marking the Queen| mark the queen]], as they do not have stingers, and are not vital to the colony if accidentally injured or even killed.

Over 300 Prophecies from the Hebrew Scriptures Reveal Messiah   [http://www.messiahrevealed.org/]



== Messiah in Genesis 3 The fall of man ==

Text from KJV 

''12.  And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13.  And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  14.  And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  '''15.  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel'''.'' 


Gen 3.15 is seen as a prophesy that the Messiah would:-
1. be born of woman.
2. be the enemy of evil
3. suffer in his struggle against evil (bruised heel)
4. defeat evil (shall bruise thy head)

CJL -28 April 05

== Messiah in Genesis 9 The story of Noah's Ark ==

''King James Version ...   20.  And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:  21.  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.  22.  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.  23.  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.  24.  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.  25.  And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.  '''26.  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant'''.  27.  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 28.  And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.  29.  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.''


MESSIAH DESCENDS FROM SHEM.

== Genesis 12 The Call of Abram ==

1 The LORD had said to Abram, &quot;Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. 
2 &quot;I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you;
I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
3 I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse;
and '''all peoples on earth will be blessed through you'''.&quot;

MESSIAH IS A DESCENDANT OF ABRAM

MESSIAH COMES FOR ALL NATIONS

== Genesis 17 The Covenant of Circumcision ==

19 Then God said, &quot;Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.&quot;



MESSIAH WILL BE A DESCENDANT OF ISAAC.

== Genesis 18 - Abraham pleads for Sodom ==

16 When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. 17 Then the LORD said, &quot;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? 18 Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and '''all nations on earth will be blessed through him'''. 19 For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.&quot;

THE MESSIAH WILL BE A DESCENDANT OF ABRAHAM

THE MESSIAH WILL COME FOR ALL NATIONS

== Genesis 21 Hagar and Ishmael ==

9.  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian (hebrew: Mitsriyt), whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 
10.  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 11.  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 12.  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. '''In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.''' 13.  And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.


MESSIAH WILL DESCENT FROM ISAAC.

Isaac means = he laughs

Academics suggest that there were 2 Mizraims - one is Egypt and the other was in northern Arabia.

== Genesis 22 - Sacrifice of Issac ==

9.  And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 
10.  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
11.  And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am. 
12.  And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. 
13.  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. 
14.  '''And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided'''. 
15.  And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, 
16.  and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, 
17.  that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. 
18.  '''And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.'''  


THE MESSIAH WILL BE SACRIFICED ON THE SAME MOUNTAIN

MESSIAH DESCENDS FROM ABRAHAM AND WILL COME FOR ALL NATIONS.

== Genesis 26 - Abraham goes to Philistine ==

1.  And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar. 
2.  And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. 
3.  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father. 
4.  And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And '''in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'''. 
5.  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 6.  And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 

MESSIAH IS A DESCENDANT OF ISAAC AND COMES FOR ALL NATIONS.

== Genesis 28 - Jacobs Ladder ==

10.  And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. 
11.  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
12.  And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
13.  And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. 
14.  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And '''in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed'''. 
15.  And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. 
16.  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not. 
17.  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
18.  And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
19.  And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first. 

MESSIAH IS A DESCENDANT OF JACOB AND COMES FOR ALL NATIONS.

== Genesis 49 - Jacob's Blessing of the 12 Tribes ==

1.  And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days. 

8.  Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee. 9.  Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? 10.  '''The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come: And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.''' 11.  Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes: 12.  His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">if dx is contravariant, then surely g must be covariant, or vice versa? To be honest I can never remember which is which, but I'm sure they must be different.

dx is contravariant, g is covariant and symmetric. The way to remember is that 
dx'&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;=dx'&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;/dx&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;·dx&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;    by the chain rule
This is the change-of-coordinate equation of a contravariant tensor, and thus dx is contravariant.  Hope this helps. - Itzamna 2 Feb 2008

I also don't understand the last example.  How could that work, since ds is a scalar, 2 is a scalar, and dx and dy are contravariant vectors?

=='''Testing Intelligence:''' ==
['''PURPOSES AND METHODS''']

Although, as we have seen , theorists and researchers are still working on a definition of intelligence, psychologists, educators, and others who face a very real need to measure intelligence in some way continue to study existing tests and to explore ways to improve their ability to provide us with useful information. Why do we need to measure intelligence? There are three primary purposes in intelligence testing : predicting academic performance, predicting performance on the job, and assessing general adjustment and health

The earliest intelligence tests were designed to meet the first of these goals, and most existing intelligence tests, such as the Binet and Wechsler scales, predict performance in school better than they predict anything else. Predicting how well a person will succeed at a job is the second goal of intelligence testing, and according to Gottfredson (1997), such measures are the most powerful predictors of over all work performance. A third use of intelligence testing is in assessing people's general adjustment and health. The Binet and Wechsler tests that we discuss in this section can detect signs of neurological problems, mental retardation, and emotional distress in children as well as adults, and the Bayley scales and other infant tests are useful in assessing developmental progress in infants as well as neurological disorders or mental retardation.

Unfortunately, traditional tests do not make predictions as accurately for some groups in our society as for others. Many critics, for example, have pointed out that these tests often require knowledge that children with fewer advantages are unlikely to have and that thus, traditional tests may unfairly classify some people as less intelligent than they actually are. For some years researchers have been attempting to develop what are known as culture-fair tests, that is, tests that attempt to exclude or minimize the presence of culturally biased content that could prejudice test takers' responses. The raven progressive matrices test which requires people to identify, distinguish, and match patterns of varying complexity, and the Kaufman test we discuss shortly are such tests.

We begin this section with a brief discussion of the Bayley scales and then examine the two most widely used sets of traditional tests – the Stanford – Binet tests and the Wechsler scales. Neither of these tests is culture fair, and both tests measure the products of intelligence, that is, actual information. Next we examine the relatively new, Kaufman assessment measure, which attempts both to be culture –fair and to measure the processes by which people acquire information and solve problems we then turn to the methodology of test construction, including the ways in which psychologist s develop norms for test scoring and the kinds of procedures they considering the relative stability of intelligence as well as what factors may effect changes in intelligence over time.

== '''Measuring infant intelligence''' ==

The Bayley scales of infant development (Bayley, 1969, 1993) are probably the best known and most widely used of all infant development tests. Because these tests were designed to be used with the very young, their nonverbal test items were chosen for their ability to measure specific developmental milestones. The Bayley scales are used with infants and children between 1 and 3 years of age, and they are generally used to assess children who are suspected to be at risk for abnormal development. For example, the Bayley mental scale includes such things as looking for a hidden object and naming pictures, whereas the motor scale includes such items as grasping ability and jumping skills in a third part of the test, the examiner observes the child's behavior, making notes about such things as sociability and displays of fear 

The growing emphasis on the processes of intelligence has led some investigators to explore ways of assessing processing skills in the very young as well as to devise measures that are culture – fair . box 11-1 discusses one of these newer tests, the Fagan test of infant intelligence, which is capable not only of assessing process but of eliciting similar performance from infants of different cultures. The test also correlates well with measures of intelligence in children of older ages. Such predictive value not only can tell us something about the relative stability of intelligence, a topic we discuss later in this section, but also can serve a diagnostic purpose, indicating the need for special assistance for a child at risk for less than adequate cognitive development (Fagan, 1992).


== '''The Stanford – Binet test''' ==

Widely used by psychologists both in schools and in health settings, the Stanford Binet test is the modern version of the test devised in the early 1900s by Binet and Simon at the request of the Paris school system. At that time because of new compulsory education laws, the city's schools were overcrowded, and school administrators wanted to identify children who were unable to learn in traditional classroom settings, fearing that teachers might judge these children unfairly, school officials proposed giving them the opportunity for special education.
Binet and Simon, who believed that intelligence was malleable and that children's academic performance could be improved with special programs, took an innovative approach to the construction of their test (Binet, 1909/1973; Siegler, 1992). Critical of earlier psychologists, who had tried to assess intelligence by measuring simple sensory or motor responses, Binet and simon asserted that to differentiate among individuals, one had to sample higher mental function such as

'''''The Fagan test of infant intelligence'''''

All mothers and fathers know that their babies are destined to win Nobel prizes or to become great leaders, but is it really possible to test intelligence in very young children? The Fagan test of infant intelligence was built on the notion that infants display their intelligence in their capable use of such processes as encoding the attributes of objects, seeing similarities and differences between objects, forming mental representations, and retrieving those representations (Fagan, 1992). Of course we cannot see an infant's selective attention to novelty, the primary basis of the Fagan test, but we can infer it from infants behavior. Suppose, for example , that we show a 5-month old a red diamond shape; next we show the infant a green diamond and a green square. Typically, the infant will show a preference for the square, indicting that she has processed the element of from the original color form compound and is now interested in the new form. (Remember our discussion in chapter 5 of habituation and the infant's tendency to attend to what is novel in her environment)

The Fagan test estimates an infant's intelligence by measuring the amount of time the infant spends looking at a new object compared with the time  spends looking at a familiar object (Fagan et al , 1991) using a set of 20 photographs of human faces, arranged in pairs, the examiner begins by showing a baby one photograph of the first pair, for 20 seconds. Then the examiner pairs that photograph with its mate, showing the baby the two photos together for 5 seconds, and then again for another 5 seconds, this time reversing the two photos left to right (to avoid any tendency for the infant to choose one side).  The score the infant receives is made up of the total time he spends looking at the novel photograph throughout presentation of all the 10 pairs.

To determine whether infants from different cultures would be equally adept at this task, Fagan and his colleagues administered the test to groups of European American and African American babies in the United States, a group of infants in Bahrain (bordering Saudi Arabia), and a group of infants in Kampala, Uganda.  Within each cultural group infants of four ages - 6, 8, 18, and 24 months – were tested. The researchers found that there were practically no differences between the average scores obtained by the nearly 200 infants in these groups:

European American babies scored an average of 58.8 African American 59.1 Bahrainans 59.6 and Ugandans 58.4. according to Fagan (1992), the most parsimonious explanation for these findings is that differences in IQ between blacks and whites spring from differences in cultural exposure to information (that) influences scores in the domain of cultural knowledge tested (p.85).

Interestingly, among these infants, 54 percent of European Americans, 49 percent of African Americans, and 26 percent of Bahrainians were considered to be physically at risk – that is, they had spent five or more days in a neonatal intensive care unit. Moreover, among the Ugandan babies, 62 percent had mothers who were HIV positive. The presence of these potentially negative influences may add significance to the authors statement that there appeared to be no differences in intelligence among the four group.

Fagan and his associates (Fagan , 1984) have demonstrated the Fagan test's ability to predict intelligence scores at a later age, a quality that greatly enhances the potential usefulness of the test (see also text discussion of the predictive value of infant testing). In fact, a primary goal of the test is to differentiate normal from cognitively deficient infants. According to Fagan (1992), the test has been shown highly sensitive to later evidence of mental retardation, identifying some 85 percent of children who later obtained low IQ scores.

Binet originated the concept of mental age, which is an index of a child's actual performance level as contrasted with her true age. Thus, if a 6-year – old child gets as many items correct as the average 7-year-old , the 6-year – olds mental age is 7; she performs as well as a child 7 years old. The mental age concept was later superseded by the intelligence quoting for which the German psychologist William stern devised the following form:
 
Where IQ equals mental age MA) divided by chronological age (CA), multiplied by 100. thus, if a child's mental age equaled her chronological age, she would be performing like an average child of her true age, and her IQ would be 100. if her performance were superior to other children her age , her IQ would be above 100; if it were inferior, her IQ would be less than 100.  Today's Stanford-Binet test, a revision of the Binet-Simon measure, has been designed to include items that tap other than language and math skills, such as putting together jigsaw puzzles and making designs with blocks, but the extent to which academic experience influences the latter types of tasks is not completely clear. As we will see next, the Wechsler scales have placed more emphasis on tests that assess so-called performance skills.

The Wechsler Scales

The Wechsler intelligence scales, developed by David Wechsler (1952, 1958), include the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). Although these tests show the influence of Binets tests. Wechsler designed them specifically to yield separate verbal and performance IQ scores as well as a combined, full scale IQ score. The descriptions of the WISC subtests shown in table 11- highlight that performance items are some what less likely to be influenced by formal education or cultural factors. As a result, a child who has a specific learning problem such as a difficulty with language may do quite well on these items, even if he performs poorly on the verbal subtests.  Children who come from homes that lack some of the advantages other children enjoy may also be more successful on these performance tests.

Rather than use mental age as a basis for estimating intelligence, Wechsler created the deviation IQ, which is a number that reflects the higher, lower, or similar position of the test taker's score in relation to the score obtained by an average child of the test taker's age. How is this different from the concept of mental age? The deviation IQ scoring system, which like the Binet IQ takes 100 as an average score, is based on extensive testing of people of different ages in many parts of the United States and on the statistical computation of mean scores for each age group. In computing these average scores, psychologists use a statistic called the standard deviation to signal the extent to which no average scores deviate from the norm. as a result, an individual's score may be at the mean, or it may be one or more standard deviations above or below the mean.

== '''The Kaufman assessment battery for children''' ==
The first test to include a specific focus on processing skills, the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC), is based directly on cognitive development research (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 1983). The test measures several types of information – processing skills grouped into two categories: sequential processing (solving problems in a step – by – step fashion) and simultaneous processing (examining and integrating a wide variety of materials in the solution of a problem) the test also assesses achievement in academic subjects, like vocabulary and arithmetic, yet its test items (many nonverbal) are intended to be culture-fair. In fact, the designers of this test used a wide and representative sample of many American cultural and socio-economic groups in establishing norms for the test.

An interesting innovation is that if a child fails early items on a subscale, K-ABC examiners teach the child how to complete these items before they administer the rest of the subtest. According to the designers of the test, this ensures that no child who is capable of learning an unfamiliar task receives a failing score in it. The Kaufman test has been criticized for offering only a limited range of items that tap information – processing function, such as short-term memory (Conoley, 1990); Sternberg, 1985) critics have argued that the test should focus more on problem solving strategies, a central component of the information – processing approach to intelligence. Nevertheless, the Kaufman test is a creative approach to the measurement of intelligence that applies important insights from the information – processing approach to the study of intelligence and intelligence testing. ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives ==
* Understand what neuropsychology is and what a neuropsychologist does.
* Gain knowledge of the basic structures and functions of the brain.
* Understand the tools a neuropsychologist uses, and what each can help diagnose and why.
* Understand the different areas that a neuropsychologist tests, and examples of tests that are used.

== Neuropsychology ==

Psychological testing in health is mostly done by neuropsychologists in a field called '''neuropsychology'''. Neuropsychology is the study of the brain and how it relates to behavior. The '''neuropsychologist''' uses neuropsychological tests in order to test for dysfunction in the brain that affects behavior. Through these tests, neuropsychologists can identify disorders of the brain and spinal cord for further treatment or for the sake of gaining knowledge. It is also a diverse field which overlaps with the studies of psychological testing, neurology, and psychiatry.

Neuropsychologists study the brain in many different disorders. Some of these include how alcohol affects the functioning of the brain, how the AIDs virus changes brain functioning, problems in memory, the effects of Alzheimer's disease, deficiencies in language, motor and movement problems, malingering, injury or disease of the brain, epilepsy, and learning disabilities such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder.

== Lateralization in the Brain ==
In order to understand neuropsychological tests a basic understanding of the nervous system and brain. The nervous system is made of two parts, the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The '''central nervous''' system consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the '''peripheral nervous''' system is made up of cranial nerves.

The central nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is more important to neuropsychologists, especially the function of the brain. The brain is made up of both neurons and glial cells. One of the characteristics of a normal adult brain is that it is lateralized into the right and left '''hemispheres'''. '''Lateralization''' is the separation of the function of both side of the brain.

In order to study the functions of each hemisphere, neuropsychologists study split-brain patients. '''Split brained patients''' have had the '''corpus callosum''' severed. This area of the brain is the major commisure, or major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres, in the brain. When it is severed, it's as if both sides of the brain operate independently of one another, thus it's like having two separate brains that are specialized for different tasks that can't communicate with one another; however, this lack of communication is short-lived since the brains other '''commisures''' (posterior, anterior, and hippocampal) start to take on additional functioning in order to allow for the hemispheres to communicate.

For example: &quot;[a] patient with a split brain, when shown an image in their left visual field (the left half of what each eye sees), will be unable to say what they have seen. This is because the speech control center is in the left side of the brain in most people and the image from the left visual field is sent only to the right side of the brain. Since the two sides of the brain cannot communicate, the patient can't say what they are seeing. The person can, however, pick up a corresponding object with their left hand, since that hand is controlled by the right side of their brain.&quot; (en.wikipedia.org)

This example of a neuropsychological test in split-brained patients shows how neuropsychologists know that left hemisphere of the brain is dominant for speech. Other generalities is that the left hemisphere works in a sequential manner, it is also dominant for understanding language while the right hemisphere is better at understanding emotional tone of speech. The right hemisphere also works in simultaneous way and is better at spatial tasks. 

Although these generalities in most people, it should be noted that not all people share this same type of lateralization. For example, many left-handers and a few right-handers have language dominance in the right hemisphere instead of in the left.

'''Wernicke and Broca's Areas'''

Two are of the brain that are specialized for language are Wernicke and Broca's Areas. '''Wernicke's Area''' is specialized in the ability to understand spoken language while '''Broca's Area''' is specialized in the ability to speak and use expressive language.

== The Three Areas ==

The brain is organized into three areas. The hindbrain, the midbrain, and the forebrain. The '''hindbrain''' is believed to be the most ancient part of the brain because it controls the most basic functions of life. In addition, it is also the closest area of the brain to the spinal cord or it is the lowest part of the brain. The hindbrain controls breathing, swallowing, vomiting, and blood pressure. It also is used for basic things such as general arousal, consciousness, muscle tone, posture, and hand eye movements. 

The next higher level of the brain is the midbrain. The '''midbrain''' controls head and eye movements, and it is used to localize and follow visual stimuli as well as auditory stimuli. The diagnosis of dysfunction in the midbrain is done by neurologists, those who study the biological function of the brain, because this part of the brain deals with more with cranial nerves.

The last and most advanced area is the forebrain. The '''forebrain''' is composed of six major areas: the pineal body, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and the corpus callosum. The '''pineal body''''s major function is in the secretion of hormones. The second structure, the thalamus, is the area in which all sensory information is sent initially before it is projected to other areas. Next, the '''hypothalamus''' is the area in feeding, sexual behavior, sleeping, temperature regulation, emotional behaviors and movement. While the major role of the '''hippocampus''' is in memory. As for the '''basal ganglia''', it is responsible for motor functions, in fact, damage to this area results in Parkinson's disease. Last, the '''corpus callosum''', as mentioned above, allows both hemispheres to communicate with each other.

== The Lobes ==

The brain is separated into four lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal. The '''frontal lobe''' is responsible for executive functions and motor performance. For example, executive functions are the ability to plan, carry out the plan, organize, and to engage in goal directed behavior.

The '''temporal lobe''' is responsible for auditory information, sensations, long-term memory storage and control of biological drives such as aggression and sexuality. The '''occipital lobe''' is responsible for vision and the '''parietal lobe''' is responsible for sensory skills.

== Testing Tools ==

Neuropsychologists use a series of brain imaging techniques to localize the areas of dysfunction. First, the '''electroencephalograph (EEG)'''. In this electrodes are placed on the skull and the EEG record the electrical activity of the brain. This tool is useful in diagnosing epilepsy because part of epilepsy is abnormal electrical activity which an EEG can measure.

The next imaging technique is '''computerized tomography (CT scan)'''. In this, x-rays are passed through the brain measuring the density it. Because a CT scan can detect density differences it is helpful in identifying any abnormality in density, such as in the presence of cancer or blood clots.

Another technique is '''positron emission tomography (PET scan)'''. In order to perform a PET scan, glucose is injected with a radioactive tracer and then the positrons are measured with the instrument. This works because glucose is permeable to the blood-brain barrier and the radioactive tracer can get into the brain. A PET scan helps to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. This is because it can detect differences in glucose metabolism thus differences in brain functioning and structure which are affect by Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

The last technique is the use of '''magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'''. In an MRI, atoms and radio waves scan the brain to determine the structure of the brain. Since this also can detect abnormalities it is useful in finding brain tumors. It also can determine neurological diseases if damage to brain areas can be detected in the MRI.

== Testing Techniques ==

Neuropsychologists use many techniques in order to diagnose psychological disorders. The tests measure sensory input, attention and concentration, learning and memory, language, spatial skills, executive functions, and motor output. These different areas allow the neuropsychologist to determine the area in which the dysfunction exists.

'''Sensory input''' is important because humans need to hear, feel, smell and perceive incoming stimuli accurately to learn and function well. Neuropsychologists measure the senses to see if their is a deficiency or dysfunction. One example of a test is asking a blindfolded subject, after touching one hand, to determine what hand has been touched. This test determines if the sense of touch is operating correctly. In addition, a faint sound could be presented to one ear to test if hearing is working correctly.

'''Attention and concentration''' is the ability to attend to stimuli, sustain attention, shift attention, the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli and the ability to divide attention to different tasks at the same time. Most attention tasks measure one component of attention. An example of an attention test is the '''continuous performance tests'''. This test measures sustained attention. In it, a person is asked to press a key when a certain letter or shape appears on the computer monitor. This test is used often to diagnose children with ADHD although it is not very reliable.

Another important area is '''learning and memory'''. Learning and memory are connected to each other and it is not meaningful to separate them in tests. Tests measure the various aspects of learning and memory such as short term memory, long term memory, auditory and visual memory, and verbal memory. Examples of tests for learning and memory is the '''Wechsler Memory Scale-3 (WMS-3)'''.

The use and understanding of language is the ability to speak, write and read language. '''Expressive language''' is the ability to speak whereas '''receptive language''' is the ability to understand language. A deficiency in language skills due to brain damage is known as '''aphasia'''. There are two major forms of aphasia, Wernicke's aphasia and Broca's aphasia. '''Wernicke's aphasia''' is deficiencies understanding language and '''Broca's aphasia''' is difficulty producing language. Aphasia's can be determined using an MRI because the MRI will reveal structural damage to the brain.

To test '''executive functioning''' (conceptual reasoning, planning, organization, flexibility in thinking) the '''Wisconsin Card Sorting test''' can be used. In this test, a number of cards which have varying numbers, colors, and shapes are used. The subject is then asked to sort the cards according to different aspects of the cards. This tests for frontal lobe damage.

The last area in which neuropsychologists measure is '''motor output'''. The tests measure both motor speed and accuracy. One test is the '''finger tapping test'''. In this test, subjects are asked to tap their index fingers of both hands as fast as they can in one minute, the number of taps are counter as an indication of motor speed. As for the '''grooved pegboard tests''', subjects are asked to put pegs in holes in a certain time with their left and right hand. The number of pegs put in the pegboard are counted also as an indication of motor speed.

      <comment>/* Equipment For Honey Harvesting */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Often, after making the decision to keep bees, the hardest task is actually starting. Many questions arise due to the many options for keeping bees. The following is simply a recommended guideline. It is therefore not the only correct path to starting right with bees. It is more important to know the reason behind each step than simply taking it. This way an educated decision can be made based on knowledge, not based simply on because that was what you were told to do.

==Gain Knowledge==
Before becoming involved with live bees, often the best advice is to gain a secondhand experience in some form.
===Read===
Be prepared to read about beekeeping, the more reading you accomplish on the subject, the better informed you will be. There exist a handful of books regarding the subject of beekeeping, which can be found in many libraries and through many booksellers. There also exist many helpful websites and tutorials, including [[Beekeeping| this wikibook]], just remember to take all advice with a grain of salt, as beekeepers are an opinionated group. Only follow books or guidelines that you feel comfortable with.

===Practical Experience===
The best way to gain knowledge on beekeeping is through practical experience. If possible locate a beekeeper in your area that may be willing to guide you along or even mentor you during your newfound interests. 
===Join An Association===
Many regions have [[Beekeeping/Beekeeping Clubs| beekeeping associations or clubs]]. Joining one of these can be a valuable resource. It may even be advised to join some time before you actually intend to keep bees.

==Getting Equipment==
Most beginners to beekeeping start with a standard [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth style hive]], but this is by no means the only option available. It is, however, the advisable path, due to ease of availability and experience of others. It is more than possible to start beekeeping with a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], however that is not the way we shall continue.
===What To Get===
There is a wide range of equipment available to prospective beekeepers. It is advised by most keepers to start with a minimum of two hives and fewer than five. Though you should feel free to expand once you feel comfortable. 
====Hive Parts====
Keep in mind the following list is making the assumption that you will be using a [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth style hive]]. The parts on this list will create one complete hive unless otherwise noted.
&lt;br&gt;

*2 [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| Deep Hive Bodies]] to be used as [[Beekeeping/Brood Nests| brood nests]]
*20 [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]] and sheets of [[Beekeeping/Foundation| foundation]] to fit the two deep hive bodies.
*A Minimum of 2 [[Beekeeping/Honey Supers| supers]] for collecting honey.
*20 [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]] and sheets of [[Beekeeping/Foundation| foundation]] to fit the two honey supers.
*A [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducer| Entrance Reducer]]
*A [[Beekeeping/Feeder| Feeder]], often a [[Beekeeping/Hive Top Feeder| hive top feeder]] of a large capacity is recommended, though other designs will work.
*A [[Beekeeping/Inner Cover| Inner Cover]].
*A [[Beekeeping/Telescopic Cover| Telescopic Cover]].
*A [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| Bottom Board]].

====Tools====
*A [[Beekeeping/Smoker| Smoker]]
*A [[Beekeeping/Hive Tool| Hive Tool]], some beekeepers use a large flat head screwdriver or a pocketknife, but a real hive tool is recommended.
*A [[Beekeeping/Bee Brush| Bee Brush]]
====Safety Equipment====
*A [[Beekeeping/Veil| Veil]] for each beekeeper, an extra one is recommended if you ever expect observers.
*A pair of [[Beekeeping/Gloves| Beekeeping Gloves]], this is an optional item but most beginners prefer to use them.

====Other====
*Enough exterior paint or varnishes to properly weather proof the outside of the hive.
====Equipment For Honey Harvesting====
Often it is best to wait before buying honey-harvesting equipment, due to the large investment. It may be possible to borrow equipment from an association or use that of an existing beekeeper.
*A [[Beekeeping/Queen Excluder| Queen Excluder]], some beekeepers choose not to use this device.
*A [[Beekeeping/Bee Escape| Bee Escape]], some beekeepers choose not to use this device.
*An [[Beekeeping/Uncapping Knife| Uncapping Knife]]
*A [[Beekeeping/Honey Extractor| Honey Extractor]]

===New Versus Used===
Buying [[Beekeeping/Buying New Hive Parts| new]] equipment is often safer than [[Beekeeping/Buying Used Hive Parts| used]] hive equipment, as there is no chance of disease or other pests being transferred. It is obviously more expensive too. Some beginning beekeepers choose to [[Beekeeping/Building Hive Parts| build]] their hive parts, where as this process can be fun, it is often more expensive to build a single hive than it would be to buy one new.

==Getting Bees==
Bees should only be obtained after all the hive equipment is acquired and setup. There exist a wide variety of [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| honeybee races]], you should familiarize your self with their specific attributes and see what works best in your area before acquiring any. Once you have selected your desired race you should look at [[Beekeeping/Obtaining Bees| obtaining bees]] that best meet your purpose. It is recommended that a beginner acquire bees either from a [[Beekeeping/Packaged Bees| package of bees]] or from a [[Beekeeping/Nuc| nucleus hive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives ==
* Basic understanding of what I/O psychology is, and what an I/O psychologist does.
* Know the various types of selection tests in I/O psychology.
* Understand the process of validating an employment test.
* Know the legal issues associated with employee selection.

== Industrial and Organization (I/O) Psychology ==

'''Industrial and organization psychology''' is the field of psychology that applies psychological principles to work related issues. I/O psychologists develop tests to predict and measure employee performance.

== Selection Tests ==

There are a variety of '''selection tests'''. They range from unstructured interviews to structured personality tests. The main goal of these tests is to predict job performance. Each test has its own relative strengths and weaknesses in this regard.

A very commonly employed selection test is a '''job interview'''. Job interviews can be structured or unstructured. In an '''unstructured interview''', the interviewer engages in dialogue with the interviewee that does not follow a predetermined format, questions may vary from applicant to applicant, and there is usually no standardized scoring method. Consequently, validitating this technique as a job performance predictor is quite difficult (One applicant may have the opportunity to respond favorably to a question that was not asked of another or vice versa). By contrast, in a '''structured interview''' all applicants are judged on responses to the same questions asked in the same format. Structured interviews provide for more reliable and consistent scoring results.

Another tool used for selection is '''personality testing'''. Many personality tests now employ the five factor model of personality (FFM). These factors are conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness. A short description of each factor is listed below:

* '''Neuroticism''': a tendency to easily experience unpleasant emotions
* '''Extraversion''': a tendency to seek stimulation and the company of others
* '''Agreeableness''': a tendency to be compassionate rather than antagonistic about others
* '''Conscientiousness''': a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutiful, and aim for achievement and competence
* '''Openness to experience''': a tendency to enjoy new intellectual experiences and ideas

Of all the factors, conscientiousness has been found to positively correlate most with job performance ratings{{Citation needed|date=Jan 2010}}. This factor is higly related to self-discipline, attention to detail, and organization. 

'''Mental ability tests''' measure intelligence and are the best predictor{{Citation needed|date=Jan 2010}} of job performance in all jobs and all organizations. '''Crystalized Intelligence''' relates to the ability of a person to use prior knowledge through learned processes to solve problems. '''Fluid Intelligence''' relates to a person's ability to solve a new problem utilizing novel or unlearned strategies. Employers employ both types of intelligence testing for varying job demands. 

Much like IQ, EQ or '''emotional intelligence''' is used to predict job performance. This information is gained through emotional intelligence testing. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognized and control the emotions of oneself and others. This is a relatively new are being studied for predicting job satisfaction.

The next testing technique is the '''biodata''' technique. Biodata uses personal background information to predict job performance. The type of information is job history, family history, gender, and things of that sort. These factors are then derived empirically instead of theoretically like other selection tests.

An area of selection testing that relates to motor skills are '''psychomotor ability''' tests. These tests measure fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. These skills are important in jobs like carpentry where the worker needs to have control over a hammer to hit a small nail. Unlike psychomotor ability tests, physical ability tests measure gross motor skills, such as lifting and running. These skills are important in jobs like construction where strength is an important aspect.

Another selection test technique is taking a '''work sample''' of an applicant. During a work sample, an applicant completes a realistic job task. These tasks are highly realistic and are supposed to simulate the actual job one is applying for. One example of a work sample is a drivers test. During a drivers test simulates realistic driving. The goal is to assess how well an applicant can perform the tasks, or how well an applicant can learn the task.

Tasks are also performed when an employee or applicant visits an '''assessment centers'''. These centers are used to assess applicants potential for high-level jobs. The testing takes multiple days and is costly to the organization providing the assessment and that is why it is seldom used for jobs other then those of high-level. The assessment consists of a battery of psychological tests. One example of a psychological test given is the '''leaderless group exercise''', where a group is given a task to complete without a leader this task is testing if any of the applicants will take the role of leader, thus showing leadership skills. Another exercise completed at an assessment center is a '''role-playing exercise'''. In these exercises applicants are asked to take a role in a job-related situation in order to study how well the applicants handle the situation. Another example of a psychological test is the '''in-basket exercise'''. In this exercise, applicants have a number of jobs in a &quot;basket&quot; that need to be completed in an allotted time. Each job has requirements in order to complete and they take a certain set amount of time to complete. This tests the organizational ability of applicants, how well applicants work together, leadership, among other things.

Like the role playing task in assessment centers, another selection test is the '''situational judgment test'''. This test is a paper and pencil test where a participant is presented with a hypothetical situation and asked to write what they would do in that situation. 

Unlike hypothetical situations, often, jobs require knowledge of the job. The '''job knowledge test''' is used for that purpose. These tests measure how much knowledge a person has in the field they want to work in. An example of this is the State Medical Board test that needs to be taken before a person can practice medicine in a state. Another example are certification tests, such as the A+ Certification test for people who wish to show they have basic hardware and software computer knowledge.

Often times, people need help making decisions about their career. '''Occupational counselors''' use '''vocational interest tests''' in order to help guide career decisions. These tests measure different occupational interests.

The last type of selection test are '''tests of mental illness'''. These tests measure if a person has a mental illness. However, due to the '''American's with Disabilities Act''' (ADA) they are illegal to give to job applicants. This is because it mental illness is considered a disability, and even if a person has one, it does not mean they cannot perform the job. If they can perform the job, then, in spite of their disability, the ADA protects them. Although, in some jobs mental illness can not be tolerated. This is because these jobs have interest in public welfare. One example of a job which where public welfare is at risk is a job as a police officer.

== Validating Employee Selection Tests ==

In order to use a selection test with confidence it must be validated. This validation process is important because it builds validity and reliability for using the test for a specific job. For example, if a fast food restaurant called Gopher Burger creates a selection test for employees by putting together a series of questions like &quot;What is your favorite color?&quot; it would have no basis for job performance theoretically nor empirically.

In order to establish validity in the select tests first, a '''job analysis''' must be conducted. A job analysis is a study that is used to determine the important tasks and skills needed for a specific job. In our example about Gopher Burger, the test creators would start brain storming about what skills a cook needs in the restaurant, such as manual dexterity for flipping the burgers, keen memory for remembering what goes on the burgers, and speed to make the food quickly.

The next step is to create a rudimentary test from the job analysis. This tests should then be administered to the employees or applicants. Then, predictive and concurrent validation would be calculated. The measures for the validation studies would be gotten from ratings ('''subjective measures''') or objective measures. In Gopher Burger, an example of an '''objective measure''' would be the number of burgers the applicant can make it an hour; whereas, ratings can be gained from a supervisors observation of the applicant.

After the validation studies are complete, the test should be revised until validity and reliability are statistically significant in order to accurately predict job performance from the test.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{equipment}} | [[Cookbook:Bakeware|Bakeware]]

A '''bain-marie''' is a double-walled [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pot]] with water in between the walls. This construction limits the maximum temperature to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] point of water, which is  [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|212°F]] (100°C). Two suitably sized oven-proof pots can function as a bain-marie, provided that the inner pot can be kept from touching the outer pot (except perhaps at the top edge) and can be kept stable enough.

Oven temperature should be 325°F to 350°F (165°C to 175°C). Start the bain-marie with boiling water, instead of waiting for it to get hot in the oven. To prevent [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], use a lid and ensure that the water goes well up the side of the inner pot.

A bain-marie can be used to cook [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], preventing the outside from crusting before the inside is fully cooked.

A similar device is the [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double-boiler]], which is for use on a normal [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
[[Image:Ocelot.jpg|thumb|left|Ocelot]]
The '''ocelot''' is a beautiful small-to-medium sized cat whose markings resemble the much-larger jaguar.  That beauty once brought them close to extinction, though they have fared better in recent years with legal protection.

== Where do the ocelots live? ==
[[Image:Ocelot range.png|thumb|left|Places where ocelots live are colored green]]

Ocelots mostly live in South and Central America, but there are some as far north as the southernmost reaches of the United States of America.  There are eleven different types (or ''subspecies'') of ocelot. These live in different parts of the south of the Americas.

Three of these eleven subspecies live in Mexico, and a different subspecies lives in each of the Amazon Rainforest, Atlantic Forest, the Northern Andes (Venezuela and Guyana) and all other countries of South America, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil (the biggest area on the map), Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay.
  
Ocelots are excellent climbers, but they do most of their hunting on the ground.  Ocelots mostly come out at night. During the day they sleep in trees, bushes and thick grasses. Some ocelots live alone, while others have been reported to live in pairs, maintaining contact by mewing to each other.

==What do ocelots look like?==
[[Image:Ocelot_at_Zoo.jpg|thumb|right|An Ocelot at the Marwell Zoo]]
Ocelots grow up to 3 feet and 2 inches (100 cm) in length, plus a foot and a half (45 cm) tail length. It is similar in appearance to the oncilla and the margay, who inhabit the same region, but the ocelot is larger.  Their fur is gold with black spots.  They are very thin, have huge teeth, and can jump quite far. Ocelots have long spots.

==What do ocelots eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is. Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (''prey'') by smell, sniffing for where they've been on the ground. They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on their prey.

==Fun facts==
* ''Ocelot'' comes from the Aztec word ''tlalocelot'' which means &quot;field tiger.&quot;
* Ocelots have only 36 pairs of chromosomes while most other cats have 38.  Their close relatives the margay and oncilla are the others to share this distinction.
* Ocelots often sit perfectly still for a half hour or more waiting for unsuspecting prey.
* Some observers believe that ocelots remain faithful to their chosen mates.

'''How to catch an ocelot?'''

Scientists at a wildlife refuge in southern Texas were having a hard time finding the few ocelots that lived in the area.  They tried using all kinds of animal smells but the ocelots would never show up.  So it was very lucky for the scientists when an amazing accidental discovery took place.  A worker at the refuge wore the scent of Obsession, a men's cologne (think of it as a perfume for men).  One day an excited ocelot tried to rub against the worker to better catch the scent.  The scientists then knew that ocelots love Obsession!  They are now trying to use the cologne to help in their project to raise the number of ocelots. 
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
[[Image:Serval.jpg|thumb|right|A Serval]]

The '''serval''' is a little-known but fascinating creature, a lightweight cat living in tall grass where the lions hunt gazelles and buffalo.  It does not attempt to compete with the mighty &quot;king of beasts&quot;, content to tackle smaller prey.  Gliding along on stilt-like limbs, with a long neck and large ears, the serval looks like no other cat, and for a reason...  From the tall grass a startled flock of birds takes flight only to be chased in the air.  With a spring of its powerful limbs, a serval shoots straight up, battering one of the birds back to earth with its long front limbs.

== Where do servals live? ==
[[Image:serval range.png|thumb|left|Places where servals live are colored green.]]
Servals live in the ''savannahs'' (grasslands) of Africa.  This allows them to see both their prey and their predators.  As a medium sized cat they have to be wary of lions and hyenas.  Servals are good swimmers, and often live near open water where they can take an occasional dip to hunt for fish or swipe at the birds that stop by.

==What do servals look like?==
[[Image:Serval in Tanzania.jpg|thumb|right|The serval is built for tall grass]]
The serval's lanky body gives them the most advantage for their bulk in coping with the tall grass where they roam. It gives them the appearance of being larger than they really are. In fact, the smaller female ranges from less than twenty pounds up to about thirty-five pounds. Males generally weigh thirty to fifty pounds. Their large ears give them an advantage in hearing their prey before it hears them. Their fur is yellow with black spots. On the back of the ears are horizontal gray bars. Servals use the position of their ears to communicate with each other. They also hiss a great deal, but this sound can have friendly meanings too. People often think a captive raised serval is being aggressive that is only trying to say hello.

==What do servals eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Servals usually eat birds, fish and small rodents.  
When hunting a bird, the serval will jump up in the air and bat the bird with its front paws.  This stuns the bird and makes it fall to the ground.  When hunting rodents, the serval uses its large ears to listen for them under the ground.  It then jumps straight up into the air six feet or higher, and comes straight down on its prey.  Like most cats, a serval will take advantage of other opportunities that come along, taking on anything it feels it can safely subdue.  However a serval never poses a threat to humans.

==Fun facts==
* Servals can jump up to 10 feet straight up to catch birds.
* Their hearing is so acute they can hear burrowing rodents underground and dig them up.
* A cross between a male serval and a female domestic cat is called a savannah cat.
* The mother will chase her male offspring away as soon as they can hunt, at about 8 to 10 months of age, but will let females stay with her for a little longer, up to a year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

These little confections are great one-per-afternoon snacks. These badboys are dense and will give you a euphoric high on sweets but make you want to go work out after.

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (180g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*semi-sweet [[cookbook:chocolate chips|chocolate chips]]

==Equipment==
*cupcake papers
*[[Cookbook:Cupcake Pan|cupcake pan]]
*[[cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]]
*[[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]
*[[cookbook:Mixing bowl|mixing bowl]]
*[[cookbook:Double boiler|double boiler]] (optional)

==Procedure==

#Preheat your [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F]] (180°C).
#Soften the cream cheese in the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] in a bowl. Thirty seconds on a medium setting should be sufficient.
#Combine the cream cheese, eggs, and sugar.
#Line the pan with the papers.
#Put chocolate chips in the bottom of the cupcake papers - less than a full layer; do not completely cover the bottom of the papers.
#Fill the cups with the mixture, then place into the oven.
#[[cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for about 15 minutes. The chocolate will melt and create a bottom to your cakes, but part of that chocolate will also bubble up through the cream cheese for an added effect.
#Remove and allow to cool for 20 minutes, until the chocolate hardens on the bottom and becomes crunchy.

You can also garnish the top of the cakes with chocolate that you melt in a [[cookbook:double boiler|double boiler]]. I added a dollop of chocolate little larger than a quarter on the top.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Research tools ==

* [http://www.surveymonkey.com Survey Monkey] is a tool (both free and paid versions) for creating online surveys.


== Rich Internet Applications ==

According to the Wikipedia entry &quot;[[wikipedia:Rich Internet Application|Rich Internet Application]],&quot;

 Rich Internet Applications (RIA) are a cross between
 web applications and traditional desktop applications,
 transferring some of the processing to the client end.

[[w:Macromedia|Macromedia]], the software company which makes, among other programs, Flash and Dreamweaver, is credited with introducing this term in a 2002 whitepaper.

In the context of ATALL, RIAs represent a set of technologies that materials designers (be they practicing classroom teachers, resesarchers, or learners) can use to create ATALL-enabling on-line environments. This section of the ATALL Wikibook will present a specific set of technologies which may be used to support solitary and collaborative ATALL and research into ATALL.

=== Relevant Technologies ===
==== Flash MX 2004 ====
Flash MX 2004 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Macromedia Flash|Flash]]&quot;) is an authoring program which allows users to create applications (often called &quot;movies&quot; in the Flash literature) with varied user interfaces ([[w:User interface|UI]]), featuring still and animated graphics as well as audio elements. It features drawing tools (e.g. lines, boxes, ovals, shading, paint brushes), an [[w:Animation|animation]] timeline, and a programming language, [[w:ActionScript|ActionScript]] (version 2.0), which is based on the proposed standard for version 1.5 of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]]. Applications authored with Flash are exported as Shockwave files (with .[[w:SWF|swf]] extension), which may then be run by the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in or a stand-alone player.

GUI resources include...
*text fields (both plain text and HTML)
*buttons
*movie clips
*audio and video display and capture objects
*custom mouse pointers
*pull-down menus

=====Example GUI Designs=====
'''Text Chat''': A collaborative application (see discussion of Flash Communication Server) may be easily authored using a multi-line text field (for display of the transcript), a single-line text field (for entry of messages), and a button (for sending a new message entered in the single-line text field).

'''Total Physical Response ([[W:Total_Physical_Response|TPR]]) Tasks''': A solitary activity might use a collection of so-called &quot;[[w:Drag-and-drop|drag-and-drop]]&quot; movie clips as items to be manipulated in response to text and/or audio prompts. Feedback would be provided when each item is moved to the proper location. For example, a learner might hear &quot;Place the table to the left of the chair.&quot; Placing the table anywhere except to the left of the chair would result in the application informing the user that the table had been misplaced.

'''Asynchronous Audio/Video [[W:email|Electronic mail]]''': Flash's audio and/or video capturing functions make it possible for learners to save their speech for later listening and viewing by a partner.

==== Flash Communication Server ====
Flash Communication Server 1.5 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Flash Communication Server|FlashComm]]&quot;) provides real-time audio, video, and data exchange between connected applications running in the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in from Macromedia. FlashComm servers may also interact with other FlashComm or [[w:Web server|web servers]] (e.g., the [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache server]]) in order to access dynamically generated data via a [[w:Scripting programming language|scripting language]] such as [[w:PHP|PHP]], [[w:Perl|Perl]], or [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]]. Such interaction is frequently used to retrieve, add, or update information to a database (e.g., [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] or [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]]). Though this scripting and database interaction is also available to SWF files running in the Flash Player, routing the interactions through FlashComm may be preferable when the results of each interaction should update all clients or when extra layers of security are desired.

==== PHP ====
One of the possible readings of &quot;P&quot; in &quot;[[w:LAMP|LAMP]]&quot; (the first three letters standing for &quot;Linux,&quot; &quot;Apache,&quot; and &quot;MySQL&quot;), [[w:PHP|PHP]] is a scripting language that features a broad variety of capabilities such as text searching, database connections, file management, and HTML form processing (via [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]). In general, the LAMP suite of software is popular because it is free for anyone wishing to set up their own web hosting, and it allows web hosting companies to offer very cheap (under six U.S. dollars per month) web hosting. As noted in in the Wikipedia entry for the LAMP acronym, &quot;Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, runs software that can be characterized as a LAMP application. Wikipedia's MediaWiki software is developed primarily under Linux, using the Apache HTTP Server, with its content being stored in a MySQL database, and the program logic being implemented in PHP.&quot;

===== AMFPHP =====
One particular technology built with PHP, AMFPHP (available for free at http://www.amfphp.org), is especially useful for RIA-enabled ATALL. This collection of scripts decodes and encodes Macromedia's '''A'''ction '''M'''essage '''F'''ormat ([[w:AMF|AMF]], a data format that allows for the exchange of almost every type of data object defined in ActionScript such as numeric and string variables as well as custom objects. In contrast to extensible markup language ([[w:XML|XML]]), also used to exchange a wide variety of data types, AMF is designed so that information may be transmitted quickly. An immediate benefit of this format is the time saved by not having to program conversions of the applications data into XML for transmission as well as conversion of XML from a server back into an application's data structures.

One of the most important reasons for using an implementation of AMF is the availability of AMF-compatible scripts libraries for the free scripting languages [[w:Perl|Perl]] and [[w:Python programming language|Python]] (the other possible readings of the &quot;P&quot; in the LAMP acronym) in addition to the native support for the format in Macromedia's proprietary [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]] scripting language. This almost guarantees that the particular model in which an RIA is deployed may be changed (e.g., using Perl and PostgreSQL instead of PHP and MySQL) with minimal alteration of the Flash and/or FlashComm code.

==== MySQL ====
A free (for non-commercial use) database server, MySQL (or any other database) is primarily responsible for making Internet applications rich. The long-term, centralized, and rapidly searchable storage provided by a database enables an application to minimize, if not completely eliminate, the data it must contain within itself each time it is loaded. Once loaded and running in the Flash Player, for example, an application can request only those data sets which are needed at a given point in a user's interactions with the system. Free web-based utility applications such as [[w:PhpMyAdmin|PhpMyAdmin]], installed with most scripting- and database-enabled hosting services, make modifying, archiving, and moving database entries easy for most moderately skilled users, thereby insuring data integrity and security.

=== Use of These Technologies ===
Because PHP communicates easily with Flash Player applications and with FlashComm via multiple connection methods (e.g., AMFPHP), these connections allow PHP to return information retrieved from a database (e.g., MySQL). This functionality may be used for a variety of ATALL-related purposes such as...
*presenting pre-prepared texts to users
*logging user behavior (e.g., quiz results or text from chat sessions)
*tracking user behavior over time
*matching users by common interests, languages, skill levels, etc.

*Intervention [[Technology as Intervention Strategies]]

This is an interactive series of activities and games that teachers using McMillan Treasures Curriculum in elementary grades for language arts can access via the Internet.  Students can try at home or they can interact with the website in the classroom during center time if the capabilities of computers will allow it.  These activities are related with the story, vocabulary, and grammar that the students are studying in class.   
http://activities.macmillanmh.com/reading/treasures/

*Resources for Interventions
1. Just as important to identify the student's learning style is to identify the stages of language acquisition in the second language.  Here is a great resource link to better understand the stage of language acquisition. 
http://www.everythingesl.net/inservices/language_stages.php

2. Once the teacher is able to identify the best combination of learning styles to implement in the classroom, the stage of language development needs to be identified.  Then a series of interventions and strategies are implemented, here is a good resource link on issues of identification and intervention methods.   
http://www.crosscultured.com/articles/accult_cogn_handouts.pdf

3. What to do when you have an ESL\ELL student with special needs?  Here is link to a great article on this matter and it is a source for great strategies to implement in the classroom.

'''Nastar''', or '''tananas''', are [[Cookbook:pineapple|pineapple]] jam filled cookies. These are popular treats for Eid ul-Fitr and Christmas celebrations in Indonesia.

==Ingredients==
===Cookie===
* 0.5 kg [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 0.5 kg all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] yolks
* 2 egg yolks, for painting the top of the cookies
* 1 ounce [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 5 gr [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] powder
* 1 ounce Gouda [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] grated, or Cheddar as substitute
* 0.5 ounce [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]] for garnish

===Jam===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapples]]
* 300 gr [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] stick

==Procedure==
===Jam===
# Peel pineapple, wash and make pineapple [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]]
# Put pineapple purée in a pan, add sugar and cinnamon, cook while mixing in medium fire until set
# If the jam still tastes sour, add more sugar to taste
# Let it cool, pineapple jam has to be thick enough to roll into small marbles

===Dough===
# Batter 6 egg yolks with margarine and sugar
# Add grated cheese to mix
# Add flour and vanilla little by little to make dough

===Cookie===
# Roll the dough smaller than golf ball, fill with pineapple jam

      <text xml:space="preserve">Are really **, /= etc. special characters? I mean, they are operators compounded from two special characters, but not a special character per se. I think we should not write special character pages, or at least make it consistent with those of keywords. For example:

Programming:Ada:Special:*

This special character is used in the [[Programming:Ada:Operators:*|multiplication operator (*)]] and the [[Programming:Ada:Operators:**|exponentiation operator (**)]].

Programming:Ada:Special:-

This special character is used to define comments (--), and as [[Programming:Ada:Operators:-|minus unary and binary operator (-)]].

According to the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-2-2.html RM], we are saying special character when we should say delimiter (not all special characters are delimiters, and some delimiters are compounded of more than one special characters). [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:30, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Well, this is a tutorial so we should keep it simple. Also moving i.E. - and -- together will make bad linking in source code examples. So I think the compound delimiters need there own pages. Prehaps we should better explain the different groups. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:15, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:: What do you think about following the current structure but renaming Special pages to Programming:Ada:Delimiter, e.g. Programming:Ada:Delimiter:** Programming:Ada:Delimiter:*? That would be a minimal change and would be in line with RM terminology. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:59, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Shure, that's a good idea. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 05:18, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::::There are, however, two used special characters that are not delimiters - they are # and &quot;. I think it is not necessary to write a page   for them, since their usage should be described in Integers and Strings pages. For the unused special characters, there is nothing to say beyond that they are unused. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:58, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Voting rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

Comments:

I would like to get some information about how much stuff is still being developed by the main FHSST group and what actual on-line colaboration can be done by users here with the WikiBooks community.  It seems as though this book should actually be a part of WikiSource instead, but I'm not sure.  The main page is encouraging people to join their group if you want to contribute, and not add content to the WikiBook side.  Is that correct?   If this is something that will be encouraged to be edited by the Wikibook community as a fork of what the FHSST group is doing, I wouldn't mind participating.  If not, then this nomination should be removed as it is not the nature of this Wikibook to get collaboration in this manner.
[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:03, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

&lt;b&gt;Response to Rob&lt;/b&gt;:
Hi Rob - you are partly right but as always things are more complicated than they seem. We (FHSST) are dedicated to
WikiBooks - its a great idea and I support the idea fully. A couple of points that have led to the current situation:

* we started (Oct 2002) before WikiBooks (mid 2003) existed so we had to come up with a collaborative solution
* we have a lot of content that isn't in wiki format - [http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst FHSST].
* the new syllabus in South Africa comes into force in 2006 so we have a deadline
* we spent many hours moving the Physics book onto WikiBooks (hours not developing content)
* we will move Maths and Chemistry over as well but we decided that we would benefit more from developing content right now 

Regarding our commitment to WikiBooks:
* we recently (this month) started two new books which we want to develop &lt;b&gt;solely&lt;/b&gt; on WikiBooks (Biology, Computer Literacy) and &lt;b&gt;any other books we start from now&lt;/b&gt; on will be done on WikiBooks
* we only ask people to join our external project because we have mailing lists where there is active discussion regarding the syllabus, structure and how we'll print books etc. so that efforts are coordinated and coherent
* we know from experience that if you have a specific objective (proper syllabus) you had better coordinate contributions

We don't insist that people join our project if they are going to contribute but encourage it because it helps us coordinate and write a book which meets a specific syllabus - quote from the Physics book: 
&lt;small&gt;&quot;Please consider joining the mainstream development group of FHSST to help get this text complete as fast as possible. We really want to provide a complete set of high school science texts that are freely available as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/small&gt; We are happy for anybody to add whatever they want to the Physics book on WikiBooks but what would really make a difference is the Optics and Heat and Properties of Matter  chapters as this would help us finish the book off.

Other books on WikiBooks that are developed by random volunteers suffer from a lack of cohesion and coordination. Talk pages and some vague guidelines haven't been able to streamline contributions and most books are developing incredibly slowly. The ones that are quite advanced tend to have been written by a single person (Botany, Cell Biology for example - not really the point of WikiBooks). We have also found that older volunteers who have been interested in helping have really struggled with the technology of contributing. Explaining what a wiki is to them is difficult (its easier than when we were using CVS for sure!). So its easier to work with them via email.

There is one issue that is never addressed on WikiBooks that I have seen - if we developed a book for the South African syllabus on WikiBooks and finished it, if you came back a month later you'd find that all the spelling would have been changed to American English and other such things. People (obviously with the best intentions) have already started &quot;fixing spelling mistakes&quot; in the Physics book. So WikiBooks as I see it will always just be a place for developing content and so the Physics book is there for the random volunteers who might add something useful to our cause or not. Ultimately a fixed edition will have to made available somewhere or tagged somehow, I haven't looked into this yet.

Everything we write will be given to the WikiBooks community to develop further or use to develop other books but right now its difficult because we need specific things to produce a printed text in South Africa.

I hope that something that I have written makes sense, I am very happy to continue discussing things and I am also keen on finding the best way to develop content. We have more books still to start. 

Basically how do you best get people to work together in a coordinated and coherent manner?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control Structures ==
=== Conditional Branches ===

Ruby can control the execution of code using Conditional branches. A conditional Branch takes the result of a test [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Lexicology#Expressions|expression]] and executes a block of code depending whether the test expression is true or false. If the test expression evaluates to the constant &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, the test is false; otherwise, it is true.  Note that the number &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; is considered true, whereas many other programming languages consider it false.

In many popular programming languages, conditional branches are statements.  They can affect which code is executed, but they do not result in values themselves.  In Ruby, however, conditional branches are expressions.  They evaluate to values, just like other expressions do.  An &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression, for example, not only determines whether a subordinate block of code will execute, but also results in a value itself.  If no block is executed, the if expression results in nil. For instance, the following &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression evaluates to 3:

  if true
    3
  end

Ruby's conditional branches are explained below.

==== if expression ====

Examples:

  a = 5
  if a == 4
    a = 7
  end
  print a # prints 5 since the if-block isn't executed

You can also put the test expression and code block on the same line if you use &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;:
  if a == 4 then a = 7 end
  #or
  if a == 4: a = 7 end
  #Note that the &quot;:&quot; syntax for if one line blocks do not work anymore in ruby 1.9. Ternary statements still work

This is equal to:

  a = 5
  a = 7 if a == 4
  print a # prints 5 since the if-block isn't executed

==== unless expression ====

The unless-expression is the opposite of the if-expression, the code-block it contains will only be executed if the test expression is false.

Examples:

  a = 5
  unless a == 4
    a = 7
  end
  print a # prints 7 since the unless-block is executed

The ''unless'' expression is almost exactly like a negated ''if'' expression:
  if !expression # is equal to using unless expression

The difference is that the ''unless'' does not permit a following ''elsif''.  And there is no ''elsunless''.

Like the if-expression you can also write:

  a = 5
  a = 7 unless a == 4
  print a # prints 7 since the unless-block is executed

The &quot;one-liners&quot; are handy when the code executed in the block is one line only.

==== if-elsif-else expression ====

The elsif (note that it's &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;elseif&lt;/code&gt;) and else blocks give you further control of your scripts by providing the option to accommodate additional tests.
The &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; blocks are considered only if the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; test is false.  You can have any number of &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; blocks but only one &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and one &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block.

Syntax:
  if expression
    ...code block...
  elsif another expression
    ...code block...
  elsif another expression
    ...code block...
  else
    ...code block...
  end

==== short-if expression (aka ternary operator) ====

The &quot;short-if&quot; statement provides you with a space-saving way of evaluating an expression and returning a value. 

The format is: 

  result = (condition) ? (expression-if-true) : (expression-if-false)

It is also known as the ternary operator and it is suggested to only use this syntax for minor tasks, such as string formatting, because of poor code readability that may result.

  irb(main):037:0&gt; true ? 't' : 'f'
  =&gt; &quot;t&quot;
  irb(main):038:0&gt; false ? 't' : 'f'
  =&gt; &quot;f&quot;

This is very useful when doing string concatenation among other things. 

Example:
  a = 5
  plus_or_minus = '+'
  print &quot;The number #{a}#{plus_or_minus}1 is: #{plus_or_minus == '+' ? (a+1).to_s : (a-1).to_s}.&quot;

Also, this can be written as:

  result = if condition then expression-1 else expression-2 end

Assignments can be made as:

  result = (value-1 if expression-1) || (value-2 if expression-2)

==== case expression ====
An alternative to the if-elsif-else expression (above) is the case expression.  Case in Ruby supports a number of syntaxes.  For example, suppose we want to determine the relationship of a number (given by the variable a) to 5.  We could say:

  a = 1
  case 
  when a &lt; 5 then puts &quot;#{a} is less than 5&quot;    
  when a == 5 then puts &quot;#{a} equals 5&quot;   
  when a &gt; 5 then puts &quot;#{a} is greater than 5&quot; 
  end

Note that, as with if, the comparison operator is ==.  The assignment operator is =.  Though Ruby will accept the assignment operator:

    when a = 5 then puts &quot;#{a} equals 5&quot;   # WARNING! This code CHANGES the value of a!

this is not want we want!  Here, we want the comparison operator.

A more concise syntax for case is to imply the comparison:

  case a
  when 0..4 then puts &quot;#{a} is less than 5&quot;    
  when 5 then puts &quot;#{a} equals 5&quot; 
  when 5..10 then puts &quot;#{a} is greater than 5&quot; 
  else puts &quot;unexpected value #{a} &quot;         # Just in case &quot;a&quot; is bigger than 10 or negative.
  end

Note: because the ranges are explicitly stated, it is a good coding practice to handle unexpected values of a.  This concise syntax is perhaps most useful when we know in advance what values to expect.  For example:

  a = &quot;apple&quot;
  case a
  when &quot;vanilla&quot; then &quot;a spice&quot;    
  when  &quot;spinach&quot; then &quot;a vegetable&quot; 
  when &quot;apple&quot; then &quot;a fruit&quot; 
  else &quot;an unexpected value&quot;
  end

If entered into IRB this gives:

  =&gt; &quot;a fruit&quot;

Other ways to use case and variations on its syntax may be seen at Linuxtopia Ruby Programming [http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/ruby_tutorial/Ruby_Expressions_Case_Expressions.html]

=== Loops ===

==== while ====
The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement in Ruby is very similar to &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and to other languages' &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; (syntactically):
 while &lt;expression&gt;
   &lt;...code block...&gt;
 end

The code block will be executed again and again, as long as the expression evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

Also, like &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt;, the following is possible:
 &lt;...code...&gt; while &lt;expression&gt;

Note the following strange case works...
  line = readline.chomp while line != &quot;what I'm looking for&quot;

So if local variable &lt;code&gt;line&lt;/code&gt; has no existence prior to this line, on seeing it for the first time it has the value &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; when the loop expression is first evaluated.

==== until ====
The &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; statement is similar to the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement in functionality. Unlike the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement, the code block for the &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; loop will execute as long as the expression evaluates to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
 until &lt;expression&gt;
   &lt;...code block...&gt;
 end

=== Keywords ===

==== return ====

&lt;code&gt; return value &lt;/code&gt; causes the method in which it appears to exit at that point and return the value specified

Note that if no return of a value is specified in a method the value of the last value set is implicitly returned as the return value of the method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hobbyist beekeeping does not fit one specific definition, though hobbyists tend to have many things in common. Essentially, those who keep bees as a hobby have a different day job, and simply find beekeeping or its related practices enjoyable.
Rarely do hobbyists keep as substantial number of colonies, often just enough to keep at home in the backyard or within a few minutes drive. Similarly to those who [[Beekeeping/Sideline Beekeeping| sideline]] in beekeeping, a hobbyist may sell products as result to beekeeping, but they rarely earn much more than the price to maintain their bees.

==Reasons To Keep Bees As a Hobby==
There are many reasons as to why a person may decide to pickup the task of hobby beekeeping. There are likely as many reasons as there are beekeepers. Either way, beekeeping as a hobby is a scarcity in today’s modern world, and generally only benefits are gained when one peruses such a task.
===The Joy of Honey===
[[Image:runny hunny.jpg|thumb|Honey]]
Often the number one reason people pickup beekeeping as a hobby is because of the potential to produce [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]]. Honey was one of the earliest, and remains one of the sweetest, commodities available to man. Because of the recent desire for a do-it-yourself attitude, many people have decided to make a step towards producing such a sweet reward within their own backyard.
===Pollination===
A second most popular reason to keep bees as a hobby is pollination. Many beekeepers also keep gardens. The simple act of keeping bees often enhances fruit and vegetable production because of all the pollination that the bees achieve.

===Entertainment===
Watching bees can be fun. A colony of bees, when observed form the outside, or even from the inside if you're lucky enough to have an [[Beekeeping/Observation Hive| observation hive]], holds the same kind of draw as watching an ant farm.
===Education===
Some times beekeepers start keeping bees as a project for a science fair, for the 4H club or other similar organization; this educational experience often evolves into beekeeping as a hobby. Many things can be learned from bees; in fact many things are still being learned. 
Those who enjoy the complex inter-workings of the world around them may find beekeeping to be an exceptionally educational experience.
===Stress Relief===
Some beekeepers keep their bees to take their mind off other things. Some even say that simply sitting down and watching the comings and goings of a hive is an extremely relaxing experience. Some have even been known to simply spend the entire afternoon observing the activities going on outside a single hive.

===Gifts===
Beekeepers often have access to goods and supplies, thanks to their bees, that many others do not. Because of this, a beekeeper is able to assemble wonderful gifts to give away during the holidays or for birthdays. These gifts may include various forms of honey, home made candles, cosmetics and such.

===Animal Husbandry===
Many people keep pets, whereas bees cannot be domesticated, the companionship is still often appreciated. Many hobbyist build a bond between themselves and their literally thousands of bees. This can make beekeeping a joyful experience when done right. 
===Healthy Life Style===
Some hobby beekeepers keep bees for their own health. Some keepers collect [[Beekeeping/Pollen| pollen]] to supplement their diet, [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] to make home medication and eat a diet with local [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]] to lower the effects of allergies. Though many of these processes have not been scientifically proven to be effective, beekeepers who practice them often swear by them.

==Related Hobbies==
Though beekeeping may seem innocent enough on its own, it can often lead to other related hobbies such as the following.
*Baking and [[Beekeeping/Food Recipes| Cooking]]
*[[Beekeeping/Candle Making| Candle Making]]
*Gardening
*Home [[Beekeeping/Cosmetic Formulas| cosmetics]] making
*Mentoring and Educating
*Retailing hive products
*Soap Making
*Wine and [[Beekeeping/Mead| Mead]] making
*[[Beekeeping/Building Hive Parts| Wood Working]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Software Application Management Overview =

Computer applications are created by human for Computers. This human and computer interaction can be abstracted
into following steps.

* Design the software for computers.
* Build the software on computers.
* Package the software for all kind of computers.
* Install/Remove the software from computers.

Last three activities can be divided into more detail steps as follows

* Software build process(SB):
** unpack source files
** patch source code
** configure source file for a particular OS
** compile souce codes to generate binary and documentation
** test the compiled binary if need to
** install the binaries into installation path
** uninstall the binaries

* Package build (PB) process is much straight forward:
** prepare the scripts to take care of preinstall, postinstall, preremove and postremove required actions.
** prepare initilization  script to start/stop application service 
** call up local PMS to pack the binary,documentation and scripts into local PMS format.

* Package Management (PKGUTIL) Process:
** upload and administrate packages on package depot server.
** install 
** remove
** upgrade/patch
** auto installation upon package dependence.

==  Acronyms: CPAD, CPAM, PMS, HPMS and TWW ==
&quot;The Written Words&quot; is to describe the cross-platofrm application developement and management activities performed by System administrators. &quot;The Written Words&quot; is an attempt to write down tasks performed into XML language. 

To provide a generic naming to describe activities, following acronyms are defined for easy reference. Also
this will leave room for other packaging methods like openpkg or Portage in gentoo.

* '''CPAD:''' '''C'''ross-'''P'''laform '''A'''pplication '''D'''evelopment, a solution to enable software application developement easily for man-made,incompatible and variated operating systems. X windows, Java,OpenStep and GNUstep are examples of solutions.

* '''CPAM:''' '''C'''ross-'''P'''latform '''A'''pplication '''M'''anagement, a solution to enable easy and consistent application management. TWW's HPMS is one of the solutions.

* '''HPMS:''' '''H'''brid '''P'''ackage '''M'''anagement '''S'''ystem. A wrapper solution that work with PMS to shield package developer from incompatible local PMS. It will allow package developer to consistently create and maintain software packages without knowing the details of each PMS when they don't need to.

* '''PMS:''' '''P'''ackage '''M'''anagement '''S'''ystem. A software system designed to create,build,install,remove and upgrade software in a packed format. Examples: RPM,dpkg,inst,lpp,portage,Installsield,HP SD-UX.

* '''PMS format:''' PMS Package Format. A file or directory to include a group of compiled binaries ,documenation or script file. This file is usually in compressed form and called as software package. With this work being done, a software package can be better maintained. Example formats:rpm,msi,ipk,pkgadd,depot and GNUstep's .app.

* '''TWW:''' '''T'''he '''W'''ritten '''W'''ord of wisdom to guide you through the maze of getting an open source software built and packaged. Better yet, the words are digitalized into a xml file that can be play back and repeated by others. 

* [http://www.thewrittenword.com '''TWW Inc:''']A company specialize in open source building and packaging to make opensource easier to use across different OS platforms.

== What is Package Management System ? ==
* Every modern OS come with a PMS(Package Management System). Because we went through the pains of not having one during the age of DOS. Adding software binaries into an OS without systematic packaging is proven to be not manageable.

Following ASCI diagram depict some OS and their PMS relationship. 
&lt;pre&gt;
       |--------------------------------------------|
       |Software|Software   | Software  |  Software |
       |--------------------------------------------|
PMS    |  RPM   |  PKGADD   |   MSI     | SD-UX     |
       ---------------------------------------------|
       | Linux  | Solaris   | Windows   | HP-UX     |
OS     |        |           |           |           |
       --------  ----------   -----------  ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What is Hybrid Package Management System ? ==
* Like hybrid car, it is hard to throw away old technology(burning gas in engine) and use new one(battery for electric motor) directly, Existing installed OS need a less intrusive, hybrid package management system to help us transit to new technology.
* To achieve best compatibility with existing deployed machines in an IT or Home computer environment, We need to create packages using native PMS as much as possible and use different installation path. Undo or removing existing application installation effort is usually cost prohibitive. The Written Word Inc. design and implement their HPMS for commercial open-source support. The tools can be used to package and administrate commercial packages that doesn't need to use native PMS directly. Examples are IBM/Rational's clearcase and Oracle database software. Using HPMS, we can install clearcase with &quot;pkg-inst clearcase-6.0&quot; or we can install a Oracle server using &quot;pkg-inst oracle-8.1.7&quot;   without using their installers directly.

* Following is a ascii diagram to illustrate a HPMS can work on top(hyper) of existing native PMS to build , package and manage software applications.
&lt;pre&gt;

       --------  ----------   -----------  ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What is HPMS ? ==
* Following is ASCII diagram to illustrate the os,pms and hpms relationships when creating a native package.

* When creating a software binary from source codes.
** On Linux with RPM PMS, you will need to use rpmbuild command to parse through configure and build section of instruction in package.spec file.
** On Oracle Solaris, you usually type make command to parse Makefile that contain instruction about source code and compiler options to build the binary.

* Go to http://www.thewrittenword.com/evaluate/
* On the right side of OS menu, click on the OS version you need
* Following the instruction on web page you clicked on.

== pkg-inst ==
pkg-inst install the packages. It will handle package dependency automatically. The automation is achieved by package dependency description in  pkg-db.xml on application repository server.
following example commands are the most usded ones.
# pkg-inst bash : This is a very simple syntax to install a package comparing to &quot;pkg-get -i bash&quot;, &quot;rpm -i bash&quot;.
# pkg-inst -N bash : -N is to do dry-run without install the actural package. a good way to see what is going to happened in advance.
# pkg-inst --tempdir=/tmp clearcase: /var is used by default to store downloaded package, we can specify other directory as temporary directory when /var/ is tool small to hold the package we want to install.

== pkg-rm ==
# pkg-rm bash : A simple syntax to remove  package comparing to &quot;pkg-get -d bash&quot;, &quot;rpm -e bash&quot;.
# pkg-rm -N bash : -N is to do dry-run without install the actural package. 
# pkg-rm  clearcase: /var is used by default to store downloaded package, we can specify other directory as temporary directory when /var/ is tool small to hold the package we want to install.

== pkg-info ==
# &quot;pkg-info bash&quot;
# &quot;pkg-info -N bash&quot; : -N is to do dry-run with out install the actual package. a good way to see what is going to happened in advance.
# &quot;pkg-info&quot;: find out what is available on applicaton repository server.

== Create the hello-world TWW package ==
In this tutorial, we will use tranditional hello world example to illustrate the digition of software package creation process.
Said, you read the news update from [http://www.stepwise.com stepwise] about [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2137.html TN2137] on configuring hello-world example from GNU to be a fatbinary execuatable which contains ppc and i386 binary code. 

We can increase the digitation degree more on tn3127 document by automate the process into hello-2.1.1/sb-db.xml. Once the process is digitized we can repeat the accurate result of achieving goals in tn3127. 

=== Flow chart of a TWW package creation ===
[[Image:CreatingTWWPackage.jpg|The flow chart diagram of TWW Cross-Platform Application Management System]]

Above diagram is the process of creating a TWW package and upload to application repository server.
# Install the TWW development tool.
# Create a package template from newtww.sh script.
# Build  the software by '''&quot;sb small-1.0.sb&quot;''' which will go through the following steps.
## '''sb -u hello-2.1.1.sb''' : unpack compressed source.
## '''sb -C hello-2.1.1.sb''' : configure the source tree to have fat binary.
## '''sb -B hello-2.1.1.sb''' : call up make command to build the source.
## '''sb -i hello-2.1.1.sb''' : install the binaries to installation directory.
## '''sb -t hello-2.1.1.sb''' : test the installed binaries on installed directory 
# '''pb -1 hello-2.1.1.pb''' will package the binaries in installation directory into native PMS format.
# We then turn the native PMS (Solaris pkgadd in this case) a zip file.
# Generate a MD5 sum file so have a way to make sure the integrity of the file.
# Upload the small-1.0.pkgadd.pkg-inst, small-1.0.pkgadd.pkg-inst.md5sum to package repository server.
# Add an entry in pkg-db.xml in package repository server.
# Package is now ready for retrieval by simple  &quot;pkg-inst hello&quot; command from  Solaris machine.

== Porting TWW HPMS to other OS ==

These are tasks  need to be done when porting TWW HPMS tools to other OS.
* Porting the TWW HPMS tool itself.
** sb need to add in new OS indentication code.
** pb need to have a new python module to deal with the new PMS.
* Porting the package sources.
** The packages source contain instruction for a particular OS. We need to add the new supported OS to the package source. 
* The makefile to automate the TWW tools porting. 
** Same as Makefile, each makefile contain instruction for a perticular OS, if a new OS is added then the Makefile need to be updated as well.

Hello,

thank you for your effort in [[Computer programming]]. However the texts are just a but off topic. The chapter in question is about learning languages and why a particular lanuguage makes a good (or prehaps bad) learning language. And what the language can teach you.

Look at Ada, C, C++ or Objective-C.

BTW: I seriously consider to remove i.E. the Perl and PHP texts since they say nothing about learning curve or paradigms available and they have been added anomymously so I can't ask the author the improve them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Finnish|^^Contents^^]] [[Finnish/Grammar-Vowel harmony |&lt;&lt;Grammar-Vowel harmony]] | '''Grammar-Suffixes''' |

----
Now the big part! In Finnish, like all Finno-Uralic languages, there are a huge series of suffixes to represent plurals, positions, postpositions (prepositions), pronouns and descriptions. They are grouped in to 4 groups of which there is a strict order, Group 1 which are plurals, Group 2 which are positions (2a) and postpositions (2b), Group 3 which are accusative pronuons (i.e. my, your...)   And Group 4 which are descriptions (i.e. also, too). To describe the suffixes easily the word '''auto''' (car) is used.

== Group 1: Plurals ==

The first group of suffixes are plurals, of which there are 3 different ways.

===-t===
You can pluralize many words by simply putting a &quot;'''t'''&quot; after the word:
*'''auto → auto''t''''' ;  car → cars
*'''kirja → kirja''t''''' ;  book → books


If there are &quot;'''kk'''&quot;, &quot;'''pp'''&quot;, or &quot;'''tt'''&quot; in a word in a similar way like those below, pluralize it in the following way:

* '''kukka → kuka''t''''' ;  flower → flowers
* '''hattu → hatu''t''''' ;  hat → hats


If a word has &quot;'''nk'''&quot; in a similar way like those below, pluralize in the following way:

* '''kenkä → kengät''' ;  shoe → shoes
* '''sanko → sangot''' ;  bucket → buckets
* '''henki → henget''' ;  spirit → spirits


If a word ends with a letter &quot;'''s'''&quot; like those below, pluralize it in the following way:

* '''varis → varikset''' ;  crow → crows
* '''tulos → tulokset''' ;  result → results


If a word ends with &quot;'''nen'''&quot; like those below, pluralize it in the following way:

* '''kukkanen → kukkaset''' ;  small flower → small flowers
* '''Virtanen''' → '''Virtaset''' ;

===-i (-j)===
To pluralise a word with another suffix you put an '''i''' in between the word and the suffix(es). If where there is a cluster of more than 2 vowels, then the '''i''' becomes a '''j'''
*'''autossani → auto''i''ssani''' in my car → in my cars
*'''autoa →  auto''j''a''' car → cars (partitive)

===-a===
When there is a number before the word to indicate an amount, you put an '''a''' after the word (in fact this is not a plural at all, but partitive: it is the number that takes the formal role of '''auto''' in the sentence, more about that later)
*'''auto →  kaksi auto''a''''' car → two cars
*'''autoni → kaksi auto''a''ni''' my car → my two cars

== Exercises ==

Answer to these exercises are at the end of the page.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(fg)= f\frac{dg}{dx} + g\frac{df}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \frac{g\frac{df}{dx} - f\frac{dg}{dx}}{g^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Trigonometric Functions==

= Topics Covered =
* Radiation Background ==
* “Dirty Bomb” ==
* Radioactive Waste / Nuclear Reactors ==
** Yucca Mountain ===
= Radiation =
= Basics of Radiation- Irradiation =
* Irradiation is exposure to penetrating radiation ==
** External irradiation does not make a person radioactive. ===
** External irradiation can damage tissue through direct or indirect means (generation of free radicals and H2O2 from ionization of water) ===
= Basics of Radiation- Contamination =
* Contamination occurs when material that contains radioactive atoms is deposited on skin, clothing, body cavities, wounds. May also damage tissue, but much more slowly than direct irradiation. ==
* Person contaminated with radioactive materials will be irradiated until the source of radiation (the radioactive material) is removed ==
= Basics of Radiation =
* Ionizing radiation is produced by unstable atoms (isotopes) which have an excess of energy or mass. ==
* Atoms give off, or emit, the excess energy or mass as radiation which collide with adjacent molecules and ionize (knock off electrons) ==
** electromagnetic ( gamma or x-rays)  ===
** particulate (i.e., mass given off with the energy of motion - beta and alpha radiation).  ===
= 4 types of ionizing radiation =
* Alpha- little penetration, easily stopped by skin and clothes, dangerous if ingested or inhaled. 20x more damaging than equivalent dose of beta or gamma. ==
* Beta- light penetration, may cause red “burn” on skin. ==
* Gamma- deep penetration, like x-rays. ==
* Neutrons- particles that also penetrate deeply and cause extensive damage. Seen only in nuclear bombs. ==
* All types of radiation cause damage to DNA of cells. Most vulnerable tissues are heme, GI and reproductive systems. ==
= Biological Effects of Radiation =
* Stochastic- effects that are also seen in unexposed individuals, but are increased in frequency with radiation exposure (trigger effect). Not all individuals exposed will get effect. Severity is independent of dose. ==
** Examples include cancer, mental retardation in exposed fetus, genetic damage. ===
= Biological Effects of Radiation =
* Non-stochastic effects- threshold dose, predictable causal relationship with dose related severity in all individuals exposed. ==
** Sterility, skin burns, cataracts, hemopoietic damage, GI and CNS damage. ===
= Radiation Physics for Dummies =
* Absorbed dose = energy/mass=joule/kg ==
* 1 Roentgen=1 rad ==
* 100 rad= 1Grey(Gy). ==
* Dose equivalent=energy/mass x (strength of type of radiation). Alpha is 20x. ==
* 1 rad of gamma is 1 rem ==
* 			BUT ==
* 1 rad of alpha is 20 rem ==
* 100 rem = 1 Seivert (Sv) ==
= Radiation Physics for Dummies =
* Natural radioactivity - 40 mrem/year. ==
* Air travel NYC-London- 4 mrem ==
* CXR- 10 mrem ==
* National Council of Radiation Protection ==
** 5 rem/yr (50 mSv) =annual exposure limit of radiation workers ===
** 0.5 rem (500 mrem or 5 mSv) = max annual exposure to layperson = 50 CXR. ===
= Radiation Physics for Dummies =
* 50 rem is max single dose recommended for a first responder acting in a life saving situation ==
** No risk of Acute Radiation Sickness ===
** 1-4% estimated increase in Ca risk. ===
* In this case, rem = rad, since workers in this situation will be wearing PPE, so gamma is only radiation that will penetrate. ==
= Biological Effects of Radiation =
* Sterility- 30 rads in men, 300 rads in women. More exposure leads to longer effect. Usually temporary ==
* 100 rads  = N/V ==
* 200 rads = Cataracts, Hemopoietic syndrome ==
* 300  = skin erythema ==
* 400 rads = usually fatal ARS due to heme depression. ==
* 1,000 rads = GI syndrome → FATAL. ==
* 2,000 rads = CNS syndrome → FATAL ==

= “Dirty Bomb” FAQ =
= What is a “Dirty Bomb”? =
* A conventional explosive packaged with radioactive material that scatters when the bomb goes off. ==
* Could be a small device, or as big as a truck bomb ==
= How does a Dirty Bomb do harm? =
* Initial blast of the conventional explosive ==
* Airborne radiation and contamination ==
= Only nuclear experts can make one, right? =
* Nope, requires not much more expertise than it takes to make a conventional bomb ==
= So why aren’t we all dead? =
* The hard part is acquiring the radioactive material, not building the bomb. ==
* There are reports that suggest organizations, such as Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda, probably have radioactive contaminants such as strontium 90 and cesium 137, which could be used to make a dirty bomb, and have succeeded in manufacturing a small dirty bomb ==
= Why else aren’t we all dead? =
* A dirty bomb is not a nuclear weapon ==
* 	(nuclear weapons involve a complex nuclear-fission reaction and are thousands of times more devastating) ==
= So do we have to worry? =
* Yes, dirty bombs are WMD’s but… ==
* More for their capacity to cause terror and disruption than inflicting heavy casualties. ==
** Panic over radioactivity ===
** Evacuation measures ===
** Area struck would be off-limits for at least several months—possibly years—for cleanup efforts ===
= Acme Radioactive Materials, on sale for 3 payments of $9.99? =
* Radioactive materials for military, industrial, or medical applications:  e.g. weapons-grade plutonium or uranium, freshly spent nuclear fuel ==
** the most deadly ===
** the most difficult to obtain  ===
** Medical supplies such as radium or certain cesium isotopes used in cancer treatments could be used ===
*less dangerous
*A measuring cup’s worth of radioactive material would be needed, but such small amounts would be unlikely to cause severe harm, especially if over a wide area.
= Dirty Bomb- Summary =
* Explosion and trauma, moderate dispersal of radioactive debris, imbedded fragments, very little irradiation ==
= Yucca Mountain =
* http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov ==
= Location =
* Nye County, Nevada, ~100 miles NW of Las Vegas ==
* Remote desert on federally protected land ==
* Within secure boundaries of the Nevada Test Site. ==
= What is Yucca Mountain? =
* A site slated by the federal gov’t to store all nuclear waste from power plants, weapons program, etc. ==
= Currently =
= Why Yucca Mtn? =
* Remote ==
* Dry climate ==
* Stable geology ==
* Deep water table ==
* Closed water basin ==
= How do we get the stuff to Yucca? =
* Nat’l experience to date ==
** 2,700 shipments ===
** 1.6 million miles ===
** 30 years; ===
** → No harmful release of radiation ===
* Similar to Europe’s safety record- travel shorter distances, but more densely populated ==
= Transportation of Nuclear Waste =
* Highly regulated ==
* DOT and NRC regulations ==
** Containers ===
** Advance route approvals ===
*Each state’s governor can specify
*Local trained emergency response teams (34 states)
** Escorts ===
** 24-hr satellite surveillance ===
= Scenario  =
* A shipment to Yucca Mountain goes flying off an elevate section of the FDR ==
* FDNY calls to confirm this and informs you that you will be getting 5 victims. ==
* Soon after this 6 ambulatory patients with minor injuries show up. EMS soon brings 2 critically injured patients and 5 patients with compound fractures. ==
* What is the most important next step in addition to mobilizing the mass casualties’ disaster plan? ==
* In any explosion consider a “dirty bomb”. ==
** So, radiation detection device required ===
* Screen background radiation.  If &gt; 2x → contaminated. ==
* For gross screening, may be able to use the radiation detection monitor used to monitor radioactive waste from the hospital. ==
= LUDLUM M-3
SURVEY METER =
* PPE with an N95 respirator, coveralls/gloves, and eye shields should be worn by personnel treating patients  ==
* PAPR’s and full Decon suits are overkill, unless suspect simultaneous chemical contamination! ==
* If life saving treatment is done without PPE (personal protective equipment), providers will need to be screened, change clothes and shower as well. ==
* Personal electronic dosimeters should be worn as soon as available ==
* The detection device confirms that all these patients are contaminated. DOE sends out word that Cesium 137 has been confirmed as the radioactive agent. No other toxic substances are identified. ==
* What are the next steps? ==
* Tendency is to run away from these victims out of fear of suffering harm to oneself. Wrong and unethical. ==
* Treatment of the LIFE-THREATENING traumatic injuries should take place ASAP, even before decon is done. ==
* Should don quick respiratory, eye and contact protection as in routine trauma. ==
* IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A LIVING PATIENT TO BE SO CONTAMINATED AS TO POSE AN IMMEDIATE HEALTH THREAT TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS.  ==
* This is in direct contrast to chemical contamination situations, where there is indeed an immediate hazard to health care providers. ==
* That being said, non-life-threatening injuries will allow time for screening for radioactivity to take place. Remember, radioactive particles are PARTICLES, and can be washed and stopped by PPE (thin Tyvek suits with hoods, gloves, and respiratory face protection and eye shields).  ==
* If mixed chemical/radiologic incident is suspected, then treat as a chemical incident with greater PPE consideration. ==
* All victims must be screened for radiation. Those that test positive will need to be decontaminated. ==
* In the meantime, you will need to treat the most severely injured.  ==
= Decontamination =
* All victims need nasal swabs to assess degree of exposure &lt;i&gt;prior to showering&lt;/i&gt;. Best if done &lt;1 hour after exposure. ==
* Treat the immediate victims first, then shower them (on gurneys).  ==
* All others can be showered, screened, and then treated. ==
= Decontamination =
* Due to inhalation or ingestion, some victims may not be totally decontaminated. Admitted to special isolation rooms as determined by hospital administration and Radiation Safety Officer. ==
* Radiation may not be detected externally even if ingestion has occurred (hence the nasal swabs, and save body secretions is important) ==
= Treatment =
*All victims should have nasal swabs done to assess degree of exposure.
*Urine, feces, vomitus should be collected as well, with names and times labeled.
*Assess samples for radioactivity.
*Internal decontamination may be necessary
= Treatment- internal decontamination =
* Potassium iodide- to protect thyroid if I 131 is suspected ==
* gastric lavage within 1-2 hrs. until fluid is , 2x background radiation. ==
* Antacids (AlOH, MgCO3) reduce GI uptake ==
* Dulcolex or fleet’s phosphosoda cathartic enemas. ==
= Treatment =
* Vomiting- use 5-HT3 blockers (Zofran, Anzemet) ==
* Draw blood for CBC, ALC, HLA, and Chromosome analysis in consultation with hematology. ==
* CBC with an absolute lymphocyte count should be done. A drop of 50% in 24-48 hours has prognostic significance. ==
* Consider anti viral and antibacterial prophylaxis in consultation with ID. ==
* Isolation if pancytopenia is a risk. ==
= Treatment =
* Prostaglandin (misoprostol) analogues in consultation with GI may prevent GI bleed. ==
* Colony stimulating factor may help those at risk for pancytopenia. ==
* DTPA-chelates plutonium and other transuranic elements ==
* Prussian blue- chelates thallium and cesium ==
* Consult Nuclear Medicine as well for general management. ==
= Treatment =
* Amifostine- free radical scavenger, protective of cell membranes and DNA. ==
* Clinically used to offset mucositis of RT. ==
* Side effects- n/v, hypotension. ==
* Protective pre exposure, may be valuable for first responders (and us!). ==
* Post exposure not shown to help ==
= Great websites =
* www.orau.gov ==
* www.CDC.gov ==
* www.gnyha.org ==
= Questions? =
= Acute radiation sickness =
* ARS results from direct exposure to radiation from either particles or beams. ==
* Initially N/V ==
* More severe exposure → diarrhea, shock, and AMS ==
* Advanced symptomatic state from radiation exposure alone → unlikely to survive.  But, can be difficult to distinguish from trauma related symptoms if an explosion has occurred. ==
= In absence of injury =
* Acute Radiation Sickness – 4 phases: ==
** Prodromal phase-nausea /vomiting or no symptoms. ===
** Latent phase –recovery  ===
** Manifest Illness phase- heme (anemia, infection), GI sloughing, bleeding and fluid loss. ===
** Recovery or death. ===

[[Image:Zizania palustris macro.jpg|right|thumb|Wild rice grains]]

Despite the name, '''wild rice''' is not [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. It is a seed native to the Great Lakes region of North America. Compared to other grains, wild rice is highly nutritious. The seeds are purple-tinted black, 1/3 to 1/2 inch long, and about 1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter.

==Copyright==
The cookbook is not a place for you to violate copyright. Hire a lawyer if you need legal advice, but anyway: In the USA, you can get by with ''fully'' rewriting the procedure in your own words. The actions of the procedure and the ingredient list can only be subject to patent, not copyright. Patented recepes are extremely rare. Note that Europe is in general stricter about this; merely rewriting the procedure might not do the job. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:56, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
:Ha. Thanks for the advice! I was not aware of the &quot;procedural rewrite&quot; way of getting around copyright. That is what I had suspected, but was unsure. I prefer to create a recipe from a variety of sources, though, just as I would any other article. I'm not sure what recipe you're talking about, but you must be wrong. The only recipe I've copied directly from a source was from ''The Grand Union Cookbook'', which is over 100 years old, and thus (I assume) falls safely into public domain. Any other recipes were my own creation. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 18:42, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

== Pickle ==

Please show me an example of a recipe that:
#should link to [[Cookbook:Pickle]] instead of [[Cookbook:Pickling]] (explain why)
#means anything other than pickled cucumebers

Note that [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]] are best linked as I just did, because &quot;pickled&quot; is not a noun.

It's to your benefit that [[Cookbook:Pickle]] be primarily about pickled cucumbers, so that you can correctly interpret all the American recipes that specify &quot;pickle&quot;.
:Whew! Well, I tried to address all of the meanings of pickle, while making it crystal clear that if a recipe calls for a &quot;pickle&quot; just exactly which one it is. I melded the edits from you and [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] with some of my own stuff, along with a usage note for recipe writers. I hope everybody's happy with it. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 07:51, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

== bonito flakes ==

I couldn't find a perfect match for you to look at, though I have seen it in person. The bonito flakes I bought in San Francisco's &quot;Japan Town&quot; area were not as long and bacon-like as these, and the cedar bedding chips I've used were a bit more red. (the lighting might be the cause of the minor color difference though) Notice how both images have light and dark parts. Only the smell is really different. Here, see for yourself:

* http://www.medaille.edu/vmacer/120_graphic_16bedding_cedar.jpg
* http://www.gastronews.cz/pictures/poradna/2004-05-05_BONITO%20FLAKES.jpg

So, isn't it helpful to describe the bonito flakes as looking like cedar bedding material? Consider the person who has never seen it before, and who might want to search for it in a Japanese market. If they know to look for a bag full of what appears to be rodent bedding, they'll have no trouble.

BTW, mackeral flakes look like pine bedding.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:35, 12 May 2005 (UTC)
:What. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 15:56, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

== capitalization ==

I noticed that you've taken a bunch of pages in &quot;Title Case&quot; and redirected them to normal &quot;Wiki case&quot;. Since most of our pages are in title case already, I think it would be prudent to try to get consensus from other contributors before redirecting a ton of things to different cases. In [[Cookbook:Policy]] I noted this with respect to naming. There was also an argument/discussion between Albert and some other contributors about this in the past... I think there might be archives of this from [[Talk:Cookbook]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:47, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

== Cannabis ==

You changed [[Cookbook:Cannabis]] to say that marijuana was physically addictive, which is inaccurate. At best, addictiveness is highly disputed, and at &quot;worst&quot; it's not physically addictive. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:17, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:That wasn't me...I wrote that addiction was &quot;a common myth&quot;, but I didn't try to present it as a fact. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 20:47, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
::Oh wow. I just totally misread (several times) that as &quot;a common myth is that cannabis is '''not''' physically addictive&quot;. Sorry sorry sorry sorry. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:57, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

== Thank you for fighting vandalism ==

Thanks for your help in fighting vandalism. One suggestion I have is that next time you use the &quot;move&quot; tab to move a page back to its original location. This will preserve the edit history of the vandalised page. Thanks again, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:24, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

*Okay, I was wondering about that. Thanks! [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 01:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== What's up with the Japanese History Book? ==

Hiya, I was just wondering what's happening to the Japenese history book. I've noticed you've done quite a bit of work on it and I'm thinking of having a go at it. I'm really just wondering if anyone's still actively working on it or something. [[User:WietsE|WietsE]] 12:02, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
:I'm not actively working on it. At least, not now. I just put up all my notes from Japanese Culture &amp; Civilization class. (That's why it's so scattered and spotty.) I may get back to it later, or not. So, please, just roll up your sleeves and dive in anywhere! [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 22:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC) 
::Cheers. I have actually just jumped into another book! If you're getting back into it and need some help at some point give me a shout though! [[User:WietsE|WietsE]] 18:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== [[Satanism]] ==

Hi - just looking at recent changes I see this one.  As it stands it does not seem to be a &quot;text book&quot;.   What is your target audience for the book and how do you see it being used as a text book by folk.  Thanks &amp; regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
::Correct. It is the ''beginning'' of a textbook. I saw it in the requests, and decided to give it a go. It would be used in a class on alternative religions.

::On what grounds? I know it's considered a &quot;joke religion&quot;, but that alone doesn't make it an invalid topic for study. I think this should be decided by numbers and influence; otherwise you have to A) argue about what constitutes a &quot;real&quot; religion, or B) let any nut with a cult make a wikibook about it. I would argue that if you look at [[w:Subgenius|Wikipedia's article]], the church has been around for quite some time, and has accumulated a decent following. If not worthy of study as a religion, it is definitely worthy of study as a countercultural movement. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 15:31, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

::::Heh...I admit this can be a tricky subject. Once WikiBooks becomes popular enough, I'm sure there'll be all kinds of people trying to start a book on their faith-of-choice. But they run into the same problem that, say, the Multi-Level Marketing guys get on Wikipedia...the price of exposure is criticism. Some of this stuff's easy. &quot;Flying Spaghetti Monsterism&quot;?! Give me a break. Entertaining, yes. But not a WikiBook. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 15:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Astronomy]] ==

Thanks for your interest in [[Astronomy]]. It's great to see someone really contributing.

If you're interested in working more on the project, I'm happy to send you some old textbooks to use as reference. (Do remember the copyright policy, though.) Also, if there's anything else I can do to be of help, let me know.

Thanks again, and hope to see more of you. Brian Brondel 20:46, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
:Cool! Well, I've got a bunch of notes and a workbook to go through, still...Once I get through all those, I may be burnt out on the subject. I'll let you know if I'm still interested at that point. Thanks for the offer! [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 23:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Cookbook:Khagina]] ==

G'day, I just found out via a quick Google that this recipe is very likely a copyright violation. Please don't change any text on this page until this is sorted out (you and I have both been at it, we even had an edit conflict!)

== [[US Pop Culture]] ==

Hi - while I'm sure it could be one I don't see this as a &quot;textbook&quot; at present.

== Economics books ==

Hey, I saw you are fairly active with the advertising book, and I was wondering if there are any other editors semi-active with other economics books. [[User:Smmurphy|Smmurphy]] 17:44, 5 June 2007 (UTC)
:I really have no idea. I started the [[Advertising]] book because I had a bunch of notes from a class I had taken. I have no idea about the other books. My classes were in Communications, so I've studied copywriting and advertising. I don't know much about economics. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 20:13, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Avoid generic names for book project ==
For instance [[Kexi]] could be better label as &quot;Database management with Kexi&quot; (or something that better describes the scope of the book project).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:03, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks! I wondered about that, but wasn't sure about naming conventions (e.g. the GIMP book is just called &quot;[[GIMP]]&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
In sociology, a '''group''' is usually defined as a number of people who identify and interact with one another. This is a very broad definition, as it includes groups of all sizes, from [[w:dyad|dyads]] to whole societies.  While an [[w:aggregate|aggregate]] comprises merely a number of individuals, a group in sociology exhibits cohesiveness to a larger degree. Aspects that members in the group may share include: interests, values, ethnic/linguistic background, [[w:role|roles]] and kinship. One way of determining if a collection of people can be considered a group is if individuals who belong to that collection use the self-referent pronoun &quot;we;&quot; using &quot;we&quot; to refer to a collection of people often implies that the collection thinks of itself as a group. Examples of groups include: families, companies, circles of friends, clubs, local chapters of fraternities and sororities, and local religious congregations.

[[Image:US Secret Service officers.jpg|right|200 px|thumb|A law enforcement official is a social category, not a group. However, law enforcement officials who all work in the same station and regularly meet to plan their day and work together would be considered part of a group.]]

Collections of people that do not use the self-referent pronoun &quot;we&quot; but share certain characteristics (e.g., roles, social functions, etc.) are different from groups in that they usually do not regularly interact with each other nor share similar interests or values. Such collections are referred to as ''categories'' of people rather than groups; examples include: police, soldiers, millionaires, women, etc.

Individuals form groups for a variety of reasons. There are some rather obvious ones, like reproduction, protection, trade, and food production. But [[w:social categorization|social categorization]] of people into groups and categories also facilitates behavior and action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogg2003&quot;&gt;Hogg, Michael A. Social Categorization, Depersonalization, and Group Behavior. Hogg, Michael A. and Tindale, Scott, Editors. Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Group Processes. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers; 2003; pp. 56-85.&lt;/ref&gt; An example may help explain this idea:

:Suppose you are driving somewhere in a car when you notice red lights flashing in your rearview mirror. Because you have been [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|socialized]] into society, you know that the red lights mean you should pull over, so you do.  After waiting for a minute or two, an individual in a uniform walks toward your car door. You roll down your window and the individuals asks you for your &quot;license and registration.&quot;  

Because groups and categories help facilitate social behavior, you know who this individual is: a member of a law enforcement category like the [[w:police|police]] or [[w:highway patrol|highway patrol]].  In all likelihood, you do not have to question this individual as to why they are driving a special car with lights on it, why they are wearing a uniform, why they are carrying a gun, or why they pulled you over (you may ask why they pulled you over, but doing so often increases the likelihood they'll give you a ticket).  In short, because you recognize that the individual driving the car belongs to a specific social category (or group), you can enter this interaction with a body of knowledge that will help guide your behavior.  You do not have to learn how to interact in that situation every single time you encounter it.  Social categorization of people into groups and categories is a [[w:heuristic|heuristic]] device that makes social interaction easier.

==Social Identity Theory==
'''Social identity''' is a theory developed by [[w:Henri Tajfel|Henri Tajfel]] and [[w:John Turner|John Turner]] to understand the psychological basis of intergroup [[w:discrimination|discrimination]]. As developed by Tajfel, Social Identity Theory is a diffuse but interrelated group of social psychological theories concerned with when and why individuals identify with, and behave as part of, social groups, adopting shared attitudes to outsiders. It is also concerned with what difference it makes when encounters between individuals are perceived as encounters between group members. Social Identity Theory is thus concerned both with the psychological and sociological aspects of group behavior.  According to Tajfel and Turner, social identities are composed of three elements.
  
===Categorization===  
We categorize objects in order to understand them, in a very similar way we categorize people (including ourselves) in order to understand the social environment. We use social categories like black, white, Australian, Christian, Muslim, student, and busdriver because they are useful. If we can assign people to a category then that tells us things about those people.  Without an understanding of people's groups and categories, we would have a very difficult time functioning in society. Similarly, we find out things about ourselves by knowing what categories we belong to. We define appropriate behaviour by reference to the norms of groups we belong to, but you can only do this if you can tell who belongs to your group. 

===Identification===
We identify with groups that we perceive ourselves to belong to. Identification carries two meanings. Part of who we are is made up of our group memberships. That is, sometimes we think of ourselves as &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; or &quot;we&quot; vs. &quot;they&quot;, and at other times we think of ourselves as &quot;I&quot; vs. &quot;he or she&quot; or &quot;me&quot; vs. &quot;him or her&quot;. In other words, sometimes we think of ourselves as group members and at other times we think of ourselves as unique individuals. This varies situationally, so that we can be more or less a group member, depending upon the circumstances. What is crucial for our purposes is that thinking of yourself as a group member and thinking of yourself as a unique individual are both parts of your self-concept. The first is referred to as social identity, the latter is referred to as personal identity. In social identity theory, group membership is not something foreign which is tacked onto the person, it is a real, true and vital part of the person. Our groups make up part of who we are.

The other meaning implied by the concept of identity is the idea that we are, in some sense, the same, or identical to other people. This should not be misinterpreted, when we say that we are the same, we mean that for some purposes we treat members of our groups as being similar to ourselves in some relevant way. To take the most extreme example, in some violent conflict such as a war, the members of the opposite group - the [[w:Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] - are treated as identical and completely different to the those people in your group - the [[w:ingroup|ingroup]] - which is made up of distinct individuals.  Thinking about individuals in one's outgroup in such a fashion allows the individual to believe that the enemy is deserving of death by dehumanizing them (more on this below). Treating people this way allows us to justify otherwise unjustifiable behavior.

===Comparison===
A positive self-concept is a part of normal psychological functioning. There is pretty good evidence that to deal effectively with the world we need to feel good about ourselves. The idea of social comparison is that in order to evaluate ourselves we compare ourselves with similar others. We often gain self-esteem by comparing ourselves with others in our group, particularly if we can claim membership in a prestigious group. The prestige of a group is also often created through comparisons that positively reflect on the group.  In other words, people in groups choose to compare their groups with other groups in ways that reflect positively on themselves. In fact, people are motivated to see their own group as relatively better than similar (but inferior) groups (i.e., [[w:positive distinctiveness|positive distinctiveness]]). Inversely, people in a group may minimize differences between their group and another, slightly more prestigious group so one's own group tends to be seen more favorably (i.e., [[w:negative distinctiveness|negative distinctiveness]]). 

Groups choose dimensions for comparison in order to maximize the positivity of their own group. Groups which perceive themselves to be of high status on particular dimensions will choose those as the basis of comparison. Groups of low status will minimize differences on those dimensions or choose new dimensions. For example, people from some Middle Eastern Islamic countries might regard their country as inferior to the West in terms of economic and technological advancement but might regard their way of life as being morally superior.

Intriguingly, the notion that inferior or &quot;underdog&quot; groups are hyper-motivated to succeed against superior groups turns out not to be true, generally.  Members of a group or team will actually work harder when they are competing against a lower ranked group than when they are competing against a higher-ranked group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettit2010&quot;&gt;Pettit, Nathan C., Kevyn Yong, and Sandra E. Spataro. 2010. Holding Your Place: Reactions to the Prospect of Status Gains and Losses. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. 46, 2:396-401.&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes sense when framed as a status issue: the superior group has more to lose if it is defeated by an inferior team while the inferior team, if it loses, has not lost anything but rather has affirmed the existing social order.  Thus, members of higher status groups work harder when competing against lower status groups.

==Primary and Secondary Groups==
[[File:1975family.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This family from the 1970s would be an example of a primary group.]]

In sociology we distinguish between two types of groups based upon their characteristics.  A '''Primary group''' is typically a small social group whose members share close, personal, enduring relationships.  These groups are marked by concern for one another, shared activities and culture, and long periods of time spent together.  The goal of primary groups is actually the relationships themselves rather than achieving some other purpose. Families and close friends are examples of primary groups

[[Image:Ian Mackenzie High School Classroom.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A class of students is generally considered a secondary group.]]

'''Secondary groups''' are large groups whose relationships are impersonal and goal-oriented. Some secondary groups may last for many years, though most are short term. Such groups also begin and end with very little significance in the lives of the people involved. People in a secondary group interact on a less personal level than in a primary group. Rather than having as the goal the maintenance and development of the relationships themselves, these groups generally come together to accomplish a specific purpose. Since secondary groups are established to perform functions, people’s roles are more interchangeable. Examples of secondary groups include: classmates in a college course, athletic teams, and co-workers.

The distinction between primary and secondary groups was originally proposed by [[w:Charles Horton Cooley|Charles Horton Cooley]].  He labeled groups as &quot;primary&quot; because people often experience such groups early in their life and such groups play an important role in the development of [[w:personal identity|personal identity]].  Secondary groups generally develop later in life and are much less likely to be influential on one's identity.

==Group Influence==
The primary reason sociologists study groups is because of their power over individuals. A large body of research suggests that group membership strongly shapes the everyday behavior of individuals.  Following are some of the many ways groups shape individual level behavior.

===Conformity===
[[Image:Asch experiment.png|thumb|200px|An example of the types of cards used in the Solomon Asch line experiments.]]

If you've ever done something in a group that you would not do if you were alone, it's likely that you experienced conformity; your attitudes, beliefs, and/or behaviors were influenced by other people.  One of the most well-known illustrations of conformity is [[w:Solomon Asch|Solomon Asch's]] [[w:Asch conformity experiments|conformity experiments]]. The experiment was set up as follows: 

Research participants would enter a room and sit at a table with several other people (who were [[w:confederates|confederates]], meaning they were actually helping with the research).  The participant and confederates would be shown one card that had a reference line and another card that had three comparison lines. Subjects were required to select the comparison line that corresponded in length to the reference line. 

This seems like a relatively straightforward task.  However, choosing the correct line becomes much more difficult when the confederates choose the wrong answer.  Why?  Because of our tendency to conform to those around us.  Thus, when Asch has the confederates choose the wrong answer, participants also chose the wrong line 37% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asch1956&quot;&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority. Psychological Monographs, 70 (Whole no. 416).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asch1951&quot;&gt;Asch, S. E. (1951). Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgment. In H. Guetzkow (ed.) Groups, leadership and men. Pittsburgh, PA: Carnegie Press. &lt;/ref&gt;  How do you think you would respond in such a situation?

Jason Chein and Laurence Steinberg have illustrated why people in groups are more likely to take risks (one form of conforming) using functional magnetic resonance imaging: the presence of peers heightens the benefits that result from risky decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chein2010&quot;&gt;Chein, Jason, Dustin Albert, Lia O’Brien, Kaitlyn Uckert, and Laurence Steinberg. 2010. “Peers increase adolescent risk taking by enhancing activity in the brain’s reward circuitry.” Developmental Science no.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants in their research remained aware of the risks, but their brains exhibited heightened sensitivity to the benefits of succeeding. Thus, the presence of peers can facilitate risky behavior as it makes the reward more meaningful. 

===Social Facilitation===
[[File:Hpv-race.jpg|right|thumb|200px|People often perform their best when competing with others, like in races, as a result of social facilitation.  This is just one illustration of the influence of groups on individuals.]]
Social facilitation is the tendency for people to be aroused into better performance on simple tasks (or tasks at which they are expert or that have become autonomous) when under the eye of others,&lt;ref name=&quot;Triplett1898&quot;&gt;Triplett, N. (1898). The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition. American Journal of Psychology, 9, 507-533.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than while they are alone (i.e., the '''audience effect'''), or when competing against another (i.e., the '''coactor effect''').&lt;ref name=&quot;Zajonc1965&quot;&gt;Zajonc, R. B. (1965). Social facilitation. Science, 149, 269-274.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex tasks (or tasks at which people are not skilled), however, are often performed in an inferior manner in such situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cottrell1968&quot;&gt;Cottrell, N.B., Wack, D.L., Sekerak, G.J., &amp; Rittle, R.M. (1968). Social facilitation of dominant responses by the presence of an audience and the mere presence of others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 9, 245-250.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been demonstrated in a variety of species. In humans, it is strongest among those who are most concerned about the opinions of others, and when the individual is being watched by someone he or she does not know, or cannot see well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bond1983&quot;&gt;Bond, Charles F., Titus, L. J. (1983). Social facilitation: a meta-analysis of 241 studies. Psychological Bulletin. 94(2), Sep 1983, 265-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Loafing===
'''Social loafing''' refers to the phenomenon that can occur when people in a group make less of an effort to achieve a goal than they would working alone. As a result of social loafing, groups can sometimes generate less total output than the combined performance of their members working as individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karau1993&quot;&gt;Karau, S. J. &amp; Williams, K. D. (1993). Social loafing: A meta-analytic review and theoretical integration. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65'', 681-706.&lt;/ref&gt; Social loafing results from a lack of motivation when working in a group because individuals do not believe their specific contribution will be evaluated. As a result, they do not put in as much effort as they otherwise would.  Social loafing is pervasive, but it does not occur when group members feel that their task or the group itself is important.example: CR7&lt;ref name=&quot;Karau1993&quot;/&gt;

===Deindividuation===
'''Deindividuation''' refers to the phenomenon of relinquishing one's sense of [[w:identity|identity]], self-awareness, or evaluation apprehension. This can happen as a result of becoming part of a [[w:group|group]] that fosters obedience to group norms rather than an individual's norms, such as an [[w:army|army]] or [[w:mob|mob]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullen1986&quot;&gt;Mullen, B. 1986. Atrocity as a function of lynch mob composition: A self-attention perspective. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 13, 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Once this happens, individuals no longer think about themselves before they act and may, in fact, be unaware of their own actions.  

Deindividuation can have quite destructive effects, like increasing the odds someone will commit a crime&lt;ref name=&quot;Diener1976&quot;&gt;Diener, E., Fraser, S. C., Beaman, A. L. and Kelem, R. T. (1976). Effects of deindividuation variables on stealing among Halloween trick-or-treaters. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33(2), 178-183.&lt;/ref&gt;, engaging in violence,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diener1976-2&quot;&gt;Diener, E. (1976). Effects of prior destructive behavior, anonymity, and group presence on deindividuation and aggression. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33, 497-507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Silke2003&quot;&gt;Silke, A. (2003). Deindividuation, anonymity, and violence: Findings from Northern Ireland. Journal of Social Psychology, 143, 493-499&lt;/ref&gt; or even over-enforce the law, such as police in riot situations.

===Group Polarization===
'''Group polarization''' refers to the finding that after participating in a discussion group, members tend to advocate more extreme positions and/or call for riskier courses of action than individuals who did not participate in any such discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscovici1969&quot;&gt;Moscovici, S., &amp; Zavalloni, M. (1969). The group as a polarizer of attitudes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 12, 125-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jury selection - Faulk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Juries can be influenced by group polarization, leading to more extreme punitive damage awards.]]

Group polarization results from two primary mechanisms: social comparison and informational influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Isenberg1986&quot;&gt;Isenberg, Daniel J. 1986. &quot;Group Polarization: A Critical Review and Meta-Analysis,&quot; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50 (6), 1141-1151.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[w:Social comparison|Social comparison]] refers to the drive of individuals to appear socially desirable. [[w:Informational_Social_Influence|Informational social influence]] occurs when a person is in a situation where he or she is unsure of the correct way to behave.  In such situations, that person will often look to others for cues concerning the correct behavior. When &quot;we conform because we believe that other's interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronson2005&quot;&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M. (2005). Social Psychology (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; it is informational social influence.

Group polarization has been used to explain the decision-making of [[w:jury|juries]], particularly when considering [[w:punitive damages|punitive damages]] in a civil trial. Studies have shown that after deliberating together, mock jury members often decided on punitive damage awards that were larger or smaller than the amount any individual juror had favored prior to deliberation. The studies indicated that when the jurors favored a relatively low award, discussion would lead to an even more lenient result, while if the jury was inclined to impose a stiff penalty, discussion would make it even harsher.

===Diffusion of Responsibility===
{|  style=&quot;background:lightblue;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=5px cellpadding=5px align=right width=30% 
| [[w:Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese's]] murder is widely cited as an example of the diffusion of responsibility as numerous people observed (either heard or saw) her murder but no one called the police immediately, allowing the murderer to leave the scene of the initial attack then return to track her down and kill her and still get away.
|}

'''Diffusion of responsibility''' (also called the '''bystander effect''') is a social phenomenon which tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. A common example would be observing a minor fender-bender on a busy freeway.  Most people, when they observe something like that, do not stop and do not call the police, assuming someone else will do so. This phenomenon rarely ever occurs in small groups. In tests involving groups of three or fewer, everyone in the group took action as opposed to groups of over ten where in almost every test, no one took action.

===False Consensus and Illusory Superiority===
'''The false consensus effect''' is the tendency for people to project their way of thinking onto other people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross1977&quot;&gt;Ross L., Greene D. &amp; House, P. (1977). The false consensus effect: An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 13, 279-301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fields1976&quot;&gt;Fields, James M., and Howard Schuman, (1976-77) &quot;Public Beliefs about the Beliefs of the Public,&quot; Public Opinion Quarterly, 40: 427-448.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people often assume that everyone else thinks the same way they do. This belief is unsubstantiated by statistical data, leading to the perception of a consensus that does not exist. This logical fallacy involves a group or individual assuming that their own opinions, beliefs and predilections are more prevalent amongst the general public than they really are.  This bias is commonly present in a group setting where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population. Since the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe that everybody thinks the same way.  This is done to justify one's own beliefs.

'''Illusory superiority''' is a cognitive bias in which people overestimate the degree to which they possess desirable qualities, relative to others, or underestimate their negative qualities relative to others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoorens1993&quot;&gt;Hoorens, Vera (1993). &quot;Self-enhancement and Superiority Biases in Social Comparison&quot;. European Review of Social Psychology (Psychology Press) 4 (1): 113—139. &lt;/ref&gt; Such over- and under-estimations serve to bolster peoples' self-esteem.  People who succumb to the illusory superiority bias have inflated views of their own characteristics. Some surveys have found all, or nearly all, the participants rate themselves as above the group average. The strongest effect has been found when people rate themselves on abilities at which they are totally incompetent. These subjects have the greatest disparity between their actual performance (at the low end of the distribution) and their self-rating (placing themselves above average). The effect has been found when people compare themselves to others on many different abilities and personality traits:
* Sorority members perceive those in their sorority as far less likely to be conceited and snobby than those in other sororities&lt;ref name=&quot;Biernat1996&quot;&gt;Biernat, M., Vescio, T.K., &amp; Theno, S.A.

===Groupthink===
'''Groupthink''' is a term coined by [[w:psychologist|psychologist]] [[w:Irving Janis|Irving Janis]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Janis1972&quot;&gt;Janis, I. (1972). ''Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0395140447&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a process by which a group can make bad or [[w:irrationality|irrational]] decisions.  In a groupthink situation, each member of the group attempts to conform his or her opinions to what they believe to be the [[w:consensus|consensus]] of the group.  In a general sense this seems to be a very rationalistic way to approach the situation.  However this results in a situation in which the group ultimately agrees upon an action which each member might individually consider to be unwise (the [[w:risky shift|risky shift]]).

Janis' original definition of the term was &quot;a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.&quot;  The word ''groupthink'' was intended to be reminiscent of [[w:George Orwell|George Orwell]]'s coinages (such as ''[[w:doublethink|doublethink]]'' and ''[[w:duckspeak|duckspeak]]'') from the fictional language [[w:Newspeak|Newspeak]], which he portrayed in his novel ''[[w:Nineteen Eighty-Four|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

Groupthink tends to occur on [[w:committee|committee]]s and in large organizations. Janis originally studied the [[w:Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] bombing, the [[w:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] and the [[w:Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Recently, in [[w:2004|2004]], the [[w:United States|US]] [[w:Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate Intelligence Committee]]'s ''Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq''&lt;ref name=&quot;SIC2004&quot;&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee. 2004. Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq http://intelligence.senate.gov/conclusions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; blamed groupthink for failures to correctly interpret intelligence relating to Iraq's [[w:weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] capabilities.

One mechanism which management consultants recommend to avoid groupthink is to place responsibility and authority for a decision in the hands of a single person who can turn to others for advice.  Others advise that a pre-selected individual take the role of disagreeing with any suggestion presented, thereby making other individuals more likely to present their own ideas and point out flaws in others' &amp;mdash; and reducing the stigma associated with being the first to take negative stances (see [[w:Devil's Advocate|Devil's Advocate]]).  

Anonymous feedback via suggestion box or [[w:online chat|online chat]] has been found to be a useful remedy for groupthink &amp;mdash; negative or dissenting views of proposals can be raised without any individual being identifiable by others as having lodged a critique.  Thus the [[w:social capital|social capital]] of the group is preserved, as all members have [[w:plausible deniability|plausible deniability]] that they raised a dissenting point.

==Networks==
A '''social network''' is a social structure between actors, either individuals or organizations. It indicates the ways in which they are connected through various social familiarities ranging from casual acquaintance to close familial bonds.  The study of social networks is called both '''social network analysis''' and '''social network theory.'''  Research in a number of academic fields has demonstrated that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals.	

[[Image:social-network.svg|right|340px|thumb|An example of a social network diagram]]

Social network theory views social relationships in terms of ''nodes'' and ''ties''.  Nodes are the individual actors within the networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors. There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes. In its most simple form, a social network is a map of all of the relevant ties between the nodes being studied.  The network can also be used to determine the [[w:social capital|social capital]] of individual actors.  These concepts are often displayed in a social network diagram, where nodes are the points and ties are the lines. 

The shape of the social network helps determine a network's usefulness to its individuals.  Smaller, tighter networks can be less useful to their members than networks with lots of loose connections ([[w:weak tie|weak tie]]s) to individuals outside the main network.  More &quot;open&quot; networks, with many weak ties and social connections, are more likely to introduce new ideas and opportunities to their members than closed networks with many redundant ties.  In other words, a group of friends who only do things with each other already share the same knowledge and opportunities.  A group of individuals with connections to other social worlds is likely to have access to a wider range of information.  It is better for individual success to have connections to a variety of networks rather than many connections within a single network.  Similarly, individuals can exercise influence or act as brokers within their social networks by bridging two networks that are not directly linked (called filling social holes).

The power of social network theory stems from its difference from traditional sociological studies, which assume that it is the attributes of individual actors - whether they are friendly or unfriendly, smart or dumb, etc. - that matter.  Social network theory produces an alternate view, where the attributes of individuals are less important than their relationships and ties with other actors within the network.  This approach has turned out to be useful for explaining many real-world phenomena, but leaves less room for individual agency, the ability for individuals to influence their success, so much of it rests within the structure of their network. For instance, social networks have been used to examine how companies interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different companies.  These networks provide ways for companies to gather information, deter competition, and even [[w:collusion|collude]] in setting prices or policies.  Power within organizations has also been found to be tied to social networks.  Powerful people in organizations often derive their power from their degree of connectedness within the organization (i.e., the degree to which an individual within a network is at the center of many relationships) rather than from job title or statuses.  Social networks also play a key role in hiring, in business success for firms, and in job performance.  

The so-called '''[[w:rule of 150|rule of 150]]''' states that the size of a genuine social network is limited to about 150 members (sometimes called the [http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html Dunbar Number]).  The rule arises from cross-cultural studies in [[w:sociology|sociology]] and especially [[w:anthropology|anthropology]] of the maximum size of a [[w:village|village]] (in modern parlance an ''[[w:ecovillage|ecovillage]]'').  It is theorized in [[w:evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychology]] that the number may be some kind of limit of average human ability to [[w:recognition|recognize]] members and track emotional facts about all members of a group.  However, it may be due to [[w:economics|economics]] and the need to track &quot;[[w:free rider|free rider]]s&quot;, as larger groups tend to be easier for [[w:cheat|cheats]] and [[w:lying|liars]] to prosper in.

[[File:Six degrees of separation.png|thumb|right|200px|The &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; model.]]

The [[w:small world phenomenon|small world phenomenon]] is the [[w:hypothesis|hypothesis]] that the chain of social acquaintances required to connect one arbitrary person to another arbitrary person anywhere in the world is generally short. The concept gave rise to the famous phrase [[w:six degrees of separation|six degrees of separation]] after a [[w:1967|1967]] ''small world experiment'' by psychologist [[w:Stanley Milgram|Stanley Milgram]] which found that two random [[w:United States|US]] citizens were connected by an average of six acquaintances. Current internet experiments continue to explore this phenomenon, including the Ohio State [http://smallworld.sociology.ohio-state.edu/html/homepage.html Electronic Small World Project] and Columbia's [http://smallworld.columbia.edu/ Small World Project]. [[w:As of 2005|As of 2005]], these experiments confirm that about five to seven degrees of separation are sufficient for connecting any two people through the internet.

Sociologists are interested in social networks because of their influence on and importance for the individual.  Social networks are the basic tools used by individuals to meet other people, to recreate, and to find social support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent research suggests that the social networks of Americans are shrinking and more and more people have no close confidants or people with whom they can share their most intimate thoughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson2006&quot;&gt;McPherson, J. Miller, Lynn Smith-Lovin, and Matthew E. Brashears. 2006. &quot;Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades.&quot; American Sociological Review. 71(3): 353-375.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the mean network size of individuals in the U.S. was 2.94 people.  Networks declined by almost an entire confidant by 2004, to 2.08 people.  Almost half, 46.3% of Americans, say they have only one or no confidants with whom they can discuss important matters.  The most frequently occurring response to the question of how many confidants one has was zero in 2004.  The decline in confidants has been most notable among non-kin networks, putting greater emphasis on kin and spouses as social confidants. Most social confidants are similar in demographic characteristics to the person doing the sharing.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson2006&quot;/&gt;  The implications of these findings are potentially disturbing for American society as people have smaller [[w:social support|social support]] networks, which are important for both social but also health reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some additional information on group socialization from Levine, John M. in Group Processes (also, look for the graphic):
pp. 86-87 &quot;To clarify temporal changes in individual-group relations, Moreland and Levine (1982) developed a model of group socialization that analyzes the passage of individuals through groups. The model seeks to describe and explain the affective, cognitive, and behavioral changes that groups and individuals produce in one another over the course of their relationship. Two fundamental assumptions underlie the model. The first assumption is that relationships between groups and individuals change in systematic ways over time, with individuals moving through different membership phases as a function of the length and quality of their experience with the group. The second assumption, which will prove central to our discussion of innovation, is that groups and individuals exert reciprocal influence on one another, with both parties acting as sources as well as targets of influence.&quot;

p. 87 &quot;The dynamic properties of the group socialization model derive from the operation of three psychological processes - evaluation, commitment, and role transition.&quot;

p. 91 &quot;Until recently, most of the work on socialization in both organizations and small groups was characterized by a restricted social perspective. During socialization, organizations and groups were assumed to be sources of influence, whereas new members were assumed to be targets. Recently, however, there has been increasing recognition that newcomers play an active role in their socialization and can produce changes (intentional or unintentional) in their organizations or groups (Bauer et al., 1998; Feldman, 1994; Levine &amp; Moreland, 1985; Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1997; Sutton &amp; Louis, 1987).&quot;

p. 96 &quot;Newcomers can also use a variety of additional tactics for producing intended innovation that do not have clear parallels in unintended innovation. One such tactic involves the timing of innovation efforts. In his research on idiosyncrasy credit, Hollander (1960) found that individuals attempting to change a group's procedural norms were less successful if they tried to initiate innovation immediately after entering the group than if they conformed for a while before suggesting any changes. Extrapolating from these findings, newcomers who attempt to produce innovation immediately after entry (when group commitment to them is low) are likely to be less successful than those who wait until later (when group commitment is higher).&quot;
I wonder if LDS leaders know this: Mission President advice.

p. 99 &quot;Jones (1986) organized these socialization tactics into two clusters - &quot;institutionalized&quot; tactics (collective, formal, sequential, fixed, serial, investiture) and &quot;individualized&quot; tactics (individual, informal, random, variable, disjunctive, divestiture). He also argued that institutionalized tactics produce custodianship (in which newcomers accept traditional role expectations), whereas individualized tactics produce innovation (in which newcomers challenge these expectations). Subsequent research has provided some support for these hypotheses (e.g., Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996; Black, 1992; Black &amp; Ashford, 1995; Mignerey, Rubin, &amp; Gorden, 1995). Although little is known about why groups use particular socialization tactics (Bauer et al., 1998), it would not be surprising if institutionalized and individualized tactics were employed by groups with norms favoring custodianship and innovation, respectively.&quot;

== To do ==

1) Add &quot;degredation ceremonies&quot; to total institution; (2) Improve the section on social class. It appears to be self-promotion by a minor figure in the field. Emphasis should be on Kohn's work. (3) add section on agents of socialization; (4) define anticipatory socialization (5) add section on socialization into gender; (6) Thomas theorem, social construction of reality.[[User:Thomasfbrown|Thomasfbrown]] ([[User talk:Thomasfbrown|talk]]) 21:52, 3 November 2008 (UTC)


Seems like a clear if simplified definition of &quot;socialization&quot; should start this entry. Then more implications and subtleties of the concept can unfold as the material is presented, but at least at the start it might help to have a simple idea of what is being discussed -- RlKap 12/28/2010</text>

Some notes from Reicher, Stephen - in Group Processes:


p. 183 &quot;However, these hostile and external observers never took care to investigate the patterns of crowd action and the conceptions of crowd members to see if their suppositions were warranted. If one did - and there is a growing literature by historians and social scientists that does (e.g. Feagin &amp; Hahn, 1973; Krantz, 1988; Rude, 1964; Williams, 1986) - then two things would become immediately apparent. The first is that crowd action is patterned in such a way as to reflect existing cultures and societies.&quot;

p. 183 &quot;The second obvious feature of crowd phenomena is that they are not only shaped by society but also that they in turn bring about social change. Indeed the changes wrought by crowds exist at three levels. There is change in the ways that crowd members see themselves as social actors. Autobiographies and studies of activists (e.g. Biko, 1988; Burns, 1990; Cluster, 1979; Haley, 1980; Teske, 1997) repeatedly show that people do not enter collective movements with fully fledged movement ideologies but that they develop their understanding of society and who they are within it as a consequence of participation.&quot;

p. 186 &quot;Both are equally represented in the core concept of submergence which, for Le Bon, marked the transition from individual psychology to crowd psychology. Simply by being part of the crowd, individuals lose all sense of self and all sense of responsibility. Yet, at the same time, they gain a sentiment of invincible power due to their numbers.
&quot;Once individual identity and the capability to control behavior disappears, crowd members become subject to contagion. That is, they are unable to resist any passing idea or, more particularly and because the intellect is all but obliterated, any passing emotion. This may even lead crowd members to sacrifice their personal interests - a further sign of irrationality.&quot;

p. 186 &quot;The majority of his crowd text is, in fact, essentially a primer on how to take advantage of the crowd mentality, how to manipulate crowds, and how to recruit their enthusiasms to one's own ends. In brief, Le Bon exhorts the would-be demagogue to direct the primitive mass by simplifying ideas, substituting affirmation and exaggeration for proof, and by repeating points over and again. It is important to acknowledge this stress on the power and the potential of crowds as a strength in Le Bon's work which has often been overlooked...&quot;
Sounds like a page in the Republican playbook.

p. 189 &quot;Such acceptance is easily obscured by the ferocity with which Allport condemned any notion of a group mind. He considered any reference to a mind that was separate from the psyche of individuals as a meaningless abstraction or even as &quot;a babble of tongues&quot; (Allport, 1933) and, in his seminal text on social psychology (Allport, 1924) he asserted that: &quot;there is no psychology of groups which is not essentially and entirely a psychology of individuals&quot; (p. 4). When it came to collective action, Allport declared, still more famously: &quot;The individual in the crowd behaves just as he would behave alone only more so&quot; (p. 295).&quot;
I knew there was a reason I didn't like Allport.

p. 190 &quot;Riots tended to happen in towns and in areas that were stable and had well-established social networks.  Feagin and Hahn (1973) provide similar evidence for the American urban revolts of the 1960s.
&quot;Next, there are considerable data that show migrants were under-represented and long-standing residents were over-represented in riot events.&quot;

p. 194 &quot;To start with, the social identity tradition assumes identity to be multiple and to constitute a complex system rather than being unitary. Most notably, a distinction has been made between personal identity, which refers to the unique characteristics of the individual, and social identity, which refers to an individual's self-understanding as a member of a social category (Tajfel, 1978; Turner &amp; Giles, 1981).&quot;
Apparently, social identity theory is 'da bomb in social psychology.</text>

==Notes from Abrams, D. in Group Processes:==

p. 427 &quot;The split between psychology and more sociological theories of social processes was accentuated with Floyd Allport's pronouncement that, &quot;There is no psychology of groups which is not essentially and entirely a psychology of individuals&quot; (Allport, 1924, p. 4; see Graumann, 1986). By 1925 sociology and psychology had become discrete disciplines (Manicas, 1987), and this meant that social psychology and the study of groups in psychology became separated from its collectivist past. As a result, different levels of analysis were not well articulated in theory and research (Doise, 1986).
&quot;According to Farr (1996), there are two social psychologies. The sociological form owes much to collectivist perspectives, and in an extreme form it regards psychological processes as barely relevant for explaining the impact of social categories and institutions on societal change and development. The psychological form is rooted in the behaviorism and reductionism of Watson and Floyd Allport. At its extreme, social categories, institutions, and roles are treated simply as factual inputs that individuals process, without much regard to the way the meaning of the categories is shaped by societal context (see Hopkins, Reicher, &amp; Levine, 1997, for a contentious critique of the way psychologists treat race as a stimulus variable in social cognition research on prejudice).
&quot;The direction taken by social psychology throughout the following six decades suggests that, as far as most were concerned, Allport had won the day. For example, the idea that the group somehow dehumanizes us, stripping us of our identity and individuality, re-emerged in the form of deindividuation theory (Diener, 1980; Zimbardo, 1969; see also Reicher, this volume, chapter 8). As a result, James's view that the group may be represented in the self (as distinct from simply influencing the self) was neglected in much of the theorizing that followed his writing (see Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1988; Reicher, 1984; Tajfel, 1978). An individualistic meta-theoretical framework also pervaded the enormous arena of group dynamics, which was dominant from the 1940s to the 1960s (e.g., Cartwright &amp; Zander, 1969; Shaw, 1981). Despite its roots in Lewin's potentially collectivist field theory (e.g., Lewin, 1952), group process research has largely been a study of interpersonal interaction in small face-to-face groups, in which &quot;I&quot; reigns supreme, and any reference to &quot;we&quot; is largely descriptive; &quot;we&quot; is simply an arithmetic aggregation (Hogg, 1992).&quot;

p. 428 &quot;In social psychology, the dominant meta-theory remains one in which the self is a unique, individual entity that is relatively autonomous and independently motivated. For example, Baumeister's (1999) choice of articles in his collection of readings on The Self in Social Psychology reflects a ballot mailed to the membership of the International Society for Self and Identity, and includes topics such as self-regulation, self-awareness, self-presentation, self-esteem, self-evaluation, and self-affirmation. None of the articles focuses on group processes, intergroup relations, or social identity. The collection is largely concerned with (a North American view of) the self as an individual psychological entity. Baumeister (1998) argues that selfhood is based in three human experiences: reflexive consciousness, interpersonal being, and executive function.&quot;

==Relative Extrema==
Find the relative maximum(s) and minimum(s), if any, of the following functions.
{{question-answer|question=1. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x}{x+1} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|none}}}}
{{question-answer|question=2. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = (x-1)^{2/3} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Minimum at the point &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=3. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^2 + \frac{2}{x} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=4. &lt;math&gt; f(s) = \frac{s}{1+s^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relative maximum at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=5. &lt;math&gt; f(x) =  x^2 - 4x + 9 \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=6. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x^2 + x +1}{x^2 -x +1} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relative maximum at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{noprint|[[Calculus/Differentiation/Applications of Derivatives/Solutions#Relative Extrema|Solutions]]}}

==Range of Function==
{{question-answer|question=7. Show that the expression &lt;math&gt;x+ 1/x&lt;/math&gt; cannot take on any value strictly between 2 and -2.|answer={{noprint|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=1-\frac{1}{x^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1-\frac{1}{x^{2}}=0\implies x=\pm1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x)=\frac{2}{x^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(-1)=-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(-1)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a relative maximum.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(-1)=-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits _{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, which means that the function is increasing. Coming from very negative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-values, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; increases from a very negative value to reach a relative maximum of &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, which means that the function is decreasing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^{-}}f(x)=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^{+}}f(x)=+\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(1)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a relative minimum.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Between &lt;math&gt;[-1,0)&lt;/math&gt; the function decreases from &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then jumps to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and decreases until it reaches a relative minimum of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;x&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, so the function increases from a minimum of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
The above analysis shows that there is a gap in the function's range between &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.}}}}

==Absolute Extrema==
Determine the absolute maximum and minimum of the following functions on the given domain

{{question-answer|question=9. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = (\frac{4}{3}x^2 -1)x &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[-\frac{1}{2},2]&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Maximum at &lt;math&gt;(2,\frac{26}{3})&lt;/math&gt;; minimum at &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{3})&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

      <comment>/* Regarding link on Optics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Mark,

I suggest that you use slashes (/) to organize levels in the textbooks. The reason is that the wiki software recognizes that as a way of grouping or subdividing pages, and on the pages that come after a slash the software makes an automatic link back to the parent page. Check out [[Seven Habits Study Guide]] for an example. Hopefully we will able to standardize all the new books on this structure. PS Let me know at any time if there is anything I can do to make your life easier. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 02:14, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

== Regarding link on [[Optics]] ==

Hi there.  I'm not sure if the author has allowed it to be used under the GFDL (I didn't put the link there).  As far as I know, the content on [[Optics]] is written at a high school level, so I think most of it (if not all) can be moved to the FHSST section.  I should really work on expanding that...I've been neglecting it quite a bit ;)

I'm real sorry for my late response, but I've been really busy lately. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 19:25, 15 May 2005 (UTC)



== Book Order ==
Hi, I noticed that you were listed as a contributer to the FHSST Physics book.  I noticed that wavelike motion is covered before forces in the book. This makes it very hard to explain the simple harmonic motion of a mass oscillating on a spring, which I believe is an example of wavelike motion.</text>

      <comment>typo: &quot;principal&quot; -&gt; &quot;principle&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Langstroth beehive is a beehive that was designed using the principle of [[Beekeeping/Bee Space| bee space]], discovered and published by [[Beekeeping/Langstroth| L. L. Langstroth]], and manipulation. This hive design is characterized by its removable frames, which allow for the inspection of the bees for development, diseases and parasites. In 1860, Langstroth developed and published his design and it has since been the basis for a majority of the world’s man made beehives.

==Characteristics==
Like most common designs of hives, the Langstroth hive uses [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]]. These frames are often filled with some form of [[Beekeeping/Foundation| foundation]] to give the bees a proper starting position and template for building comb. These frames are then installed in [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]]. The Langstroth hive is known to impose artificial segregation of the colony by physically dividing honey from brood by use of the [[Beekeeping/Brood Chamber| brood chambers]], for brood development and bee residence, and the [[Beekeeping/Honey Super| honey supers]], for excess honey collection. These separate chambers are stacked onto a [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| bottom board]] and capped off with some form of cover, most often a [[Beekeeping/Inner Cover| inner cover]] and an outside fitting [[Beekeeping/Telescopic Cover| telescopic cover]].

Other parts, such as [[Beekeeping/Feeders| feeders]], [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducers| entrance reducers]], [[Beekeeping/Hive Stand| hive stands]], [[Beekeeping/Queen Excluders| queen excluders]], or similar items may also be used in conjunction with Langstroth style hives.

==Advantages==
===Interchangeable Parts===
Langstroth hives use standard sized hive parts to allow for interchangeability with other hives. This feature of non-unique hive parts allows for mass production, and therefore cheaper prices.
===Availability===
Langstroth hives are the most common design of retailed hives. Because of this, it is relatively easy to acquire the proper parts to fit them.
===Increased Honey Harvesting===
Because [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]] is often extracted from reusable comb only small amounts of wax is lost during honey production. This means that the same comb, when properly stored, may be used season after season, not needing to be replaced by the bees, and is therefore more efficient. 
===Expansion and Contraction===
Because of their modular design, Langstroth hives are perfect for expansion and contraction of particular hives. Hives can be made larger to fit more bees, or smaller to fit fewer depending on seasonal population.

==Disadvantages==
===Complex Design===
Langstroth hives require exact measurements and must conform to rather precise standards. These standards ensure that parts are actually interchangeable between hives. Attention must also be taken to consider bee space. If bee space is not properly observed it is not uncommon to have parts glued together with [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] or connected with burr comb.

===Decreased Wax Harvesting===
Though wax may be harvested from Langstroth style hives, especially in the form of old comb, generally the only wax collected is that in the from of wax capping during honey harvesting and that of burr comb. Most beekeepers prefer to preserve their wax comb so that it may be reused for as many seasons as possible.
If wax production is desired a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]] may better suited than a Langstroth hive.

===Heavy Lifting===
Langstroth hives are known for heavy lifting when it comes time to harvest honey. Some beekeepers choose to use smaller [[Beekeeping/Honey Supers]], but often they too may become difficult to lift when filled with ripe honey.

===Difficult Management===
Langstroth hives may be more difficult to manage compared to other hive designs, such as the [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], as the entire hive must be opened in order to do even minor management. This difficulty of management is most easily expressed with having to remove the cover, and alerting the entire hive by way of a suddenly well-lit hive where it was once quite dark. Difficulty also arises during inspection of the [[Beekeeping/Brood Chamber| brood chamber]], the [[Beekeeping/Honey Super| supers]] must be removed, and so likely would the top most brood chamber, to make a satisfactory hive wide inspection.

==Is this real?==
Take the ''Cookbook:Blue Corn-Pinon Pancakes with Apricot-Pinon Compote'' as an example. Do apricots, pine nuts, almonds, cinnamon, and corn all grow in the same area? I think not, and baking powder is less than 100 years old.

Now consider ''Cookbook:Wild Rice Blueberry Dessert''. Lemon juice with blueberries and wild rice??? Lemons are citrus fruit, which comes from tropical and subtropical southeast Asia. Wild rice does not grow well in places that citrus fruit will tolerate.

Canned food, like the cream of broccoli soup, isn't more than 150 years old AFAIK.

Oogruk is untranslated. Walrus? Seal? Whale? Porpoise? Dolfin?

Certo-brand liquid fruit pectin is seriously inappropriate. The same goes for sugar actually.

Bacon is cured pig meat. Pigs are from the Old World.

:Well, it does make sense that they would adapt new foods into their recipes over time. Native Americans are still around, and their cuisine is probably still evolving. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 08:33, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
::We call that &quot;[[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States]]&quot;. I may be of European descent, but I don't claim to cook &quot;colonial cuisine&quot; or &quot;European cuisine&quot; or &quot;white cuisine&quot;. I cook US cuisine, which certainly does contain influences from the first people to settle the area. Probably [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]] and corn tortillas are still fairly authentic. The [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamale]] recipe, which you might consider to be more Mexican than US, is roughly an old recipe from Central America (ready-to-eat field rations for warriors) if you leave out the pork and black pepper. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:09, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

There is such a thing as &quot;Native American&quot; cuisine, but a lot of it has been absorbed into the cuisines of the respective countries.  Succotash and Glot (or Glottucks) are Amerindian dishes, but the inclusion of milk or butter is a European influence.

One can categorize the recipes as &quot;traditional&quot; (pre-colonial or colonial with minimal influence of European cuisine) and &quot;modern&quot; (utilising canned goods, different regions, out-of-season, non-native ingredients).

This should also be broken up into regions. There's a difference between South Western US, Tex-Mex, South-Eastern US, North-Eastern US/Canada, etc. regions.</text>

A '''cupcake pan''' is similar to a [[Cookbook:Muffin Pan|muffin pan]], but usually has smaller cups. It is a tray intended for [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] use, with shallow cup-like depressions (cups) about 2.5 inches (60 mm) in diameter and 1.5 inches (40 mm) deep. However, there also exist cupcake pans with &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;miniature&quot; cups.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conclusion ==

As I have shown so far, EFL learners engage in various interactions in virtual environments for EFL writing development such as 1) authentic writing tasks with authentic audiences 2) direct or indirect feedback from native speakers 3) learning English and English society and culture as well as language 4) involving simulated society 5) creating avatar and various own objects and rooms. 

However, because the primary goal of virtual environments is not to help EFL learners to improve their writing, all interaction and activities are not helpful to them. For example, sometimes, virtual environments expose EFL learners to inappropriate relation with partners and improper language input. Thus, I suggest some guidelines to obtain the desired results.      
          

* Find someone to talk to and ask three questions.
* Interview a native speaker at some length
* Gather information from other users or from items, and write a report.
* Log and print out a conversation, highlighting new vocabulary or idiomatic expressions. 
* Build rooms in response to an in-class reading. 
* Hold a party; invite on-line friends. 
* Start an e-mail correspondence with someone you meet in virtual environments.
* Design your own tasks, as individuals or in groups. 
* Keep a journal of activities in virtual environments. 
* Write a simple program that helps others learn the language (Lonnie, 1999)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biology is all about life - what affects it, what changes it, about how it's organized, about what makes it possible and predictable. 

It can be easy to see how Biology applies to our bodies, or our immediate environment, but sometimes it is less easy to see how it applies to the bigger picture of the world around us. To help in understanding the bigger picture, there are a few things any student should remember:

* Although Biology is taught in sections, each section has links to other sections. What you learn about the structure of a cell has links to how water-borne diseases spread. If you spend some time trying to see and understand these cross-links when you are learning and revising, you will be more able to see the bigger picture.

* Similarly, Biology cannot be completely separated from any other science. It is connected to Maths, to Chemistry, to Physics, to Geography, even to Sociology and Philosophy. If you want to do well in Biology, don't be afraid of these other sciences!

* Biology is not just about what you know, or can describe - it's also about what skills you have. Work hard to develop your skills and you will give yourself a better chance at figuring out the bigger picture. Skills can be used in unfamiliar situations; knowledge is more difficult to apply in unfamiliar situations.

Biology is fun, even though it can be hard work! We hope that as you study and learn, you will discover your own passion for this subject, and that what you learn will make a difference to your life on a daily basis.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Unit Systems ==

=== SI Units (Système International d'Unités) ===

These are the internationally agreed upon units and the ones we will use. Historically these units are based on the metric
system which was developed in France at the time of the French Revolution.

{| style=&quot;border-spacing:3px; text-align:center;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
 |+ '''Table 1.1:''' SI Base Units
 |- 
 ! Base quantity
 ! Name
 ! Symbol
 |- 
 | length
 | meter
 | m
 |- 
 | mass
 | kilogram
 | kg
 |- 
 | time
 | second
 | s
 |- 
 | electric current
 | ampere
 | A
 |-
 | thermodynamic temperature
 | kelvin
 | K
 |-
 | amount of substance
 | mole
 | mol
 |- 
 | luminous intensity
 | candela
 | cd
 |}

All physical quantities have units which can be built from the 7 base units listed in Table 1.1 (incidentally the choice of these seven was arbitrary). They are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations of the other six. This is similar to breaking a language down into a set of sounds from which all words are made. Another way of viewing the base units is like the three primary colours. All other colours can be made from the primary colours but no primary colour can be made by combining the other two primaries.
 
Unit names are always written with lowercase initials (e.g. the metre). The symbols (or abbreviations) of units are also written with lowercase initials except if they are named after scientists (e.g. the kelvin (K) and the ampere (A)). 

To make life convenient, particular combinations of the base units are given special names. This makes working with them easier, but it is always correct
to reduce everything to the base units. Table 1.2 lists some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar at this stage &amp;mdash; we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to say the units correctly. For instance, the '''newton''' is another name for the '''kilogram metre per second squared''' (kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;}, while the '''kilogram metre squared per second squared''' ((kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;}) is called the '''joule'''.  

{| style=&quot;border-spacing:3px; text-align:center;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
 |+ '''Table 1.2: ''' Some Examples of Combinations of SI Base Units Assigned Special Names
 |- 
 ! Quantity
 ! Formula
 ! Unit Expressed in
 ! Name of
 |- 
 | &amp;nbsp; 
 | &amp;nbsp; 
 | Base Units
 | Combination
 |- 
 | Force
 | ''m·a''
 | kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
 | N (newton)
 |- 
 | Frequency
 | &lt;math&gt;{1\over T} &lt;/math&gt;
 | s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
 | Hz (hertz)
 |- 
 | Work &amp; Energy
 | ''F·s''
 | kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
 | J (joule)
 |}

Another important aspect of dealing with units is the prefixes that they sometimes have (prefixes are words or letters written in front that change the meaning). The kilogram (kg) is a simple  example: 1 kg is 1000 g or 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g. Grouping the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the g together we can replace the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Incidentally the kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.

There are prefixes for many powers of 10 (Table 1.3 lists a large set of these prefixes). This is a larger set than you will need but it serves as a good reference. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the table, it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. ''' Those prefixes listed in boldface should be learnt.'''

As another example of the use of prefixes, 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; g  can be written as 1 mg (1 milligram).

===Other Unit Systems===
The remaining sets of units, although not used by us, are also internationally recognised and still in use by others. We will mention them briefly for interest only.  

====c.g.s Units====
In this system the metre is replaced by the centimetre and the kilogram is replaced by the gram. This is a simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For example, the units of force and work are different. These units are used most often in astrophysics and atomic physics. 

====Imperial Units====
These units (as their name suggests) stem from the days when monarchs decided measures. Here all the base units are different, except the measure of time. This is the unit system you are most likely to encounter if SI units are not used. These units are used by the Americans and British. As you can imagine, having different units in use from place to place makes scientific communication very difficult. This was the motivation for adopting a set of internationally agreed upon units. 

====Natural Units====
This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities (such as the speed of light) are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high energy physics and quantum mechanics.

== The Importance of Units ==

Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the
numbers we calculate. Depending on which units we use, the numbers are different (e.g. 3.8 ''m'' and 3800 ''mm''
actually represent the same length). Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be
specified when expressing physical quantities. In the case of the curtain example at the beginning of the chapter, 
the result of a misunderstanding would simply have been an incorrect amount of material cut. However, sometimes such misunderstandings have
catastrophic results. Here is an extract from a story on CNN's website: 

&lt;!-- (NOTE TO SELF: This quote may need to be removed as the license we are using allows for all parts of the document to be copied and I am not
sure if this being copied is legit in all ways?) --&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''NASA: Human error caused loss of Mars orbiter November 10, 1999'''&lt;br/&gt;
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failure to convert English measures to metric values caused the loss
of the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that smashed into the planet instead of
reaching a safe orbit, a NASA investigation concluded Wednesday.
The Mars Climate Orbiter, a key craft in the space agency's exploration of the red planet,
vanished after a rocket firing September 23 that was supposed to put the spacecraft on orbit around Mars.
An investigation board concluded that NASA engineers failed to convert English measures
of rocket thrusts to newton, a metric system measuring rocket force. One English pound of
force equals 4.45 newtons. A small difference between the two values caused the spacecraft
to approach Mars at too low an altitude and the craft is thought to have smashed into the
planet's atmosphere and was destroyed.
The spacecraft was to be a key part of the exploration of the planet. From its station about
the red planet, the Mars Climate Orbiter was to relay signals from the Mars Polar Lander,
which is scheduled to touch down on Mars next month.
``The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft was a failed translation of English units
into metric units and a segment of ground-based, navigation-related mission software,&quot;
said Arthus Stephenson, chairman of the investigation board.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story illustrates the importance of being aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, we must be able to convert
between systems of units!

== Choice of Units ==

There are no wrong units to use, but a clever choice of units can make a problem look simpler. The vast range of problems makes it impossible
to use a single set of units for everything without making some problems look much more complicated than they should. We can't
easily compare the mass of the sun and the mass of an electron, for instance. This is why astrophysicists and atomic physicists use
different systems of units.  

We won't ask you to choose between different unit systems. For your present purposes the SI system is
perfectly sufficient. In some cases you may come across quantities expressed in units other than the standard SI units. You will then
need to convert these quantities into the correct SI units. This is explained in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to Change Units ==

Firstly you obviously need some relationship between the two units that you wish to convert between. Let us demonstrate with a
simple example. We will consider the case  of converting millimeters (mm) to meters (m)&amp;mdash;the SI unit of length. We know that there are 1000 mm in 1 m which we can write as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000 \mbox{ mm} = 1 \mbox{ m}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

Now multiplying both sides by 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1000\mbox{ mm}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we get 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}1000 \mbox{ mm}=\frac{1}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}1 \mbox{ m}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;


which simply gives us

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1=\frac{1 \mbox{ m}}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

This is the conversion ratio from millimeters to meters. You can derive any conversion ratio in this way from a known relationship between two units. Let's use the conversion ratio we have just derived in an example:


'''Question''': Express 3800 mm in meters.


'''Answer''':


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3800 \mbox{ mm} &amp; = &amp; 3800 \mbox{ mm} \times 1\\&amp; = &amp; 3800 \mbox{ mm} \times \frac{1\mbox{ m}}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}\\&amp; = &amp; 3.8 \mbox{ m}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;


Note that we wrote every unit in each step of the calculation. By writing them in and canceling 
them properly, we can check that we have the right units when we are finished. We started with mm and multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{mm}}&lt;/math&gt;

This canceled the mm leaving us with just m&amp;mdash;the SI unit we wanted to end up with! If we wished to do the reverse and convert metres to millimeters, then we would need a conversion ratio with millimeters on the top and meters on the bottom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How Units Can Help You ==

We conclude each section of this book with a discussion of the units most relevant to that particular section. It is important to try to understand what the units mean. That is why thinking about the examples and explanations of the units is essential.

If we are careful with our units then the numbers we get in our calculations can be checked in a 'sanity test'.

=== What is a 'sanity test'? ===

This isn't a special or secret test. All we do is stop, take a deep breath, and look at our answer. Sure we always look at our answers&amp;mdash;or do we? This time we mean stop and really look&amp;mdash;does our answer make sense?

Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 people you  would know it was wrong&amp;mdash;that's just an insane number of people to have in a classroom. That's all a sanity check is&amp;mdash;is your answer insane or not? But what units were we using? We were using people as our unit. This helped us to make sense of the answer. If we had used some other unit (or no unit) the number would have lacked meaning and a sanity test would have been much harder (or even impossible).

It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let's consider masses. An average person has mass 70 kg, while the heaviest person in medical history had a mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person's mass and you get 7000 kg, this should fail your sanity check&amp;mdash;your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.000&amp;nbsp;01 kg should fail your sanity test.

The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are.
In the example of people in a classroom you need to know that there are usually 20&amp;ndash;50 people in a classroom. Only then do you know that
your answer of 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 must be wrong. Here is a table of typical values of various things (big and small, fast and slow,
light and heavy&amp;mdash;you get the idea):

&lt;!-- NOTE TO SELF: Add to this table as we go along with examples from each section. --&gt;

Now you don't have to memorise this table but you should read it. The best thing to do is to refer to it every time you do a calculation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Temperature ==

We need to make a special mention of the units used to describe temperature. The unit of temperature listed in Table 1.1 is not the everyday unit we see and
use. 

Normally the Celsius scale is used to describe temperature. As we all know, Celsius temperatures can be negative. This might suggest that any number is a valid temperature. In fact, the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles that make up the gas. As we lower the temperature so the motion of the particles is reduced until a point is reached where all motion ceases. The temperature at which this occurs is called absolute zero. There is no physically possible temperature colder than this. In Celsius, absolute zero is at -273.15 °C. 

Physicists have defined a new temperature scale called the ''Kelvin scale''. According to this scale absolute zero is at 0 K and negative temperatures are not allowed. The size of one unit kelvin is exactly the same as that of one unit degree Celsius. This means that a change in temperature of 1  kelvin is equal to a change in temperature of 1 degree Celsius&amp;mdash;the scales just start in different places. Think of two ladders with steps that are the same size but the bottom most step on the Celsius ladder is labelled -273, while the first step on the Kelvin ladder is labelled 0. There are still 100 steps between the points where water freezes and boils on either ladder. 



                          |----|   102 °C    |----|  375 K
                          |----|   101 °C    |----|  374 K
  water boils  ---&gt;       |----|   100 °C    |----|  373 K
                          |----|    99 °C    |----|  372 K
                          |----|    98 °C    |----|  371 K
                                              .

                          |----|    -1 °C    |----|  272 K
                          |----|    -2 °C    |----|  271 K
                                              .
                                              .
                                              .
                          |----|  -269 °C    |----|  4 K
                          |----|  -270 °C    |----|  3 K
                          |----|  -271 °C    |----|  2 K
                          |----|  -272 °C    |----|  1 K
  absolute zero ---&gt;      |----|  -273 °C    |----|  0 K
  


(NOTE TO SELF: Come up with a decent picture of two ladders with the labels --water boiling and freezing--in the same place but with different labelling on the steps!)

This makes the conversion from kelvins to degrees Celsius and back very easy. To convert from degrees Celsius to kelvins add 273. To convert
from kelvins to degrees Celsius subtract 273. Representing the Kelvin temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and the Celsius temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T_K &amp;=&amp; T_{oC} + 273\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It is because this conversion is additive that a difference in temperature of 1 degree Celsius is equal to a difference of 1 kelvin.
The majority of conversions between units are multiplicative. For example, to convert from metres to millimetres we '''multiply''' by 1000. Therefore a
change of 1 m is equal to a change of 1000 mm.

== Conclusion ==

In this chapter we have discussed the importance of units. We have discovered that there are many 
different units to describe the same thing, although you should stick to SI units in your
calculations. We have also discussed how to convert between different units. This is a skill you must acquire.

      <comment>/* Dynamic disks, USB */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You may consider looking at the following site that tells you how to hack windows 2000 or windows xp to allow software raid 0 and 5. 

http://members.home.nl/rvandesanden/raid3.html

I started to try this but hit the wall when I realised that external USB disks cannot be converted to dynamic disks. So as suggested in the wiki, I will mount both disks on an IDE inteface and see what I see after I remount them in the USB enclosures.

== It works ==

I've tried creating a dynamic disk plugged into a PC under Win2k, and then placing this disk in an external USB enclosure.

Initially the drive came up with a red symbol in disk administrator, but I was able to right-click and select &quot;Reactivate Disk&quot; and this then displayed succesfully.  Dynamic disks under USB2 work just fine.


Second confirmation: I did this also, and it didn't even require &quot;reactivate&quot; (this is under XP Pro with the RAID-enabling hack). It did complain that it wasn't able to update the boot.ini file properly because the &quot;SCSI controller&quot; (haha) for the USB drive &quot;wasn't responding&quot; -- but that just means it probably won't boot from the USB drive, which is fine.

== I have done this pretty successfully ==


I did this maybe 2.5 years ago with some limited success, and just decided to plug it in again a few days ago.

I bought 10 911 firewire bridges.  Made the registry hack.  For an enclosure I bought a metal toolbox, and filled it with 10 120gb drives (at the time 120gb drives were the best capacity per dollar).  Basically, I drilled holes in the back of the toolbox and mounted the drives on one side, with the interface side facing upwards.  I then mounted an Antec power supply in the middle of the toolbox (and cut a vent in the back for the fan of the power supply. I had to short one of the pins on the power supply, so it would be always &quot;switched on&quot;.  I used Y-connectors to power all the drives and bridges.  This seemed like it would be much cheaper and easier than buying and powering a lot of firewire enclosures.

Net result, was a dynamic spanned XP volume with about 1.1TB of space for roughly $2700, which was an excellent deal at the time (quite terrible now, of course).  

I used it for quite some time, but it was never really stable.  I thought it was because I was using just loose bridge boards, or figured my cabling was weak somewhere, but never quite figure out the reliability problems.  I kept getting delayed-write failures.  I googled to no avail.

It turns out since then, that there has been 2 proposed resolutions for that problem.  One is a firmware upgrade for the Oxford chip.  The second, is upgrading to SP2.  As I am no longer running anything other than SP2, just out of curiosity I grabbed the thing out of the closet and plugged it in.  Since then it has worked perfectly.  I also ran across the Tom's Hardware article the other day and upgraded the disk to use RAID-5 rather than spanned.  It does seem a lot slower now :)

Anyway, if any one is interested I could probably snap a few pictures.  It's pretty funny looking, closed it's hard to tell from all but one side, it's anything other than a red metal toolbox.  If it had worked better at the time, I would have probably taken pictures and posted on Slashdot and declared myself a genius.

== poor results w/ initio 2340l ==


under windows 2000 server i wanted to put 3 pata drives in an enclosure and run software Raid 5.

i get a blue screen before i finish regenerating.  something about memory management.  i'll look into it more later but it seems that there is very little info out there on initio (a.k.a inic) 2430L or 2430.  

am i correct that with oxford drives under windows software raid 5 that when you restart the drives are immediately online and do not show as failed and require a reactivation.

any other resources out there for win sw raid 5 w/ external enclosures.

thanks.

== Diskpart ==

Using Diskpart does not work - the command line follows the same policy setting as the GUI Disk Manager and will not allow you to convert a USB volume into a dynamic disk. Microsoft admits this is by policy (1), and not due to any hardware limitation, due to them believeing it to be too unreliable.

1. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300415

== Dynamic disks, USB ==

&quot;I think WindowsXP only puts &quot;dynamic&quot; drives into a RAID array.&quot;

All Windows versions (except NT4) allow RAID only on dynamic disks.

Could a USB disk be converted to dynamic by cloning to it an existing dynamic disk ?</text>

== Scientific Notation, Significant Figures,Rounding and Chi Squared Test ==

If you are only sure of say, both digits of a two-digit number, and put it in a formula and get a long series of numbers to the right of the decimal place, then those digits are probably not very accurate. This is the idea of significant figures.

Take 10 and divide by 3. If you are not sure that the number 10 is perfectly accurate, then you do not need to write down 3.333... and can get away with  something like 3.3 or 3.33. Usually, in Biology, we only need figures to 1 decimal place, but sometimes we need them to 2 places.

The main situation in which we would need to be careful and accuate with our numbers is in statistics. In particular, we would need figures to 2 decimal places if we wanted to use the Chi (pronounced Ki) Squared Test (abbreviated as X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; test) to decide whether a result is significant or not.

== Introduction ==

Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy material. The shop assistant would need to know how much material was
required. Telling her you need material 2 wide and 6  long would be insufficient-- you have to specify the '''unit'''
(i.e. 2 ''metres'' wide and 6 ''metres'' long). Without the unit the information is
incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were making curtains for a doll's house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide
and 6 centimetres long!

It is not just lengths that have units, all physical quantities have units (e.g. time and temperature).

The South African high school Biology curriculum is built around 3 Learning Outcomes - things that you need to show you can do. Each Learning Outcome has 3 Assessment Standards. These are the things the classroom teacher, or the exam board, will use to test whether you meet the Learning Outcomes.

== Learning Outcomes Overview ==

*Learning Outcome 1: Scientific Inquiry and Problem Solving Skills 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 1: The learner identifies and questions phenomena and plans an investigation. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 2: The learner conducts an investigation by collecting and manipulating data. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 3: The learner analyses, synthesises and evaluates data and communicates findings.


*Learning Outcome 2: Construction and Application of Knowledge
**Focus of Assessment Standard 1: The learner accesses knowledge. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 2: The learner interprets and makes meaning of knowledge in Life Sciences. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 3: The learner shows understanding of how Life Sciences knowledge is applied in everyday life.


*Learning Outcome 3: Life Sciences, Technology, Environment and Society
**Focus of Assessment Standard 1: The learner explores and evaluates the scientific ideas of past and present cultures. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 2: The learner compares and evaluates the uses and development of resources and products and their impact on the environment and society. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 3: The learner compares the influence of different beliefs, attitudes and values on scientific knowledge.


Learning Outcome 1 is testing whether or not you have practical skills. See  [[../Useful Information|Useful Information]] for details of the skills you will need to develop.

Learning Outcome 2 is testing your knowledge of Biology.

Learning Outcome 3 is testing whether you can apply your knowledge to real life situations.

== What do I need to know for the exam? ==

In school, each Learning Outcome is covered through using the same subject material in different ways. Because of that, this textbook is based on the subject material, and not the Learning Outcomes. In each section we aim to explain how the material should be used, and what skills should be learnt, to meet each of the Learning Outcomes.

The 4 subject areas are:
*Tissues, cells and molecular studies
*Structure, Control and Process in basic life systems of Plants and Humans
*Environmental Studies
*Diversity, Change and Continuity

Read each section through carefully. You can only really start to show that you have certain skills if you know the subject material properly.

We aim to cover everything you should learn from Grade 10 through to Grade 12, since each year builds upon the foundation of the previous year. However, the balance of our explanations will be focused on the Grade 11 and 12 work, since this will not have been tested externally.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Biological Nomenclature &amp; Taxonomy ==

Nomenclature simply means to name. In Biology, there is a standard way of naming organisms. This is based on a grouping, or classification, system designed by Carolus (or Carl) Linnaeus. Grouping organisms is called Taxonomy, and the people who do this are called taxonomists.

Taxonomy involves putting all living things into groups based on the characteristics they have in common. These groups, or taxa, can be further divided into smaller and smaller groups, until every single organism is described and named. 

For example, dogs and cats are in the same group at one level, because they both eat meat, have fur, 4 legs, and give birth to live young. However, on the next level down they are no longer in the same group, because dogs cannot pull their claws back into their paws, while cats can retract (pull back) their claws. (This is not the only reason they are in different groups, but we don't have the space and time to give all of them.)

Each level of grouping has its own name. In order of decreasing size they are: Kingdom, Phylum (or Division), Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. (You can remember this order using this poem: &lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt;ing &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;hilip &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ame &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;ver &lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;or &lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt;randma's &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;oup.)

Using this system, every organism has a binomial (or two part) name, which are always written in italics (or underlined if handwritten). The first part of the name is written with a capital letter and shows which genus the organism is in. The second part is always written with a small letter and shows the species.

=== How does it work? ===

There are 5 Kingdoms - Animals (Animalia), Plants (Plantae), Fungi, Protists (Protista, but now often called Protoctista) and Bacteria (often called Monera). Most taxonomists these days divide the Bacteria Kingdom into two and say there are 6 kingdoms, but in school level Biology we ignore that division and say there are only 5.

&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt;
A lot of the names used seem to have odd endings or spellings. That's because they come from Latin, which was the main language spoken when Linnaeus started developing this system. A lot of the words we use in Biology have been changed slighly from their original Latin. Instead of saying Kingdom Animalia (for example), which is Latin, non-Biologists will often say Animal Kingdom. You need to practice using both.

e.g. a Lion belongs to the Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata (which means it has a backbone), Class Mammalia, Order Carnivora, Family Felidae, Genus &lt;i&gt;Panthera&lt;/i&gt; and species &lt;i&gt;leo&lt;/i&gt;. If you simply use &lt;i&gt;Panthera leo&lt;/i&gt;, anyone anywhere in the world who has studied Biology will know which organism you are talking about, and why it belongs to that group. This is very useful if you are trying to communicate with someone who doesn't speak your language!

      <comment>/* The exp, exp2, and expm1 functions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Simple math|Control}}
{{wikipedia|math.h}}

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;math.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header contains prototypes for several functions that deal with mathematics. In the 1990 version of the ISO standard, only the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; versions of the functions were specified; the 1999 version added the &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt; versions. To use these math functions, you must link your program with the math library. For some compilers (including GCC), you must specify the additional parameter &lt;code&gt;-lm&lt;/code&gt;.

The functions can be grouped into the following categories:

== Trigonometric functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;acos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;acos&lt;/code&gt; functions return the arccosine of their arguments in radians, and the &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt; functions return the arcsine of their arguments in radians.  All functions expect the argument in the range [-1,+1]. The arccosine returns a value in the range [0,π]; the arcsine returns a value in the range [-π/2,+π/2].

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float asinf(float x); /* C99 */
 float acosf(float x); /* C99 */
 double asin(double x);
 double acos(double x);
 long double asinl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double acosl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; functions return the arctangent of their arguments in radians, and the &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt; function return the arctangent of &lt;code&gt;y/x&lt;/code&gt; in radians. The &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; functions return a value in the range [-π/2,+π/2] (the reason why ±π/2 are included in the range is because the floating-point value may represent infinity, and atan(±∞) = ±π/2); the &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt; functions return a value in the range [-π/2,+π/2]. For &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt;, a domain error may occur if both arguments are zero.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float atanf(float x); /* C99 */
 float atan2f(float y, float x); /* C99 */
 double atan(double x);
 double atan2(double y, double x);
 long double atanl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double atan2l(long double y, long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tan&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tan&lt;/code&gt; functions return the cosine, sine, and tangent of the argument, expressed in radians.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float cosf(float x); /* C99 */
 float sinf(float x); /* C99 */
 float tanf(float x); /* C99 */
 double cos(double x);
 double sin(double x);
 double tan(double x);
 long double cosl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double sinl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double tanl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hyperbolic functions ==

The &lt;tt&gt;cosh&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;sinh&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tanh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the hyperbolic cosine, the hyperbolic sine, and the hyperbolic tangent of the argument respectively. For the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions, a range error occurs if the magnitude of the argument is too large.

The &lt;tt&gt;acosh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the argument. A domain error occurs for arguments less than 1.

The &lt;tt&gt;asinh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of the argument.

The &lt;tt&gt;atanh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the argument. A domain error occurs if the argument is not in the interval [-1, +1]. A range error may occur if the argument equals -1 or +1.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float coshf(float x); /* C99 */
 float sinhf(float x); /* C99 */
 float tanhf(float x); /* C99 */
 double cosh(double x); 
 double sinh(double x);
 double tanh(double x);
 long double coshl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double sinhl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double tanhl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float acoshf(float x); /* C99 */
 float asinhf(float x); /* C99 */
 float atanhf(float x); /* C99 */
 double acosh(double x); /* C99 */
 double asinh(double x); /* C99 */
 double atanh(double x); /* C99 */
 long double acoshl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double asinhl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double atanhl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exponential and logarithmic functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exp2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;expm1&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' exponential function of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (''e''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;). A range error occurs if the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is too large.

The &lt;code&gt;exp2&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-2 exponential function of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (2&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;). A range error occurs if the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is too large.

The &lt;code&gt;expm1&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' exponential function of the argument, minus 1. A range error occurs if the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is too large.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float expf(float x); /* C99 */
 double exp(double x);
 long double expl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float exp2f(float x); /* C99 */
 double exp2(double x); /* C99 */
 long double exp2l(long double x); /* C99 */
 float expm1f(float x); /* C99 */
 double expm1(double x); /* C99 */
 long double expm1l(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;frexp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;modf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scalbn&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;scalbln&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

These functions are heavily used in software floating-point emulators, but are otherwise rarely directly called.

Inside the computer, each floating point number is represented by two parts:
* The significand is either in the range [1/2, 1), or it equals zero.
* The exponent is an integer.
The value of a floating point number &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;v = {\rm significand} \times 2^{\rm exponent}&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;frexp&lt;/code&gt; functions break the argument floating point number &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; into those two parts, the exponent and significand.
After breaking it apart, it stores the exponent in the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt;, and returns the significand.
In other words, the value returned is a copy of the given floating point number but with an exponent replaced by 0.
If &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is zero, both parts of the result are zero.

The &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt; functions multiply a floating-point number by a integral power of 2 and return the result.
In other words, it returns copy of the given floating point number with the exponent increased by ex.
A range error may occur.

The &lt;code&gt;modf&lt;/code&gt; functions break the argument &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; into integer and fraction parts, each of which has the same sign as the argument. They store the integer part in the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;*iptr&lt;/code&gt; and return the fraction part.
The &lt;code&gt;*iptr&lt;/code&gt; is a floating-point type, rather than an &quot;int&quot; type, because it might be used to store an integer like 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 which is too big to fit in an int.

The &lt;code&gt;scalbn&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scalbln&lt;/code&gt; compute &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; × &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is the base of the floating-point system; if it is 2, the functions are equivalent to &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float frexpf(float value, int *ex); /* C99 */
 double frexp(double value, int *ex);
 long double frexpl(long double value, int *ex); /* C99 */
 float ldexpf(float x, int ex); /* C99 */
 double ldexp(double x, int ex);
 long double ldexpl(long double x, int ex); /* C99 */
 float modff(float value, float *iptr); /* C99 */
 double modf(double value, double *iptr); 
 long double modfl(long double value, long double *iptr); /* C99 */
 float scalbnf(float x, int ex); /* C99 */
 double scalbn(double x, int ex); /* C99 */
 long double scalbnl(long double x, int ex); /* C99 */
 float scalblnf(float x, long int ex); /* C99 */
 double scalbln(double x, long int ex); /* C99 */
 long double scalblnl(long double x, long int ex); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

Most C floating point libraries also implement the IEEE754-recommended nextafter(), nextUp( ), and nextDown( ) functions.

=== The &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log1p&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;log10&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' natural ('''not''' common) logarithm of the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative. A range error may occur if the argument is zero.

The &lt;code&gt;log1p&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' natural ('''not''' common) logarithm of one plus the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is less than -1. A range error may occur if the argument is -1.

The &lt;code&gt;log10&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the common (base-10) logarithm of the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative. A range error may occur if the argument is zero.

The &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-2 logarithm of the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative. A range error may occur if the argument is zero.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float logf(float x); /* C99 */
 double log(double x);
 long double logl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float log1pf(float x); /* C99 */
 double log1p(double x); /* C99 */
 long double log1pl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float log10f(float x); /* C99 */
 double log10(double x);
 long double log10l(long double x); /* C99 */
 float log2f(float x); /* C99 */
 double log2(double x); /* C99 */
 long double log2l(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;ilogb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;logb&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;ilogb&lt;/code&gt; functions extract the exponent of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a signed int value. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is zero, they return the value &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGB0&lt;/code&gt;; if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is infinite, they return the value &lt;code&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/code&gt;; if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is not-a-number they return the value &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGBNAN&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, they are equivalent to calling the corresponding &lt;code&gt;logb&lt;/code&gt; function and casting the returned value to type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. A range error may occur if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is zero. &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGB0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGBNAN&lt;/code&gt; are macros defined in &lt;code&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is a macro defined in &lt;code&gt;limits.h&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;logb&lt;/code&gt; functions extract the exponent of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a signed integer value in floating-point format. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is subnormal, it is treated as if it were normalized; thus, for positive finite &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, 1 ≤ &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; × &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;sup&gt;-logb(x)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; . &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is the radix for floating-point numbers, defined in the &lt;code&gt;float.h&lt;/code&gt; header.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 int ilogbf(float x); /* C99 */
 int ilogb(double x); /* C99 */
 int double ilogbl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float logbf(float x); /* C99 */
 double logb(double x); /* C99 */
 long double logbl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Power functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt; functions compute &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; raised to the power &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and return the result. A domain error occurs if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is negative and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is not an integral value. A domain error occurs if the result cannot be represented when &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is zero and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is less than or equal to zero. A range error may occur.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float powf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double pow(double x, double y);
 long double powl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the positive square root of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float sqrtf(float x); /* C99 */
 double sqrt(double x);
 long double sqrtl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;cbrt&lt;code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;cbrt&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the cube root of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float cbrtf(float x); /* C99 */
 double cbrt(double x); /* C99 */
 long double cbrtl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;hypot&lt;code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;hypot&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the square root of the sums of the squares of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, without overflow or underflow, and return the result.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float hypotf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double hypot(double x, double y); /* C99 */
 long double hypotl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Nearest integer, absolute value, and remainder functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;ceil&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;ceil&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the smallest integral value not less than &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result; the &lt;code&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the largest integral value not greater than &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float ceilf(float x); /* C99 */
 double ceil(double x);
 long double ceill(long double x); /* C99 */
 float floorf(float x); /* C99 */
 double floor(double x);
 long double floorl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;fabs&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;fabs&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the absolute value of a floating-point number &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float fabsf(float x); /* C99 */
 double fabs(double x); 
 long double fabsl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;fmod&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;fmod&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the floating-point remainder of &lt;code&gt;x/y&lt;/code&gt; and return the value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; - ''i'' * &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, for some integer ''i'' such that, if &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is nonzero, the result has the same sign as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and magnitude less than the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is zero, whether a domain error occurs or the &lt;code&gt;fmod&lt;/code&gt; functions return zero is implementation-defined.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float fmodf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double fmod(double x, double y);
 long double fmodl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;nearbyint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lrint&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;llrint&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;nearbyint&lt;/code&gt; functions round their argument to an integer value in floating-point format, using the current rounding direction and without raising the &quot;inexact&quot; floating-point exception.

The &lt;code&gt;rint&lt;/code&gt; functions are similar to the &lt;code&gt;nearbyint&lt;/code&gt; functions except that they can raise the &quot;inexact&quot; floating-point exception if the result differs in value from the argument.

The &lt;code&gt;lrint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;llrint&lt;/code&gt; functions round their arguments to the nearest integer value according to the current rounding direction. If the result is outside the range of values of the return type, the numeric result is undefined and a range error may occur if the magnitude of the argument is too large.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float nearbyintf(float x); /* C99 */
 double nearbyint(double x); /* C99 */
 long double nearbyintl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float rintf(float x); /* C99 */
 double rint(double x); /* C99 */
 long double rintl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long int lrintf(float x); /* C99 */
 long int lrint(double x); /* C99 */
 long int lrintl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llrintf(float x); /* C99 */
 long long int llrint(double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llrintl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lround&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;llround&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt; functions round the argument to the nearest integer value in floating-point format, rounding halfway cases away from zero, regardless of the current rounding direction.

The &lt;code&gt;lround&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;llround&lt;/code&gt; functions round the argument to the nearest integer value, rounding halfway cases away from zero, regardless of the current rounding direction. If the result is outside the range of values of the return type, the numeric result is undefined and a range error may occur if the magnitude of the argument is too large.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float roundf(float x); /* C99 */
 double round(double x); /* C99 */
 long double roundl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long int lroundf(float x); /* C99 */
 long int lround(double x); /* C99 */
 long int lroundl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llroundf(float x); /* C99 */
 long long int llround(double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llroundl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;trunc&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;trunc&lt;/code&gt; functions round their argument to the integer value in floating-point format that is nearest but no larger in magnitude than the argument.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float truncf(float x); /* C99 */
 double trunc(double x); /* C99 */
 long double truncl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;remainder&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;remainder&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the remainder &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; REM &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; as defined by IEC 60559. The definition reads, &quot;When ''y'' ≠ 0, the remainder ''r'' = ''x'' REM ''y'' is defined regardless of the rounding mode by the mathematical reduction ''r'' = ''x'' - ''ny'', where ''n'' is the integer nearest the exact value of ''x''/''y''; whenever |''n'' - ''x''/''y''| = ½, then ''n'' is even. Thus, the remainder is always exact. If ''r'' = 0, its sign shall be that of ''x''.&quot; This definition is applicable for all implementations.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float remainderf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double remainder(double x, double y); /* C99 */
 long double remainderl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;remquo&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;remquo&lt;/code&gt; functions return the same remainder as the &lt;code&gt;remainder&lt;/code&gt; functions. In the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;quo&lt;/code&gt;, they store a value whose sign is the sign of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and whose magnitude is congruent modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; to the magnitude of the integral quotient of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, where ''n'' is an implementation-defined integer greater than or equal to 3.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float remquof(float x, float y, int *quo); /* C99 */
 double remquo(double x, double y, int *quo); /* C99 */
 long double remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Error and gamma functions ==

The &lt;code&gt;erf&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the error function of the argument (2/(π&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;) ∫&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; dt); the &lt;code&gt;erfc&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the complimentary error function of the argument (that is, 1 - erf x). For the &lt;code&gt;erfc&lt;/code&gt; functions, a range error may occur if the argument is too large.

The &lt;code&gt;lgamma&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma of the argument (that is, log&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;|Γ(x)|). A range error may occur if the argument is a negative integer or zero.

The &lt;code&gt;tgamma&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the gamma of the argument (that is, Γ(x)). A domain error occurs if the argument is a negative integer or if the result cannot be represented when the argument is zero. A range error may occur.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float erff(float x); /* C99 */
 double erf(double x); /* C99 */
 long double erfl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float erfcf(float x); /* C99 */
 double erfc(double x); /* C99 */
 long double erfcl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float lgammaf(float x); /* C99 */
 double lgamma(double x); /* C99 */
 long double lgammal(long double x); /* C99 */
 float tgammaf(float x); /* C99 */
 double tgamma(double x); /* C99 */
 long double tgammal(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
In our previous chapters we explored the use of using a single variable in research; however, much of the research done in psychology involves the use of several variables. This is because there are few instances where researchers can use a single variable to explain human behaviors. Our previously learned material covered using one independent variable. In reality, more often research questions will involve the use of more than one independent variable.

This chapter will explore the use of the '''two variables between-subject design''', and the statistical method used to measure this type of design is known as the '''two-way ANOVA'''.


== Advantage of the Two-variable Design ==

In research using a two-variable design offers many advantages over using a one-variable design. The first advantage is increased efficiency. This is because the two-variable design contains all of the elements of using two, one-variable designs. From this, using one, two variable design is more cost-effective than researching two, one-variable design experiments.

Another advantage is that we can analyze the interaction of the two variables in the design. This helps us understand how combinations of variables influence behavior. In particular, it allows us to understand and analyze the interactive effects between the two independent variables on the dependent variable. In this, '''interaction''' means that the effect of one independent variable is influenced by another independent variable; or, interaction means that the relationship between an independent variable is different at various levels (types) of another independent variable. 

For example, the researchers Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, and Schwaz (1996) conducted an experiment where they examined the reaction of white male participants who had just been insulted versus those who had not been insulted using males from the Northern and Southern regions of the United States. They measured their testosterone level creating an operational definition for their level of aggression. This is because testosterone is easily measured through saliva samples and correlates with arousal, especially aggression.  The hypothesis is that the participants who had been insulted would show a higher level of testosterone than do participants who had not been insulted; however, there was a second independent variable: regional background of the participants. In fact, the researchers selected half of the participants from Northern regions and the other from Southern. The researchers thought that the men from the South, who had a &quot;culture of honor”, would show a greater increase in testosterone levels than the males from the North. This is because men in the South are raised to protect their character when attacked through insults or violence, whereas men in the North are not so they thought that a man from the South being insulted would show more arousal. 

This example shows how the variable of culture (Northern or Southern male) influences the variable aggression (in the form of testosterone levels), and it also shows how the being insulted affects aggression levels. There can be an interaction between the two variables if the effect of one variable is not consistent across all levels of the other variables. For example, if the results of the study showed that the Northern males’ testosterone levels did not rise when insulted but the Southern males did, there would be interaction. Remember, it is interaction between the Independent variables; therefore, the variables of being a Southern male and being insulted interact with each other to produce the effect of increased aggression, while being a Northern male and being insulted produces a different interaction as to prevent increased aggression.

The last advantage of using a two-variable design ANOVA is an increase in statistical power. If you recall, power is the ability to confidently reject a false NULL hypothesis. This type of research design increases statistical power because the within groups variance tends to be smaller than the within-group variance of a comparable one-variable study (two, one-way ANOVA's). If you recall, the smaller the variance the less fluctuation in measure; therefore, the smaller the F-ratio; therefore, the smaller the confidence interval which means that we are more likely to have chosen a smaller range of possible values which, in turn, restricts the range of possible values for statistical significance; thus, greater statistical power in correctly rejecting a false NULL hypothesis.

=== Summary ===
The advantages of using a two-variable design via Two-Way ANOVA:
*Decrease in cost
*The ability to analyze the interaction of two independent variables
*Increased statistical power due to smaller variance

== The Logic of Two-Variable Design ==

The first concept to consider with a two-variable design is the concept of a treatment combination. Initially, when we design a two-variable study, we select the number of levels we want to use for each variable. Because we combine the two variable into one study, we create something call a '''factorial design'''. A Factorial design represents a study that includes an independent group for each possible combination of levels for the independent variable. For example, in the Cohen et al. (1996) experiment, there are two levels of the insult condition and two levels of participant background. Because of this, the study uses a 2*2 factorial design. This design creates 4 independent groups, because it takes each level of each independent variable and multiplies them. In the Cohen experiment, there are 2 levels for the independent variable insult (control, and insulted) and two levels for the independent variable culture (Northern or Southern); therefore, there are 2 independent variable with 2 levels each. Thus, it is a 2*2 factorial design. An example below:

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
|+ Cohen et al. 2*2 factorial design
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;Background of Participant 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Factor A&lt;br/&gt;Insult Condition
|-
! Control a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
! Insult a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Northern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|-
| Southern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|}

Each combination of levels for the independent variable creates a treatment condition or cell. A 2*2 factorial design creates 4 treatment conditions or cells. If a study has 3 levels of one independent variable and 4 levels of another independent variable, then this study creates 12 treatment conditions or cells.

When both variables are between-subjects variables, we can conclude that the individual cells are independent groups. Independence means that the data collected for one cell do not correlate with the other cells.
B.General linear model

When we discussed the one-way ANOVA, we learned that the logic under one-way ANOVA is the general linear model. We learned that each observation is the sum of the baseline grand mean plus treatment effect and plus the random error within group.

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij}= \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\sum \alpha_i=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

The logic of the two-way ANOVA is also the general linear model. However, in the general linear model for the two-way ANOVA, there are two more components:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ijk}= \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j+ (\alpha\beta)_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}\,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\sum \alpha_i=0,\ \sum \beta_j=0,\ \sum (\alpha\beta)_{ij}=0,\ \,&lt;/math&gt;

That is, individual observation Xijk is the sum of the baseline grand mean, the effect of independent variable A at level i, the effect of independent variable B at level j, the joint effect, called interaction,  of A at level i and B at level j, and the random error within the group of the combination of A at level i and B at level j.
It is common practice to note a specific mean by replacing the index of averaging by a dot. The total of grand mean, the average over all indices, is then indicated by:

:&lt;math&gt;M = X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The estimates for the effects, i.e. the parameters &amp;mu;, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and  (&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;)&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;M=X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_i=X_{i..}-X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_j=X_{.j.}-X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(ab)_{ij}=X_{ij.}-X_{i..}-X_{.j.}+X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
|+ Cohen et al. 2*2 factorial design
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;Background of Participant 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Factor A&lt;br/&gt;Insult Condition
|-
! Control a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
! Insult a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Northern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|-
| Southern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|}

For example, for the first subject in the first cell (X1jk), the observed score would be the sum of the grand mean (M), the difference between mean score for all subjects in the control group (Ma1) and the grand mean (M), the difference between mean score for all subjects from northern (Mb1) and the grand mean (M), the difference between the mean score in the first cell (Ma1b1) and the mean scores of the two independent variables at particular levels, and the difference between the observed score and the mean score in the first cell (which represents the within group random error).

	X1jk = M + (Ma1-M) + (Mb1-M) + (Ma1b1- Ma1- Mb1+M) + (X1jk - Ma1b1)

=== C. Components of sum of square ===

To test the significance of the mentioned effects, the total variance is analysed, i.e. decomposed in appropriate parts, concerning the various estimates:
:&lt;math&gt;SST=\sum (X_{ijk}-X_{...})^2=
\sum (X_{ijk}-X_{ij.}+X_{ij.}-X_{i..}-X_{.j.}+X_{...}+X_{i..}-X_{...}+X_{.j.}-X_{...})^2=  \,&lt;/math&gt;

::=&lt;math&gt;\sum (X_{ijk}-X_{ij.})^2+\sum (X_{ij.}-X_{i..}-X_{.j.}+X_{...})^2+\sum (X_{i..}-X_{...})^2+\sum (X_{.j.}-X_{...})^2= &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;= SSE + SSAB + SSB + SSA \,&lt;/math&gt;

If we rearrange the above equation, we get:

	'''X1jk - M= (Ma1-M) + (Mb1-M) + (Ma1b1- Ma1- Mb1+M) + (X1jk - Ma1b1)'''

We can see that the deviation of each observation from the grand mean is sum of the deviation of the mean score of the first independent variable at one particular level from the grand mean, the deviation of the mean score of the second independent variable at one particular level from the grand mean, the deviation of the mean score of the combination of two independent variables from the mean scores of the two independent variables at particular levels, and the random error.

If we square all the parts of the equation and sum the deviations for all the subjects, we get:

SStotal=SSA+SSB+SSAB+SSwithin

The above equation indicates that the sum of square of total can be decomposed into four parts, the sum of square between different levels of the first independent variable, the sum of square between different levels of the second independent variable, the sum of square between different combinations of the two independent variables (that is, between different cells), and sum of square within groups.

===D. Components of variance===

If we divide the sum of square with corresponding degree of freedom, we get five types of variance.
Total variance is the sum of square divided by total degree of freedom (N-1). Total variance is also called mean square of total.
The variance due to an independent variable is the sum of square of the independent variable divided by degree of freedom for this variable. The degree of freedom for an independent variable is the number of levels of the independent variable minus 1. Therefore, the variance due to insult condition in the above example is SSA/(2-1) (dfA=j-1). The variance due to participant background is SSB/(2-1) (dfB=k-1). 

The variance due to the combination (or interaction) of the two independent variable is the sum of square of combinations divided by the interaction degree of freedom which is the product of two degrees of freedom of two independent variables, dfAB=dfA*dfB=(j-1)*(k-1).

The variance within is the sum of square of within divided by the degree of freedom within which is N-j*k.

== Main effects and interaction ==
A.Main effects
A main effect refers to the effect that one independent variable has on the dependent variable holding the effects of the other variables constant. Specifically, a main effect represents a special form of the between-groups variance of a single-independent variable.
In a two-factor ANOVA, there are two main effects, one for each factor. When we examine the data using an ANOVA, each main effect can be either statistically significant or not statistically significant. Consequently, there are four potential patterns of results:

1)A statistically significant main effect for Factor A but not for Factor B

[[Image:sign_maineffect_no_interaction.GIF|center]]

2)A statistically significant main effect for Factor B but not for Factor A

[[Image:sig_fact_b_not_a.gif|center]]

3)Statistically significant main effects for both factors

[[Image:sig_effect_both.GIF|center]]

The two lines are parallel and there is no interaction between the two independent variables. The relationship between on independent variable, for example, the relationship between insult condition and reaction, is not different at different level of the second variable, the backgrounds of the participants in this example.
4)No statistically significant main effects for both factors


B.Interaction
An interaction indicates that the effect of one variable is not consistent across all levels of the other variables. That is, the relationship between one independent variable is different at different levels of the other variable. All the above figures indicate situations of no interaction. When there is no interaction, the two lines are parallel. When there is interaction, the two will not be parallel. For a 2*2 factorial design, there are four possible interactions:
1) There is a statistically significant main effect for Factor A, the insult condition. But there is not statistically significant main effect for Factor B.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 6.0
| 6.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 3.0
| 9.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 4.5
| 7.5
| 6.0
|}

			
There is a main effect for Factor A, the insult condition. That is, without considering the background difference, there is significant difference between the control group (M=4.5) and the insult group (7.5).
There is no significant main effect for Factor B, the background. That is, without considering the insult condition difference, there is no difference between the southerner (M=6.0) and the northerner (6.0).
There is interaction between the two factors. The southerner had greatly elevated testosterone levels after they had been insulted. By contrast, the northern participants’ testosterone did not change across the two insult conditions.
The hallmark of the interaction is that the two lines are not parallel.

2) There is statistically significant main effect for Factor B, but there is not statistically significant main effect for Factor A.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 6.0
| 3.0
| 4.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 6.0
| 9.0
| 7.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 6.0
| 6.0
| 6.0
|}
			
There is a main effect for participant background. Without considering the insult condition difference, the southerners have higher testosterone level (M=7.5) than do the northerners (M=4.5).
There is no main effect for the insult conditions. Without considering the background difference, the participants in the control group (M=6.0) have similar testosterone level as the participants in the insult group have (M=6.0). 
There is interaction between the two factors. The insult had opposite effects on the southern and northern participants. The insult caused the southern participant’s testosterone to increase whereas the testosterone for the northern participants decreased.

3) Both main effects are statistically significant and there is interaction.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 3.0
| 6.0
| 4.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 3.0
| 12.0
| 7.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 3.0
| 9.0
| 6.0
|}
				
There is statistically significant main effect of Factor A. Without considering the background difference, there is significant difference between the control group (M=3.0) and the insult group (9.0).
There is statistically significant main effect of Factor B. Without considering the insult background difference, the southerners have higher testosterone level (M=7.5) than do the northerners (M=4.5).
There is statistically significant interaction between the two factors. The insult condition raised the testosterone levels. In addition to that, southern participants had, overall, greater increases in testosterone levels than did the northern participants.
4)Neither main effect is statistically significant, but the interaction is.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 3.0
| 9.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 9.0
| 3.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 6.0
| 6.0
| 6.0
|}

There is no main effect for the insult conditions. Without considering the background difference, the participants in the control group (M=6.0) have similar testosterone level as the participants in the insult group have (M=6.0). 
There is no significant main effect for Factor B, the background. That is, without considering the insult condition difference, there is no difference between the southerner (M=6.0) and the northerner (6.0).
However, there is statistically significant interaction. For southerners, insult increases the testosterone level. For northerners, insult decreases the testosterone level.

==Early history==
Greece has been occupied for ten thousand years. The Greek archaeologist, Christos Tsountas (1857–1934) discovered a major Neolithic site at the modern day village of Sesklo in Thessaly (central Greece) which dates to the seventh millennium. The Sesklo site was occupied until 1500 BC. From the third millennium the Greek mainland was invaded by tribes of an Indo-European language speaking group who referred to themselves as Hellenes, which arrived in two separate waves and transformed the culture of the region. The first group formed the basis of the Mycenaean culture, which traded as far as Egypt and Lebanon/Syria and fought the Trojan War. The second group, which ultimately formed the Doric subgroup of Greeks, entered after the Trojan War, destroyed Mycenae, and started a dark age which ended with the efflorescence of Greek culture beginning around 600 BC.  In early Greek history 'Greece' as we know it today did not exist. Instead, it was a collection of warring city-states (called ''poleis'', singluar: ''polis'') unified only by shared language, religion and culture. Two of the more important poleis were Athens and Sparta, speaking different dialects of Greek; Doric and Ionian, and having different cultural bases and histories. Ultimately, these differences expressed themselves as different forms of government. One afternoon as 12 year old Alexander, the prince of Macedonia, watched his father, King Phillip II, barter over a horse. It was a fine black stalion. After hopeless taming,the horse became his and he called him Bucephalus.

===Early Athens===

The founding of Athens is not well documented. It is known that Dorians originally founded the town, a northern tribe that invaded Greece and later settled (introducing the horse). Therefore, Athens maintained a few tribal customs, such as the popular assembly (the basis of the later Athenian democracy). Early Athenian society boiled down into two classes: the peasants, and the rich 'Hippes'. The peasants would borrow grain from the Hippes to plant and pay it back out of their harvest. While all matters were settled through a vote, there were two assemblies: one in which everyone could participate, and one reserved for the Hippes. This gave the Hippes the majority of the political power in early Athens. The society continued in this manner until the Mediterranean slave trade reached Athens. Once this happened, the peasants began to use surplus wealth to buy slaves and use them to farm their land. The Hippes, fearing that the peasants could begin to rival their wealth, began to enslave peasants who were late in repaying their debts. This sparked a long and bloody civil war, which continued for almost twenty years between the Hippes and the recurring peasant militias. These militias requested aid from Sparta, another powerful city-state, which deposed the Hippes and enforced a few laws governing Athens, which included freedom from slavery for all Athenian citizens (while slavery was still legal). The Athenians went on to build a powerful army and eventually aid the Ionians in revolt against the Persians.

Sparta was one of the most militarily powerful city-states in Greece. While Sparta had existed for a considerable time prior, Spartan history really begins with Lykurgos. Lykurgos was a Spartan aristocrat who enacted a number of reforms to spartan society which brought it to its recognizable form. Some of Lykurgos' reforms included a prohibition on any currency other than iron, a requirement that all men eat all meals in public mess halls, and that all ceilings be finished with an axe rather than carved. The Spartans proceeded to attack their neighbors to acquire helots (slaves) to farm the land while they concentrated on military matters. They later joined the Athenians in their war against the Persians.

==Triumphs and contributions==

Even though the Greek civilization was not the first to develop many studies of the arts and sciences, they were among the first &quot;western&quot; people to do so, and set up lasting techniques and methods which would be used as a basis until the Renaissance. Their architecture, along with the Romans, have inspired many architects and engineers. One kind of example is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to the Greek goddess of wisdom, Athena.

==Beginning of the End==

The Greek civilization with its independent city states such as Athens, Thebes, Sparta and its loose confederations were no match, however, against the military stratagems of Philip of Macedon or his son Alexander. They were a forerunner of the rising power of Rome, which under its generals would eventually come to conquer Greece.  But if Greece were conquered, the Romans would adapt the Greek culture, keeping it alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Beekeeping bee brush.jpg|thumb|right|A Bee Brush]]

A bee brush is a soft bristled brush that can be used to gently, and harmlessly, remove bees from a surface. The bee brush is best used in small scale to move fewer bees per session, if the desired goal is to move bees quickly, in quantity the [[Beekeeping/Bee Blower| bee blower]] may be the proper tool.
Bee brushes are made with long, soft, non-ridged bristles, which are gentle enough for moving bees off of delicate comb and firm enough to remove bees from old frames, equipment or the beekeeper. When used properly, a bee brush will not injure bees. 

==Usage==
To remove bees from a surface, carefully and quickly brush the bee brush perpendicular from the surface to be cleaned. Do not press to hard, especially on open brood cells and open honey cells, as you may either injure brood or make a mess of the honey. 

Bee brushes may be used to clear honeycomb of bees, so to harvest the honey, however this may be a time consuming and difficult task. If the intention is to remove bees quickly from the [[Beekeeping/Honey Super| honey super]] there exist sever options including use of a [[Beekeeping/Bee Blower| bee blower]], a [[Beekeeping/Fume Board| fume board]], or a [[Beekeeping/Bee Escape| bee escape]].

==Selecting a Bee Brush==
Though useful, some beekeepers stay clear of a ready-made brush, and use a clump of grass, leaves or large feathers. Despite the bee brush’s many available competitors, having a ready to use bee brush at an instants notice is indispensable.

==Buying a Brush==
Don't be tempted to purchase other generic brushes to be used as a bee brush. Bee brushes are made with very soft bristles so as not to harm bees. Know the approximate firmness of a brush before purchasing one.

==Maintenance==
*Occasionally a bee brush will come in to contact with [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]] or  [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]], in such a case it is advised to clean it with warm water and a gentile detergent, such as Dawn, if necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Beekeeping mouse guard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal Mouse Guard]]

Mouse guards serve the purpose of restricting access to a beehive by pests such as [[Beekeeping/Mice| mice]] and [[Beekeeping/Skunks| skunks]]. Some can simultaneously be used like a [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducer| entrance reducer]] and control traffic, temperature and ventilation within a hive.

==Usage==
Most often, mouse guards are used prior to the onset and during the winter months to prevent mice from choosing a beehive as a hibernation spot. It is also not uncommon for mouse guards to be used year round in some locales to help in the control of pests.
Mouse guards are often designed to be nailed or stapled across the entrance of a hive, between the [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| bottom board]] and the lower [[Beekeeping/Hive Body| hive body]].

==Selecting an Entrance Reducer==
When selecting an entrance reducer, be sure that it is made of a material that a mouse or other pest cannot chew through. Mice will gleefully chew through wooden or thin plastic guards; thus, metal is often the best option.
Some mouse guards are similar in design to small [[Beekeeping/Queen Excluders| queen excluder]]; using one of these means that not only is the [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen]] stuck inside the hive, but so are the [[Beekeeping/Drone Bee| drones]]. Dead and dying drone bodies can easily seal up the entrance and prevent worker bees from transiting to complete their necessary business.

==Maintenance==
*Entrance reducers may need to be occasionally scraped of [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] but should otherwise not need any real maintenance.
*Be sure to regularly clean dead bees from the entrance reducer and the opening to the beehive; this will help to prevent the hive from accidentally being sealed.

[[Image:Strucla sweet bread02.jpg|right|thumb|poppy seeds on [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]]]
'''Poppy seeds''' are tiny blue-grey oily seeds. They are about 1 [[Cookbook:mm|mm]] across at most.

Poppy seeds can be added to almost any [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] recipe by sprinkling or rolling the [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] in the seeds before baking it, much as one might do for [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]].
Poppy seeds are especially popular on [[Cookbook:Bagel|bagels]].

==Warning==
Eating poppy seeds can cause people to fail drug tests. 

According Encyclopædia Britannica Online: &quot;tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed.&quot;

However it is proven that eating poppy seeds does give false positives on drug tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the beginning, there was nothing but Chaos. Out of the chaos, Night and Erebus (The personification of Death and Shadow) materialized. They gave birth to Love, who in turn created Light and Day. Then came Gaea (earth), and Tartarus (the deepest pit in the world).  Gaea first bore Uranus (heaven), and  then she brought forth terrible creatures: The hundred-handers, who had a hundred hands and fifty heads, the Cyclopes, enormous creatures with only one eye, and the Titans.  Uranus hated the Hundred-handers, and imprisoned all of them in Tartarus.  Gaea didnt like this.  She decided to have Cronus (one of the Titans) castrate his father with a jagged sickle.  Cronus threw the severed members behind him and from the bloody drops earth conceived the Furies and Giants.   

Cronus then began to fear for his own life when he was given a propecy that one of his own children (birthed by Rhea, who was his sister and wife) would overcome him as he did with his father.  So he ate them one by one as they were delivered by Rhea. When Zeus was born, however, Rhea hid him in a cave on Crete, and gave Cronus a rock wrapped in a blanket instead. Cronus swallowed the rock, thinking that it was Zeus.

&lt;pre&gt;
The furies of the Gods
attend to mortals,
to keep us in our place.
Oh, the stories they tell!

Of mother Rhea
hiding her youngest son
in a cave in the island of Crete, 
defying Cronus the Titan.

Zeus, full-grown,
rescues Poseidon and Hades
from his father`s vomitus
with Hestia, Demeter and Hera.

The Titans fall before
their children;
father vanquished
imprisoned in Tartarus.

Spoils shared by brothers;
Hades the Underworld,
Poseidon the Sea,
Zeus the Sky and Earth.

The story retold in Genesis
as the God of Earth and Sky
Creates his children,
Yet dares them to defy
His dicta.

Adam and Eve,
striving for immortality,
oppose His will,
thus freeing theirs.

But oh, the price of
knowledge
in the presence 
of their mortality;
only half Gods,
the abyss immutably
beckons.

Yet among them,
the fearless,
from Lascoux to
Argentuil;
The Artists who draw
Courage
from their Creations
and thus become
immortal. 

Deabler, V.T.
&lt;/pre&gt;
When Zeus became fully grown, he forced Cronus to vomit out his brothers and sisters. After this, they went to war with the Titans. The Gods, with the help of the hundred-handers, who they released from Tartarus, eventually won over the Titans and threw all of them into Tartarus, with the exception of Atlas, who was condemned to hold the world up for eternity.
The Gods, however, faced more challenges to their authority. Gaia had given birth to a terrible monster named Typhon, who rose up against the gods. Zeus managed to strike Typhon down with a lightning bolt. Afterwards, the Giants, who had arose from Uranus's blood, also rose up against the Gods. Zeus defeated them too, and threw them into Tartarus. After this, when all threats to the Gods' authority were crushed, Zeus and his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, drew lots to see what part of the world each would rule. Zeus ended up ruling the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld.

&lt;big&gt;'''The Creation of Man'''&lt;/big&gt;

The Greeks created many accounts of how man was created. These were the two most popular:

In the first account, it is said that Prometheus and his brother, Epimetheus, decided to create living creatures on the Earth. Epimetheus created animals, but gave them all of the best gifts, such as fur, feathers, strength, and cunning, leaving nothing for mankind. Prometheus then created man, and decided to still make mankind superior to the animals by giving them fire, which he stole from Olympus.
In the second account, the Gods created mankind. First, they made mankind out of gold. This golden race lived a life without toil and worry. However, they were mortal, and eventually they died out. After this, the Gods created mankind out of silver. They were very stupid, and ended up killing each other. In the third attempt, the Gods made mankind out of Brass. They enjoyed war, and built up strong armies. Eventually, they destroyed themselves through war. The last race was made out of Iron. They were very evil, and are the race that now inhabit Earth.

This is the '''traditional pie crust'''. To ensure a flakey crust (considered desirable), you need to use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] and you need to keep the lard from melting. It's best to use a cold stone [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] and surface, and to generally keep everything in the refrigerator until used.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# Sift 775 g (a pound and a half) of flour, and take out a quarter for rolling cut in it 110 g of lard (a quarter of a pound), mixed with water and roll it out; cut 110 g (half a pound) of butter, and put it in at two rollings with the flour that was left out.
# For making the bottom crust of pies, put 110 g of lard into 450 g of flour, with a little salt, mix it stiff, and grease the plates before you make pies; always make your paste in a cold place and bake it soon. Some persons prefer mixing crust with milk instead of water.

'''Pie crust''' is the shell which forms the outside of a [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]]. Old-style pie crusts are made of [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]]. They are usually bland, flakey, and somewhat greasy. Many modern pies use crumb crusts, consisting of [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] crumbs or [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|graham cracker]] crumbs held together with [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. Crumb crusts are generally sweeter and more flavorful than pastry ones.

The underside of a pie is always covered. The top may be uncovered (open-topped), fully covered by a crust, or covered by a lattice top crust, which covers some areas while leaving the spaces between the lattices exposed. A non-crust pie topping is a [[Cookbook:Crumb_Pie_Topping|crumb pie topping]], which is a rich topping made of loosely blended ingredients, and which, unlike pastry, has little structural integrity.

[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] which have a pastry or biscuit covering on top, but not on bottom, are called crisps or [[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobblers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In social psychology, impression management is the process through which people try to control the impressions other people form of them. It is usually synonymous with self-presentation.

The goal is for one to present themselves the way in which they would like to be thought of by the individual or group they are interacting with. This form of management generally applies to the first impression.

Impression management (IM) is the goal-directed conscious or unconscious attempt to influence the perceptions of other people about a person, object or event by regulating and controlling information in social interaction. If a person tries to influence the perception of her or his own image, this activity is called self-presentation. Strategic interpersonal behavior to shape or influence impressions formed by an audience is not a new field; it has a rich history. Plato spoke of the &quot;great stage of human life&quot; and Shakespeare crafted the famous sentence &quot;All the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players&quot; in the seventeenth century. Goffman (Goffman, 1959) also followed in his seminal book &quot;The presentation of self in everyday life&quot; a dramaturgical analogy. Impression management (IM) is situated in social psychology.

The audience can be real or imaginary. IM style norms, part of the mental programming received through socialization, are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them. While an actor (speaker) tries to project a desired image, an audience (listener) might attribute a resonant or discordant image.

      <comment>/* The Theory */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Theory==
'''Ethnomethodology''' is a perspective within sociology which focuses on the way people make sense of their everyday world. People are seen as rational actors, but employ practical reasoning rather than formal logic to make sense of and function in society. The theory argues that human society is entirely dependent on these methods of achieving and displaying understanding. The approach was developed by [[w:Harold Garfinkel|Harold Garfinkel]], based on [[w:Alfred Schütz|Alfred Schütz's]] [[w:phenomenology|phenomenological]] reconstruction of [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber's]] [[w:verstehen|verstehen]] sociology.

Like [[w:Durkheim|Durkheim]], the fundamental sociological phenomenon for ethnomethodologists is the social fact.  But, unlike Durkheim, the social fact is not external of the individual.  The social fact is the product of the social member's methodological activities; it is their understanding of their everyday world.  Members, here, are understood not simply as individuals but any social entity (i.e., individuals and organizations) that can produce a social fact.  In short, members of society (individuals and organizations) make sense of and function in society by creating social facts or understandings of how society works. In this sense, ethnomethodology is at the same time both macro and micro oriented in that members can produce social facts at either level, for either the personal structure (the individual's level of everyday meaning) or the organizational/institutional structure (the organization's level of everyday meaning).

One of the key points of the theory is that ethnomethods or social facts are ''reflexively accountable''.  ''Accounts'' are the ways members describe or explain specific situations.  ''Accounting'' is the process of describing or explaining social situations or how members make sense of their everyday world. Ethnomethodologists are interested in both the account and the method by which the account is made meaningful to the recipient of the account, and tend to emphasize the latter.  The interest is not in determining if the account is accurate or otherwise judging the account but rather in exploring how the account is conveyed. For example, the explanation given by a husband for arriving home late at night is an account.  The ethnomethodologist is interested in both the account and the methods used to convey that account to the recipient, in this case, the wife. Whether the account is factual or not does not interest the ethnomethodologist.

Sociology, generally, seeks to provide accounts of society. Ethnomethodologists view such accounts - sociological ones - the same way they view the account given by the husband above.  In other words, ethnomethodologists break down the accounts given by other sociologists (and other scientists, for that matter) the same way they break down the accounts of interpersonal interaction in romantic relationships.  Ethnomethodologists are not interested in whether or not the accounts given by sociologists are accurate but rather are interested in the accounts that are given and the methods used to develop and convey those accounts.

The accounts people use to explain their behavior or help them understand social interactions are generally taken for granted (e.g., you don't have to ask permission to use the restroom in your own home).  To illustrate how these accounts are usually taken for granted, ethnomethodologists have used research methods in the past that 'breach' or 'break' the everyday routine of interaction in order to reveal the work that goes into maintaining the normal flow of life. Some examples include: 
*pretending to be a stranger in one's own home
*blatantly cheating at board games
*attempting to bargain for goods on sale in stores

In most of these situations, the individuals who are unaware that the researcher is intentionally breaching social norms attempt to explain the ''breacher's'' behavior by providing accounts for them.  These interventions demonstrate the creativity with which ordinary members of society are able to interpret and maintain the unspoken social order that ethnomethodologists study.      
      by SARTAJ NAZIR

==Impact of Ethnomethodology==
While ethnomethodology is often seen as being removed from more mainstream sociology, it has proven to be influential. For instance, ethnomethodology notes that words are reliant for their meaning based on the context in which they are used; they are ''[[w:indexicality|indexical]]''. This has led to insights into the objectivity of social science and the difficulty in establishing a description of human behavior which has an objective status outside the context of its creation. Ethnomethodology has also influenced the [[w:Sociology of Scientific Knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]] by providing a research strategy that precisely describes the methods of its research subjects without the necessity of evaluating their validity. This proved to be useful to researchers studying social order in laboratories who wished to understand how scientists conducted their experiments without either endorsing or criticising their activities. 

Ethnomethodology has had an impact on [[w:linguistics|linguistics]] and particularly on [[w:pragmatics|pragmatics]]. Ethnomethodological studies of work have played a significant role in the field of [[w:human-computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], informing design by providing engineers with descriptions of the practices of users. Additionally, ethnomethodologically informed management and leadership studies are newly emerging fields.

Worthy of separate mention, ethnomethodology has developed what is often considered a sub-field or perhaps an entirely new discipline, [[Sociological Theory/Conversation Analysis|conversation analysis]], which has its own chapter.

==Notes==
The Greek roots of Ethnomethodology literally mean ''the methods people use''.

The '''beet''', sometimes called '''beetroot''' to distinguish it from the less-commonly-eaten leafy green upper part, is a root crop with an intense purple-red color similar to veinous blood. Beet juice is commonly used for coloring or dyeing.

Beets may be [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]], but most beets are sold fresh (possibly peeled and pre-cooked) or canned. They have a uniquely strong, sweet flavor. They are a common source of refined sugar (known as &quot;beet sugar&quot;).

Beets are usually sliced and served as a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] on one side of a plate. They are often used in Eastern European soups.

Young beets, about an inch and a ½-inch diameter are fine textured, tender, and excellent in salads. Medium and large size beets are good for cooking; very large roots are too woody for eating regardless of cooking method. Which ever size of beets you choose, look for smooth, hard, uniformly round beets that are free of cuts and bruises.

It’s best to store beets that have their tops chopped off in individual plastic bags in the coolest part of the refrigerator. These should last up to one week. The greens should be eaten as soon as possible.

Wash and scrub the beets before cooking. Beets peel best after cooking, so wear gloves if you wish to avoid stained hands.

You should cook the beet for about 50 minutes.

While &quot;7 handfulls&quot; is terribly vague, removing this hint makes things even more vague.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ArchivePage}}

This archive page covers approximately the dates between January 2004 and January 2005.

==Main page appearance==

=== Remove of book listings on the front page?===
* Just too many books to list here
* When you click on a topic, the list of books under that topic are most likely different then the books on the front page (either the author adds it to the topic listing or directly to the front page). 

Lets just simplify it and put all the books on topic pages and have one or two books per day/per topic as &quot;books of the day&quot; for the front page--[[User:RobKohr|RobKohr]] 17:17, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

=== Book of the month ===
I would like to suggest a &quot;book of the month&quot;, similar to how it is working in the [[de:Hauptseite|German version of Wikibooks]], because it seems to work quite well there: Every month all registered Wikibook users can vote from a couple of nominated books for beeing next month's &quot;book of the month&quot;. I guess Wikibooks is maturing to allow for 12 excellent books to be displayed on the main page a year (similar to Wikipedia's &quot;Featured article&quot;). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 18:39, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: I would like to reserve at least a quarter of the main page for the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]], to increase the value of this award. In the future this should preferably be a well-selected picture with some introductory text to the &quot;book of the month&quot;. In the last week of January, I would like to increase the interest in the vote by placing a '''picture of a big question mark''' '''&quot;?&quot;''' with the last call for voting. I will try to set something up during the next couple of days on my user subpages, and present it here first. If somebody could create a really cool kind of questionmark (maybe floating above a book, ...) that would be great! Otherwise, I would probably only contribute a very simple question mark. Also if you have other suggestions for this, let me know. (PS: Googling around, one can find a few very nice question marks, but I'm not sure whether I can just upload them to the commons?) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 08:15, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:: Here is my suggestion for the change of the main page: [[User:Andreas_Ipp/Main_Page_suggestion]]. If you have administrator right, all you have to do is put these three lines
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===Book of the month===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book of the month}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- so that next header starts below picture --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: before this line. 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===About Wikibooks===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: (The main page has been locked just a week ago by [[User:Gentgeen]], and I don't have administrator rights). Thank you very much! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 12:57, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::: I just found out that the main page was not locked anymore, and I made the change by myself. :-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:17, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

=== Change Featured Wikibooks to Most Active Wikibooks ===
* Since the book of the month (see above) would take the role of the &quot;Featured Wikibooks&quot;, I would suggest to rename Featured Wikibooks to &quot;Most Active Wikibooks&quot; - and list the, say, '''Top 5 of currently active Wikibooks''' (that means highest number of contributors in the last month (can be checked e.g. by &quot;Related changes&quot; or by a still to be defined [[m:Requests_for_queries|SQL query]]). 
* &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; is fine, as books get rotated through, but..
* &quot;Struggling Wikibooks&quot; is quite undefined. It is not clear who can add books to this category and who will take them away again. Either it should be also organized in a kind of rotating manner (add books with a date and delete the first in list), or by some kind of voting system.
* &quot;Wikijunior&quot; is just promotional, but to be fair it should contain a link to the [[m:Wikijunior|Wikijunior background]], stating that it is a project started by the Beck Foundation approaching the Wikimedia Foundation.  --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 19:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I replaced Featured and Struggling Wikibooks by {{bad link|Wikibooks:Top active}}. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:24, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Here the last featured and struggling books:

=== Imitating the new page on Wikipedia ===
If someone has the time to dedicate this main English page could look a lot better if it imitated the clean, colored, outlined-box format of the [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia main page]]. Man this page does not look so nice to me in terms of the three pasty colored boxes (even though I helped design it) and the Wikipedia page looks very nice. We should of course keep the pretty icons .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:I went ahead and did my best shot of redesigning the main page in the shadow of the 'Pedia. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:: I don't like it. I have to scroll down loads to get to the books I want. The blank space on the right looks bad. I would revert, but it is the main page of course, so I would like more opinions. It doesn't matter much to me, actually, because I just type &quot;LD&quot; or &quot;HSE&quot; into the top-left box and use the Go button. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 12:21, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:::I like it a bit - I agree there are problems , but I think they can be overcome. We have too many books to list them all on the first page now. I think we should list categories only. Languages in particular are a huge list. We could also have the book column wider than the community one. That should solve the problem of blank space on the LHS. I think it's a good idea to have our front page similar to wikipedia's. It lets users know visually that we are a sister project. It's branding. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:19, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:My last edit should improve things a bit, making the book names flow accross the lines instead of having a line break after each one. Maybe we should get rid of the red dots too, using the top box to showcase the more completed books. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:What do y'all think ? Looking better ? 

: Should we include the little red (and yellow) dots again that indicate levels of completion ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::I liked them.  They made it easy to check at a glance if a book was ready to read for reading's sake, or more under construction.  When a user goes to a book, they shouldn't expect it to be mostly done if it's just beginning.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 01:42, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Finally, the Main (English) page looks nice because the rightmost side of the right column isn't cut off like it used to be sometimes in the past.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 15:52, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)
:Thanks for that comment. It still is cut off, just not so blatantly. But also notice that ''this'' discussion is from February. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 21:18, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

=== Cologne Blue Skin ===

It looks like the Style Sheet for the Wikibooks has a little problem... 
On the Cologne Blue style underneath the logo pic, it still says &quot;The Free Encyclopedia&quot;, instead of the (i think proper) &quot;The free textbook project&quot;.  btw, this problem is the same with the other wikimedia pages as well  --[[User:Mobius|Mobius]] 08:44, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== Centered change ===

I don't like it, I think it looks very ugly (sorry) - however, Karl still hasn't reverted it, meaning that at least he prefers it that way. Opinions? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:48, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I changed it so it now has a buffer zone of 23% on the left, and 25% on the right. I think it looks better, but I'm not sure about how large the buffers on each side should be, as screen sizes differ from user to user. --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 06:59, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== Logo design ===

It would be an improvement to see the slogan read &quot;Think freely. Learn freely&quot; rather than &quot;Think free. Learn free&quot; under the Wikibooks logo; someone coming here to learn something might be slightly put off by a source of knowledge which doesn't know the difference between an adjective and an adverb. [[User:Paul Clenton|Paul Clenton]]

I am thinking about modifying the logo to mimic the more elegant Wikipedia logo (as the designer of the current logo I feel confident in saying this). I am thinking of a smooth, gray version of the current. What kind of images could we put on the front of the top book that suggest learning / education / academia / textbooks ? eyeglasses, a feather in an inkwell, bust of Wm Shakespeare, human skeleton, strand of DNA, a sailing ship, a compass, a lightning bolt, a human brain, a radioactive physics-type symbol (as now), etc etc. Help me figure out what makes sense here. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I don't like the sailing ship or lightning bolt. Apart from that any of the images you have in mind would be great. My ideas include Rodin's &quot;the thinker&quot;. A bust of any of the classical philosphers, a [[w:Mortarboard|mortarboard]], A scroll or something that looks like a diplomer. You could also put words along the spines of the books. It would have to be simple. Something like &quot;Quantum electrodynamics for dummies&quot; would be amusing but impractical. Something like maths, poetry, french, science on each of the spines would indicate the range of different subjects on offer. That's all I can think of at the moment. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:23, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)
: I like the logo the way it is... I don't think it needs changing - it's simple and elegant and a little more interesting than it would be in plain grey. [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 02:27, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Besides the logo in the upper-left corner of each page, could we update the &quot;favicon.ico&quot; ? ( http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/FavIcon ) ? At the moment the Wikipedia &quot;favicon.ico&quot; is identical to the Wikibooks &quot;favicon.ico&quot;.

:I second the call for a new favicon. All that's needed is shrinking down the present logo. A unigue favicon would help people differentiate between Wikipedia and Wikibooks bookmarks in the Favorite Places or Shortcut Bar. -- [[User:Everlong|Everlong]]

Good job Karl. I like Theresas idea of 'The Thinker' and would like to see a simputer or PDA in there. Books have had it (well maybe in a few hundred years time . . .) I would suggest a pile of books with an 'explosive' Light - all the knowledge symbols coming out with a childs face behind as if reading a screen (perhaps wearing a mortar board) This is similar to the world jigsaw created in the wikipdea logo [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 10:41, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

=== Wikibook arrangement ===

I don't know if anyone else feels the same but I think the arrangement of wikibooks by developmental stages to be uneasy to the eyes. Also, when a wikibook progresses to the next stage, it is moved further up the listing which just adds to more unpleasantness. I think a fixed alphabetical arrangement would be best since the stage icon next to the wikibook link shows what stage it's at anyway. So when a wikibook progresses to the next stage, we only change the icon, no need to move the wikibook link around. Shuffling of the links is just not user friendly. I forgot what the technical term is... the principles of design... such as ease of readability, navigation, etc. What do the rest of you think? &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 22:26, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I was the one who came up with that idea, and the only person that said anything was [[User:NeuronExMachina|NeuronExMachina]], who liked it. See below, at [[#Books: Arrange books by completion]]. Should we put it to a vote? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 01:30, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: Sure. &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 01:29, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Book completion ==

What do you think of the high ratio of stubby books to books which are even only partially written?

=== Key to Completion Labels ===

{| style=&quot;float:right; width:50%&quot;&gt;
 ! style=&quot;background:#e2e2ff; border:2px solid #e2e2ff; border-bottom:none; padding:0.3em 0.5em; font-size:large; text-align:center;&quot; | ''' Textbooks '''
 |-
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;background:#f8f8ff; border:2px solid #e2e2ff; border-top:none; padding:0.6em; padding-top:none;&quot; |
{| style=&quot;background:#CCFFCC; border:2px solid #99FF99; font-size:small;&quot;
 | style=&quot;border-right:1px solid #CCCCCC; padding:0px 3px;&quot;| [[File:25%.svg|16x16px]] - In Development

 | style=&quot;padding:0px 3px;&quot;| [[File:100%.svg|16x16px]] - Complete Edition
 |}
 |-
 | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | ''The Books''
 |}

Here's my idea for a key to the completion labels in the Textbooks box.  I think it's easier to read than the paragraph at the top.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 04:40, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
: Good idea, I'll implement it --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 11:04, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
: I also changed the images, making them thinner and darker so their a bit less conspicuous and don't drown out the titles/links --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 12:10, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I like the new images, but I don't like the idea of &quot;completed&quot; books. Can we come up with some other phrasing ? Usable perhaps ?  Complete gives the impression that there is nothing left to do. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:31, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:That's why I used &quot;edition&quot;; a &quot;complete edition&quot; means it's in a full, complete form, but can still be updated and made better.  It has attained 1.0-ness.  If you think it's too strong though, perhaps &quot;full&quot; or somehting like it.  I don't like &quot;being finalized&quot; for this reason; a &quot;complete edition&quot; shouldn't be a &quot;final edition&quot;.  &quot;Being touched up&quot; wasn't very professional, though.  Anyone have a better term?  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 11:05, 1 Mar 2004

What about
:&quot;completed initial draft&quot;
:&quot;Ready to use&quot;
:&quot;All topics covered&quot;
:&quot;A beta version&quot;
:&quot;Ready for testing&quot;

Do you like any of these. As for being touched up. It may not sound professional, but it's very clear what is meant. I say keep it. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:15, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Actually, thinking about it again, &quot;Being touched up&quot; sounds like it's approaching finalization too.  I like &quot;completed initial draft&quot; and &quot;All topics covered&quot; for the final phase, though.  Maybe we need to look into what we mean by &quot;[[Image:Yellow.png]]&quot;.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 21:45, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: Perhaps instead of just blobs of colour you have a red D image for in development; an orange F for being finalised and a green C for complete?

: [http://vischeck.homeip.net/uploads/107817731221094/ Deuteranope simulation] of our Main Page. According to some people in my class who are deuteranope, the simulation and the original version look identical in most cases (for most websites - the only one which was a little different was the bright red Yahoo logo). This seems pretty accurate. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:44, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::I agree-even if you aren't deuteranope, the blobs can be kind of hard to see. [[User:Kagredon|Kagredon]] 01:01, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I tried adding a header but i can't get it too look right, could somebody either fix it or revert it? Also about the letter/images, I'm trying too keep the images as small as possible kinda inconspicuos, because I looked at the old version and I think the drowning out of the text was what ended the previous development status system. Some random guy also made the names better, thanks whoever you are :) --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 23:48, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I pulled the header into the table; think it looks pretty good.  I'd use a better phrase than &quot;Development Scheme&quot;, though.  If I could come up with one.  I also think that &quot;Intermittent&quot; is a very odd choice for yellow.  As I said above, I think we need to better define what yellow means.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 01:53, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I added a section on the right for better development stages descriptions, and made the names better (i think). Hope you like it. --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 09:33, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I've replaced &quot;guru&quot; with &quot;comprehensive&quot; as it seems be more reflective of the actual status of development (&quot;guru&quot; in this sense conveys a notion of omniscience, which is not the aim of any single Wikibook). In addition, the portion of text that indicates the completeness of various other Wikimedia projects has been omitted as the scheme is too subjective to be applied towards entire databases. --[[User:Taoster|Taoster]] 18:13, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== Completion label feedback ===
I like the color-blind-friendly blobs ! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:Yes, the little squares are much better&amp;mdash;easier it see. But how does [[Errata]] rate anything but the first level. There is almost no text there? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:30, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::Just a prod at the descriptions - if you were to look at most red books, they have the structure but not the content. The [[lucid dreaming]] wikibook really is approaching completion and its structure has barely changed ''at all'' since the first few edits&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. HSE, among other yellow or red books, also has structure as well as content. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 22:58, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; I understand that lucid dreaming is a bit of an anomaly because it doesn't have much content (and won't even after all the reality check pages are finished)

The descriptions are subject to interpretation.. Perhaps a better system is &quot;testing&quot; a wikibook. Level 1 - Outline of the book; Level 2 - Most (ie. more than 50%) of all proposed pages have been drafted; Level 3 - All of the pages have been drafted and finally level 4 - all initally proposed pages written and checked. Maybe?

Also, I have updated the blobs to be have a transparent background so they look a bit nicer against the style of the Main Page

----

Given the nature of a wiki, the notion of &quot;completion&quot; labels seems fairly useless.  Granted there is an initial period during which the majority of the pages are written, but even established pages can still be edited and revised.  This is to say nothing of pages which may be affected by new technologies or discoveries.  The page revision history readily indicates whether the page is undergoing active development, and coupled with the page itself the stage of development can be ascertained.  I see no reason to append a subjective label.

Lastly, I think the inconsistent use (not all pages have labels) will be highly confusing.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 07:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I disagree. First, I tried to give all Wikibooks labels on the main page, but within Wikibooks, the labeling will vary greatly. I think all Wikibooks on the bookshelves have completion labels, and whenever someone adds a book without it, I add the label. Notice the explanation of the labels on the right side of the main page and at [[Template:Stages2]]. Note that nowhere does it say that pages shouldn't be edited and revised. Also, the labels don't say anything about how fast the book is progressing right now, but rather how much is done so far. If I wanted to learn some obscure language, and we didn't have completion labels, I would be severely disappointed to find just the introduction written. Again, if I wanted to see which foreign languages are the farthest completed, I wouldn't be able to tell as easily as with completion labels. No one wants to read a page from every language book to decide something we can decide for them. We want to make it easy for the reader - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 13:37, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::It is entirely possible to browse the wiki without reading the Main Page, and thus have no idea as to the significance of the symbols, as was the case when I first encountered them.  Perhaps the symbols themselves could be linked to the explanation.  Having subsequently read about the symbols, I'd suggest changing the orientation of the intermediary symbols.  Two vertically stacked blocks can readily be confused with a 'B' or an '8'.  I'd replace it with two horizontal blocks -- which interestingly has the effect of appearing as a staircase when taken collectively:

===Time-stamped completion labels===
I created some new templates that should help to provide &quot;time-stamped&quot; [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]. As explained in [[Help:Development stages]], the template is easy to use ( &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage|100%|Jan 16, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{stage|100%|Jan 16, 2005}} ) and provides a descriptive text when you place the mouse above the picture. (template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{stage short|100%|Jan 16, 2005}} is without the small date next to it and can be used in books). This is meant to gradually replace the old images, and the date (&quot;time-stamp&quot;) helps to keep the stages up-to-date. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 18:27, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== About books themselves ==
=== Books: Featured Books ===

Botany and German have been on since [[Template:Featured]] was first made. Could we replace with HSE and something else? (Not [[lucid dreaming]], because then it would be on two lists, and there aren't any new books to replace it on the New list...). Actually, you could just replace them with HSE, the column widths would still be fine. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 19:04, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== Book categorization ===

I would like to start an Arts &amp; Crafts text. Would this be better placed in the Wikipedia Howto section, or is there room for such a text on Wikibooks? If so, in which category should it be placed? All the Wikibooks I have seen so far are very theoretical in nature. --23/4/2004

: &lt;nowiki&gt;*pokes&lt;/nowiki&gt; towards [[lucid dreaming]], a practical guide* An arts and crafts wikibook would require a ''huge'' amount of photographs and diagrams, and is therefore a major project. If, however, you want to start one, you can start by putting in under Miscellanous. Remember to make an origami section :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 16:57, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Theoretical in nature? Probably due to the contributors more than by plan. I think that this would be a great place for a book about arts &amp; crafts. In fact, someone was mentioning that not too long ago but it has not gotten started up yet (to the best of my knowledge). --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:: Ouch, I think I may have made a boo-boo through my limited command of the English language, for which I apologise. 

:: What I meant was a category that collects practical knowledge about how to apply oneself in different arts and different crafts. I wasn't talking about pottery, weaving etc. as such, although that would of course also fit into such a category. My immediate goal was to write a text about authoring web pages.--branko


===Books: Arrange books by completion===

I think we should arrange the books within the bookshelves in the order of completion (finished books first), and alphabetize the ones at the same level. This would keep the new books that just happen to start with 'A' out of the first slot and, conversely, bring completed and mostly completed books up to the front. It would also encourage people to update the completion of the book (maybe even get more done to look better). Lastly, it would make it easier to see from a glance which bookshelves need the most work and which books are completed. What do you guys think? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 21:36, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Same thing as the templates, same thing as the black edge; if you don't like the change, please tell me right here. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 15:07, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

One more thing: Should there be a note somewhere on the main page describing this ordering? --[[User:NeuronExMachina|NeuronExMachina]] 03:13, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)

===Books: What makes a Wikibook?===

Alright, I've been looking around various wikibook pages and discussions and can't figure out when something should be a wikibook project and when it should be done seperatly.  In particular I decided to start a wiki project to develop a universal pen-and-paper RPG engine ( http://www.invariant.org/media/ at the moment...if it takes off I will get a domain name.....yes yes I know shitty html pages puporting to have this aim pop up all the time but I want to see if doing this collaboratively with a wiki system allowing for nice layout and some good ideas can do better).  

I assumed at first that wikibooks was clearly an inappropriate place to put this project but while failing to find a list of third party MediaWiki run projects I noticed that there were wikibooks like &quot;Getting a Girl&quot;.  Not that I would object to a serious scientifically sound discussion of dating strategies but this book is filled with gems like, &quot;Ok, first, please forgive me to compare handling a girl's mind with jerking off a dog. The principle is the same. You want to get a girl feel horny / greedy for love.&quot;  If this is an okay wikibook maybe my project belongs here as well.  So I have two questions

First, would the project I described be best kept on my servers/account or get accepted as a wikibook.  I imagine it is best kept distinct (although this makes it difficult to attract eyes.....especially since there seems to be no obvious page indexing outside MediaWiki projects) and that only projects of a more concrete nature belong on Wikibooks (like textbooks, how-to manuals).  However, if Wikibook is going to allow things like this entierly unsubstantiated 'Getting a Girl' guide then why shouldn't my project take advantage of being hosted on wikibooks (BTW is there any page detailing the advantages/disadvantages with starting a whole project or being part of something like wikibooks). [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 11:45, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: Since you started a wiki on your own server, you will be interested in [[Wiki Science]].
: There is a third option. Consider posting your pen-and-paper RPG ideas on some other wiki. Perhaps http://freegames.wiki.taoriver.net/ would be appropriate ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:08, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Thanks for the link.  This is one of the things I found really annoying I looked for a fair amount of time for a wiki with such a purpose but couldn't fine one.  Is there any page which functions as a list of all the various wikis? [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 02:04, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:::Ohh, freegames is for computer games and doesn't use MediaWiki.  I'd still like a page listing all MediaWiki projects (if not least so people could find my project) even if freegames wouldn't be on there and isn't quite appropriate for my project (MediaWiki seems to be the only wiki engine which is visually appealing enough to have a hope of creating a succesfull pen and paper RPG.) [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 02:08, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===Books: XML(Chinese Version) ===

Someone put this Chinese Wikibook on the {{bad link|IT bookshelf}}. It's Chinese, so it doesn't belong here. Where does it belong, and how can we tell the user that created the page this (in Chinese, maybe)? I reverted the link, but they put it back there. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 21:02, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Should there be an Arts bookshelf? I imagine it could include handbooks on things like 3D modeling, drawing, game creation, etc. How can I make a bookshelf? - [[User:NeuronExMachina|NeuronExMachina]] 02:42, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Ok, here's a preliminary {{bad link|Arts bookshelf}}.

=== Bookshelf: Computer Science? ===

What's up with {{bad link|Computer Science bookshelf}}?
Right now there's a link to it on the [[Main Page|main page]] in the {{bad link|Science bookshelf}}.
Should we make it a simple redirect to [[IT bookshelf]], at least until there's enough books that it makes sense to split into 2 bookshelves ?

=== New Bookshelf - Travel Guides? ===

I am currently working on a travel guide for the [[Isle of Arran]].  I can think of no book better suited to the wikibook site, than travel guides.  For a start anyone can add to them whether it be about their home region or their favourite holiday spot.  Could we please add a bookshelf, or how do i add a bookshelf (sorry a bit new at this), for Travel Guides.

== Main page text ==
=== Opening paragraph ===

Here's my idea (added text in ''italics''):
:[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome, newcomers!]] '''Wikibooks''' is dedicated to developing and disseminating '''[[w:gratis|free]], [[w:open content|open content]] textbooks''' and other classroom texts.  ''We currently host over X textbooks, over X of them marked Thorough/Complete Editions/Somethingelsewecomeupwith.  However, every book is open to revision and addition by anyone&amp;ndash;even you.

    &lt;nowiki&gt;working on around {{Number of books}} textbooks...&lt;/nowiki&gt;
which displays as
:''We currently have {{NUMBEROFUSERS}} editors working on around {{NUMBEROFBOOKS}} textbooks...''
I'm not sure how &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Number of users}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is counted, but I thought it was a nice thing to stick in that opening paragraph. Then it was reverted. Then it was added again. Then reverted again. I considered adding it again, but I'd rather not get sucked into an edit war.

:Yacht, you are talking about page navigation links at the top of each wikibooks module, correct ? I agree on principal with what you are saying and started my [[Organic Chemistry]] book with something like you suggested, but stopped adding the navigation links after a while because I would change how the pages were linked together. My thought now is to put in navigation links later, when a book is more stable. Ideally, we will eventually have software that will do the navigation automatically for us. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:Since the Wikibook I'm writing ([[Vietnamese]]) is still pretty new and unstable, I've just added a simple link back to the TOC on every article page, using this code:

===Standards: Book structure===

Does anyone think that the books should follow a similar format or structure? Like the language books for instance, I like the idea of dividing them into level I, II, III sections and the title page for each book is a nice touch too. However, some of them have a bit of poor formatting. An example of a nicely formatted language book in my opinion, is the Norwegian text (I like the use of the green tables for key parts), should we think about making a common layout for these books? 

Another thing that is pretty evident - the way books are set up, using the book title prefix to prevent cross-articles from other books. IE: naming pages like Electronics:Circuit Diagrams or German:Types of Good Beer etc. Maybe we should come up with a way to do this automatically within books?

:I don't think our textbooks should try too hard to be similar to one another. Unlike with Wikipedia, we don't have any easy method of determining the best format for a book except by evaluating it as it's written. While it makes a text look &quot;polished&quot; to be so neatly broken down, it doesn't really help anyone study, and overloading the site with rules is probably only going to drag down people's drive to contribute. --[[User:Jwh|Jwh]] 04:57, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:For this format, we would need something catchy, like Wikipedia's &quot;In the News&quot;, &quot;Did you Know...&quot; and &quot;Featured articles&quot;. We could expand on the featured and new books (with a few pictures), but they aren't as exciting as the stuff on Wikipedia.

== Language books: Curse words? == 

What is your stand on teaching curse words in language books?

: Don't. Why should you? No usual language book does so. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 13:54, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: They are words just like any other, and not to mention Wikipedia has a large entry on the F-word...
::I think you are allowed to mention curse words. Go ahead. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 17:38, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::Plus it is a way to add some humor on the subject, as I'm not even talking about the really terrible curse words. For instance, the Polish language has a phrase, when translated, is similar to: &quot;Your face resembles a Warsaw sidewalk&quot;. This is referring to the sidewalks which are normally caked in dog feces as owners do not usually pick up after themselves :)

:::Go for it IMO the fact that other language books don't do is their problem not ours. Make sure the words are in common use, and clearly mark them as curse words so that no mistakes can be made. Most people I know want to learn &quot;hello two beers please&quot; &quot;Can you tell me how to get to my hotel&quot; &quot;I like you very much, will you go to bed with me?&quot; and some varient of &quot;You like to have sexual relations with your parents&quot;,  &quot;Why don't you go and masturbate yourself&quot; or similar insults. But that probably tells you more about my friends (and myself) than how language ''should'' be taught ;-) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:48, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

&quot;Plus it is a way to add some humour on the subject&quot;: what is considered funny usually differs tremendously between cultures and even between individuals. Adding curse words is not a fail-safe way to inject humour. Having said that, I would like to say: go ahead, write as you like. If somebody disagrees, they are sure to change your text. That is, after all, the way a wiki works. :-)

:Regarding the cultural aspect. We don't actually have to cater to every culture in the English books - we only have to include the English-speaking ones. Other cultures have their own languages and corresponding books, so the problem is solved for us --[[User:Jwh|Jwh]] 05:05, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::But when learning a language, usually one would want to use that language in a realistic environment, such as visiting Germany or France after learning German or French. If we teach them a curse word and don't identify it as a curse word, or don't say that it only is a curse word in southern France and in northern France, means something totally seperate, etc., then we have a problem. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:12, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::I agree entierly.  The goal should be language use in a realistic enviornment which happens to include fairly frequent use of curse words.  Of course it would be terrible not to identify them as curse words but I don't think anyone is suggesting this.[[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 16:56, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I think it is absolutely essential to add the curse words.  First of all to get the same respect for a collaborative online project as with a more traditional medium you need to be more overly principled about your content.  Since a wiki project, by its very emphasis on encouraging cooperation, makes people more aware that the individuals writing the information are just as fallible as they are.  It might not be a warranted reaction but given this likely attitude I think it is a very bad idea to engage in anything that might even resemble censorship or subjectivity.  

Furthermore on a more pragmatic note I find wiki books MOST advantageous because they include so many practical tidbits left out of more staid and traditional publications.  Don't emasculate one of the major wikibook benefits just to avoid offending a few people.  This is also pragmatically quite difficult in a wiki-text as these sorts of words are quite likely to be added by people who decided not to respect your nicely worded plea not to include curses.  It certainly seems like a better solution to add a classy presentation of swears rather than let an immature teenager do it for you.  At best you could create all the curse word pages and lock them empty but this will hardly stop people from adding links to these pages and asking why they can't edit them.  Besides you now look like a ham-fisted censor instead of just happening to think these words didn't belong.  [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 22:04, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:This is a bad idea. We're not suggesting censorship as a solution, but rather not to mention curse words in foreign languages at all. It is a bad idea to censor material Curse words aren't at all 'practical tidbits', rather a hinder to our efforts. If people don't like it that we don't have curse words, that's what the discussion pages are for, to work out and resolve conflicts. If the general consensus is against curse words, but the user continues to persist, we can ban their IP address at worst.

:I think you view curse words too harmless. Way more than 'a few people' are offended by curse words. Many people don't use curse words (I honestly can say that I've never used one in my life, spoken or written). As for realizing fallibility, if I, or someone else like me, read something with curse words, the 'likely reaction' is to turn away from the material/project: not a positive reaction. Instead of what you're saying, the likely reaction is negative. If curse words aren't presented, then no one cares, and if they do, that's what the discussion page is for. It's not like people are *begging* to add pages on curse words. 'Respect' for the project doesn't come at all from curse words, rather from not having them.

:A question arises: What are curse words? Curse words vary degrees in English and foreign languages, so native speakers would be best to explain this. But the simplest explanation is a word that has a definition other than how one would use it and means something in that situation. For example, 'rats' is not a curse word because it doesn't mean anything in that situation.

:Teaching curse words is '''not''' a benefit. We have to ask ourselves, &quot;Do we ''want'' people to use curse words in other languages?&quot; - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:16, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Look, whether you like curse words or not you have to admit they are extremely common parts of discourse.  It is just foolish to think that because ''you'' don't happen to use curse words they aren't important.  In fact someone who was completly unaware of curse words would have a great deal of difficulty understanding modern society, at the very least it is important to know the word ''is'' a curse word and whether it is a deadly insult or a friendly saluataion (I certainly call my friends fucker in a friendly manner on occasion...while in some cultures no doubt any use of a similar word is a deadly insult).  Whether you like it or not it is pratically important to know what the curse words are and their cultural position.

::As for the issue of censorship and respect.  The notion that we aren't censoring the curse words but just choosing not to include them is just linguistic sophistry.  I personally believe that including curse words is quite important (for a variety of reasons..some above some below) and you are straightforwardly advocating rolling back my edits if I was to include them.  Let try that again, you are suggesting that some additions to this language book be prevented not because of factual inadequacy, stylistic issues or even for being offtopic (or do you deny that curse words are a commonly used and occupy a unique linguistic position) but simply '''because someone is offended.'''  If this isn't censorship please tell me what is?

::How about the notion that this will give us a negative image?  I simply don't find it credible that a well-marked link to a curse word section would discourage many people from making use of the wikibook.  The oxford english dictionary certainly puts in it's fare share of curse words with just as detailed information and even m-w.com has 'fuck'.  These works decided the benefit of increase credibility outweighed the harms of a few offended individuals (and yes I really do believe it is few percentagewise).  Personally, I think it is a much better goal to create the most informative/usefull work you can than something fuzzy parents let their kids read.  Finally, I don't think this is information we can simply leave to the dictionaries (even assuming language dictionaries of that language carry swears).  More so than any other class of words the meaning/usage of swears is context/phrase dependent.

::Also, I '''really do''' want people using curse words (in english or otherwise).  I think it makes language more expresive and colorfull not to mention increased usage reduces the flak people who do use them take.  I respect the fact that other people may be offended by them and try to avoid them in public discourse (like here..except to discuss that word) despite the fact that I prefer using them.  Those who are offended by curse words should return the courtesy but not trying to stop others from using these words in there conversations(by denying them education/knowledge about them).  While one certainly doesn't need to rush out and put in swears in some begining language lessons a NPOV really does require that they have their own (well marked) link/pages.

::The issue of curse words may not be that significat but the precedent advocated here is very dangerous.  What happens when someone writes a wikibook about family planning and 'doesn't mention' (in the sense of rolling back updates which do mention) abortion.  The example may be extreme but it really is quite similar to the arguments presented against mentioning curse words.  Even more people may be quite offended by the mention of abortion.  You might object saying that abortion is surely practically relevant to family planning, however those who want to leave it out would disagree.  They would claim abortion is murder and is no more relevant to family planning than a guide about hiring hitmen to kill excess children would be.  Just like the curse words issue a group wants to avoid presenting certain information because it is offensive and want to discourage people from acting on that information (i.e. getting an abortion/using curse words).  Similarly there is a valid differnce of opinion (i.e. not a logical error but a differnce in basic value) over whether that effect is desierable or not.  Consequently the two cases really should have the same solution and I certainly find the notion of wikibooks witholding abortion information troublesome. [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 11:02, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::If we ever do mention curse words in language books, it should be debated on the talk pages for the writers of that wikibook, not here. Since curse words vary in how harmful they are and how often they're used, I think this discussion should be continued when and where they occur. If the writers/authors of the wikibook take a vote or something similar, and come up with a solution, that should be the way it goes in that case. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:20, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::::Yes, I agree that the deciscion of a vote of the project members should decide the issue.  In so far as the question is 'should we go out and add in curse words' I agree this should be left up to the members of that particular book.  If the question is 'should we role back curse word additions' I'm not so sure if it shouldn't be decided by the wikibook community at large.  However, this is a differnt issue than the one we have been discussing (which since it affects many books seems reasonable to discuss here).  How disputes about the correct practice are resolved is a very differnt question.  For instance I would argue strongly that an ammendment prohibiting gay marriage is wrong and violates the basic principles this country was founded on yet I completly agree that it's adoption should be decided by a vote in congress and ratification by state legislators.  In other words I am offering up reasons why any such vote should turn out a particular way. [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 02:01, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== WikiChongqing ==
This site is in chinese/japanese (can't tell which), which just look like question marks on older browsers. However, the URL is unexpected for a wiki.
I'd say, keep the link out, unless someone who can read the language confirms it is a wiki.

== Class contributions ==
Hello, I'm a teacher and would love to get my students to contribute here for credit. Any thoughts on how we can get students to participate as part of a class assignment?
*Our sister project [[w:|Wikipedia]] has developed a page to give pointers and keep track of school and university projects.  The page over there can be found at [[w:Wikipedia:School and university projects]].  I did a search here but didn't find a similar page, so we might want to consider starting one.  However, read wikipedia's page for the basic ideas.  The most important thing is to have the students create user names, so you as the instructor can easily track their contributions. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:41, 30 May 2004 (UTC)
**Welcome to wikibooks! You can sign your username and current time using &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Glad you decided to have a project here. The students may wanna use their own psuedonyms for usernames, so I'd let them (it's also helpful for us to track who's who as well). To see a user's contributions, just access their user page and click on the &quot;User Contributions&quot; link on the sidebar. Remember to teach your students the basics - NPOV, dont vandalize, how to create links and such - first, just in case. Feel free to start anytime - the more users here, the better. [[User:KirbyMeister|KirbyMeister]] 19:55, 30 May 2004 (UTC)

See also [[Wikiversity]] and the tips for teachers section of the [[w:WP:FAQ|Wikipedia FAQ]].  There should be something like that on wikibooks, too...

== Printing: Wikis for developing countries ==

The concept of Wikibooks is excellent, but to use Wikibooks in classrooms in developing countries is problematic: there are no computers.  Is there a way to print an entire book? Then paper copies could be made and distributed to students. --Steve

:Two things would help this: subdomains/categories for each book to define what's in it, and at least a way to print each page (&quot;Printable Version&quot;) like [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]] had before MediaWiki 1.3. We also would have the problem of links being impossible on paper. See [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press|Wikibook Press]], a printing suggestion. There will be many problems, though. Of course, most of our Wikibooks are not even ''close'' to getting done, so this is in many cases low priority. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 17:31, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Languages ==
===Languages: Editions in Other Languages===

On this page, someone added (it looks like) every single language that is possible. Most of them get a &quot;Wiki does not exist&quot; error message upon clicking on them, so I was wondering if others think that should stay. How many languages, and which languages, is Wikibooks in (as in subdomains)? We need to update {{bad link|Template:Languages}} to show that. Is there a way to keep track of this? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 15:07, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

===Languages: romanian Wikibooks===

I'm sorry. Why were this two pages deleted: {{bad link|De ce manuale cu conţinut deschis?}} and {{bad link|Wikibooks:De ce să contribui?}} ? You could at least wait that they are copyed to the romanian version, and then delete them. Please revert the delete, and let them there for at least one week, because I'm not sure when I will have time to copy them, but be shore that I will notice you here then. Thank you.--[[:ro:Utilizator:Danutz|Danutz]]

BTW. Please chnage in the main page the link to the romanian version, so it goes to http://ro.wikiquote.org .

:&quot;ro.wikiquote.org&quot;? Do you mean ro.wikibooks.org? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:06, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Yes, I mean that. Sorry. Can a sysop undelete the files I mentioned for a while, until I copy them to romanian Wikibooks? --[[:ro:Utilizator:Danutz|Danutz]]

==Main: Protect Page?==

Wikipedia's [[w:Main Page|Main Page]] is made up mostly of templates, and so therefore can be protected. Now that our main page is template-ified, I think it would be a good idea to protect it. Could an admin please do this? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:16, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I was about to suggest that now. I just came here and found [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=88598 this]. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 11:26, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Admins: [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]==

Could someone please update this page? It currently has 12 sysops that have been sysops for a year now and [[Special:Statistics]] says there are 18. Who are they? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:22, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:Sam, they are all listed at [[Special:Listadmins]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 14:57, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)
::Thanks. I'll be updating the admins page soon. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:04, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Wikiversity, and adding MusicML ==

I don't know whether I've overstepped the bounds of user participation, but I've created a School of Music in the Wikiversity, since I believe that's one area that should have its own school.

However, the reason I comment is that I think it'd be great for the wiki engine, if at all possible, be extended to support MusicML insertion into documents?

==Interviews?==
For the US Government text book, I was going to ask some governor and senator's offices to let me interview their representee. Is this sort of thing okay? -- [[user:zanimum]]

YES!  Just make sure that you understand the GNU free documentation license in case there are questions. --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]]

== Automated Table of Contents ==

I forget how those things work! Is there a tutorial somewhere or at least an example page? I feel so foolish cuz not long ago I was using them. I have just spend quite a while trying to figure it back out and am not having much luck... Thank you! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:49, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== [[Linguistics]] ==

I don't know where to post this comment, but I absolutely adore the Linguistics textbook on here and read it avidly. I hope you will all keep working on it! Thanks, anon.

:I like it, too. You should put this comment is on either [[Talk:Linguistics|the book's discussion page]], or on [[User talk:ACW|the talk page of the author]]. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:42, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Promoting free textbooks, how to change the world ==
This is great!  I am so happy to find Wikibooks, and to see it growing!  The down side is the way I found it:  After having a attending the &quot;home and school club&quot; (modern PTA) meeting for my son's elementary school and seeing the uphill battle of their fund-raising, I started thinking hard about how to cut costs in schools.  Something that floated to the surface rather quickly was the textbooks - textbooks are not cheap.  I very quickly thought, Open Source!  Open source textbooks, compiled online by teachers, students, whoever, is the answer.  Of course, getting these into elementary schools would be difficult (politics), but one might be able to break into community colleges and private schools...

So, as with any idea, I started searching the web to see if someone was already doing it.  There's the down side of Wikibooks - it took me a little while to find on Google (searching on &quot;free textbook&quot; and &quot;free college textbooks&quot; - I ended up here following a blog link).

So, here's the point of my writing:  This is a great project!  We can change the world!  Make education more affordable for everyone!  We need to promote the heck out of this!!!  But is what I'm describing part of Wikibooks' current vision?  If so, what promotion activities are underway already?  Who is the top Wikibooks Evangelist?  I want to help!  And if not, who do I have to convince?  Since printed books will be a staple of educational institutions for a long time to come (until every student has a laptop), a long term goal would be to either publish printed docs through a nonprofit, or minimally make Wikibooks available (which they sort of are already, through the copyleft license) for printing - but I think there will need to be a way to readily download whole books (as PDFs perhaps).

: We desperately need to get better books made before we start any promoting. This site is not yet useful except in a few cases, and it certainly doesn't have any completed textbooks (there's [[Lucid dreaming]], but that would never be taught, and [[High school extensions]] is going along pretty well) and if people get the image of a site of half-done textbooks we will keep that image for a long time and it would take a lot of effort to change it. We ought to leaave it for the time being.
: I would like book-to-PDF too, but it's hard stuff to do. I could probably write something to minimally convert a page from here into (La)TeX but to get it all done is difficult. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 06:32, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::I've said this on Karl's talk page and  on the staff noticeboard. I don't normally spam, but I'm really excited about this and so please forgive me for posting it here too. Wikmedia has secureed a grant from the Beck foundation for producing short books/magazines (anyway they'll be 48 pages long no matter what thery are called aimed at the 7 -12 year old age group. The books will be developed here on wikibooks before being printed and sold. (They'll be cheap because we only have to cover the cost of printing). If this takes off, and I'm pretty sure it will, it'll be a massive boost to wikibooks as a whole and may well mean that we can get print versions of other books up and running too. Soo come to meta [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior wikijunior] and join in the fun. We still need to decide on a title (Wkijunior is only a working title) and what the forst topic should be.

::: Very cool stuff - I agree wholeheartedly about needing more completed works before promoting the site for public consumption (&quot;come use these books&quot;), BUT I think we desperately need more promotion for development (&quot;come write books and change the world&quot;) - I am thinking of a campaign of posting flyers aimed at both students and teachers at junior colleges - making it clear of course of exactly what is being marketed (the opportunitiy to participate in writing books).  Any thoughts?

:::The printing of books (not for profit) is a longer term goal, but I think it's appropriate to have a clear vision of that, and plan for technology and processes to support it.

Hey, the philosophy wikibook is listed as 'struggling'.  Are there any people out there who want to struggle with me on this one?  At the moment we need authors who know what they are talking about, but hopefully soon we will need intelligent neophytes to assess how useful the work is.  I'm working on the logic section mainly.  This could even develop into an into an independent wikibook in its own right.  We could end up having a whole shelf of wikibooks on philosophy, but perhaps that is a few years off yet.  How do we get philosophy promoted from 'struggling' to the next category, whatever that is? --[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 10:35, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Languages list ==--[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 01:34, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

In the classic skin, the languages for the main page appears at the top, so the actual content of the main page begins 8 lines later than I believe it should.  If you take a look at [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia's main page]], you can see that they have a great solution there, with the &quot;other languages&quot; section at the bottom.  In addition, this allows for users to see how many pages that encyclopedia has.  Personally, I see only advantages- so why not set it up like they have there? -[[User:Frazzydee|[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]]]] 01:47, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Featured on Main Page ==

Nobody will deny that there is an unsightly mess of a large number of Wikibooks (most of which probably don't even qualify for a [[:File:25%.svg|25%]] rating. I propose that the main page be locked like on Wikipedia so that only those who have power granted to them can add Wikibooks to the front page (ie. When the book has enough content to be worth mentioning it is advertised on the Main Page). Some of the worst examples of empty wikibooks that are listed on the front page:

* {{bad link|Hydrology}}
* {{bad link|Forestry}}
* [[Environmental Science]]
* {{bad link|Snow Science}}
* [[Greek]]
* [[Piano]]

== And... Selected Wikibooks ==

The selected wikibooks is a great idea. But I feel that it takes up far too much room. There is a huge amount of space wasted to the left and to the right of the selected wikibooks.

Also, when I first joined Wikibooks there was '''one''' or '''two''' wikibook in each category of the selected wikibooks. I count up to ''nine'' now. Now that is excessive. Perhaps there should be some kind of waiting list to be added to the new &amp; struggling; and the books on it are changed on a month, week or even daily basis.
--[[User:Boit|Boit]] 00:15, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: Well, I pruned stuff which wasn't very new any more. Theoretically we could get stuff off the &quot;Struggling&quot; section by actually helping those books. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 08:50, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: That's a good idea, '''in theory''' however not everyone has the knowledge or understanding to be able to help. For example, [[Introduction to Philosophy]] - I wouldn't even know where to start. I have never even used Linux in my life so thereofre I wouldn't be able to help in [[Linux-Compendium]] either. The same goes for the rest of the struggling textbooks.

== Languages on the Main Page ==

Why are there links to different languages in the community section on the main page? Aren't these a bit unnecessary. There are links down the LHS of the webpage anyway AND when you first visit Wikibooks you are presented with a huge list of different language versions.

:Done. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 21:01, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Oh no not another suggestion! ==

Sorry, I seem to be posting the hell out of the talk page, but something else has bugged me from trying to browse the main page. There is so much wasted space around the Selected wikibooks area. Why can't we make a (perhaps red) cell in the table, put it above the community section which would mean there is more space for the '''huge''' number of bookshelves.

: Today I just found out about [[Main Page/test]] started by [[User:Perl]]. I've been trying to edit it to resemble Wikipedia. What does everyone think about this layout?
: Also the main problem is there's too many wikibooks now. So for the [[Main Page/test]] page, I removed the listing and replaced it with the [[Template:Bookshelves]] bar just under the welcome text. And just under this template I added a [[Wikibooks:Departments|Template:Bookshelves (all)]] link which leads to a page displaying all the wikibooks in their bookshelves (in other words, moved all bookshelves templates from the current Main Page to a separate page). -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 02:04, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::On Firefox for Windows XP the tables are not displayed correctly at all. Under IE, the test page renders fine (though I feel it's too crammed, aesthetically). However, since the page does not display properly I've reverted it instead of first discussing my aesthetic objections.

== Main page locked ==

Somebody locked the main page just yesterday or a few days ago. I don't see any post announcing or explaining this procedure. I think the main page still needs to be changed and is less than optimal (e.g. The first paragraph is almost repeated in the &quot;About Wikibooks&quot; box - what a waste of space! I thought about changing this, but now I can not without admin rights. Where can I apply for temporary admin so that I can change the main page? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 08:54, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:Sorry for not discussing it, but I locked the main page after it became a target for vandalism, due to a current VfD debate.  Once that is over, and our bruised ego friend goes away, then the page can be unblocked. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:03, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Follow up, I've protected the main page again, but this time it is only protected from page moves. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 06:37, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;Study help desk&quot; links wrongly ==

The link on the left bar, &quot;Study help desk&quot;, links to [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Current events]] (which by itself is a redirect to [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]]), instead of linking to the existing [[Study help desk]]. Either change the name or change the link. I'd prefer a link to a '''Wikibook community page''', whichever this might be. (Wikiversity seems like a project on its own, and doesn't give much help on Wikibooks which is for all age and knowledge levels, not just University related - see e.g. [[Wikijunior]] as part of Wikibooks, but not of Wikiversity..). I'd prefer &quot;Wikibook community&quot; or just &quot;Community portal&quot;, since this would give a familiar look across the wikis. (Study help desk seems related to studying problems, and not problems related to working at Wikibooks). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 09:09, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Lady finger''' is an ambiguous term that can mean:

* [[Cookbook:Okra|Okra]], a green [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] from [[Cookbook:African cuisines|Africa]].
* [[Cookbook:Savoiardi|Savoiardi]], a kind of small [[Cookbook:Sponge Cake|sponge cake]] from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]].
* In North America, &quot;ladyfinger&quot; typically refers to a more modernized, smaller, thinner cookie than the traditional savoiardi, from which its name is taken; the two are often used interchangeably, but are completely different in flavour and texture, with the newer more closely resembling uncoated chocolate fingers.
* The &quot;lady finger&quot; [[Bartending/Cocktails|cocktail]].

&quot;Lady finger&quot; can also mean a type of firecracker or human body part, but these are generally very bad to eat.

The '''Vegemite sandwich''' is a simple dish, which is known to frequent the lunchboxes of school children and the plates of casual breakfasters alike. The lunchbox variety often involves two slices of bread, whereas the breakfast variety usually only involves one, and is often toasted. Margarine may be used as a replacement for the butter, however in modern times it is becoming common for margarine/butter to be considered an optional ingredient.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]]

== Procedure ==
# Spread butter thickly and unevenly on bread. (optional)
# Spread Vegemite a little less thickly, and unevenly on bread.
# A slice of cheese can be added at this point. (optional)

==Notes, tips and variations==
* A variation is to add avocado for an avocado and Vegemite sandwich.
* Yet another variation is to spread Vegemite and then place sliced onions and a slice of cheese on toast and then place under a grill or toaster to melt the cheese.
* Some consumers assert that white sliced bread will give a superior result.
* Staples of school lunches, particularly from the Tuck Shop or school canteen, are Vegemite and Lettuce and Vegemite and Cheese Sandwiches. In each case, it's simply a standard Vegemite Sandwich with an additional ingredient added.
* Try to add ham and cheese as another idea, makes a very nice sandwich.
*Vegemite on toast is a favourite breakfast food.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Composting Toilet - there is a compact model made for boats, but a blackwater tank is required for excess urine, which can be emptied at any sani-dump station

Newspaper/garbage bags

Kitty Litter - Buy litter that comes in its own bucket.  Use the kitty shovel to form a depression in the litter so your contribution doesn't touch the side walls of the bucket.  Make your contribution.  Use your kitty shovel (or an inside out zip lock style baggy over our hand like a glove)to cover it up.  Either immediately lift it out or let it set up a bit.  Remove it from the kitty litter bucket with your kitty shovel or inside out zip lock style baggy worn like a glove over your hand.  Zip close the baggy and deposit it in a dumpster.  Drive with the lid closed on the bucket and placed so sudden stops won't tip it over.

The simplest method is to lay out some newspapers.  After defecating, wrap it in newspaper, then tie it up in a grocery bag.  Dispose of it in the nearest garbage can or dumpster.  

Newspaper method #2, wrap in newspaper with sawdust (to absorb moisture) and a handfull of soil, store outside where it can dry up w/o smelling, turns into a humanure compost burrito, yum!

Reclosable jug such as water or milk.  Ladies use a funnel which is rinsed clean with water before storing. 

Sawdust toilet

Several plans exist on the internet for making a toilet out of a 5 gallon pail.  

Portapotty

Gas station/fast food joints

Good for going to the bathroom, though frequently unclean and smelly

Grocery stores

RV toilet/blackwater system

Cassette toilet

Composting toilet.  It may be a little large, but there are [[http://www.nationalwatercenter.org/plans.htm plans for a cheap 55 gallon drum composting toilet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Overview of Rich Internet Applications =

According to the Wikipedia entry &quot;[[wikipedia:Rich Internet Application|Rich Internet Application]],&quot;

 Rich Internet Applications (RIA) are a cross between
 web applications and traditional desktop applications,
 transfering some of the processing to the client end.

[[w:Macromedia|Macromedia]], the software company which makes, among other programs, Flash and Dreamweaver, is credited with introducing this term in a 2002 whitepaper.

RIAs represent a set of technologies that SLA researchers can use to create on-line environments. This section of the RIA Wikibook will present a specific set of technologies which may be used for research into individual, pair, and group second language acquisition.

== Relevant Technologies ==
=== Flash MX 2004 ===
Flash MX 2004 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Macromedia Flash|Flash]]&quot;) is an authoring program which allows users to create applications (often called &quot;movies&quot; in the Flash literature) with varied user interfaces ([[w:User interface|UI]]), featuring still and animated graphics as well as audio elements. It features drawing tools (e.g. lines, boxes, ovals, shading, paint brushes), an [[w:Animation|animation]] timeline, and a programming language, [[w:ActionScript|ActionScript]] (version 2.0), which is based on the proposed standard for version 1.5 of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]]. Applications authored with Flash are exported as Shockwave files (with .[[w:SWF|swf]] extension), which may then be run by the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in or a stand-alone player.

GUI resources include...
* text fields (both plain text and HTML)
* buttons
* movie clips
* audio and video display and capture objects
* custom mouse pointers
* pull-down menus

==== Example GUI Designs ====
'''Text Chat''': A collaborative application (see discussion of Flash Communication Server) may be easily authored using a multi-line text field (for display of the transcript), a single-line text field (for entry of messages), and a button (for sending a new message entered in the single-line text field).

'''Total Physical Response ([[W:Total_Physical_Response|TPR]]) Tasks''': A solitary activity might use a collection of so-called &quot;[[w:Drag-and-drop|drag-and-drop]]&quot; movie clips as items to be manipulated in response to text and/or audio prompts. Feedback would be provided when each item is moved to the proper location. For example, a learner might hear &quot;Place the table to the left of the chair.&quot; Placing the table anywhere except to the left of the chair would result in the application informing the user that the table had been misplaced.

'''Asynchronous Audio/Video [[W:email|Electronic mail]]''': Flash's audio and/or video capturing functions make it possible for learners to save their speech for later listening and viewing by others (i.e., partners or researchers).

=== Flash Communication Server ===
Flash Communication Server 1.5 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Flash Communication Server|FlashComm]]&quot;) provides real-time audio, video, and data exchange between connected applications running in the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in from Macromedia. FlashComm servers may also interact with other FlashComm or [[w:Web server|web servers]] (e.g., the [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache server]]) in order to access dynamically generated data via a [[w:Scripting programming language|scripting language]] such as [[w:PHP|PHP]], [[w:Perl|Perl]], or [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]]. Such interaction is frequently used to retrieve, add, or update information to a database (e.g., [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] or [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]]). Though this scripting and database interaction is also available to SWF files running in the Flash Player, routing the interactions through FlashComm may be preferable when the results of each interaction should update all clients or when extra layers of security are desired.

=== PHP ===
One of the possible readings of &quot;P&quot; in the common acronym &quot;[[w:LAMP|LAMP]]&quot; (the first three letters standing for &quot;Linux,&quot; &quot;Apache,&quot; and &quot;MySQL&quot;), [[w:PHP|PHP]] is a scripting language that features a broad variety of capabilities such as text searching, database connections, file management, and HTML form processing (via [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]). In general, the LAMP suite of software is popular because it is free for anyone wishing to set up their own web hosting, and it allows web hosting companies to offer very cheap (under six U.S. dollars per month) web hosting. As noted in in the Wikipedia entry for the LAMP acronym, &quot;Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, runs software that can be characterized as a LAMP application. Wikipedia's MediaWiki software is developed primarily under Linux, using the Apache HTTP Server, with its content being stored in a MySQL database, and the program logic being implemented in PHP.&quot;

==== AMFPHP ====
One particular technology built with PHP, AMFPHP (available for free at http://www.amfphp.org), is especially useful for RIA-enabled research. This collection of scripts decodes and encodes Macromedia's '''A'''ction '''M'''essage '''F'''ormat (AMF), a data format that allows for the exchange of almost every type of data object defined in ActionScript such as numeric and string variables as well as custom objects. In contrast to extensible markup language ([[w:XML|XML]]), also used to exchange a wide variety of data types, AMF is designed so that information may be transmitted quickly. An immediate benefit of this format is the time saved by not having to program conversions of the applications data into XML for transmission as well as conversion of XML from a server back into an application's data structures.

One of the most important reasons for using an implementation of AMF is the availability of AMF-compatible scripts libraries for the free scripting languages [[w:Perl|Perl]] and [[w:Python programming language|Python]] (the other possible readings of the &quot;P&quot; in the LAMP acronym) in addition to the native support for the format in Macromedia's proprietary [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]] scripting language. This almost guarantees that the particular model in which an RIA is deployed may be changed (e.g., using Perl and PostgreSQL instead of PHP and MySQL) with minimal alteration of the Flash and/or FlashComm code.

=== MySQL ===
A free (for non-commercial use) database server, MySQL (or any other database) is primarily responsible for making Internet applications rich. The long-term, centralized, and rapidly searchable storage provided by a database enables an application to minimize, if not completely eliminate, the data it must contain within itself each time it is loaded. Once loaded and running in the Flash Player, for example, an application can request only those data sets which are needed at a given point in a user's interactions with the system. Free web-based utility applications such as [[w:PhpMyAdmin|PhpMyAdmin]], installed with most scripting- and database-enabled hosting services, make modifying, archiving, and moving database entries easy for most moderately skilled users, thereby insuring data integrity and security.

== Use of These Technologies ==
Because PHP communicates easily with Flash Player applications and with FlashComm via multiple connection methods (e.g., AMFPHP), these connections allow PHP to return information retrieved from a database (e.g., MySQL). This functionality may be used for a variety of SLA research purposes such as...
* presenting pre-prepared texts to users
* logging user behavior (e.g., quiz results or text from chat sessions)
* tracking user behavior over time
* matching users by common interests, languages, skill levels, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All letters are consonants? What about the long vowels? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:13, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:I'm far from an expert on Arabic (I've been taking an intro class at university for just over a month), so this interpretation/hypothesis should be taken with a grain of salt (see also [[w:Arabic alphabet]]): 
::* The &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻮ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|wāw}}) and the &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻱ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|yāʼ}}) both can be used as consonants (with English equivalents W and Y, as in &quot;wash&quot; and &quot;yawn&quot;) and thus are considered consonants. 
::* The &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﺎ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|ʼalif}}) is considered a consonant on occasion as a result of its historical use as a glottal stop (see [[w:Hamza]] on wikipedia).
::* Each of these three characters can be used to symbolize one of the short vowels when the short vowel's length is doubled (waaw turns to uu, or &quot;oo&quot; in English; yaa' to ii, or &quot;ee&quot; in English; and alif to aa, whose pronounciation I haven't been able to pin down). They can also be used as &quot;seats&quot; for the hamza.
::* The relationship between vowels and consonants have a different paradigm from in English. We native Indo-European language speakers have difficulty hearing the difference in ''consonant'' sounds between, for example, &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﺕ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|tāʼ}}) and &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻁ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|ṭāʼ}}), as (apparently) the native Arabic speaker does. Instead, we can only clue into the resulting difference in the vowel sounds, which are modified by the presence of alveolar consonants. 
::* In English, we have the luxury of being able to prounounce five vowels a number of different ways without changing the meaning (for example &quot;the&quot; can be pronounced &quot;thuh&quot; or &quot;thee&quot;; &quot;a&quot; as &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ay/eh&quot;), and of having many different ways of spelling the same vowel sound. This makes it harder for us to learn a language where the pronounciation is more strict.
::* In addition, consonants like the &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻉ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|ʻayn}}) sound to me like they should be vowels. However, the way we pronounce the letter &quot;r&quot; in English is more like a vowel than a consonant, as it is not rolled in English as it is in Spanish or German (or Arabic).
::* There are also plenty of diacritics which play around with consonant-like pronounciations, produce stops, make letters silent, etc. These are also not considered &quot;full letters&quot;.

In general, a derailleur is a mechanical means for moving the bicycle's chain from one cog to an adjacent cog, of a different size, so as to change the gearing of the bicycle. Bicycles equipped with derailleurs and multiple cogs - typically a group on the rear hub, and another group on the pedal crankset - allow for changing the gearing while the bicycle is in motion, which means that the rider can adjust the 'ease of pedaling' to suit the load being carried/pulled, to suit the immediate terrain, or to accommodate for other factors such as a headwind or the surface on which the bicycle is being ridden.
[[Image:Rear_Derailleur.JPG|frame|left|Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur]]

[[Image:Front_Derailleur.JPG|frame|left|Side view of Shimano 105 front derailleur]]

[[Image:Front_Derailleur_Top.JPG|frame|left|Top view of Shimano 105 front derailleur]]

Changing to a different gear involves derailing the chain from the currect combination of front and rear cogs,  so that it runs over a different combination of cogs, and the change requires that the rider be pedaling (i.e. that the chain be moving) because the derailleur is, effectively, deflecting the chain from its current path to a new path, over a different cog

For the purposes of the following discussion, remember that, for either front cogs (chain-rings) or rear cogs (clusters, or cassettes), 'higher' gears involve cogs further out from the center line of the bicycle, and 'lower' gears involve cogs nearer to that center line. The size of the cogs, per se - whether at the front or the rear - does not relate regularly to the notions of 'high' and 'low': being in the highest gear on a derailleur-equipped bicycle means having the chain running over the largest cog at the front and the smallest at the rear.

Almost all derailleurs, both front and rear, incorporate a strong spring which, in the absence of a properly-connected shifter cable, moves the derailing mechanism, or 'cage', toward either the high-gear or low-gear extreme position. Whichever cog (sometimes referred to as 'gear') is involved will be considered, in the following, to be the default position for that derailleur.

Historically, the rear derailleur has typically been constructed so that the internal spring serves to move the chain to the high gear (the smallest cog, the cog furthest outboard), and the front derailleur constructed to shift the chain to the low gear (again, the smallest cog, but the furthest inboard). However, variations on this do occur; Suntour front derailleurs defaulted to shifting to the highest gear, and current 'mega-range' rear derailleurs default to the lowest gear.

When replacing derailleur cables, or replacing or servicing a derailleur, it's worthwhile noting the way in which the particular derailleur operates; with the cables disconnected and the rear wheel raised off the ground (e.g. with the bicycle in a repair stand), manually pedal the bicycle and note where the derailleurs move the chain, at both front and rear. The chain should, in the absence of a cable, move to the default position inherent in the design of the particular derailleur(s) in play.

In either case, front or rear, the derailleur should shift the chain to a cog, or gear, at the extreme inner or outer position. If either the front or the rear derailleur, in the absence of a cable, does not shift the chain to the extreme inner or outer cog, or overshoots that target throwing the chain off the drive train, then adjustment of the derailleur is called for.

On each derailleur, front and rear, will be found a pair of screws, usually closely-spaced and typically marked 'H' and 'L' - &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, respectively. These screws are the limit-stop screws; they serve to establish the physical limits of travel of the cage of the derailleur in question. Independant of whether one considers the front or the rear cogs, &quot;high&quot; gears involve the cogs further away (outboard) from the mid-plane of the bicycle's frame, and &quot;low&quot; gears involve the cogs closer to the center-line of the bicycle itself. Adjustment of the 'L' limit-stop screw will set the limit inward - toward the mid-plane of the bicycle - that that derailleur's cage can be moved to. Similarly, adjusting the 'H' limit-stop screw will set the limit outward - away from the mid-plane of the bicycle - that that derailleur's cage can be moved to, whether by the action of the built-in spring, or the action of shifting using a gear shifter pulling a cable.

N.B.: since the limit-stop screws are screws, it's the depth of each, in their respective holes, that determines the respective limit. The more each screw is 'tightened' - turned into the body of the derailleur - the more restricted is the movement of the derailleur's cage. Put another way: driving both limit-stop screws fully inward may restrict the movement of the cage of the derailleur to nil i.e. this particular setting may render (the cage of) the derailleur immobile, limiting you to the use of a single cog, or gear - at least for the cogs governed by that derailleur. This fact may be of use to you should a shifter cable break and you can't easily replace it or repair it; in the event that the default position (gear) of the affected derailleur does not suit you, or the terrain you're riding in, you may be able to adjust one of the limit-stop screws to temporarily force the affected derailleur to 'default' to a more convenient gear.

The particular manner in which the adjustment of these screws physically limit the range over which the derailleur cage can move varies from manufacturer to manufacturer; in general, however, the flat end of the threaded part of the screw is positioned, when adjusted during maintenance and setup, so that some part of the moving body of the derailleur abuts the screw and is prevented from moving further.

It's recommend that the limit-stop screws be adjusted initially with no cables installed; the presence of a cable, especially if improperly set up, can confuse matters.

The following description and discussion uses the rear derailleur as the focus. With the bicycle in a stand, or otherwise arranged to allow full movement of the pedals and the rear wheel, arrange to have the rear derailleur shift the chain to a cog other than the largest (lowest gear) or the smallest (highest gear). If you have a cable installed, use the appropriate shifter to do this and, once you've shifted to an intermediate cog on the rear cluster, locate and loosen the nut (sometimes bolt) that anchors the shifter cable on the rear derailleur, then pull the cable loose. If you do not have a working shifter and cable installed, manually shift the rear derailleur to an intermediate gear by manually pedaling the bicycle with your right hand, while hooking your left hand's forefingers behind the derailleur hanger and pushing inward on the body of the derailleur with your thumb. Practice this movement before attempting it while the chain is moving/the bicycle is being pedaled. 

Once the chain is running over an intermediate gear on the rear cluster, take up the necessary tool (usually a Philips screwdriver) and turn both the 'H' and 'L' limit-stop screws of the rear derailleur inward from their current positions - perhaps 2 or 3 full turns. Doing so will restrict the range of movement possible for the rear derailleur's cage to something less that it previously had. Put another way, this step is intended to ensure that the limit-stop screws are not set so as to allow the chain to be thrown off of the rear cluster - into the spokes on the inboard side, or into the space between the frame and the cluster on the outboard side.

Assuming that the rear derailleur exhibits no other problems or defects (e.g. bent derailleur hanger, excessive 'stiction' attributable to rust, or twisted jockey pulley cage), manually pedaling the bicycle at this point may result in the rear derailleur shifting the chain to another gear - possible one not at the extreme of the range of gears available. This is because the previous step of adjusting the limit-stop screws has (probably) restricted the range over which the cage can move - to something less than that necessary to accommodate all the gears on the rear cluster.

Once it's been established that one of the limit-stop screws is acting to too-severely restrict movement of the derailleur's cage to allow shifting to the extreme gear on the rear cluster - the default position, since we've removed the cable -, it may be worthwhile to determine that the same applies to the other limit-stop screw.

The derailleur should now be in the default position; on non-mega-range systems the chain should be on, or near, the high gear (smallest cog); you can manually shift such a derailleur using the thumb-and-forefinger technique described above.

While manually pedaling, carefully attempt to move the derailleur body so as to shift to the gear at the opposite end of the cluster. When you do pedal and shift manually as described, it should be that the derailleur can not be made to shift to the other extreme of the range you'd normally expect. This is to the good, as it ensures that further adjustment of the limit-stop screws (to made shortly) safely restricts the range of movement of the derailleur's cage to the minimum-sufficient to provide the full range of gears.

Given that the limit-stop screws have been set to provide a too-narrow range (as above), the next step is to gradually adjust the limit-stop screws (turning them outward, or 'loosening' them) by small increments until the chain just reliably settles on the relevant gear, or can be made to shift to it. The purpose of this method is to ensure that setting the limit-stop screws approaches the final settings from a safe, too-narrow range i.e. a range for the derailleur cage which does not run the risk of having the chain coming off of the gears and wedging inconveniently in the spokes or the frame.

Suppose that the rear derailleur in question defaults to the 'high' gear i.e. in the absence of a cable, the derailleur's spring tries to shift the chain to the outer-most gear on the rear cluster. With this type of derailleur, it's fairly easy to manually shift the derailleur using the forefingers-and-thumb technique described above.

While pedaling, manually shift the chain away from the default position i.e. shift the chain to any lower gear by forcing the body of the derailleur inboard. Releasing the derailleur should result in the chain snapping back to the default, either the outboard gear, or one near it. If the chain does not shift to the smallest cog, locate the 'H' limit-stop screw on the body of the derailleur, and turn it outward a half-turn or less. Repeat pedaling and manually shifting to lower gears, and then releasing the derailleur. The chain should, by virtue of the spring in the derailleur, shift slightly farther outward on the cluster of gears for each small change in the depth of the 'H' screw.  

Continue making small adjustments to the 'H' screw, the &quot;high&quot; limit-stop screw, until the derailleur just reliably snaps the chain back onto the high gear, and that the chain passing over the high gear cog makes no noise (e.g. a chatter).

Test that the limit-stop screw is properly adjusted: turn the 'H' screw inward a half- or quarter-turn; pedal manually and manually shift the rear derailleur to a lower gear; release the derailleur and note whether the derailleur smartly returns the chain to the high gear. You will probably find that the half- or quarter-turn of the 'H' screw has introduced sluggishness in the movement to the high gear, a chattering of the chain as it runs on the default gear, or both. If you turn the 'H' screw outward the same half- or quarter-turn and the result is that the chain does reliably return to, and silently run over, the smallest cog, then the limit-stop screw is properly adjusted.

Setting up each derailleur's high and low limit-stop screws involves the principles outlined in the algorithm above, mutatis mutandis.

Eh, OK. I guess I can see that somebody might think &quot;hard&quot; means like a coconut shell. Maybe &quot;as hard as a lemon&quot; would be better? Tomatos should be kept somewhat cool ''in storage''. Intense cooking heat was covered by the following sentence; I don't imagine that anyone would be tempted to use intense heat for storage. BTW, given your comments on my talk page against changing spelling, I find it interesting that you changed the spelling of flavor. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:33, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

Okay, but you would want to discourage people storing them on a sunny window sill, for example. I've changes it to a cool room temperature. As I've rewritten almost all of the first paragraph, I just went with what my spell checker suggested (but not in the next paragraph).

if this is not blatantly and hideously obvious to you, you are either not well educated or are a psycho conservative prick pretending to be patriotic yet supporting bad people for illogical reasons

Why have you posted a commentary on George W. Bush's administration on the Ford-Carter-Reagan page?

__TOC__

 '''pragma''' Atomic (''local_name'');

== Description ==

'''Atomic''' is a [[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation pragmas|representation pragma]] that can be used with types and variables to specify that the code generated must read and write the type or variable from memory atomically, i.e. as a single/non-interruptible operation. It implies pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile|Volatile]], the difference is that pragma Atomic is stronger: the compilation must fail if the variable cannot be updated atomically.

This is typically used in the context of interfacing with hardware registers, which must be written atomically and where the compiler must not reorder or suppress any redundant read or write. In some cases it can also be used for tasking, but for communication of Ada tasks [[#Incorrect usage|it is safer to use protected types]] or other synchronization primitives.

== Example ==

 Device_Status : Status_Register;
 {{Ada/pragma|Atomic}} (Device_Status);
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Status'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/package||System|Storage_Elements}}.To_Address (16#8010_FF74#);

== Incorrect usage ==

{{:Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic:3}}
== Portability ==

=== Compilers ===

Atomic is a standard pragma since Ada 95, defined in the Systems Programming Annex (Annex C). This is a specialized needs annex, therefore this pragma is not available in those compilers not implementing that annex.

=== Ada versions ===

* Available in Ada 95 and Ada 2005.
* In Ada 83 pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Shared|Shared]] produces similar effects than pragma Atomic (but it is obsolescent since Ada 95).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup 
 |      title = pragma Shared (was Ada is almost ....)
 |     author = Robert Dewar
 |       date = 1996-02-17
 |  newsgroup = comp.lang.ada
 |        url = http://groups.google.es/group/comp.lang.ada/msg/eeee3a7515837ea2
 | accessdate = 2008-05-28
 |      quote = pragma Atomic is QUITE different from pragma Volatile. pragma Atomic in Ada is essentially identical to pragma Shared in Ada 83. pragma Volatile in Ada is essentially identical to volatile in C, and is a feature that is not available in Ada 83. 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platforms ===

Atomic is a portability aid between different platforms. For example, when porting between a 64-bit to a 32-bit architecture, the compiler will detect portability problems thanks to this pragma.

== Interfacing ==

The effects of pragma Atomic can be achieved in C using the type &lt;tt&gt;volatile sig_atomic_t&lt;/tt&gt;, defined in [[Wikipedia:signal.h|signal.h]] (called &lt;tt&gt;volatile std::sig_atomic_t&lt;/tt&gt; in C++). It is worth noting that the only values that can be portably stored in this type are 0&amp;ndash;127,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |        url = https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/DCL34-C.+Use+volatile+for+data+that+cannot+be+cached
 |      title = DCL34-C. Use volatile for data that cannot be cached
 | accessdate = 2009-01-10
 |     author = Justin Pincar
 |       date = 2008-11-19
 |       work = CERT C Secure Coding Standard
 |  publisher = [[w:Computer Emergency Response Team|Computer Emergency Response Team]]
 |      quote = Integer values from 0 through 127 can be safely stored to a variable of type &lt;tt&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/tt&gt;.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Ada pragma doesn't impose any specific limit (other than the type of the atomic object).

However, this C type is rarely known by programmers. Therefore, the C &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier is the approach widely used both for volatile and atomic data, even if atomic access in required. Thus, when interfacing with existing C code, the programmer must first read the code to understand whether the data needs atomic load and stores or not. If needed, the data should be marked in the Ada side with pragma Atomic or [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic_Components|Atomic_Components]]. Otherwise, pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile|Volatile]] or [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile_Components|Volatile_Components]] should be added instead.

[[w:C++11|C++11]] and [[w:C11 (C standard revision)|C11]] incorporated atomic operations and types,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |     author = Herb Sutter
 |      title = volatile vs. volatile

 |       date = 2009-01-08
 |  publisher = 
 |       issn = 
 |        url = http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/212701484
 |      quote = ISO C++ added them to the [[w:C++0x|C++0x]] draft Standard in 2007, under the templated name &lt;tt&gt;atomic&lt;T&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (e.g., atomic). They started to become available beginning in 2008 in the [http://www.boost.org/ Boost project] and other implementations. The ISO C++ atomics library also provides a C-compatible way to spell those types and their operations (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;atomic_int&lt;/tt&gt;), and these appear to be likely to be adopted by ISO C in the future. 
 | accessdate = 2009-01-10
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;, but differ from the semantics in Ada and are not compatible.

== Introduction ==

The mixed-model design gets its name because there are two types of variable, a between-subjects variable and a within-subjects variable.

== Research scenarios ==

===Example 1:===

An investigator is interested in the extent to which children are attentive to violent acts on television. An experiment is run with a sample of children: half boys and half girls. Each child views six scenes differing with respect to the level of violence. The dependent variable is a measure of attention during presentation of the scene.

The basic research question in this research scenario is the relationship between children’s attention to violent acts and the level of violence. A reasonable expectation is that children might be more attractive to scenes with high level of violence. However, this relationship may depend on the gender. We might expect a stronger relationship between attention and level of violence for boys than for girls. To test these hypotheses, a mixed-model design is used:
The dependent variable is ‘attention’.

There are two independent variables: the level of violence (factor A), and gender (factor B).
Each participant views six scenes differing with respect to the level of violence. Therefore, level of violence (factor A) is a within-subjects variable.

There are two groups of participants: boys and girls. They are independent with each other. Therefore, gender (factor B) is a between-subjects variable.

[[Image:Mixed_model_1.gif|center]]

If the relationship between one factor and the dependent variable dependents on the other factor, or is different at different level of the other factor, we say there is a interaction between the two factor (A*B). If we graphically plot the relationship, we will find that the lines are not parallel and interact.

Therefore, just like in two-way ANOVA, we test three effects: the effects due to the within-subjects variable, the effects due to the between-subjects variable, and the interaction between the two factors. A hypothetical result of the research example is shown in the following figure:

[[Image:Mixed_model_2.gif|center]]

As indicated in the figure, there is a main effect due to factor A (Levels of violence). Increasing level of violence results in the increase of attention.
There might be a main effect of factor B (Gender). Overall, boys are more attractive to the violent acts.
There is a clear interaction between the two factors.

===Example 2:===

To compare three teaching methods, an experiment was conducted in which one group was taught probability by a standard instructional method (A1), a second group was given additional problems (A2), and a third group received additional problems from a computer that provided immediate feedback (A3). It is expected that the new teaching method (e.g., A3) will be more effective than the traditional teaching method (e.g., A1). However, people might ask the question about how long the comparative advantage of the new teaching method will last. It might be possible that at the beginning the new teaching method is better than the traditional one. But as time pass by, the new teaching method may lose its comparative advantage. Therefore, the effects of the three teaching methods are compared in multiple occasions. In this study, all three groups were tested at the end of the instructional period, and then once every 2 weeks until four different tests had been given. The following table presents a data set for this hypothetical experiment. Assume that the tests were equated for difficulty so that any differences could be attributed to the passage of time. This design permits us to compare the instructional methods (A) and also to see the time course (B) following the end of instruction for each method.

=== Data analysis using SPSS ===

1.The data structure

There must be one variable to define the between-subjects variable.

2.ANOVA analysis

To conduct the ANOVA analysis, click ‘Analyze’---‘General Linear Model’---‘Repeated Measures’.
In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures Defin..’, give the within-subject factor a name by typing in “Time”. Tell SPSS how many levels the within-subject factor has. In our case, we have 4 levels (B1, B2, B3, and B4). Therefore, in the box right to ‘Number of Levels’, type in “4”. Click ‘Add’, you will see ‘time(4)’ appears in the box. This tells you that the within-subject factor is named as “time” and it has 4 levels. Click ‘Define’.

In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures’, you will see a box under ‘Within-Subjects Variables’. This is where you define the levels of the within-subjects variable. Highlight ‘b1’ and click the black arrow to move to the right box. You will see that the SPSS defined ‘b1’ as the first level of the within-subjects variable ‘time’. Highlight ‘b2’ and click the black arrow to move to the right box. You will see that the SPSS defined ‘b2’ as the second level of the within-subjects variable ‘time’. Continue this until all the levels are defined.

In the left box, highlight the between-subjects variable ‘teaching’, click the black arrow and move to the box under ‘Between-Subjects Factor(s):’.
 
To ask SPSS to calculate the means or other descriptive statistics, click ‘Options’. In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures: Options’, highlight all the factors in the upleft box and move to the box under ‘Display Means for:’. Click ‘Continue’. (The means for the overall sample, for each teaching method, for each time series, and for each combination of teaching method and time series will be calculated.)

To plots the trends by teaching methods, click ‘Plots’. In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures: Profile Plots’, in the box under ‘Factors’ highlight the within-subjects variable ‘time’ and move to the box under ‘Horizontal Axis’. Highlight the between-subjects variable ‘teaching’ and move to the box under ‘Separate Lines’. Click ‘Add’. You will see that ‘time*teaching’ appears in the bottom box. Click ‘Continue’.

Finally, click ‘OK’.

[[Image:Tamarillo CDC.jpg|right|tamarillo]]

The '''tamarillo''' or '''tree tomato''' is related to the [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] and [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillo]]. It is egg-shaped and pointed at both ends. The skin is tough and bitter and may be red, purple, amber, or golden yellow in color. The outer layer of apricot-colored flesh is slightly firm and the inside is filled with dark edible seeds that are slightly harder than those of a tomato. The flesh is tangy and tart, but flavorful. Tamarillos are native to South America, but most tamarillos sold in the United States are imported from New Zealand. This fruit is popular in South and Central America, the Caribbean, parts of Asia, and Australia.

==Selection==
Select fruit that is firm, unblemished and is heavy for its size. When ripe, tamarillos should be fragrant and should yield slightly to gentle pressure. Tamarillos are available from May to October in specialty stores and some supermarkets. They can occasionally be found out of season.

==Storage==
Tamarillos may be ripened at room temperature, then stored in the refrigerator or eaten once they are ripe. They last up to ten days in the refrigerator if wrapped in a plastic. Tamarillos may also be frozen if they are peeled and wrapped individually.

==Preparation==
Tamarillos should be peeled before eating or cooking. Blanching in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes is often the easiest way to remove the skin if the fruit is not ripe. They are often eaten raw, when ripe. Dip in frozen orange juice concentrate to sweeten the fruit and add to fruit or vegetable salads. Tamarillos are also often made into jams, chutneys and relishes.</text>

[[Image:Tomatillo 01 cropped.jpg|right|tomatillo]]

The '''tomatillo''' is related to the [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] and [[Cookbook:Tamarillo|tamarillo]]. Tomatillos are small vegetables (botanically fruits) with enclosing husks. They resemble small unripe tomatoes and are usually green or yellow. The yellow color indicates ripeness, but tomatillos are most often used when they are still green. Green tomatillos are firmer and easier to slice. The husk that holds the fruit is paper-like and is light brown. The flesh is slightly acidic with a hint of lemon.

==Selection==
The condition of the husk is often a good indicator when selecting tomatillos. If the husk is dry or shriveled then the fruit is probably not in good condition. Select tomatillos that have an intact, tight-fitting, light brown husk. If you peel back a small part of the husk (rather rude before purchase), the fruit should be firm and free of blemishes.

Canned tomatillos are available at specialty markets and are often used when making sauces. Tomatillos are available year round in supermarkets and specialty markets. Domestically grown tomatillos are available from May through November.

==Storage==
Fresh tomatillos with the husk still intact may be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. They are best stored in a paper bag. Tomatillos last a week longer in the refrigerator if the husks are removed and the fruit is placed in sealed plastic bags. Tomatillos may also be frozen after removing the husks.

==Preparation==
The husks must be removed before preparing. Wash the fruit with soap and water to remove the film left by the husk. Tomatillos may be used raw in salsas or salads or cooked for sauces. Cooking enhances the flavor and softens its skin, but the result is a soupy consistency since the fruit collapses after a few minutes.

==Recipes using tomatillos include==

[[Image:j0402474.jpg|frame|Model]]


A Model [http://www.bartleby.com/61/20/M0362000.html] is defined as a schematic description of a system, theory, or phenomenon that accounts for its known or inferred properties and may be used for further study of its characteristics. Examples are ''economic model''; ''instructional design model''; or ''instructional systems design model.'' A model can present complex information in a simpler way. Models can also provide frameworks for theory development and research. Models can be procedural (describing how something works) or conceptual (describing components and the relationships between these components). 

&lt;p&gt; Instuctional Design (ID) or Instructional Systems Design (ISD) Models are visual or verbal representations of the instructional design process that are used to guide and complete design in many training and educational settings (Seels &amp; Glasgow, 1998).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Those who are studying and/or practicing in the field of Instructional Technology are familiar with the basic instructional design model, the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) model. Seels and Glasgow explain that this model is &quot;unlikely to be used without modification or elaboration&quot; (p. 8). In other words, many individuals customize the ADDIE model to meet their unique needs.  Seels and Glasgow present their discussion of the ADDIE model in The Generic Instructional Design Model with decision questions for each stage of the ADDIE model (Seels &amp; Glasgow, 1998). &lt;/p&gt; The following is a very basic description of the ADDIE components.&lt;/p&gt;
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: the initial information gathering activities which assess the what, who, how and why of the instructional activity 
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: designing the objectives and desired outcomes of the instructional activity and the overall plan such as timelines, strategies, lesson plans,etc
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: the actual making of the instructional materials including instructor guides
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: putting the plan and the instructional materials into action such as completing and offering a computer-based instructional module 
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: checking for the effectiveness of the instructional program both immediately and in the long run

'''''Criticisms of the Use of Models in Designing Instruction'''''
*Can be too linear
*Not flexible enough, too rigid
*Very costly process
*Rarely used in the &quot;real&quot; world
*Could be too specific i.e. only applies to one particular situation
*Could be too general i.e. hard to figure out how to apply to a particular situation
== ID versus ISD ==

Many IT students are struggling to best define and differentiate between Instructional Design (ID) and Instructional Systems Design (ISD). For the purpose of discussing automating instructional design approaches and limitations, Spector &amp; Ohrazda (2003) define ID as a set of interdependent and complex activities that include situation assessment and problem identification, analysis and design, development and production, evaluation, and management and maintenance of learning process and the ID effort (Gagne, Briggs, &amp; Wager, 1992). However, ISD defines the entire set of processes and activities associated with ID and development. 


== Dick and Carey Model ==

The Dick and Carey model prescribes a methodology for designing instruction based on a reductionist model of breaking instruction down into smaller components. Instruction is specifically targeted on the skills and knowledge to be taught and supplies the appropriate conditions for the learning of these outcomes.

====Reference====

Dick, W., Carey, L. and Carey, J.O. (2001). The Systematic Design of Instruction. (5th Edition). Addison-Wesley Educational Publishers, Inc.

==Morrison/Ross/Kemp Model==

The Morrison, Ross and Kemp model has nine basic steps in the systematic design process, or what MRK refer to as a &quot;comprehensive instructional design plan&quot; (MRK, p. 7):

# Identify instructional problems, and specify goals for designing an instructional program. 
# Examine learner characteristics that should receive attention during planning. 
# Identify subject content, and analyze task components related to stated goals and purposes. 
# State instructional objectives for the learner. 
# Sequence content within each instructional unit for logical learning. 
# Design instructional strategies so that each learner can master the objectives. 
# Plan the instructional message and delivery. 
# Develop evaluation instruments to assess objectives. 
# Select resources to support instruction and learning activities.

==School-Based Model==

==General Military Model==


==Beeson Model==
''under construction''

Otherwise known as the IDDF+ADDIE Comprehensive Model for Learning &amp; Documentation Development, Beeson (2007) embeds the concepts of the ADDIE model into a broad, comprehensive model for developing learning and learning-related documentation that is scalable and applicable to nearly every situation where an initiative to develop learner skills has been undertaken.

== The 4C/ID-Model ==

The 4C/ID-Model, developed by Jeroen van Merriënboer (van Merriënboer, 1997; van Merriënboer, Jelsma, &amp; Paas, 1992), is characterized by four interrelated components that are essential in blueprints for complex learning environment. The components are
# Learning tasks
# Supportive information
# Procedural information
# Part-task practice.
These tasks are sequentially ordered and are to be performed by learners in a simulated environment. Van Merriënboer and others (1997) discuss the 4C/ID-Model [http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/clark_4cid.pdfs] as a structure of training blueprint for complex learning and associated instructional methods.

== The Merrill's 5-Star Model ==


Merrill's 5-Star Model [http://id2.usu.edu/5Star/Workshops/5StarWorkshop1.PDF ] also known as The First Principles of Instruction [http://id2.usu.edu/5Star/Index.htm], assumes design principles apply regardless of the instructional program or practice prescribed by a given theory or model (Merrill, 2001). According to Merrill [http://cito.byuh.edu/merrill/] , the properties of the The First Principles of Instruction are three-fold.
# Learning from a given program will be facilitated in direct proportion to its implementation of first principle.
# First principles can be implemented in any delivery system or using any instruction architecture.
# First principles of instruction are design oriented rather than learning oriented.

&lt;p&gt; The 4 distinct phases of learning identified with this problem-based instructional model are
# Activation of prior experience
# Demonstration of skills
# Application of Skills
# Integration of these skills into real world activities. &lt;/p&gt;


According to Merrill (2001), current instructional models suggest that the most effective learning environments are those that are problem-based and involve the student in the above-stated phases. The prescription for this statement is derived from multiple sources. For example, it is reported that current work in cognitive psychology indicates that students learn better when they are engaged in solving real-world problems (p.5). Showing learners the task or problem they will be able to solve is found to be more effective than stating abstract learning objectives (p.5). Consequently, Merrill argues that at the top level, the instructional design prescriptions based on the first princples are:

# Problem-based: That is, learning is facilitated when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. 

Some of the arguments/questions for this assertion are: How is the problem/task defined? What are the levels of difficulty in solving the problem? Is the problem simple or complex? How is instruction designed to solve simple or complex problems? Problem-based learning is well articultated in recent instructional models. Authors and reseachers in this area of study include Collins et al (1989); Schank et al (1999); Jonassen (1999); Savery &amp; Duffey (1995); Clark &amp; Blake (1997); and van Merriboer (1997).

== ADDIE in 3-D ==

Historically, instructional technology has taken a culturally neutral stance when it comes to the design of instruction. Recent research shows that culture has an enormous impact on how knowledge is conveyed, received and attained. Knowledge then is socially mediated and all socialization is grounded in culture. Because of this, Thomas, Mitchell and Joseph propose that Instructional Technology move from a systematic to systemic methodology. What’s the difference? Well, in a systemic system, practitioners would use a more integrated, holistic, multi-directional approach to the design of instruction.

The writers also contend that because culture is so much a part of the construction of knowledge that it must underpin not only the analysis phase, but all phases of the design process. Hence, ADDIE – The Third Dimension, which would, consists of three parameters: intention, interaction, and introspection. They go on to say that as culture is the heart of meaning making, it warrants exacting attention in the systemic design process. This way, we as ISD will be able to deliver more culturally sensitive products to an increasing global audience.


This new dimension is interesting and insightful. How have ADDIE, and other similar model structures embrace this concept of cultural sensitivity and similar neglected characteristics? Think of the GRE instructions and assessment. Not only GRE, but also SAT and other similar instructions and assessments designed to select qualified students worldwide.  Think of the new international student in the new educational and learning environment. Would there be a new paradigm shift to designing instructions?

== Instability: Not Always Bad? ==

Instability in systems is not always bad. Growth and evolution are both potential properties of unstable systems and can occur only when there is a net change in one or more system stocks.

;Growth:Growth, found in many forms, is essentially the change in the quantities of stocks (levels) within a system. Mostly thought of as a positive increase, growth is the change in the quantities of the system given the normal system structures, i.e. without changing the behavior of the system or the interaction of its components. Different forms of growth exist based on the system’s complexity. All that is required for the positive feedback loops to gain dominance is to have a very small net increase in the system. 

;Exponential Growth:The result of a dominance of positive feedback loops in a system is the exponential growth of its quantities. Exponential growth doubles the system stock quantities each period of time, regardless of the system size or complexity. This growth will continue within a system until it reaches the “carrying-capacity”. This capacity is the natural limits imposed on the system as to what it can sustain. As the limits are met, the negative feedback loops tend to gain dominance over the positive feedback loops. This slows the growth and even can cause decline in the system if the carrying-capacity limits were exceeded. 

== Limitations ==

Resources are not infinite, however. Eventually, real world systems must run out of the resources used to increase exponentially and may do so only after doubling the stocks a few times. Exponential growth in a system may be difficult to notice with only one or two iterations. As the time periods increase in the difference in the previous system state (i.e. the ability to notice change) will also double.

Note: To gain a conceptual idea of the true nature of exponential growth, see examples and explanations in pages 268-272 in Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, Sterman, 2000.

;S-Shaped Growth:Exponential growth continues until negative feedback loops (possibly in the form of resource restrictions) slow that growth. The slowing of this exponential growth in return to a stable system can produce the common pattern of an “S-Shaped Growth”. This pattern is dependent on the responsiveness of the negative feedback loop. Delays in the negative feedback loop allow the exponential growth to overshoot the equilibrium goal then create an oscillating graph pattern. Additionally, if the carrying capacity of the system is overshot due to this delay in negative feedback, the result will be a decline (collapse) of the system’s stock(s). This decline often remains until the system reaches the carrying capacity and regains equilibrium.

== Patterns of Growth ==

Growth in a system can occur in patterns other than the standard exponential or S-Shaped models. Linear growth, however, is often rare. What is thought to be linear is often a narrow field of view of a system’s growth. If widened, this narrow view often turns out to be exponential growth.

;Evolution:When the growth of a system changes the structure or behaviors of a system, instability will occur, if only briefly. Spontaneity in the system or just simply the release of non-advantageous components makes the system evolve. This evolution is the creation of a new generation of the previous system. Evolution of a system is driven by selection processes that effect the growth and stability of the system. These selection processes select against disadvantages in the system, rather than selecting for processes thought to be advantageous.

=== Example ===

Examine the growth of a plant over time. Eventually, the plant’s root system will expand to meet the needs of the plant. However, this root system did not grow in a direct manner. Rather, roots grew in various directions with some roots finding less nutrients and water than others. Thus, the plant naturally selects away from underproductive roots and the productive roots in the nutrient-rich areas thrive.

The example illustrates the process of evolution throughout the plant’s root system (a sub-system of its own). Evolution is a by-product of the system’s growth and periodic instability. As the system experiences periods of growth, the evolutionary choices allow the system to remain productive. Without evolution, the system would eventually be unable to compete with other systems for resources.

[[Image:ARS_HPSI47.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Uma&quot; guava]]
The '''guava''', also known as the '''bangkok apple''' or '''guayaba''', is an oval-shaped [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. It varies in size from a small [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] to a medium [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. The thin skin may be yellow, red, purple or nearly black and the flesh ranges from a pale yellow to a bright red. Guava is sweet with a slight tart aftertaste. Its texture is firm; similar to an apple. Guava is native to [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]], but is now commonly grown in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]], Florida, Hawaii and most parts of Africa and tropical Asia.

==Selection==
Select fruit that gives to gentle pressure and is unblemished. Fresh guavas are often only available in the region near where they are grown, but may be ordered by mail. Canned guava products are available nationwide throughout the year in larger supermarkets.

==Storage==
Store ripe guavas in the refrigerator for up to a week. Green, unripe guavas should be stored at room temperature until ripe. Ripe guavas stored at room temperature will spoil quickly; normally within a couple of a days.

==Preparation==
The entire guava is edible. The rind and small seeds inside, along with the creamy flesh are often used in making [[Cookbook:Jelly|jellies]], [[Cookbook:Jam|preserves]], and [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. To be eaten raw, guava needs to be very ripe. Guava is typically sliced lengthwise into 5 or 6 slices and seeds discarded.</text>

[[Image:horned melon CDC.jpg|right|horned melon]]

The '''horned melon''', also known as the '''kiwano melon''' and '''African horned melon''', is an oval-shaped [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] with horns on its peel. It has a bright orange and yellow skin with a pale yellow-green pulp inside. The flavor of the pulp is sweet and a bit tart with a flavor mix of [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]. Horned melon is native to southern and central [[Cookbook:African cuisines|Africa]]. Most imported melons are now from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] has began growing this melon, so a domestic product is available part of the year.

==Selection==
Select melons without any bruises or spots with a bright orange color. It is best to purchase a melon that has the horns intact, as damaged horns may be a sign of rough handling. Horned melons are available year round in specialty markets and supermarkets.

==Storage==
Unripe melons may be stored at room temperature for up to two weeks. Ripe melons will last about 3 to 4 days at room temperature. There is no need to refrigerate horned melon.

==Preparation==
There is no way to peel the skin off of the melon, so the fruit needs to be scooped out of the melon before using. The melon may be cut in half or into wedges to help extract the fruit pulp. The pulp may be eaten by itself, used as a topping for a sweet [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] or added to a fruit or green [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]. The shell may be used as a serving dish once the pulp is removed, but the skin should not be eaten.</text>

''“Knoppix is… so astoundingly useful it's nearly impossible to overpraise” -- [http://www.slashdot.org/ slashdot.org]''
=== What is Knoppix? ===
==== Linux that runs from CD  ====
[[w:Knoppix|Knoppix]] is an astonishingly clever product. It is a single CD that runs Linux on your PC or laptop. It gives you a full graphical desktop with networking, sound, the lot (subject to suitable hardware). No installation is necessary.

Knoppix is excellent for demonstrations, system recovery, or just testing how well the hardware in a given PC is supported. The Knoppix CD is compressed. On-the-fly transparent decompression gives a remarkable 1,600 Mb of software on a single 700 Mb CD.

==== Can be installed on a Hard Disk or a USB key ====

You can '''optionally''' install Knoppix on your hard drive from the Knoppix LiveCD. Type '''knoppix-installer''' in a [[w:root console|root console]] when using Knoppix.

For installation on a USB key see http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/USB_Based_FAQ

==== How it works ====
Start the computer using the Knoppix CD.
The existing software on the hard disk will be bypassed. The hard disk may still be accessed read-only. When you have finished using Knoppix, restart and take the CD out. The regular operating system will run as normal.
==== Safe to run ====
Knoppix leaves your existing software untouched. In fact, Knoppix can run on a computer with no hard disk at all! After running Knoppix, simply take the CD out of the drive. The computer will behave as if nothing has happened.

The general philosophy of Knoppix is to access disks in read-only mode as much as possible. This is ideal for beginners, because it protects against accidents.
==== Personal ====
Settings and personal files can be saved to a disk, such as a removable USB hard drive stick. This lets you store a personalised Knoppix setup and take it with you everywhere.

==== Free ====
Most amazing of all, Knoppix is free. The latest version is always available from the Knoppix download page. Not only is Knoppix free as in no charge, it is also free as in freedom. Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled:
*To make unlimited copies.
*To use one copy on as many computers as you like.
*To give unlimited copies to your friends.
*To sell unlimited copies.
*To customise it to suit yourself.
*To redistribute your customised versions.

=== What you can do with Knoppix ===
==== Learn Linux ====
This book is designed to help you run Linux for the very first time. Knoppix is perfect for newcomers. Linux isn't going away any time soon. That is why learning it is an investment in your time that will pay off for years to come.
This book is meant for people who are at least reasonably familiar with computers. For example, I assume you know your way around your computer's mouse, keyboard, CD drive, and so on.
==== Rescue and test ====
Knoppix is a wonderful tool for rescuing and testing PCs. I will provide enough information to be useful, without going into mind-bending detail. With Knoppix it is possible to:
*Read files from Windows formatted hard disks, even when the operating system installed on the hard disk cannot be started (unless the hard disk has an unrecoverable data error, or if it is physically damaged).
*Copy files onto other disks, such as removable USB drives, Zip drives, CD-RW blanks and network drives (given suitable hardware).
*Identify hardware, even when Windows cannot identify it (subject to certain limitations).
==== Use and explore ====
Knoppix is a complete desktop system. Use it:
*To print.
*To play music.
*To use a scanner or a digital camera.
*To connect to the Internet.
*To browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
*To send and receive Internet email.
*To try out the built-in office applications, graphics tools, sound playing, video playing, Internet applications and games.

==== Network ====
Knoppix is a child of the Internet. Knoppix does networking with its eyes closed. For security reasons, Knoppix does not automatically run any servers that could be accessed from the outside.
=== Where Knoppix comes from ===
Knoppix was created in Germany by Klaus Knopper. Knoppix is a volunteer, co-operative, community effort. It exists entirely on the Internet. At the moment Knopper is the man who does most of the work on the disk. He does get patches and some scripts from the community, but he is still the most important person.
The Knoppix project is hosted by LinuxTag, which is based in Germany at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern. The LinuxTag team runs conferences, workshops and exhibitions for everyone interested in Linux and Free Software.

=== Knoppix is Free Software ===
Knoppix is ''Free Software''. It is licensed under the ''GNU General Public Licence (GPL)''. Free Software is not freeware, and not shareware. Free Software means “free as in freedom”, not necessarily price. This means you are allowed to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve Knoppix at no charge.

The catch is that when you give (or sell) copies to other people, you must give them the same freedoms under which you received it. This limitation ensures that Knoppix is free now and will remain free forever.  For more details, see the license text at the end of this book.
 '''Web link'''
 The Free Software Definition: 
 [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html]
=== Limitations ===
==== No warranty ====
First and most important of all, Knoppix is experimental software. There is no warranty. Use it at your own risk.
==== CD means slow ====
Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) drives are much slower than hard disk drives. This means that some applications on the Knoppix CD may take a long time to start; much longer than they would do on a full permanent Linux system. However, Knoppix has some clever (optional) tricks that can spectacularly speed things up.

Knoppix does not get very far on unreliable CD-ROM drives. Since everything has to be loaded from CD, it falls over pretty quickly if CD-ROM errors occur, or if the Knoppix CD itself is damaged. Knoppix has built-in tools for testing its own media.

==== Not everything works ====
Knoppix supports a huge range of common PC hardware, but not everything. Internal dial-up modems and external USB broadband modems tend not to work. AOL and Compuserve are completely incompatible. Certain cheap printers may be useless. Many cheap colour laser printers do not work. Support for wireless (802.11b) network adapters is limited at best. Certain types of multimedia audio and video files are unplayable. Most commercial DVD movie discs cannot be played. In general, Knoppix does not run Windows software.
==== RAM intensive ====
Knoppix works by loading everything into Random Access Memory (RAM). The more RAM you have, the better. For typical performance, you need 128 Mb of RAM.

If you are lucky enough to have 828 Mb of RAM or more, Knoppix has clever tricks to make good use of all the RAM in your computer. This can deliver blazingly fast performance.

If you have less than 128 Mb of RAM, Knoppix has the ability to use part of the hard disk as if it were RAM. This is called creating a ''swap file''. However, this technique does not work on all hard disks, and performance is much slower than real RAM.

Putting it all together is the work of the [[w:Debian|Debian]] project. The result is called the Debian ''distribution''. This means that Knoppix is Debian modified to run on a self-contained CD.
=== What is Linux? ===
Linux (pronounced &quot;lin-ucks&quot;) is a free [[w:operating system|operating system]]. An &quot;operating system&quot; is the base software that makes a computer useful.

Strictly speaking, Linux is the ''kernel''. The kernel is the core component of the operating system. Think of an operating system as a nut. The ''shell'' is the part that you use. The kernel is the core that talks to the computer's hardware.
 '''Note'''
 There are many different Linux ''distributions''.
 But there is only one current version of the [[w:Linux kernel|Linux kernel]].
 Therefore, every distribution contains Linux.
==== A little history ====
In the 1970s, computer ''programs'' were free. A program is a sequence of instructions that makes a “calculating machine” do something useful. The engineers who worked on these instructions became known as programmers. They shared their know-how with each other. They found that it made their work more pleasant.

Unfortunately, this co-operative spirit died under commercial pressures. Restrictive practices in the fast-growing “software industry” meant that sharing the most useful programs and some of the most vital technical information became largely impossible.

A man named Richard Stallman was greatly frustrated by this change. He wanted to bring back the spirit of the early days that he had known at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
He knew that he had the perfect skills to build a free operating system. He knew that if he didn't do it, no-one would. So he decided to do it, or “die trying”.

By the 1990s, Stallman's [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] had found or created nearly all the components of a free operating system. He called his creation “[[w:GNU|GNU's Not UNIX]]”.

The name is a joke designed to poke fun at the alphabet soup of computer acronyms. Some acronyms have other acronyms as part of their definition. The GNU acronym takes this one stage further - it has its own acronym as part of its definition. “Is Not” is a way of saying “is like” or “is compatible with”.

''UNIX'' refers to a family of operating systems that were used mainly in science, engineering and finance. Stallman chose to base his efforts on UNIX because it was tried and tested. It would also be convenient for other people to switch from UNIX to GNU.
===== How GNU grew =====
[[Image:Linus Torvalds talking.jpeg|right|thumb|Linux creator Linus Torvalds.]]
In 1991, the GNU project still lacked a kernel, the vital core component of an operating system. Luckily, a student in Finland called Linus Torvalds created one “as a hobby”.

In 1991, Torvalds produced a simple, basic system called “Freax”. He called it “Linux” privately but never meant it to be called that in public, because he didn't want to be too egotistical. He made it free because he wanted feedback. It was posted on the Internet by a friend.

Pretty soon, Torvalds began receiving email from places he'd dreamed of visiting, like Australia and the United States. Instead of cash, Linus preferred postcards. His sister Sara was suddenly impressed that her brother was somehow hearing from new friends far away.

Torvalds had used the Free Software Foundation's tools, so he decided to make it free likewise. This was a way to say “thank you”. He decided to put Linux under the Free Software Foundation's ''General Public Licence''. This meant that anyone could use, improve or sell Linux, but no-one could take overall control.
===== It's a GNU world! =====
From there, it snowballed in the most extraordinary way. It has catapulted Torvalds to accidental super-stardom. He has appeared on the cover of ''Time'' magazine. We should remember that Stallman started it all. That is why the full title of Linux is ''GNU/Linux''. In other words, Knoppix is a Linux-based GNU system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Knoppix for the first time ==
''“The most important design issue… is that Linux is supposed to be fun.” -- Linus Torvalds''
=== Overview ===
The purpose of this section is to get you started into Knoppix for the very first time. This section skips nearly all of the options for starting Knoppix. The options for starting Knoppix are explained later.
=== Hardware requirements ===
The recommended hardware is as follows:
*Pentium I 350 Mhz processor (recommended minimum).
*128 Mb RAM.
*Either: IDE or SCSI bootable CD-ROM or DVD drive
*Or: 3.5&quot; floppy drive plus non-bootable CD-ROM or DVD drive.
*SVGA compatible graphics card (most cards supported).
*Monitor capable of 800x600 pixel resolution.
*Serial mouse, or PS/2 mouse, or USB mouse.

=== Starting Knoppix ===
There are two stages to starting Knoppix:
==== The first stage ====
The first stage is to get to the ''boot prompt''. The boot prompt lets you customise the Knoppix startup process. For example, you can specify at the boot prompt what screen resolution you want Knoppix to use. To reach the boot prompt, you use either the CD/DVD or the floppy disk. What about some instructions for use with USB???

==== The second stage ====
The second stage is to run Knoppix itself. This requires the CD/DVD. Knoppix follows the instructions given at the boot prompt to complete the startup process.

=== The first stage ===
==== Getting to the boot prompt ====
To get to the boot prompt, follow these steps:
#If the computer is already on, insert the Knoppix CD/DVD. If the CD/DVD drive is set to ''auto-run'', information explaining about Knoppix will appear. Restart the computer.
#If the computer is off, turn it on, then immediately insert the Knoppix CD/DVD. To play for time, press the Pause/Break key immediately after turning your computer on. On many PCs and laptops, this will [[w:pause|pause]] the BIOS, giving you more time to insert the CD/DVD. Then press the Pause/Break key again to resume startup.
#Most newer computers will automatically check for a bootable CD/DVD in the first drive. The Knoppix boot prompt should then appear. The [[w:boot|boot]] prompt is the last three lines at the bottom of the screen. If your computer can't display the white and blue Knoppix logo, you will get a blue background instead. &lt;br/&gt;
#On some computers, you must press a key for the “[[w:boot device menu|boot device menu]]”. The boot device menu is used to tell the computer which drive to boot from. A prompt saying which key will display the boot menu will appear on the screen just after you turn the computer on. For example, on some Dell desktop PCs, press F12 when prompted, press the Down Arrow key until “Boot from IDE-CDROM” is highlighted, then press Enter.
#At the boot prompt, press Enter to boot Knoppix accepting all the defaults (including the German keyboard/language.) If you do nothing for 60 seconds, Knoppix boots automatically. To boot Knoppix with another keyboard/language, see the section “Which language?” below.
 '''Tip'''
 If you have two CD/DVD drives, and one of them is a CD/DVD Re-Writable drive, 
 put the Knoppix CD/DVD in the other drive.
 Keep your writable drive empty if you can.
 This will let you try out the CD/DVD writing features in Knoppix easily at a later time.

==== Help at the boot prompt ====
Press F2 for the [[w:help screen|help screen]]. The help screen is a summary of the boot prompt options. Pressing F2 or any other key cancels the timer, so Knoppix will not automatically boot.
===== Quick help =====
'''Question: How do I get out of the boot prompt?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Take the disc out of the drive, then restart your computer.

'''Question: How do I use the boot floppy?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Turn off the computer. Insert the Knoppix boot floppy disk. Turn the computer back on. The computer should boot from the floppy drive. Then the Knoppix boot prompt should appear.

If that doesn't work, enter your computer's Basic In/Out System (BIOS) setup. The key to press that takes you into the BIOS setup is usually shown on the screen just after you turn the computer on. Visit the [[w:boot priority|boot priority]] screen (it may have another name such as ''boot device menu''). Set the BIOS to boot from the CD/DVD or floppy drive before the hard disk drive. If unsure, check with your motherboard or computer manufacturer.

'''Question: The computer has two CD-ROM drives. Why does the Knoppix disc boot in one drive but not the other?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Some BIOSes can only boot the ''first'' CD-ROM/DVD drive. To work around the problem, start up from the Knoppix boot floppy disk. Then you can put the Knoppix CD/DVD in either CD-ROM/DVD drive. If you are really determined, switch the CD-ROM/DVD [[w:drive order|drive order]] so the drive you want to boot from is the first drive.

=== The second stage ===
==== Starting Knoppix proper ====
To start Knoppix with the United Kingdom keyboard/language:
#Type this at the boot prompt: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=uk&lt;/code&gt;
#Press the Enter key on the keyboard.
#Knoppix will begin loading with the UK keyboard/language.
==== Which keyboard/language? ====
The most important option at the boot prompt is the [[w:keyboard|keyboard]]/[[w:language|language]]. More correctly, the keyboard/language option sets the [[w:locale|locale]]. A locale is a collection of regional settings including keyboard layout, language, time format, date format, currency format and paper size. Some language translations may be incomplete.

The locale options are named using the International Standards Organisation two-letter country codes (ISO 3166 and ISO 639). The locale options are:
{| border=1

|}
==== Automatic hardware detection ====
Knoppix will then try to detect the various items of hardware in your computer. How long it takes depends upon the speed of your machine. Here are some examples to give you an idea of what to expect:
{| border=1
!Processor
!RAM
!CD-ROM speed
!Time needed
|-
|Intel Pentium 4 (2.6 Ghz)
|512 Mb
|48x
|40 seconds
|-
|AMD Duron (1 Ghz)
|256 Mb
|32x
|45 seconds
|-
|AMD Athlon (600 Mhz)
|128 Mb
|24x
|1 min 30 seconds
|}
==== The X Window System ====
Next, it will briefly say “INIT: Entering runlevel 5” and then Knoppix will try to start the [[w:X Window System|X Window System]]. The X Window System is the graphics display.

If you have a supported graphics card, you will see a black cross on a grey stippled background. This means the X Window System started successfully.
==== The K Desktop Environment ====
Knoppix will begin loading the ''K Desktop Environment''. KDE runs on top of the X Window System. The progress of loading KDE will be shown in the middle of the screen. When KDE has finished loading, the welcome page will be loaded.

When the welcome page appears, congratulations! You have started Linux, the X Window System, and the K Desktop Environment successfully.
==== Quick help ====
'''Question: Why does KDE come up in German?'''&lt;br/&gt;
You need to specify the [[w:keyboard|keyboard]]/[[w:language|language]] at the boot prompt. For example, for the UK locale, enter &lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=uk&lt;/code&gt; at the boot prompt.

'''Question: It says 'cloop: read error', what does that mean?'''&lt;br/&gt;
There is a problem reading the Knoppix CD. You either have a faulty CD-ROM drive or a damaged CD. To test the Knoppix CD, enter at the boot prompt:
 knoppix testcd
This will make Knoppix check the media for errors. If you know that the Knoppix CD is good, this error usually means a faulty CD-ROM drive.

'''Question: I get a blank screen when the X Window System comes up, why?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Knoppix is trying to use a [[w:screen resolution|screen resolution]] that your monitor doesn't support. For example, Knoppix may have detected your graphics card is capable of 1024x768 pixel resolution, but your monitor can't cope with that. Try setting a lower resolution at the boot prompt. For example, enter:
 knoppix lang=uk screen=800x600
This will make Knoppix use a screen resolution of 800 by 600 pixels when it starts the X Window System.

'''Question: Why does the screen go blank when the kernel boots?'''&lt;br/&gt;
This problem usually occurs with low cost TFT (flat screen) monitors. The kernel is using a ''framebuffer'' console, but the monitor is incompatible with it. Turn off the ''framebuffer console''. At the boot prompt, use the option “''vga''=normal”. For example, type:
 knoppix lang=uk vga=normal
This will turn off the framebuffer console and the penguin logo.

'''Question: Why doesn't the mouse work?'''&lt;br/&gt;
This could mean you are trying to use a PS/2 mouse in a 9-pin serial port through a PS/2-to-serial adapter. Some PS/2 mice do not work when plugged into a 9-pin serial port. Try a real serial mouse.

'''Question: It says “Initrd extends beyond end of memory”.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Your motherboard is reporting the RAM size incorrectly. Specify the amount of physical RAM in your computer at the boot prompt. For example, if you have 128 Mb of RAM, enter at the boot prompt:
 knoppix lang=uk mem=128M

'''Question: It says “Could not find the KNOPPIX filesystem, sorry. Dropping you to a (very limited) shell.”'''&lt;br/&gt;
Try booting with:
 knoppix ide2=0x180 nopcmcia
If that doesn't work, it means your PCMCIA CD-ROM drive is not supported. There is a workaround. In Windows, copy the directory called “KNOPPIX” from the ''Knoppix'' CD to the root of a local FAT formatted hard drive partition (''eg'': drive “C:”). The copy will take some time to complete. Then start ''Knoppix'' and specify the partition that you copied the KNOPPIX directory to, using the “''fromhd''=” boot parameter. For example, boot with:
 knoppix fromhd=/dev/hda1
If Windows is not available, use a single-floppy Linux such as “tomsrtbt” to do the copy, however that is beyond the scope of this book.

=== Getting out ===
Now that you've got Knoppix up and running, feel free to have a poke around. Everything is read-only, so you're unlikely to do any harm to your computer. To [[w:exit|exit]] Knoppix:
#Click the “K” menu in the bottom left corner.
#Click “Logout”. &lt;br/&gt;
#Knoppix will begin shutting down.
#The Knoppix CD will be ejected.
#Remove the CD and close the tray.
#Press Enter on the keyboard.
#Knoppix will attempt to turn off the computer automatically. If it doesn't turn off automatically, it is now safe to turn off the computer yourself using the power button.
 '''Tip'''
 For a quick exit, press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. This “three finger salute” kills the [[w:X Window System|X Window System]].
 Killing the X Window System takes down KDE and all its open applications.
 Knoppix will then shut down automatically.

== The K Desktop Environment ==
[[Image:Konqi-klogo-official-400x500 b.png|thumb|right|Konqi: the KDE mascot]]
The ''K Desktop Environment'' is a modern, powerful and free [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]] environment for UNIX compatible systems. Its name is a play on the ''Common Desktop Environment'' created by Sun Microsystems in the 1980s. This section explains what KDE has to offer.
 '''Web link'''
 The home page of the K Desktop Environment:
 [http://www.kde.org/ http://www.kde.org/]
=== Single click, not double-click ===
KDE looks familiar to Windows and Macintosh users because it takes some of the best elements from each. There is an important difference: everything is single click. Nothing needs a double-click to make it work. If you double-click, you'll end up with a program running twice, or something else you don't need. Just [[w:single click|single click]]. To revert this to what you may be used to, there is an appropriate setting under Peripherals -&gt; Mouse in the Control Center.
 '''Tip'''
 To [[w:select a file|select a file]] instead of opening it, hold down the Ctrl key and click the left mouse button.
 The icon will be selected, rather than opened.
 It is then safe to let go of the Ctrl key.

=== Context menus everywhere ===
Most icons have a [[w:context menu|context menu]]. To get the context menu for an icon, right-click on the icon.
You'll get a little pop-up menu of common actions for that icon. This also works on window edges, toolbars, and just about everything else.
 '''Tip'''
 Right-click to see the context menu for an item.
=== Hover the mouse for help ===
Like Macintosh and Windows, most icons have a tooltip. Hover the mouse pointer over an icon. A little yellow label will tell you what that icon does.
Tooltips only work in the current active window. This means that if you have two windows open, you will only get tooltips in the window that is at the front. To get [[w:tooltip|tooltips]] in the other window, you must click it to bring it to the front.
 '''Tip'''
 Not sure what an icon does? Hover the mouse pointer over it.
=== The Desktop ===
The main part of the screen is called the ''[[w:Desktop|Desktop]]''. This is where the application windows appear. There are also icons for each ''disk device'' in the system.

Here are device icons for two CD-ROM drives, a 1.44 Mb floppy drive, and a hard disk partition. Notice that the “hard disk partition” icon has the name “hda1”. Knoppix has its own way of naming disks and partitions. For details, see the section “Knoppix essentials”.
These icons are actually hyperlinks. In other words, they are just pointers to the place in the system where the files appear. You can't drag and drop files and folders onto Desktop device icons, as you can on the Apple Macintosh.
 '''Note'''
 Desktop icons are shortcuts. There are no files inside Desktop icons.
 Instead, Desktop icons are just pointers to the places where the files actually appear.
If you plug in a hot-pluggable disk device, such as a USB external hard drive, a new icon for it will appear on the Desktop. This behaviour will be familiar to Apple Macintosh users.
=== The Panel ===
At the bottom of the screen is the ''[[w:Panel|Panel]]''. The Panel is always visible. It contains various utilities and status information.
==== K Menu ====
In the far left corner of the Panel is the ''[[w:K Menu|K Menu]]'' which is just like the Windows “Start” menu. Click for a list of programs that are available on the system.
==== Quick launch ====
Next to the K Menu are ''[[w:Quick Launch|Quick Launch]]'' icons. These icons represent frequently used programs.
Hover the mouse pointer over the program icon for a description of what it does. Single-click on the icon to start that program. Be aware that the ''OpenOffice'' program may take several minutes to start, especially if you have a slower computer.
==== Desktop Guide ====
The ''[[w:Desktop Guide|Desktop Guide]]'' consists of four squares. Each square represents one desktop. You start off in the first desktop. Click in the Desktop Guide to switch between the four available desktops.
To move open windows between Desktops, click the Window Control Box at the top left corner of the window. Point at “To desktop”, then choose the Desktop that you would like to send the window to.
==== Taskbar ====
A button is shown in the ''[[w:Taskbar|Taskbar]]'' for each open window. This example shows three open windows; ''Konsole'', the ''Konqueror'' web browser, and the ''GIMP'' graphics editor.
==== System Tray ====
The ''[[w:System Tray|System Tray]]'' contains an icon for the current keyboard layout. To view the available keyboard layouts, right-click on the keyboard layout icon.
==== Clock ====
The [[w:clock|clock]] shows the time and date.
==== Hide Panel ====
At each end of the Panel is a ''Hide Panel'' button. Click the Hide Panel button to make the Panel shrink to that side of the screen. Click the button again to unhide the Panel. Drag the Hide Panel button to move the entire Panel from one side of the screen to another.
=== Left mouse button selects text, middle button pastes ===
To [[w:copy and paste|copy and paste]] text using a three button mouse:
#Select the text that you want to copy and paste with the left mouse button, so that the text is highlighted.
#Point to the place where you want the text to go.
#Click the middle mouse button. The last selected text will be pasted from the X Window System's ''copy buffer'' into the place where you clicked.

== Alternatives to KDE ==
For whatever reason, you may you might want to try something other than KDE.  Several alternatives exist, such as [[w:GNOME|GNOME]], Xfce, and WindowMaker. GNOME, being an entirely separate desktop environment rather than a window manager, is distributed within [[w:Gnoppix|Gnoppix]]. For more info, see [[Knowing Knoppix/Alternatives to KDE|Alternatives to KDE]]. Once knoppix has loaded you can switch between the various alternatives.

In newer versions of Knoppix, [[w:Beryl (window manager)|Beryl]] may be supported (this depends on your hardware). Although using Beryl is almost identical to using KDE it must be specified at boot time with the :
 knoppix desktop=beryl

''“If I ever met Bill Gates, there wouldn't be much of a meeting point. I couldn't tell him about business, and he couldn't tell me about technology.” -- Linus Torvalds''

This section contains important background information that will help you understand the rest of this book. If you are in a hurry, skip over this section. The terms explained in this section will be used often, so you may need to refer back to this page later.
=== File names ===
The following rules apply to file names in ''Knoppix''.
*'''Case sensitive.''' This causes the most problems for beginners. For example, “myfile.txt”, “MyFile.txt” and “'''MYFILE.TXT'''” are all different names.
*'''Long file names are allowed.''' File names can be up to 255 characters long.
*'''There is no “C:” drive.''' Instead, all files are arranged in a tree beginning with “/”, which is called the ''[[w:root directory|root directory]]''. The “root directory” is like “My Computer”. It is the starting point for everything stored inside in the computer.
*'''Forward slashes.''' For example, in Windows, part of the location of an image file might be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;My Documents\My Pictures\duck.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ''Knoppix'', the backslashes that represent the path to the file are written as forward slashes instead, like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;My Documents/My Pictures/duck.jpg&lt;/code&gt;
 '''Note'''
 What's the difference between a directory and a folder? Not much.
 A folder is just the icon that is usually used to represent a directory.
 The words “directory” and “folder” are ''interchangeable''.
 Remember, a hard disk is like a filing cabinet.
 Partitions are like drawers, directories are like folders, and files are like individual documents.
=== Drive names ===
You may be used to Microsoft Windows' naming scheme for disk drives. For example, you may be used to “drive A:” for the first floppy drive; “drive C:” for the first visible hard drive partition, and so on. Knoppix has its own drive naming scheme. This section explains how the naming scheme works.
==== Disk types ====
The naming scheme starts with a two-letter code for the type of disk.
{| border=1
!Name
!Drive type
|-
|fd
|Conventional floppy drive
|-
|hd
|Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) drive
|-
|sd
|Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) drive
|}
==== IDE drives ====
[[w:IDE drive|IDE drives]] are the most common in desktop PCs and laptops. A single letter indicates how the drive is connected. Most PCs and laptops have two IDE ''channels'': [[w:primary|primary]] and [[w:secondary|secondary]]. Each channel can have up to two devices: [[w:master|master]] and [[w:slave|slave]].
{| border=1
!Name
!IDE drive 
|-
|hda
|Primary Master
|-
|hdb
|Primary Slave
|-
|hdc
|Secondary Master
|-
|hdd
|Secondary Slave
|}
==== SCSI drives ====
For [[w:SCSI drive|SCSI drives]], a single letter indicates its location. This is called its position in the ''SCSI chain''. Zip, USB and Firewire drives are also treated as SCSI drives.
{| border=1
!Name
!SCSI drive location
|-
|sda
|First SCSI drive
|-
|sdb
|Second SCSI drive
|-
|sdc
|Third SCSI drive
|}

==== Disk partitions ====
IDE and SCSI hard drives are divided into ''partitions''. Zip, USB and Firewire drives also contain [[w:partitions|partitions]]. A partition is like a compartment within a disk. There may be a single partition that covers the entire disk. There may be more than one partition. Each partition is indicated by a number.
{| border=1
!Name
!Drive
!Partition
|-
|hda1
|Primary master IDE drive
|First partition
|-
|hda2
|Primary master IDE drive
|Second partition
|-
|hda3
|Primary master IDE drive
|Third partition
|}
==== SCSI emulation for IDE CD-ROM drives ====
IDE CD-ROM drives are treated as SCSI drives. This is called ''SCSI emulation''. SCSI emulation is there so that CD burning applications can use the same language to talk to SCSI and IDE drives.
{| border=1
!Name
!CD-ROM drive
|-
|scd0
|First CD-ROM drive
|-
|scd1
|Second CD-ROM drive
|-
|scd2
|Third CD-ROM drive
|}
==== Conventional 1.44 Mb floppy drives ====
For ordinary [[w:floppy disk|floppy disk]] drives, a number shows the drive number.
{| border=1
!Name
!Floppy drive number
|-
|fd0
|First floppy drive
|-
|fd1
|Second floppy drive
|}
=== Drive detection ===
Knoppix automatically [[w:detect|detects]] all IDE and SCSI devices. The names of the devices are printed in the startup messages (Ctrl+Alt+F1). Here is an example:
 hda: [FUJITSU MPA3026AT]
 hdb: [LS-120 VER5 00 UHD FLOPPY]
 hdc: [HITACHI DVD-ROM GD-2500]
 hdd: [MATSHITA CD-RW CD-7586]
This example shows that the primary master is a Fujitsu hard drive. The primary slave is an Imation LS-120 SuperDisk drive. The secondary master is a Hitachi DVD-ROM drive. The secondary slave is a Matshita CD-RW drive.
=== Partition detection ===
''Knoppix'' automatically detects all [[w:partitions|partitions]] on all IDE and SCSI devices. For example, given a single Windows partition on the primary master IDE hard drive, the following ''device name'' will be created:
 /dev/hda1
This means the partition will be called /dev/hda1 in Knoppix.
 '''Note'''
 Some removable disks also have partitions, notably Iomega Zip disks.
 For the partitions on an Iomega Zip disk to be detected properly, you must insert the disk into the drive before you start Knoppix.
=== Mount points ===
Each device name has a ''[[w:mount point|mount point]]''. This is a special place where the files on a device appear. A mount point is created automatically for each device name. For example, given the Fujitsu drive above, the following mount point will be created:
 /mnt/hda1
This means the partition /dev/hda1 will be mounted to /mnt/hda1.
==== Auto-mounting of floppy and CD-ROM drives ====
Conventional floppy and CD-ROM drives are ''[[w:auto-mount|auto-mounted]]''. This means Knoppix takes care of mounting and unmounting them automatically. The auto-mount locations are:
*First floppy drive: /mnt/floppy
*Second floppy drive: /mnt/floppy1
*First CD-ROM drive: /mnt/cdrom
*Second CD-ROM drive: /mnt/cdrom1
=== Login accounts ===
When you start Knoppix, you are logged in automatically. No [[w:passwords|passwords]] are needed. All passwords are locked by default. Knoppix bypasses all the usernames and passwords of the operating system installed on the hard disk.
{| border=1
!Keyboard shortcut
!Virtual terminal
!Logged in as user account
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F1
|Console number 1
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F2
|Console number 2
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F3
|Console number 3
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F4
|Console number 4
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F5
|[[w:X Window System|X Window System]] (KDE)
|knoppix
|}
You can switch between the virtual terminals at any time. For example, to switch to the first console, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. The Knoppix startup messages will be displayed. To switch to the second console, press Ctrl+Alt+F2. To get back to the X Window System, press Ctrl+Alt+F5.
 '''Note'''
 The X Window System is on virtual terminal number 5.

=== User accounts ===
==== The user account ====
The Knoppix ''[[w:user|user]]'' account is called “''knoppix''”. This account is for all productivity tasks, including CD burning and printing. When the X Window System starts, you are logged in to that user account automatically, without a password.
==== The superuser account ====
The ''[[w:superuser|superuser]]'' account is for system administration tasks. The superuser account is called the ''root account''. When ''Knoppix'' starts, you are logged in as ''[[w:root|root]]'' to all four consoles automatically with no password. It is also possible to use the root account within the X Window System.
 '''Important'''
 As with other Linux distributions, use the ''user'' account for all your everyday tasks.
 Only use the ''root'' account when you need it.&lt;br/&gt;
 For example, when you are logged on as ''root'', you have the power to instantly delete every file on every disk with one simple command.
 When you are logged on as a ''user'', the system will not let you do that. This helps you to protect yourself against accidents.
 Get into the habit now and it will save you later!

      <text xml:space="preserve">3ds Max is a bulky application, and for game artists, many of the features go unused. This project is an attempt to strip down 3ds max 5 to the modeling, animating, unwrapping, and character setup minimum.

==Precautions==
Don't delete Max's components right off. Create a backup folder somewhere and ''move'' the files into that folder. That way, if anything screws up, you can easily retrieve the files without having to reinstall max. Common sense, but some people tend to be a tad trigger happy.

==Removable Plugins==
First of all, what one person believes is removable may be indispensable to your workflow, so make that discretion before getting rid of those plugins. 3ds max's architecture is plugin based, so the first place I headed to was the ''plugins'' directory.

Taking a look at Plug-in Manager, these are the plugins loaded on startup and what they do.

'''DLU'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLU files are Utility plugins.
They are basic utilities such as the Polygon Counter, advanced utilities such as Reactor, and even legacy utilities such as Dynamics.

COMSRVUI.DLU&lt;br&gt;
UVREMOVE.DLU&lt;br&gt;
COLLECTOR.DLU&lt;br&gt;
HSUTIL.DLU&lt;br&gt;

APOLLO3.DLV&lt;br&gt;

'''FLT'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLC'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLO'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLO files are Object plugins.
They create new objects. For example, if you install a &quot;antmodel.dlo&quot; file, it will allow you to create ants. Found on the Create Panel, in the dropdown list that says &quot;Standard Primitives&quot;. There it will show a new section that contains the object type that the plugin provides.

'''BMI''' - 2D Image File Format I/O&lt;br&gt;

'''DLR'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLR files are Render plugins.
They're pretty rare compared to the other types, but they're still a valid plugin. They will be found in the Render Scene window (F10) under the &quot;Current Renderers&quot; rollout. Click on the &quot;Assign...&quot; button and it will open a new window for you to choose the renderer you want to use. (by default there will only be one renderer showing, the &quot;VUE File Renderer&quot;, since the Default Scanline is already in use)

'''DLM'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLM files are Material plugins.
They will be found in the Material Editor as new material types (where it says Standard, Raytrace, Multi/Sub-object, etc., there will be more)

'''GUP'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLT'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLT files are Texture plugins.
They will be found in the Material Editor as well, but will be as Maps, such as Brick, Speckle, Noise, etc. (usually the maps are the same name as the plugin)

'''BMS'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLZ'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLI''' - 3D File Format Importer&lt;br&gt;

'''DLE''' - 3D File Format Exporter&lt;br&gt;

'''FLT'''

The majority of the words listed here are either wrong or not really translations at all just the indian dialect of english,

:This is not exact. Remember that modern Hindi accepts English words. While the textbook will tell you that bussines is व्यापार, most people, especially young, will just use बिज़निस. I agree that the page contains real errors. First, किधर must never be transliterated as KID-HAR, but as KI-DHAR, because ध=DHA is a single character. It is the very same mistake as if you would write &quot;nowhere&quot; as NOW-HERE. Moreover, किधर can only refer to direction. Sentence: &quot;Where are you going?&quot; can be translated as &quot;तुम कहाँ जा रहे हो?&quot; or &quot;तुम किधर जा रहे हो?&quot; However, &quot;where are you&quot; can only be written &quot;तुम कहाँ हो&quot;, किधर must not be used here. The more honorific variants with आप are correct too. It will need more work to make everything right. --[[User:Icebearsoft|Zdeněk Wagner (ज़्देन्येक वाग्नेर)]] ([[User talk:Icebearsoft|talk]]) 16:48, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

==Pronounciation Key==
You need a pronounciation key for every language page. Without it, the words and phrases will still be meaningless.--[[Special:Contributions/63.3.2.130|63.3.2.130]] ([[User talk:63.3.2.130|discuss]]) 13:51, 5 May 2011 (UTC)

[[Image:water_chestnut_CDC.jpg|right|water chestnut]]
The '''water chestnut''', also known as the '''Chinese water caltrop''', resembles a [[Cookbook:Chestnut|chestnut]] in color and shape. It is a tuber commonly associated with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking, but also appears in other ethnic meals.

Originating from Southeast Asia, water chestnuts are actually roots of an aquatic plant that grows in freshwater ponds, marshes, lakes, and in slow-moving rivers and streams. These roots are commonly grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Taiwan|Taiwan]], China, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thailand]], and sometimes in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. Water chestnut harvesting is laborious, making them somewhat expensive to purchase. Processed and canned water chestnuts are widely found in most supermarkets. Fresh water chestnuts are more difficult to find, but are becoming more available.

If you find fresh water chestnuts, select those that are firm with no signs of wrinkling. These will need to be peeled prior to eating and cooking. Fresh tubers may be stored wrapped tightly in a plastic bag for up to one week.

Canned, unopened water chestnuts will store indefinitely. Once opened, they keep up to one week in a bowl of water. Be sure to change the water daily for the &quot;freshest&quot; product.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">As discussed in the Overview, the AMFPHP scripts allow Flash movies and Flash Communication Server applications to communicate with PHP scripts. These scripts can receive, process, and return data to the requesting movie or application. In the context of SLA research, perhaps the most useful function of such scripts is database interaction involving the inserting, updating, and retrieving of information.

== Setting Up AMFPHP ==
After downloading the AMFPHP scripts from http://www.amfphp.org and unzipping them, the ''gateway.php'' file should be placed in a directory of the web server; be sure that it is a directory in which the execution of scripts is allowed by the web server. On many servers, this is within the ''cgi-bin'' directory or a subdirectory thereof. The AMFPHP ''flashservices'' folder is typically installed within the ''cgi-bin'' directory. Then, a subfolder for access by the individual Flash movie (or FlashComm application) should be created. Into this subfolder should be placed ''gateway.php''; normally, this file should not require any editing. For this tutorial, the subfolder will be named ''mysql_amfphp''.

Finally, a subfolder named ''services'' should be created in the ''mysql_amfphp'' folder. The ''services'' folder will contain the PHP file that accesses the database. For this sample application, a file named ''MySQLQuery.php'' should be created and the following code should be placed within it using a basic text editor (Notepad on Windows, vi or emacs on UNIX/LINUX, for example).

 &lt;?php
 class MySQLQuery{
   function MySQLQuery(){
     $this-&gt;methodTable = array(
       &quot;inRecord&quot; =&gt; array(
         &quot;description&quot; =&gt; &quot;Inserts the passed argument into the database&quot;,
         &quot;access&quot; =&gt; &quot;remote&quot;, // available values are private, public, remote
         &quot;arguments&quot; =&gt; array (&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;)
       ),
       &quot;outRecord&quot; =&gt; array(
         &quot;description&quot; =&gt; &quot;Echos the passed argument back to Flash (no need to set the return type)&quot;, 
         &quot;access&quot; =&gt; &quot;remote&quot;, // available values are private, public, remote
         &quot;arguments&quot; =&gt; array (&quot;arg1&quot;)
       )
     );
   }
   function inRecord($fName, $lName){
     $dbc =  mysql_connect(&quot;DBNAME&quot;, &quot;USERID&quot;, &quot;PASSWORD&quot;);
     mysql_select_db(&quot;amfphp_test&quot;);
     $sql = &quot;INSERT INTO people ( UID , firstName , lastName ) &quot;
            . &quot;VALUES ( '', '$fName', '$lName' )&quot;;
     $result = @mysql_query ($sql); // run the query
     return &quot; *-* &quot; . $lName . &quot;, &quot; . $fName . &quot; *-* (&quot; . $result . &quot;)&quot;;
   }
   function outRecord($message){
     $dbc =  mysql_connect(&quot;DBNAME&quot;, &quot;USERID&quot;, &quot;PASSWORD&quot;);
     mysql_select_db(&quot;amfphp_test&quot;);
     $result = mysql_query('SELECT * FROM people');
     while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
       $nameList .= $row['lastName'] . &quot;, &quot; . $row['firstName'] . &quot;; &quot;;
     }
     return $message . &quot; ^**mysql_amfphp**^ &quot; . &quot;\n&quot; . $nameList . &quot;\n&quot;;
     }
   }
 ?&gt;

== Setting Up the Database ==
In the example code, the values ''DBNAME'', ''USERID'', and ''PASSWORD'' should be changed to reflect the specific database server to be accessed. Furthermore, the database should contain a database named ''amfphp_test'', which contains a table named ''people''. The table ''people'' should, in turn, contain two columns: ''firstName'' and ''lastName''.

== Creating the Flash Movie ==
Using the components window in Flash MX 2004, create a user interface with the elements shown in the image.
[[Image:Flash-amfphp-ui-setup.png|none|350 px|thumb|The User Interface]]
The UI elements above should be given the following names:
*top text area: 'show_txt'
*''list records'' button: ''callButton''
*''clear textfield'' button: ''clearButton''
*''firstName'' text line: ''inFirstName''
*''lastName'' text line: ''inLastName''
*''insert record'' button: ''insertButton''

These names will match the following ActionScript code, which should be placed in the first frame of the main timeline of the Flash movie:

 // Necessary class (needed for AMFPHP)
 #include &quot;NetServices.as&quot;
 // just for debugging purposes
 #include &quot;NetDebug.as&quot; 
 // Create the AMFPHP gateway and connect to the server.
 // The gateway.php file points to the services folder (see below,
 // where the service is actually called with getService(&quot;MySQLQuery&quot;)
 NetServices.setDefaultGatewayUrl(&quot;http://www.MYSERVERNAME.com/cgi-bin/mysql_amfphp/gateway.php&quot;);
 conn = NetServices.createGatewayConnection();
 //Result handler
 request = new Object(); 
 request.onResult = function(result) {
   show_txt.text = result;
 }
 // Call the service; name of service (MySQLQuery) must be the same
 // as the pre-extension name of the file in the &quot;services&quot; folder: &quot;MySQLQuery.php&quot;
 service = conn.getService(&quot;MySQLQuery&quot;);
 // Buttons 
 callButton.onPress = function(){
   service.outRecord(request, show_txt.text);
   show_txt.text = &quot;&quot;;
 }
 clearButton.onPress = function(){
   show_txt.text = &quot;&quot;;
 }
 insertButton.onPress = function () {
   service.inRecord(request, inFirstName.text, inLastName.text);
 };
 stop();

After exporting the movie, a user should be able to insert first- and last-name pairs into the database. The PHP code returns a confirmation message both when inserting and retrieving database information. When inserting information, the first and last names will be returned; when retrieving, whatever text is in the upper window will be sent and added to the beginning of the returned information, followed by a list of the names (in ''last name, first name'' order) in the database.

= Possible Uses =
The sample application above illustrates how a Flash movie might access a database. Such access might be used for login authentication, creating a new user account, or saving textual information for future retrieval and study.

It is worth noting that information in a database needn't be accessed exclusively by the AMFPHP code or Flash movie that created it. If, for example, the transcript of a text chat were saved as a database entry, another Flash movie could be used to retrieve it for review by a researcher. A PHP script, likewise, could retrieve the transcript and perform text manipulation operations on it (e.g., placing the HTML tags for bold text, &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt; &amp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, around words not in the 1000 most frequent words/word families in English).

In the next section, a sample application will be used to demonstrate how text from a chat application might be saved for later retrieval.

[[Image:bitter_melon_CDC.jpg|right|bitter melon]]
'''Bitter melon''' is also known as '''foo qua''', '''balsam pear''', and '''bitter gourd'''. It is actually a member of the [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] family and resembles a [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] with bumpy skin. When first picked, a bitter melon is yellow-green, but as it ripens, it turns to a yellow-orange color. The inside of the melon is filled with fibrous seeds. Bitter melon is used mostly in [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] cooking. Bitter melon plants are considered an invasive weed in Florida.

Bitter melon has some interesting effects on humans. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment for diabetes and to cause abortions. It impedes many things: viruses, bacteria, tumors... and the immune system. It lowers blood cholesterol. It is a laxative.

Bitter melon has lots of potassium and vitamin C. The ripe orange fruit has lots of beta-carotene, and the intensely red ripe seeds have lots of lycopene.

==Selection==
Select firm, unblemished melons that are from 5 to 12 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] in length. Choose melons that are still green for a more bitter flavor and a yellow-orange melon for a milder taste. 
==Storage==
Store melon loose in a paper or plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. Slice the melon immediately before use.

==Preparation==
Cut in half and discard the seeds and fibrous core. It is indeed 'bitter', even if grilled; not a pleasant taste. To reduce the bitterness, blanch in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. The skin is edible and the melon is not typically peeled. The seeds are also edible, unless very hard, and are included in some recipes. Bitter melon is commonly stuffed, curried or [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]]. It can also be used in [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] and [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] and may be [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]]. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] are often added to recipes with bitter melon to offset the bitter taste.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Bitter Melon|1|1|1|3|3|3|3|3|3|1|1|1}}

Bitter melons are available fresh from April to September in most Asian markets and can occasionally be found in larger supermarkets. They are primarily grown in tropical climates, including East Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and South America. Some markets are beginning to carry bitter melons year round. They may also be purchased canned or dried. [http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/5ADay/month/exotic_vegetables.htm][http://www.bittermelon.org/]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Setting Up AMFPHP ==
As in the example of basic database interaction, the AMFPHP scripts from http://www.amfphp.org should be unzipped, and the ''gateway.php'' file should be placed in a directory of the web server. Also, the AMFPHP ''flashservices'' folder should be installed within the ''cgi-bin'' directory. Then, a subfolder which will be accessed by the Flash movie (for login purposes) and the FlashComm application (for saving chat text) should be created. Into this subfolder should be placed ''gateway.php''; normally, this file should not require any editing. For this tutorial, the subfolder will be named ''AMFPHPChat''.

In the ''AMFPHPChat'' folder, a subfolder named ''services'' should be created. The ''services'' folder will contain the PHP file that accesses the database on behalf of both the Flash movie and the FlashComm application. For this sample application, a file named ''DBServices.php'' should be created and the following code should be placed within it using a basic text editor (Notepad on Windows, vi or emacs on UNIX/LINUX, for example).

[[Image:calabaza_CDC.jpg|right|calabaza]]
'''Calabaza''' or '''calabaza squash''', also known as the '''West Indian pumpkin''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]-like [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] that is round in shape and varies in size. It can be as large as a [[Cookbook:Watermelon|watermelon]] or as small as a [[Cookbook:Cantaloupe|cantaloupe]]. The color of calabaza can also vary and may include greens, tans, reds and oranges. Some squash are all one color while other calabaza are multi-colored and may include all of colors listed above. This squash is popular in the Caribbean as well as Central and South America.

==Selection==
Calabaza is often sold already chopped into chunks in many Latin markets. This is because of the difficulty many have in chopping the whole squash. Select pieces with a fresh, moist and unblemished flesh. Soft or wet spots means the squash is beginning to spoil. The color of the flesh should be a bright orange. Whole squash are more difficult to find, but if you find one, select one that still has the stem attached and is heavy for its size. You should avoid purchasing a squash with bruises, cuts, or soft spots. Calabaza is available year round.

==Storage==
Whole calabaza may be stored in a cool, dry space for up to 6 weeks. Cut calabaza should be wrapped tightly or placed in a covered container in the refrigerated for no more than one week.

==Preparation==
Whole calabaza may be difficult to slice. Slicing through the tough rind often calls for a heavy cleaver or a very sharp knife. If the squash resists slicing, remove the stem and place the knife or cleaver blade along the squash’s length. Gently tap the blade with a hammer until the squash falls open. Scoop out the seeds, peel and prepare!

Calabaza has a sweet flavor and its texture is firm. This is similar to the taste and texture of more familiar varieties of squash, such as [[Cookbook:Butternut Squash|butternut]] or [[Cookbook:Acorn Squash|acorn]]. Calabaza may be substituted in recipes calling for those more common types of squash.

Calabaza is most commonly [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], either cut in sections or in cubes. Its seeds may also be roasted in a similar way as pumpkin seeds. Simply place on a [[Cookbook:Baking Sheet|baking sheet]] coated in [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] until brown and crisp, optionally with a bit of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] on top.</text>

[[Image:chayote_CDC.jpg|right|chayote]]
'''Chayote''', also called '''mirliton''' or '''choko''', is a gourd-like [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] that is about the size and shape of a very large [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]. The skin is pale green and smooth with slight ridges that run lengthwise. Many compare the color to a light green [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. The flesh is white and there is one soft seed in the middle. Chayote is grown in the US in several states including California, Florida, and Louisiana, and throughout South and East Asia, where they are harvested much larger than in the Americas, but it is native to Latin America. Historically, this squash was one of the primary foods of the Aztecs and Mayas.

==Selection==
Select squash that are small, firm and unblemished; just as you would select a pear. Choose squash that is heavy for its size. Tender skin, skin that reacts to pressure, often means poor quality. Chayote is commonly found in supermarkets during peak season (December to March), but may be found in larger supermarkets and specialty markets throughout the year. It is common to score the flesh of the squash with one's fingernails to test for ripeness, so be wary of such marks when selecting a squash. 

==Storage==
Refrigerate whole chayote in a plastic bag for up to one month. Cut chayote may be refrigerated in a covered container or tightly wrapped for 3 to 5 days. It is best to use chopped chayote immediately, as it can gather flavors from other foods stored in the refrigerator.

==Preparation==
Chayote has a bland-tasting flesh that may be used in several ways. It may be prepared in similar ways to other summer squash, such as [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]], but may require peeling and a bit more seasoning. Chayote is most commonly used in side dishes, [[Cookbook:Stew|stews]], and [[:Category:Casserole recipes|casseroles]]. It may also be sliced in half and [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] or [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] whole and eaten plain. It is also used in mild curries in [[Cookbook:Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian cuisine]]. The soft seed is edible, but many choose to remove it.

[[Image:Have-23.jpg|thumb|right|star fruit]]
The '''star fruit''', sometimes called the '''carambola''' or '''star apple''', is a tropical fruit that is gaining popularity. This fruit acquired its name from the five pointed star shape when cut across the middle of the fruit. It has a waxy, golden yellow to green color skin with a complicated flavor combination that includes [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]], [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapples]], and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]. It is usually quite sour.

Two types of star fruit are grown, tart and sweet. Tart varieties typically have narrowly spaced ribs, while sweet varieties tend to have thick, fleshy ribs. The tastes between the two are hardly distinguishable. The fruit is readily available July through February.

==Selection==
Select firm, shiny skinned, even colored fruit. Star fruits will ripen at room temperature and have lightly brown edges on the ribs when it’s ripe. Avoid purchasing star fruit with brown, shriveled ribs. This delicious fruit is also available dried.
 
==Storage==
Non-ripe star fruit should be turned often, until they are yellow in color and ripe with light brown ribs. Store ripe star fruits at room temperature for two to three days or unwashed, and refrigerated, in a plastic bag for up to one week.

==Preparation==
Star fruits are great to eat out of hand as these tropical delights do not need to be peeled or seeded before eating. Simply wash the fruit, remove any blemished areas, cut crosswise to get the star shape, and eat!</text>

=== Chat Subject Keyframe ===
'''NOTE''': The ''chat_subject'' keyframe can use the same code as the ''chat_researcher'' keyframe because the text-writing and session-ending code cannot be accessed without the UI buttons in the ''chat_researcher'' keyframe.

=== Synchronization and Status Handler Code ===
'''NOTE''': The following code should be placed in a file named ''synchAndStatusHandler.as''. This code is useful for debugging in the Flash MX 2004 authoring environment. It reports all synchronization messages (e.g., successes and errors) and status messages. Code could be added to respond to specific events such as errors in connecting or unexpected disconnections.

[[Image:Asian_pear_CDC.jpg|right|Asian pear]]
'''Asian pears''' are related to the pears that are typically seen in grocery stores, but this fruit is similar to an apple and its many names reflect that characteristic. Other names that this fruit goes by are: '''Chinese pear''', '''Japanese pear''', '''Sand''', '''Nashi''', and '''apple pear'''.

Asian pears are usually round, firm to touch when ripe, and ready to eat after harvest. Asian pears reach prime quality when they ripen on the tree, like apples and peaches do. Asian pears will be crisp, juicy, and slightly sweet with some tartness, especially near the core.

There are several Asian pear varieties available. Japanese pears are more round in shape, while the Chinese pears are more oval or pyriform (pear-shaped).

In the United States, the Japanese type of Asian pear called 20th Century or Nijisseki is the most popular. It is easily identified with its round shape and smooth yellow skin. Other common varieties include the Japanese bronze-toned Hosui pear and the pear-shaped Ya Li, a pale-green Chinese variety.

==Selection==
Select the most fragrant and unbruised fruit with little to no brown spots. Ripe Asian pears are hard and do not soften. They are ready to eat when purchased.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Asian Pears|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|1|1|1}}
The harvest season on the northern hemisphere usually begins in mid july, in southern regions and lasts until mid september, when the Asian pears are harvested in more northern regions. [http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-1131/]

==Storage==
Asian pears are known for keeping well. Store pears a week at room temperature or up to three months in the refrigerator.

There are other style changes that I would make, but I do not think that it is my place to make such decisions for the author-- who in all likelihood will be responsible for finishing what has been written--and I am not currently in a position to usurp the responsibility.

Oh yes you are in that position.  &quot;Be bold&quot; or whatnot.

The &quot;Numbers and Algorithms&quot; section should be junked.  It is redundant, considering that the previous section introduces numbers.  The introductory material should be left to that section too.</text>

The '''nectarine''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]]. Nectarine flesh tastes and feels somewhat like [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]] flesh, and almost identical to peach flesh. Freestone nectarines have flesh that separates easily from the pit. Cling nectarines have flesh that clings to the pit.

Choose nectarines with a strong and pleasant smell. Nectarines will soften if left around, but will not gain a nice ripe taste and smell. Do not refrigerate nectarines.

Use peach recipes with nectarines.</text>

[[Image:prickly_pear_CDC.jpg|right|prickly pear]]
The '''prickly pear''' is a cactus fruit. It is 2 to 4 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long and shaped like an [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]. Its skin is coarse and thick, not unlike an avocado's and it ranges in color from yellow or orange to magenta or red. Tubercles with small prickly spines can be found on the prickly pear’s skin. This fruit’s flesh, which ranges in color also from yellow to dark red, is sweet and juicy with crunchy seeds throughout. It grows covered with needles like the rest of the cactus. When purchased at the grocery store, these should already have been removed. It's still wise to handle the fruit carefully because some of the smaller nearly-invisible needles can remain on the fruit. The needles can get stuck in bare hands where they create a tiny, aggravating points of pain.

The fruit is firm, with an inedible rind, a watery interior and large, hard black seeds. It has a mild flavor similar to [[Cookbook:Watermelon|watermelon]]. It can be eaten raw, or made into [[Cookbook:Jelly|jellies]] and syrups. Prickly pear syrup is available throughout the southwestern United States, and is often used in margaritas. The prickly pear can be diced like [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] and used as a topping on [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] or [[Cookbook:Cereal|cereal]] or blended into a smoothie.

[[Image:edible_cactus_CDC.jpg|right|edible cactus]]
'''Edible cactus''' is also known as '''nopales''' (no-PAH-les), '''nopalitos''', '''cactus paddles''', or '''cactus pads'''. This vegetable is popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and other Central American countries, parts of [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]], the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], North Africa and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. Its popularity is increasing in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], where it can be found at Mexican grocery stores, specialty produce markets and farmer’s markets.

Edible cactus is characterized by its fleshy oval leaves (typically called pads or paddles) of the nopal ([[Cookbook:Prickly Pear|prickly pear]]) cactus.

With a soft but crunchy texture that also becomes a bit sticky (not unlike [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]]) when cooked, edible cactus tastes similar to a slightly tart [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green bean]], [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|green pepper]].

Cactus pads contain beta carotene, iron, some B vitamins, and are good sources of both vitamin C and calcium. 

==Availability, Selection, and Storage==
Edible cactus is available year-round with a peak in the mid-spring and the best season from early spring through late fall. When buying edible cactus, choose small, firm, pale green cacti with no wrinkling. Be sure to pick cacti that are not limp or dry. Very small paddles may require more cleaning because their larger proportion of prickers and eyes.
Edible cactus can be refrigerated for more than a week if wrapped tightly in plastic.

Edible cactus is also sold as:

* Canned — [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] or packed in water
* Acitrones — candied nopales, packed in [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] syrup and available in cans or jars.

==Preparation==
The edible cactus you buy should be de-spined though you will need to trim the “eyes” to remove any remaining prickers, and outside edges of the pads with a vegetable [[Cookbook:Peeler|peeler]]. Trim off any dry or fibrous areas and rinse thoroughly to remove any stray prickers and sticky fluid.

Edible cactus can be eaten raw or cooked. To cook, [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] over [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] water for just a few minutes (if cooked too long they will lose their crunchy texture). Then slice and eat! Cactus can also be cut and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for a few minutes.

Steamed cactus can be added to [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scrambled eggs]] and [[Cookbook:Omelet|omelets]], or diced fresh and added to [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]]. They can also be substituted for any cooked green in most dishes.

The pads can be served as a side dish or cooled and used in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]]. They taste especially good with Mexican recipes that include [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|hot peppers]] and fresh [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;
{{user language|en|0|category=}}
{{user language|en|1|category=}}
{{user language|en|2|category=}}
{{user language|en|3|category=}}
{{user language|en|4|category=}}
{{user language|en|N|category=}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
This page explains the {{tlx|user language}} template, which is a framework for displaying the language abilities of users on their user page. This helps with communication by listing which languages, and how much of each, users can understand. 

To find someone who speaks a particular language, see [[:Category:Users by language|users by language]], and follow the links. For the most part, the two and three letter codes are taken from [[w:ISO 639|ISO 639]], but see the list below for a comprehensive guide.
{{clear}}

==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{user language|fr|N}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Copy and paste the example code above, and replace &quot;fr&quot; with the desired language's code (see the list below) and &quot;N&quot; with one of the following characters representing your fluency level:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Level
! Description
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 0
| The user cannot communicate at all in that language.
|-
! 1
| Elementary; the user is able to write very simple questions and statements, and might be able to understand more complex sentences with difficulty. Their vocabulary is limited (excluding understanding based on similarity with other languages).
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 2
| Intermediate; the user can participate in simple discussions using simple sentence constructions, but needs help with more advanced vocabulary or structures. 
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 3
| Advanced; the user can effectively participate in discussions with native speakers, and can participate in technical discussions with relative confidence. They have a good grasp of grammar and their errors virtually never interfere with understanding.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 4
| Near native; the user can read and write fluently and accurately at all levels of normal discussion, including technical discussions. The user can reasonably pass off as a native speaker in written discussion, and makes few errors.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! N
| Native speaker; the user has spoken the language from birth, and has a large vocabulary and an intuitive understanding of grammar. The user can participate in all levels of discussions with ease, and can understand most errors in others' writing.
|}

==Customizing the format==
It is possible to customize the behavior and appearance of the template with the following override parameters (for example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{user language|fr|N|align=left}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! align
| Set the alignment on the page. Possible values are left, center, and right (default). This also sets appropriate clearing, so that the boxes will stack automatically in that position (you can override this with the &quot;css-box&quot; override below).
|-
! css-box
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the box.
|-
! css-left
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the left cell.
|-
! css-right
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the right (main) cell.
|-
! category
| Setting this parameter to empty (&lt;code&gt;category=&lt;/code&gt;) displays the language box without categorizing the page. For the opposite effect, categorizing the page without displaying the box, see the {{tlx|User language/category}} template.
|}

==Using with userboxes==
You can use top and bottom templates to group the user language template(s) and other [[Wikibooks:Userboxes|userboxes]] together. Format: {{tlx|Userboxtop}}&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{user language|xx|#}}{{user blah}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;{{tlx|Userboxbottom}}

==Languages supported==
The languages supported by the template are listed alphabetically by their [[w:ISO 639|ISO 639]] code.

== Cantonese Romanization ==
Seeing how I am the first big contributor to this wikibook, I felt I had to make a decision about the romanization system (otherwise no one could begin editing the lessons!).  So I chose [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]] because it's promted by the [[w:Linguistic Society of Hong Kong|Linguistic Society of Hong Kong]] and aspires to be a standard. Well, I am into writing the first lesson and I am beginning to have regrets:  

# Out of all the Cantonese references I have, not one uses Jyutping.  I have two books bought in Hong Kong just a couple months ago from Greenwood Press (pub. 2004) that use a modified [[w:Yale romanization|Yale]] (same as the system used by Matthews and Yip in their 1994 Intermediate Cantonese book).  Another character glossary (first pub. 1987 with another pub. date in 2004) uses the Sidney Lau system.  The Lonely Planet phrasebook uses the author's own creation.  Yet another coursebook uses a mainland Chinese system based on [[w:Hanyu Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]].  I believe the Foreign Service Institute textbook (published in the 70's) that I had before used the Yale system.
# Even with good familiarity of the material, I still find this romanization scheme confusing.  It's not intuitive for many English speakers.  For instance the &quot;J&quot; of &quot;Jyutping&quot; is '''not''' a &quot;j&quot; sound at all.  It's exactly like the &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yard&quot;!  And so the &quot;yu&quot; sound then?  That's the high front rounded vowel in French &quot;tu&quot;.  From a linguists' prespective, Jyutping makes quite a bit of sense but not from the beginners' prespective!  (But I am a linguist and it still drives me nuts!)
# It has not been adopted as a standard as it was oringinally intended. As the books I have described above show, there has been no big shift (or any at all?) to Jyutping.  From my understanding, Hong Kong universities are currently using the Yale or a modified Yale system for teaching Cantonese to foreigners.  I don't believe that the Hong Kong government has ever declared any official romanization scheme (the one it uses for place names is quite ad-hoc and does not mark tones at all).
# The tone marks are not the best method for beginners.  Although Jyutping is easy to type because it doesn't require diacritics, I think the mixing of numbers and letters is really awkward for learners in my opinion.  English speakers do not mix numbers inside words and so we have a habit of ignoring numbers as &quot;garbage&quot;.  But the numbers are critical because they represent the tones.  The Yale system using tone marks similar to Hanyu Pinyin which I think is much more useful for beginners.  We give a lot more attention to diacritics then numbers mixed into the word.

As someone who loves standards, I am really saddened by this dilemma.  I thought that supporting  Jyutping would be the &quot;right&quot; thing to do but it seems that it never caught on.  Although Yale is slightly more troublesome to type, I think the tradeoff is worth it considering the learner's benefit '''and''' how popular it is in other Cantonese learning materials.  Hence I'm deciding to go to the modified Yale system used in the two recent Greenwood Publisher books I have.  This system is presented in [[Cantonese: Fundamentals of the language]].

Seeing how there is not many other people here yet, I guess I am just talking to myself.  However, I do believe the question &quot;Why did you pick X romanization scheme over Y or Z?&quot; is going to come up eventually.  And it's plausible with all the different romanization camps out there, this will be a big controversy...so I am posting my reasons now rather than later.

--[[User:Xingmu|Alissa]] 14:35, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

There is a dictionary called ''Dictionary of Cantonese with Mandarin Phonetic Symbol''(广州音字典 普通话对照)， published in 1983 by Canton People Publishing House. I will show some examples how the dictionary describes a word:

堞 die(e为第二声，我吾识打） [dib6碟] 城上如齿状的矮墙。 （dib6中的6表示广东音中六中基本声调中的去声，跟“事”或“食”相同）

燃 ran(a为第二声） [yin4言] ... （4为阳平声调，跟“时”相同）

I am not intended to say that this system is suitable to describe Cantonese. I am just telling the existence of this dictionary. It seems that it is useful for people who already known Mandarin to learn Cantonese.

--[[User:Hgneng|Cameron Wong]] 16:40, 15 Aug 2005 (time zone of Beijing)

I have read books that teach Japanese to speak Cantonese, however, I forgot their names. There are a lot textbooks that teach Japanese to speak and to understand cantonese, since there are a lot of Japanese working in Hong Kong. You may found a lot of books in &quot;Sogo&quot; Department store in Hong Kong. 

Forget the [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]]. The key for a good textbook is &quot;easy to learn&quot;, so don't stick to only one pronunciation system. If you have listen to [[w:Pimsleur language learning system|Pimsleur]]'s teaching materials, you'll find out that writing the pronunciation only help the reader to remember how they speak the language. The best way to teach pronunciation is to listen. 

However, if you have to record the pronunciation into written text, use the one that reader  understand.

For instance, in [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]], &quot;陳&quot; is represented by &quot;can&quot;. It is quite reasonable that English speakers preceive &quot;can&quot; as the first syllable of &quot;Canada&quot; instead of the exact pronunciation of &quot;陳&quot;. On the other hand, the pronunciation of &quot;陳&quot; is close the second syllable of English word, &quot;merchant&quot; without the &quot;t&quot; sound. 

In addition, [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]] is too hard for beginners. Personally, I don't think a standardized &quot;Romanization&quot; can help beginners to learn to speak cantonese quickly. Instead, &quot;Romanization&quot; always frightten beginners in their first language class. 

Using &quot;association&quot; is more effective in &quot;learning to speak&quot; as well as &quot;learning to listen&quot;. It is an alternative to represent the pronunciation of a word is to associate it to something readers have learnt before. 

For instance, you may represent the pronunciation of &quot;塵&quot; same as that of &quot;陳&quot;. 

If readers are asked to listen to the word &quot;陳&quot;, they will associate two different words, &quot;塵&quot; and &quot;陳&quot;.

== Contributors Guide ==

I stumbled upon this book a few weeks ago, and am interested in contributing to it.  When I first found it, I noticed that the yet-to-be-created lessons were modeled after the Mandarin WikiBook, but I have noticed that xingmu has added some new content in Lesson 2 as well as updating the &quot;How To Use This Textbook&quot; section.  It seems like the information that xingmu has added is pretty well organized as if it is part of a project that is well under development.  My question is, would you like others to contribute as stated on your user page, or do you have a pretty good plan for where this book is going?  I am by no means a linguist, but I have studied Cantonese for a few years and am interested in helping develop a good resource for learners.  Let me know if there is anything specific you would like me to add, or if there are things you are already working on (so I know what not to add).  If you would like others to help contribute, it would be good to create a contributor's guide.  Thank you!  I hope I can help out with this project.
--[[User:Rtaggart|Rtaggart]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:I added on a Contributor's Guide to the main page, adapting it from the Mandarin version, excising the sections that don't apply to the Cantonese Wikibook. It mostly covers multimedia contributions (stroke order images, sound clips), so if you have anything else to add about regular contributions, feel free.

:Rtaggart, as for reservations about contributing, leave those behind. With the activity levels of most Wikibooks, an excess of content does not ever seem to be a problem. If you're concerned that effort may be lost through duplication or by a later change in book direction, then put your first efforts into fleshing out the plan. I'd say not to worry though. Grammar explanations and the like can easily be moved and reshuffled if the book structure needs to change. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 04:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&lt;i&gt;&quot;Mathematics is the mortar of the bricks of Physics.  Engineering is the house they build&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Unknown

Physics, especially Calculus based Physics, is integral to the solving of engineering problems.  Without understanding the relationships between Current and Voltage, Electrical engineers are unable to solve problems to do with Power.  Civil engineers use density and volume to find the weight of an object.  Mechanical engineers rely heavily on dynamics in everything they do, which in turn is deeply rooted in differential equations and parametrization.

There are many more examples of the use of Physics in the world of engineering, and we can then think of engineering as a mix between applied physics and applied mathematics.

The text will try to provide an application to real world problems within the context of engineering, from a calculus based approach.  The Mathematics of engineering will be referred to in parts, and it is expected that those engineering students who are readers of the book have at least a basic grasp of both calculus and simple algebra.

[[Image:Passion_fruit_700.jpg|right|thumb|passion fruit]]
'''Passion fruit''' is a goop-filled tropical fruit. You're actually supposed to eat the seedy goop and throw away the outer part, not the other way around. The other strange thing is that wrinkled dehydrated-looking ones are considered best.

The seeds are edible so you can eat the orange goop straight from the shell. Passion fruit is more commonly sieved and its highly aromatic pulp and juice are used as a flavoring for beverages and [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauces]]. The pulp has an intense aromatic flavor, while the texture is [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]-like and watery. The flavor is likened to [[Cookbook:Guava|guava]].
Native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Brazil|Brazil]], passion fruits are grown in Hawaii, Florida, and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]. These crops, along with imports from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]], keep passion fruit on the market all year.

==Selection==
Choose large, heavy, firm fruit. When ripe, it has wrinkled, dimpled, and often deep purple skin. Some fruit, particularly that of Hawaii, is yellow when ripe. Skin is old-looking, but does not mean the fruit is rotten. Mold does not affect quality and can be wiped off. Fruit color is green when they are immature, changing to shades of purple, red or yellow as they ripen. Leave at room temperature to ripen. The skin will wrinkle, but the fruit will not soften much. Once ripe, store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.

==Preparation==
Passion Fruit is generally eaten fresh but may be cooked for use in sauces and fillings. Begin by cutting the fruit in half and scooping out the fleshy pulp with a spoon. Spoon the pulp over [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]] or other soft fruits. The pulp makes a delicious [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] and the seeds add a unique crunchy texture. To remove seeds: Strain in a non-aluminum sieve, or use cheesecloth, squeezing to extract the juice.</text>

== What is USB? ==
USB stands for &quot;Universal Serial Bus&quot;. It is an industry standard developed in the mid-1990s that defines the cables, connectors and communications protocols used in a bus for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and electronic devices. USB was intented to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has also become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports.

USB flash drives are memory devices that are inserted and powered by USB ports. They store information and data that needs to be easily accessed. These devices are portable and convenient for people on the go. USB ports are a common necessity for students as well as business employees or personnel. In addition to convenience, they range in storage capacities from 1GB to 64 GB, so end users are able to store as much information as small computers. 
[[File:USB Flash Drive and Card Reader.jpg|thumb|USB Flash Drive and Card Reader]]

USB connects several devices to a host controller through a chain of hubs. In USB terminology, devices are referred to as ''functions'', because each individual physical device may actually host several functions, such as a webcam with a built-in microphone. The hubs are special-purpose devices that are not officially considered functions. There always exists one hub known as the root hub, which is attached directly to the host controller.

These devices/functions (and hubs) have associated ''pipes'' (logical channels). The pipes are synonymous to byte streams such as in the pipelines of Unix. Pipes are connections from the host controller to a logical entity on the device named an ''endpoint''. The term ''endpoint'' is also occasionally used to refer to the entire pipe.

These endpoints (and their respective pipes) are numbered 0-15 in each direction, so a device/function can have up to 32 active pipes, 16 into the host controller and 16 out of the controller.

Each endpoint can transfer data in one direction only, either into or out of the device/function, so each pipe is uni-directional. Endpoint 0 is however reserved for the bus management in both directions and thus takes up two of the 32 endpoints — all USB devices are required to implement endpoint 0, so there is always an inward and an outward pipe numbered 0 on any given device.

In these pipes, data is transferred in packets of varying length. Each pipe has a maximum packet length, typically &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; bytes, so a USB packet will often contain something on the order of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 up to 512 bytes.

The pipes are also divided into four different categories by way of their ''transfer type'':

*''control transfers'' - typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and a status response, used e.g. by the bus control pipe number 0
*''isochronous transfers'' - at some guaranteed speed (often but not necessarily as fast as possible) but with possible data loss, e.g. realtime audio or video
*''interrupt transfers'' - devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency), e.g. pointing devices and keyboards
*''bulk transfers'' - large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth (but with no guarantees on throughput or latency), e.g. file transfers

When a device (function) or hub is attached to the host controller through any hub on the bus, it is given a unique 7 bit address on the bus by the host controller.

The host controller then polls the bus for traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion, so no device can transfer any data on the bus without explicit request from the host controller. The ''interrupt transfers'' on corresponding endpoints do not actually interrupt any traffic on the bus:  they are just scheduled to be queried more often and in between any other large transfers, thus &quot;interrupt traffic&quot; on a USB bus is really only high-priority traffic.

To access an endpoint, a hierarchical configuration must be obtained. The device connected to the bus has one (and only one) ''device descriptor'' which in turn has one or more ''configuration descriptors''. These configurations often correspond to states, e.g. active vs. low power mode. Each configuration descriptor in turn has one or more ''interface descriptors'', which describe certain aspects of the device, so that it may be used for different purposes: for example, a camera may have both audio and video interfaces. These interface descriptors in turn have one ''default interface setting'' and possibly more ''alternate interface settings'' which in turn have ''endpoint descriptors'', as outlined above. An endpoint may however be reused among several interfaces and alternate interface settings.

=== Host controllers ===
[[File:Type A USB connector.jpg|thumb|right|A USB Series “A” plug]]

The hardware that contains the host controller and the root hub has an interface geared toward the programmer which is called ''Host Controller Device'' (HCD) and is defined by the hardware implementer. In practice, these are hardware registers (ports) in the computer.

At version 1.0 and 1.1 there were two competing HCD implementations. Compaq's Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) was adopted as the standard by the USB-IF. However, Intel subsequently created a specification they called the ''Universal Host Controller Interface'' (UHCI) and insisted other implementers pay to license and implement UHCI. VIA Technologies licensed the UHCI standard from Intel; all other chipset implementers use OHCI. The main difference between OHCI and UHCI is the fact that UHCI is more software-driven than OHCI is, making UHCI slightly more processor-intensive but cheaper to implement. The dueling implementations forced operating system vendors and hardware vendors to develop and test on both implementations which increased cost. During the design phase of USB 2.0 the USB-IF insisted on only one implementation. The USB 2.0 HCD implementation is called the ''Extended Host Controller Interface'' (EHCI). Only EHCI can support hi-speed transfers. Each EHCI controller contains four virtual HCD implementations to support Full Speed and Low Speed devices. The virtual HCD on Intel and VIA EHCI controllers are UHCI. All other vendors use virtual OHCI controllers.

=== Class Codes ===
The device descriptor of a USB device has a signature that tells what kind of device has been attached to the bus. This signature consists of class code, subclass code and protocol fields. Together, these identify what operating system driver should be used to communicate with the device. Additionally, each USB device interface descriptor contains the same signature fields. The interface signature allows multiple operating system drivers to simultaneously communicate with a single USB device (for example USB device with audio and video interfaces) and they also allow multiple instances of the same driver to communicate with separate interfaces of the same USB device (for example USB ethernet adapter with multiple ethernet ports)

Devices that attach to the bus can be full-custom devices requiring a full-custom device driver to be used, or may belong to a ''device class''. These classes define an expected behavior in terms of device and interface descriptors so that the same device driver may be used for any device that claims to be a member of a certain class. An operating system is supposed to implement all device classes so as to provide generic drivers for any USB device.

Device class codes are decided upon by the Device Working Group of the USB Implementers Forum. If the class applies to the entire device, the class code is assigned to the ''bDeviceClass'' field of the device descriptor, and if it is to be set for a single interface on a device, it is assigned to the ''bInterfaceClass'' field of the interface descriptor. It is also possible that multiple interfaces of the device are grouped by using an Interface Association Descriptor, in which case the class code is assigned to ''bFunctionClass'' fields of the descriptor. Class code is a single byte, so a maximum of 254 different device classes are possible (values 0x00 and 0xFF are reserved). If ''bDeviceClass'' is set to 0x00, the operating system will look at ''bFunctionClass'' for Interface Association Descriptors and ''bInterfaceClass'' for each interface to determine the device class. Each class also optionally supports a ''SubClass'' and ''Protocol'' subdefinition. These can be used as the main device classes are continuously revised.

The most used class codes (grouped by assigned class ID) are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usb.org/developers/defined_class USB Class Codes]&lt;/ref&gt;

; 0x00 - Unspecified Class (Device Descriptor) : The USB device has no assigned class code. The class codes of the device interface descriptors should be used to identify which drivers are supported by the device.
; 0x01 - Audio Class (Interface Descriptor) : The interface follows USB audio device class specification. This class code is used by sound card-like devices.
; 0x02 - CDC / Communication Device Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : USB communications device class (&quot;CDC&quot;), used for modems, network cards, ISDN connections, Fax.
; 0x03 - HID Class / Human Interface Device Class (Interface Descriptor) :USB human interface device class (&quot;HID&quot;), keyboards, mice, etc.
; 0x05 - Physical Device Class (Interface Descriptor) : ?
; 0x06 - Still Imaging Class (Interface Descriptor) : Still image capture device class, identical to the Picture Transfer Protocol as used across USB
; 0x07 - Printer Class (Interface Descriptor) : USB printer device class, printer-like devices.
; 0x08 - Mass Storage Class (Interface Descriptor) : USB mass storage device class used for flash drives, portable hard drives, memory card readers, digital cameras, digital audio players etc. This device class presents the device as a block device (almost always used to store a file system).
; 0x09 - Hub (Device Descriptor) : USB hubs.
; 0x0A - CDC Data / Communication Device Class Data (Interface Descriptor) : CDC-Data (Communications Class Device).
; 0x0B - Smart Card Class (Interface Descriptor) : Smart card readers.
; 0x0D - Content Security Class (Interface Descriptor) : Content Security.
; 0x0E - Video Class (Interface Descriptor) : USB video device class, webcam-like devices, motion image capture devices.
; 0xDC - Diagnostics Device Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : Class for diagnostics devices. This class has a single subclass for USB 2.0 compliance testing devices.
; 0xE0 - Wireless Controller Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : Wireless controllers, for example Bluetooth dongles. This class code is usually used only in interface descriptors, only bluetooth subclass allows use in device descriptors.
; 0xEF - Miscellaneous Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : ?
; 0xFE - Application Specific Class (Interface Descriptor) : ?
; 0xFF - Vendor Specific Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : Custom device class - used to establish that a device or interface does not support any standard device class and requires custom drivers.

USB signals are transmitted on a twisted pair of data cables, labelled D+ and D&amp;minus;. These collectively use half-duplex differential signaling to combat the effects of electromagnetic noise on longer lines. D+ and D&amp;minus; usually operate together; they are not separate simplex connections. Transmitted signal levels are 0.0&amp;ndash;0.3 volts for low and 2.8&amp;ndash;3.6 volts for high.

=====Transfer modes=====
USB supports four transfer modes:
*Control
*Interrupt
*Bulk
*Isochronous

=====Transfer speed=====

USB supports three data rates:

* A '''Low Speed''' rate of up to 1.5 Mbit/s (187.5 kB/s) that is mostly used for Human Interface Devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks.
* A '''Full Speed''' rate of up to 12 Mbit/s (1.5 [MB/s). Full Speed was the fastest rate before the USB 2.0 specification and many devices fall back to Full Speed. Full Speed devices divide the USB bandwidth between them in a first-come first-served basis and it is not uncommon to run out of bandwidth with several isochronous devices. All USB Hubs support Full Speed.
* A '''Hi-Speed''' rate of up to 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s).

Hubs, even Hi-Speed hubs, serving a number of non-hi-speed devices, are likely to divide up a total bandwidth of 12 Mbit/s for such devices, which will slow them down unless the hub has transaction translator for each port. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/09/09/usb_technology/index.html Multi-TT Hub Goes Head-to-Head With Single-TT] at Tom's Hardware Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hi-Speed devices are commonly referred to as &quot;USB 2.0&quot; and advertised as &quot;up to 480 Mbit/s&quot;, not all USB 2.0 devices are Hi-Speed. Hi-speed devices typically only operate at half of the full theoretical (60 MB/s) data throughput rate. The maximum rate currently (2006) attained with real devices is about half, 30 MB/s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barefeats.com/usb2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most hi-speed USB devices typically operate at much slower speeds, often about 3 MB/s overall, sometimes up to 10-20 MB/s. The USB-IF certifies devices and provides licenses to use special marketing logos for either &quot;Basic-Speed&quot; (low and full) or Hi-Speed after passing a compliancy test and paying a licensing fee.  All devices are tested according to the latest spec, so recently-compliant Low Speed devices are also 2.0.

Hi-Speed devices are intended to fall back to the slower data rate of Full Speed when plugged into a Full Speed hub. Hi-Speed hubs have a special function called the '''Transaction Translator''' that segregates Full Speed and Low Speed bus traffic from Hi-Speed traffic. The Transaction Translator in a Hi-Speed hub (or possibly each port depending on the electrical design) will function as a completely separate Full Speed bus to Full Speed and Low Speed devices attached to it. This segregation is for bandwidth only; bus rules about power and hub depth still apply.

A hub will have one or more Transaction Translators and there is no standard way to determine the number of transaction translators a hub may have.  All low and full speed devices connected to one transaction translator will share the low/full speed bandwidth.  This means that hubs can have dramatically different performance depending upon the number of transaction translators and the devices plugged into their ports.  e.g. a hi-speed 7 port hub with only 1 transaction translator with 7 low/full speed devices plugged in, will act no differently than a USB 1.1 hub and all devices compete for the same low/full speed bandwidth.  If the hub were to have a transaction translator for each of the seven ports, then each device would have all the full/low speed bandwidth available to it and would only compete for the hi-speed bandwidth, which is much greater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/09/09/usb_technology/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Data encoding ====

The USB standard uses the NRZI system to encode data, and uses bit stuffing for logic 1 transmission '''six''' bits long (put logic 0 after '''six''' bits of logic 1; the receiver ignores a 0 following '''six''' logic 1). Moreover, receiving a block of seven consecutive bits of logic 1 will be signaled as a bit stuffing error at the receiver.
The NRZI (non-return to zero, inverted) encoding method does not change the signal for transmission of a logic '''1''', but it inverts the signal level for transmission of each logic '''0'''.

Most of the pins of a Mini-USB connector are the same as those in a standard USB connector, except pin 4. Pin 4 is called &quot;ID&quot; and, in the Mini-A plug, is connected to ground, but in the Mini-B plug it is not connected. This causes a device supporting USB On-The-Go (with a Mini-AB socket) to initially act as host when connected to a USB Mini-A plug (the &quot;A&quot; end of a Mini-A– Mini-B cable). The Mini-A connector also has an additional piece of plastic inside to prevent insertion into a slave-only (B-only) device.

==== Connector types ====

There are several types of USB connectors, and some have been added as the specification has progressed.
From the original USB specification:

* Standard-A plug
* Standard-A receptacle
* Standard-B plug
* Standard-B receptacle

Added in the first engineering change noticed to the USB 2.0 specification:

* Mini-B plug
* Mini-B receptacle

Added in the ''Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification'':

* Micro-A plug (white)
* Micro-AB receptacle (gray)
* Micro-B plug (black)
* Micro-B receptacle (black)

Adapters, also from the ''Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification'' (Note that no other adapters are allowed.):

* Standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug

[[File:MicroUSB_0115.jpg|thumb|Micro-USB plug]]
[[File:MicroUSB_0121.jpg|thumb|Micro-USB plug]]
* &quot;Micro-series USB technology will replace Mini-series USB in OTG products&quot; [http://www.usb.org/press/pressroom/2007_01_04_usbif.pdf] &quot;Beaverton, OR, 2007-01-04 -- The USB Implementers Forum, Inc. (USB-IF) today announced the completion of the Micro-USB specification, a new connector technology that will replace many of the Mini-series plugs and receptacles currently used in portable products.&quot; The Micro-USB plug is rated for 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles. It is about half the height of the mini-USB connector in widespread use today but features a similar width.

==== Cables and connectors ====

[[File:Male and Female USB Connectors.jpg|thumb|Series &quot;A&quot; plug and receptacle.]]

Cables have only plugs, and hosts and devices have only receptacles. Hosts have type-A receptacles; devices, if they have receptacles, have type-B. Type-A plugs only mate with type-A receptacles, and type-B with type-B.

The On-the-Go supplement allows a product to be either host or device, with a Micro-AB receptacle that accepts either a Micro-A plug or a Micro-B plug. Micro-A, Micro-B, and Micro-AB connectors are identified easily by color. The plastic inside Micro-A plugs and receptacles is always white, that in Micro-B connectors black, and that in Micro-AB receptacles grey.

There is a limited set of cables allowed by the USB specification. Cables fall into two categories — &quot;detachable&quot; and &quot;captive&quot;. All allowed USB cables have one type-A plug, either Standard-A or Micro-A. The other end of a &quot;captive&quot; cable is either not removable or it has a custom connector on the device end. If the cable is &quot;detachable&quot;, the other end of the cable must have a type-B plug. There also exists a special adapter cable that has micro-A plug and standard-A receptacle. 

Captive USB cable types:

* Standard-A plug to device. &lt;br&gt;This cable may have a custom connector on the device end.
* Micro-A plug to device. &lt;br&gt;This cable is not intended to be removed by the end user of the device.

Detachable USB cable types:

* Standard-A plug to Standard-B plug. &lt;br&gt;This is the most popular cable for connecting USB devices to host.
* Standard-A plug to Mini-B plug. &lt;br&gt;Used to connect older mobile devices to host.
* Standard-A plug to Micro-B plug. &lt;br&gt;Used to connect newer mobile devices to host.
* Micro-A plug to Micro-B plug. &lt;br&gt;Used to connect mobile devices to each other.
* Micro-A plug to Standard-A receptacle. &lt;br&gt;This is a special adapter cable that is allowed to be at most 150 mm long. It is needed in order to allow mobile devices to act as USB hosts for devices which are not using Micro-USB connectors.

Any cable with a receptacle (except the special case above) or with two &quot;A&quot; or two &quot;B&quot; connectors is, by definition, not USB.&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.usb.org/developers/whitepapers/cablew~1.pdf and http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ecn1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, many cable manufacturers make and sell USB-compatible (yet not strictly conforming) extension cables with a Standard-A plug on one end and Standard-A receptacle on the other end. Note that these non-conforming extension cables should not be mixed with conforming cables that contain a small bus-powered hub. Cables with two type A or even two type B plugs are available from more specialist suppliers.

Note that only &quot;full-speed&quot; and &quot;hi-speed&quot; devices use detachable cables. Compliant &quot;Low-speed&quot; devices only use captive cables, because the low-speed specification does not allow for the electrical characteristics of standard detachable USB cables.

The Mini-B, Micro-A, Micro-B, and Micro-AB connectors are used for smaller devices such as PDAs, mobile phones or digital cameras. The Standard-A plug is approximately 4 by 12 mm, the Standard-B approximately 7 by 8 mm, and the Micro-A and Micro-B plugs approximately 2 by 7 mm.

The connectors which the USB committee specified were designed to support a number of USB's underlying goals, and to reflect lessons learned from the varied menagerie of connectors then in service. In particular:

* The connectors are designed to be robust. Many previous connector designs were fragile, with pins or other delicate components prone to bending or breaking, even with the application of only very modest force. The electrical contacts in a USB connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue, and the entire connecting assembly is further protected by an enclosing metal sheath. As a result USB connectors can safely be handled, inserted, and removed, even by a small child. The encasing sheath and the tough moulded plug body mean that a connector can be dropped, stepped upon, even crushed or struck, all without damage; a considerable degree of force is needed to significantly damage a USB connector.
* It is difficult to incorrectly attach a USB connector. Connectors cannot be plugged-in upside down, and it is clear from the appearance and kinesthetic sensation of making a connection when the plug and socket are correctly mated. However, it is not obvious at a glance to the inexperienced user (or to a user without sight of the installation) which way round a connector goes, so it is often necessary to try both ways.
* The connectors are particularly cheap to manufacture.
* The connectors enforce the directed topology of a USB network. USB does not support cyclical networks, so the connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible. Unlike other communications systems (e.g. RJ-45 cabling) gender-changers are almost never used, making it difficult to create a cyclic USB network.
* A moderate insertion/removal force is specified. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle (without the need for the screws, clips, or thumbturns other connectors require). The force needed to make or break a connection is modest, allowing connections to be made in awkward circumstances or by those with motor disabilities.
* The connector construction always ensures that the external sheath on the plug contacts with its counterpart in the receptacle before the four connectors within are connected. This sheath is typically connected to the system ground, allowing otherwise damaging static charges to be safely discharged by this route (rather than via delicate electronic components). This means of enclosure also means that there is a (moderate) degree of protection from electromagnetic interference afforded to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (this is the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair must travel a distance in parallel). In addition, the power and common connections are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for safe hot-swapping and has long been common practice in the design of connectors in the aerospace industry.
* The USB standard specifies relatively low tolerances for compliant USB connectors, intending to minimize incompatibilities in connectors produced by different vendors (a goal that has been very successfully achieved). Unlike most other connector standards, the USB spec also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to avoid circumstances where a device complied with the connector specification but its large size blocked adjacent ports. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable which does.

However, the physical layer is changed in some examples. For example, the IBM UltraPort is a proprietary USB connector located on the top of IBM's laptop LCDs. It uses a different mechanical connector while preserving the USB signaling and protocol. Other manufacturers of small items also developed their own small form factor connector, and a wide variety of these have appeared. For specification purposes, these devices were treated as having a captive cable.

An extension to USB called USB On-The-Go allows a single port to act as either a host or a device - chosen by which end of the cable plugs into the socket on the unit. Even after the cable is hooked up and the units are talking, the two units may &quot;swap&quot; ends under program control. This facility targets units such as PDAs where the USB link might connect to a PC's host port as a device in one instance, yet connect as a host itself to a keyboard and mouse device in another instance. USB On-The-Go has therefore defined two small form factor connectors, the Mini-A and Mini-B, and a universal socket (Mini-AB), which should stop the proliferation of proprietary designs.

Wireless USB is a standard being developed to extend the USB standard while maintaining backwards compatibility with USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 on the protocol level.

The maximum length of a USB cable is 5 meters; greater lengths require hubs [http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1]. USB Connections can be extended to 50 m over CAT5 or up to 10 km over fiber by using special USB Extender products developed by various manufacturers.

=== Power supply ===
==== Standard ====

The USB specification provides a 5 V (volts) supply on a single wire from which connected USB devices may draw power. The specification provides for no more than 5.25 V and no less than 4.35 V between the +ve and -ve bus power lines.

Initially, a device is only allowed to draw 100 mA. It may request more current from the upstream device in units of 100 mA up to a maximum of 500 mA. In practice, most ports will deliver the full 500 mA or more before shutting down power, even if the device hasn't requested it or even identified itself. If a (compliant) device requires more power than is available, then it cannot operate until the user changes the network (either by rearranging USB connections or by adding external power) to supply the power required.

If a USB device sees that the data lines of the USB bus have been idle for 3 milliseconds, the device must go into suspend state. Suspended devices are allowed to draw 500 μA. If the device was configured to use more than 100 mA of current, before the device was suspended, and the device was configured as a remote wakeup source, the device is allowed to draw 2.5 mA while suspended. The current limits during suspend are one second averages.

Note that '''On-The-Go''' and '''Battery Charging Specification''' both add new powering modes to the USB specification. 

If a bus-powered hub is used, the devices downstream may only use a total of four units — 400 mA — of current. This limits compliant bus-powered hubs to 4 ports, among other things. Equipment requiring more than 500 mA, hubs with more than 4 ports and hubs with downstream devices using more than four 100 mA units total must provide their own power. The host operating system typically keeps track of the power requirements of the USB network and may warn the computer's operator when a given segment requires more power than is available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blender can render radiosity, a method of calculating realistic lighting, in which light is emitted and transferred using a method similar to that by which heat is transferred.

==Tutorial, Introduction to Radiosity==
No tutorial as of yet.

==Terms Used for Blender Radiosity==

'''Element'''
:Light-receiving mesh, data to be lit. (Meshes with material's emit value set to zero will only be treated as elements.)

'''Patch'''
:Light-emitting faces of a mesh, where the material applied to that face has an emit value above zero.


''Note'' Once lit, elements will be used as patches, so that light can bounce a number of times.

Patches can also be lit by other patches and therefore treated as elements.

==Lighting Geometry==
In Blender detail in lighting is gained by subdividing the mesh, therefore baked meshes will usually have many more faces than the original.

Some facts about radiosity

#The centre of the face is used when emitting light.
#The area of the face will determine how much light it casts.
#Triangles often cause uneven subdivision, giving worse results and less even lighting. Use quads where possible.
#For best results when making a mesh for radiosity baking, long skinny faces will cause artifacts, triangles even more so.
#Radiosity is an iterative process that is continually refined until any of the user-set limits are reached (i.e. the smallest element or the maximum number of elements is reached.) You may stop radiosity calculation early by pressing escape at any time even though your limits are not reached.

==Radiosity Settings==
'''Hemires'''
:This adjusts the resolution of the Hemicube,
:The hemicube is a 3D Grid than spans the bounding box of all objects to which you are applying radiosity.
:This grid is used for calculating the path of light emitted from one object to another.
:The resolution is the number of subdivisions along the X,Y and Z axis, not related to Blender units, affecting how fine grained the light calculations will be.
:A low value may result in noisy scattering of colour, whereas a higher value will be smooth in tone.
:''Note'' that with smaller scenes that are less complex, a lower resolution may give good results much more quickly.

'''Max Iterations'''
:Limits the number of radiosity rounds, 0 is unlimited. If used, this value should be greater or equal to the total number of emitting faces. :''Hint'' It is probably best to keep this value at 0 to make sure all light-emitting faces are evaluated.

'''Add New Meshes'''
:Adds new radiosity baked meshes into active current layers.
:''Hint'' leave some empty layers to add the new mesh into, keeping the original meshes separate from the radiosity allied mesh.

'''Multi and Gamma'''
:Lighting adjustment, use after radiosity is baked.

'''Convergence'''
:Sets the threshold for light to keep bouncing. lower threshold will keep lower energy light bouncing.
:A high Convergence can prevent dim lights from being used at all.
:A higher value is faster.

'''Collect Meshes'''
:Collect selected meshes for radiosity computation.

'''PaMin'''
:This will effects 2 things,
:1) The Minimum size of faces that will be used as a light-emitting patch, and
:2) the minimim size to which a light-emitting face will be subdivided.


'''PaMax'''
:This will effects 2 things,
:The maximum size of faces that will be used as a light-emitting patch, and the maximum size at which an element may be used as a light, when it is subsequently lit by another patch.
:This is important because large faces my be evaluated as a single patch and light surrounding faces from the faces centre point, causing uneven lighting.


'''SubSh Patch and Element'''
:Sub Shoot Patch/Element effects how many times the face is tested for subdivision. More tests mean that it will incrementally subdivide, calculating the patch/element that needs the most detail each time, rather then performing subdivisions fewer times, resulting in a more uniformly subdivided area.
:The subdivisions are limited by the ElMin and PaMin, and will stop if all faces reach this size limit.
:A Zero value will for either of these makes the number of possible tests unlimited.

'''SubSh Patch'''
:Subdividing shoot patches is a way of having patches that are originally large patches subdivided so that lighting casts from each new subdivided patch, resulting in softer shadows.
:The subdivisions are limited by '''PaMin''', which sets how small patches may be before they stop subdividing.

'''SubSh Element'''
:Sub Shoot Patch effects how many times per shoot elements can be subdivided.
:Subdividing elements is the method used to add detail in what would otherwise be a flat area of colour.

'''MaxEl'''
:The total number of faces for the final result. This value is useful for limiting the quality and time taken for the final result. Use a lower value to start with. For meshes that are already highly subdivided you can even use 0 and have no subdivision.
:Also Note that sometimes a lower value will distribute polygons more effectively and give as good a result as a higher setting.

==Trouble Shooting==
'''Q.''' The result looks bad: tone is uneven, as if added in the wrong areas.

'''A.''' Its likely your mesh has skinny faces. Try make your mesh with even faces, quads where possible.


'''Q.''' The tone on areas that should be smooth is uneven and blotchy. 

'''A.''' Setting a higher Hemires will solve this problem.


'''Q.''' I'm getting light refracted white areas when one element reflects onto another.

'''A.''' Your PaMax setting is too high. Your element is reflecting light from the centre of an area that is too large. and will reflect light from a small number of large patches. Make the PaMax lower.

'''Tea''' is generally a drink made from [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] &quot;tea leaves&quot;, which are the leaves of the tea plant.
Sometimes other plants are used. Usually the leaves are not actually eaten; they are strained out of the broth before the broth is drunk.

Some people add [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]].

Tea may be chilled with ice to make a refreshing drink known as '''ice tea''' or '''iced tea'''.
In particular, chilled sweetened tea (or simply sweet tea) is a common beverage in the American south east

Tea is often sold in bottles with added sugar and [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], to be chilled before use.

Tea is a popular drink mixer in some areas; when mixed with vodka, it is known as an Ice Pick.

The '''celery root''' is the main taproot that grows downward as [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] grows upward. Celery root is also known as '''celeriac''', '''turnip-rooted celery''', and '''knob celery'''. Normally a distinct variety of celery is used when growing roots for food. The root is used when it is about the size of a baseball or softball. Celery root is normally peeled and cooked. It is often mashed or used in casseroles and baked dishes. The celery root is routinely used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] cooking and is seen throughout [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]]. Celery root tastes somewhat like celery and [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].

Celery roots are available year-round with a peak during November through April. Select roots that look like they would be easiest to clean and peel; the roots can have lots of knobs and crevices full of dirt. Medium roots tend to be smoother and harder and these roots can be sold with or with out the celery tops. If you do buy the roots with the tops, trim the stalks and save them for soups and stews. The roots should be wrapped in plastic, stored in the refrigerator, and used within a week. Celery roots must be scrubbed, trimmed at the top and bottom, quartered, and then peeled before eating. Be sure to discard any spongy parts. Avoid overcooking celery root as it will go quickly from firm to mushy.</text>

The '''parsnip''' looks like a pale [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and is actually a relative of the carrot, [[Cookbook:Celeriac|celeriac]], and parsley root. Commonly found in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]], this root vegetable arrived to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] with the colonists. Popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries for its [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] flavor and [[Cookbook:Nut|nutty]] fragrance, this vegetable was often used in recipes that called for [[Cookbook:Calorie|caloric]] decadence.

Parsnips are available year round with a peak from fall into spring. They are often displayed with the parsley root, so be sure you know which is a parsnip. Parsley roots are typically sold with their feathery greens whereas parsnips are sold by the root.

Select medium sized roots with uniform creamy beige skin. Avoid limp, pitted, or shriveled roots. Store parsnips unwashed wrapped in paper towel, placed in plastic, and store in the vegetable crisper of the refrigerator for about 2 weeks.

Wash, peel, and trim parsnips as you would a carrot. If [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]], then the parsnips skins will slip off after cooking. If pureeing parsnips, then leave skins intact.

{{vegetable}}

The '''turnip''' often looks like a large [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]], but this varies greatly. Both the root and greens are used.

Turnips are available year round with a peak in the fall and winter months. Select smooth surfaced roots that are firm and heavy with some root hairs at the bottom. In general, the smaller the turnip, the sweeter the taste. Turnips keep well; cut the greens and bag them separately from the root placing them in the crisper section of the refrigerator for up to a week. Turnips can be peeled before cooking, eaten raw, or sliced, diced, or julienned. When cooking this delicate root, cook only to the just tender point; avoid overcooking as sweetness will diminish.

{{vegetable}}

The '''rutabaga''' is a cross between a [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and a [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]]. People have avoided this root because it is a [[Cookbook:Brassicas|cruciferous vegetable]] that becomes more flavored and odorous when cooked.

Rutabagas are available year round with a peak in the fall and winter. These roots range from tan to violet in color and are much larger than turnips; choose smooth, heavy, and firm roots. Smaller rutabagas, 4&quot; in diameter, tend to have sweeter flavor. This root stores for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a week. Rutabagas are usually covered in wax, so it’s best to quarter the root, then peel the skin before cooking.

'''Horseradish''' is a member of the [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] family and is native to Eastern Europe, although it may have originated in Asia, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germany]], or the [[Cookbook:Mediterranean cuisines|Mediteranean area]]. The ancient [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greeks]] used it, so did the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Israel|Hebrews]] — it is one of the 5 bitter [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] of the Jewish Passover. The strong flavor of this root has an underlying sweetness and seems more like [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] than a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

Today horseradish is commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cocktail Sauce|cocktail sauce]] and as a cheap [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]] substitute.

Horseradish roots are available year round but are plentiful during the fall and early spring. Buy roots that are hard. Avoid sprouting, greenish tinges, blemishes, and shriveling.

Store these roots in plastic bags and refrigerate up to a week or freeze grated root in an airtight container for several months. Scrub the root and peel the brown skin. Finely grate or food process the root.

'''Salsify''' is called '''vegetable oyster''' because of its faint oyster-like flavor. This name is used interchangeably to describe two roots. '''White salsify''' is pale, thin, forked, has rootlets at the bottom, while '''black salsify''' ('''scorzonera''') looks like a brown [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and is much smoother and longer looking. Popular in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]] since the 16th century, this root has just begun to make its appearance in markets.

This root is available from fall to early spring. Select medium size roots that are smooth and firm. Larger roots are more fibrous and smaller roots have less meat. White salsify is sold in bunches with leaves still attached. Black salsify is usually sold without leaves and in plastic bags. Salsify will last 2 weeks wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator. Prepare salsify by scrubbing with a brush, removing the skin, rootlets, and all dark spots. Trim the tops and bottoms and slice as you would a carrot or leave whole. Avoid overcooking this root as it will quickly turn into mush.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Danish there are two genders of nouns, but they aren't &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; like other European languages. They're called common and neuter gender, and they are inflected differently. Every noun is associated with one gender, and the gender should be learned when learning the noun. 

About 75% of Danish nouns are ''common'' gender, and if the noun is a living thing such as '''hund''' (dog), chances are its going to be common gender.

However, there are not any clear rules as to what gender a noun is. To a native speaker, it comes naturally whether to use common or neuter gender, but to someone learning Danish as a second language, it often requires a lot of exercise and listening to native speakers.

===Singular nouns===
The Danish word for ''a'' is '''en'''. '''en''' is
the common gender indefinite article. The neuter article is '''et'''. Thus you say:

*'''en dreng''' = ''a boy''
*'''en pige''' = ''a girl''
*'''et hus''' = ''a house''
*'''et æble''' = ''an apple''

In English, when you want to refer to one particular person or item, you use
the article ''the'' instead of ''a'' or ''an''. In Danish you do this by
inflecting the nouns:

*'''drengen''' = ''the boy''
*'''pigen''' = ''the girl''
*'''huset''' = ''the house''
*'''æblet''' = ''the apple''

Example sentences:

*'''Jeg ser en dreng.''' = ''I see a boy.''
*'''Jeg ser drengen.''' = ''I see the boy.''
*'''Jeg læser en bog.''' = ''I read a book.''
*'''Jeg læser bogen.''' = ''I read the book.''
*'''Jeg spiser et æble.''' = ''I eat an apple.''
*'''Jeg spiser æblet.''' = ''I eat the apple.''

===Plural nouns===
Indefinite:
*'''drenge''' = ''boys''
*'''piger''' = ''girls''
*'''huse''' = ''houses''
*'''æbler''' = ''apples''

Definite:
*'''drengene''' = ''the boys''
*'''pigerne''' = ''the girls''
*'''husene''' = ''the houses''
*'''æblerne''' = ''the apples''


Here is the table for inflections of nouns:

&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th rowspan=2&gt;Gender&lt;th colspan=2&gt;Singluar&lt;th colspan=2&gt;Plural
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Indefinite&lt;th&gt;Definite&lt;th&gt;Indefinite&lt;th&gt;Definite
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Common gender&lt;td&gt;en dreng&lt;td&gt;drengen&lt;td&gt;drenge&lt;td&gt;drengene
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter&lt;td&gt;et æble&lt;td&gt;æblet&lt;td&gt;æbler&lt;td&gt;æblerne
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Re: Dynamic Types ====

The statement about static array bounds in C is misleading if not
incorrect in its current form. At least since C99, I think. Consider

 float g(int n)
 {
   struct S {
     float fs[n];
   };
 
   // ...
 }

This is also o.K. by all my C compilers

===== C99 =====

True, C99 has dynamic arrays.  We might have to change the statement.

PS: you must have an exotic set of C compiler since all main stream compiler either have not implemented va arrays or still have them on the known bug list.

== Improvement of basics page ==
If the point of this &quot;basics&quot; page is to teach a newby Ada, then I think it's missed completely.  It seems to start in the middle, wanders through examples, using lots of terminology that's never explained, only to point out relatively unhelpful variations of some commands.

How about a more structured approach; give the explanation of a minimal Ada program, then flesh it out with the &quot;hello world&quot; example.

If a discussion of executible sizes is in order right away, the provide details on options to be used, or links to the mentioned projects.

This looks like a disorganized mess.

:The current status of the page is the confluetion of various collaborations with a divergent approach. You may be right in that the page may need a rework. The executable size section might be moved to [[Ada Programming/Tips]] with a link from here. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 11:09, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

:This page ''definitely'' needs changes, it is the entry point from the Wikipedia Ada page and should be in the best possible shape I think. I have moved some of the messy details to a &amp;lt;ref&gt; footnote, &lt;del&gt;but it is lost now! Can't we use footnotes, or have I made a mistake?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Found it, my fault, sorry.&lt;/ins&gt; [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 22:51, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

:I'd like to see a few more things moved into footnotes, in particlar the excerpt from the Text_IO header!  It really interrupts the flow and is off-putting to the newbie. [[User:Gahs|Gahs]] ([[User talk:Gahs|talk]]) 20:50, 6 December 2007 (UTC)


Sorry not sure how to use the discussion page yet but should;
   Put(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
   New_Line;
   Put(&quot;I am an Ada program with package use.&quot;);
be replaced by
   Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
   New_Line;
   Put_Line(&quot;I am an Ada program with package use.&quot;);
please delete this once dealt with by experienced Ada programmer. Thank you.

== Compilation ==

It would be nice if you could point out how to compile hello world with gnat, e.g. gnatmake hello_world.adb. This is the basics page after all and just running gnat hello_world.adb produces unhelpful errors. See also http://www.adacore.com/wp-content/files/auto_update/gnat-unw-docs/html/gnat_ugn_2.html --[[Special:Contributions/139.19.14.55|139.19.14.55]] ([[User talk:139.19.14.55|discuss]])

: You are right. I have just discovered that the [[Ada Programming/Building]] page was not referenced inside the wikibook. It was only included on the final [[Ada Programming/All Chapters]] compilation. I have included a link to that chapter on this one. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ManuelGR|contribs]]) 18:29, 24 May 2011 (UTC)

== Input ==

It would be nice if you also added an example with text input. The &quot;What's your name?&quot; - Input - &quot;Hello, $Name$&quot; example. --[[Special:Contributions/139.19.14.55|139.19.14.55]] ([[User talk:139.19.14.55|discuss]])

Yes ... it would be nice to explain how to begin to compile this hello world, because sommething is missing to get it.</text>

[[Image:CDC_ugli.jpg|left|Ugli Fruit]]
[[Image:CDC_ugli2.jpg|right|Ugli Fruit]]
The '''ugli fruit''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]].

Ugli fruits are named after their appearance which is generally discolored, pot-marked and odd-shaped. However, it gets a bad rap; it really has a very sweet, citrus taste, is peeled easily and is seedless, making it a great snack or addition to salads. The outside is a greenish-yellow color and has a shape that is between an [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] and a [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]. Ugli fruits are native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]] and have been propagated in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] since the 1930s. They are said to combine the best qualities of [[Cookbook:Tangerine|tangerines]], [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]] and Seville oranges. Ugli fruits have a very thick exterior, so you don't get as much pulp as you might expect from the size.

==Storage, Selection and Preparation==
Choose fruits that are heavy and have no sign of drying at the ends. The fruit should give with slight pressure much like grapefruit. Color is not important when choosing, and pot-marks and small dents are normal. Uglis can be kept at room temperature for about 5 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Uglis should not be cooked or it will lose flavor.</text>

[[Image:CDC_kumquat3.jpg|right|Kumquat]]
The '''kumquat''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]].

Kumquats can appear in markets from October (at the earliest) through June, and during some unpredictable off-season times as well. Considered a winter fruit, their golden color is a welcome sight. Select fruits that are firm, not soft. Because of their skin, they tend to spoil more easily than thicker skinned fruits such as [[Cookbook:Orange|oranges]]. Kumquats will last a few days at room temperature or for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. The entire kumquat is consumed in a bite or two. Because of their size and color, they are also great as drink garnishes or as an addition to salads. Wash kumquats before serving.</text>

[[Image:CDC_sapote.jpg|right|sapote]]

The '''sapote''' is quite rare in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. Only a few acres in Florida and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] are planted with this fruit. Sapote has a orange flesh that is unusually soft, juicy, creamy and has a sweet, mild flavor that hints at flavors such as [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. Sapotes are the size of a [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]] or [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] and are bright green or brown in color. This fruit is a native of the highlands of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]], but has grown in California since the early 1800s. Varieties such as the mamey, black skinned, green skinned, yellow skinned and about half a dozen more uncommon varieties pop up in grocery stores and farmer’s markets from time to time.

==Selection, Storage, and Preparation==
Sapotes are generally on the market in fall and winter, but seasonality can vary from year to year. Select hard fruits and store at room temperature. However, they last only about 3 days. Chill briefly before serving. This fruit can be frozen as well; wrap the whole fruit and tuck into the freezer. To serve, half thaw in the refrigerator, and then scoop the rest out like sherbet.</text>

[[Image:CDC_pepino.jpg|right|pepino]]

The '''pepino''' or '''pepino melon''' is also known as '''treemelon''', '''bush melon''', and '''mellowfruit'''. It is native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peru]], but is now also grown in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. Pepinos are teardrop-shaped and have a smooth skin that is striped with yellow and dark purple. The flesh of this fruit is fragrant and combines the tastes of [[Cookbook:Cantaloupe|cantaloupe]] and [[Cookbook:Honeydew|honeydew]].

==Selection, Storage, and Preparation==
Pepinos are available late fall to mid-spring. Fruits with a light yellow or green skin are not ripe, while fruits with dark purple stripes are ripe. Ripen at room temperature until as firm as a slightly ripe plum, then refrigerate ripe fruit for up to 3 days.</text>

[[Image:CDC_cherimoya.jpg|right|cherimoya]]

The '''cherimoya''' is also known as the '''custard apple''' or '''sherbet fruit'''. It is large and pinecone-like in appearance with a green exterior. Cherimoyas are juicy with a creamy white flesh that tastes like a combination of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]], [[Cookbook:Papaya|papaya]], and [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]. The large black seeds are numerous, but very easy to remove. The cherimoya is related to the [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|pawpaw]].

==Selection, Storage, and Preparation==
Cherimoyas are available November through May. Choose fruits that are yellow-green, firm and without blemishes. Dark spots and splotches should be avoided. Cherimoyas will ripen at room temperature for a few days until softened. They can then be tightly wrapped and refrigerated for up to 4 days. Once ripe, a cherimoya will spoil very quickly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The present tense in Danish verbs is expressed by adding an '''r''' to the end.

The basic form of a verb is the ''infinitive''. In English these are words preceded by ''to'', such as ''to go'' and ''to be''. The Danish translation of ''to'' in this case is '''at'''. Danish infinitives usually end in '''e''', and you get the present tense by adding '''-r'''. 
There are two major groups of Danish verbs.  In one group, you add -de or -ede to the end of the infinitive to create the past tense and -et to the end to create the perfect tense.  In the other group, you replace the e at the end of the infinitive with -te to get the past tense, and remove the e from  the past tense to get the perfect.

You will experience a lot of examples where these rules doesn't apply, but they are the most general ones.

&lt;/table&gt;

Note that several verbs in the table are irregular.

'''Note''': Imperative is the tense where you give a command like &quot;eat!&quot;, &quot;read!&quot;, &quot;listen!&quot; etc.

[[Image:CDC_blue.jpg|right|blueberries]]
The '''blueberry''' is a small sweet fruit.

Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated ones. Blueberries have a protective light powdery coating on the skins and tend to last longer than other berry varieties. Nearly half of the cultivated blueberries grown are sold as fresh blueberries. Fresh blueberries are available for nearly eight months of the year from producers across the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]]. [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North America]] is the world's leading blueberry producer, accounting for nearly 90% of world production. 

==Selection==
[[Image:Blueberry Macro 2.JPG|thumb]]
In general, berries should be dry, firm, well shaped, and eaten within a week after purchase. If you can’t eat them that soon, remember that berries freeze well! It’s best to buy berries that are ‘in-season’ as they’ll cost less and are more ripe and flavorful than ‘out-of-season’ berries.

Stay away from containers of berries with juice stains which may be a sign that the berries are crushed and possibly moldy; soft, watery fruit that means the berries are overripe; dehydrated, wrinkled fruit that means the berries have been stored too long.

Select blueberries that are firm, dry, plump, and smooth-skinned. Berries should be deep-purple blue to blue-black; reddish berries aren't ripe but can be used in cooking.

==Cooking==
*Blueberries tend to change color during cooking. Acids, like [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], make the blue in blueberries turn red. In an alkaline environment, such as a [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] with too much [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]], the blueberries may turn greenish-blue.
*To reduce the amount of color streaking, stir your blueberries (right from your freezer, if frozen) into your [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] or [[Cookbook:Muffin|muffin]] batter last.
*When making [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]] and [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffles]], add the blueberries as soon as the batter has been poured on the [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]] or [[Cookbook:Waffle Iron|waffle iron]]. This will make the pancakes prettier and they'll be easier to flip. If frozen blueberries are used, cooking time may have to be increased to be sure the berries are heated through.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Blueberry|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|3|3|2|1|1}}

Blueberry becomes available halfway through spring, with a peak in the summer. The North American blueberry harvest (responsible for most of the world's supply) runs from mid-April through early October, with peak harvest from mid-May to August.

[[Image:CDC_raspberry.jpg|right|raspberries]]
The '''raspberry''' is a small delicate berry. Raspberries have a similar structure to blackberries, but they are hollow. Red raspberries are the most common type but there are also golden, amber, and purple berries all similar in taste and texture. In the USA raspberries are often imported from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]], while most of the fruit comes from [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]. Raspberry season begins in June and lasts through October in the northern hemisphere.  In Europe raspberries are grown in most places and imported in large quantities from south eastern Europe, particulary Serbia and Bulgaria.

==Selection==
In general, berries should be dry, firm, well shaped, and eaten within a week after purchase. If you can’t eat them that soon, remember that berries freeze well! It’s best to buy berries that are ‘in-season’ as they’ll cost less and are more ripe and flavorful than ‘out-of-season’ berries.

Stay away from containers of berries with juice stains which may be a sign that the berries are crushed and possibly moldy; soft, watery fruit that means the berries are overripe; dehydrated, wrinkled fruit that means the berries have been stored too long.

Select raspberries that are unblemished and dry, in an unstained container. Raspberries should be medium to bright red, depending on the variety. Moisture will increase spoilage, so the berries themselves should be relatively dry. Shelf life for raspberries is short, and they should be consumed within 2–3 days of purchase. Eat at room temperature for fullest flavor.

==Frozen==
It is always best to buy fresh fruit but frozen produce is available and especially popular in the USA.

A 350 gram bag of whole frozen raspberries is equal to about 3 cups frozen berries.

Whole frozen berries destined for your [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods should be used frozen. Gently fold into [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]], [[Cookbook:Cake|cakes]] and [[Cookbook:Muffin|muffins]] just prior to use.

Store whole frozen berries in their unopened or tightly resealed packages in your freezer. If berries are to be served alone, thaw until they are pliable and serve partially frozen. Add sugar to taste — it brings out both the flavor and the luscious juices.</text>

Making a simple sentence diagram is very easy! Let’s get started right now.

First, draw a base line:

{| style=&quot;width: 372px; height: 15px; border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|- style=&quot;border-bottom: solid black 3px&quot;
|
|-
|
|}

Then, cross the base line with another line:

{| style=&quot;width: 372px; height: 142px; border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|- style=&quot;height: 50%; border-bottom: solid black 3px&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; |
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; |
|- style=&quot;height: 50%&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; |
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; |
|}

We will draw the sentence diagram on top of these lines. Are you ready?

Let’s use a simple sentence:

  Marta plays.

This sentence has two parts: “Marta” and “plays”.

Write “Marta” on the first part of the base line, and “plays” on the second part.

{| style=&quot;width: 372px; height: 142px; border-collapse: collapse; font: bold 24pt Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: center; vertical-align: center&quot;
|- style=&quot;height: 50%; border-bottom: solid black 3px&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; | Marta
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; | plays.
|- style=&quot;height: 50%&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; |
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; |
|}

In this sentence, “Marta” is the subject. In sentence diagrams, we write the subject on the first part of the line.

“Plays” is the predicate. We write predicates on the second part of the line.

Later, we will see how to diagram longer sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Grammar is fun! ==
Grammar tells how we use words to talk and write to one another. 

We learn about grammar so we can understand other people, and so other people can understand us!

We use grammar every day, all of the time. We usually do not realize that we are using it.

Remember, grammar is fun, and learning about grammar is fun, too!

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Denmark|Danish Cuisine]]

The '''frikadeller''' - as [[w:Denmark|Danish]] as the [[w:Dannebrog|Dannebrog]].

This is standard Danish fare, made of ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] and [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]].  Traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]] and [[Cookbook:Rødkål|rødkaal]] ([[Cookbook:Braising|braised]] red [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]). Originally, this dish was made so that the meat would feed more people, and thus, the possibilities as to what can be added are numerous. 

These can be frozen and reheated.

==Ingredients==
*250 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] ground [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
*250 grams ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*20% by volume of [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]] (or approx 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]])
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (optional)
*substitute bread crumbs with [[Cookbook:Wheat Germ|wheat germ]] and/or [[Cookbook:Oat Bran|oat bran]]
*ground [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] to taste
*Any ingredient will work. Many people add a quantity of milk also, and the mixture is then thickened again with more flour, bread crumbs and/or oat bran.

==Procedure==
#Mix all ingredients.
#Make small patties.
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] in hot [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] with (lots of) butter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;math&gt;z=a+bi= r \left ( \cos \phi \ + i\sin \phi \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''i'' is the [[w:Imaginary Number|imaginary number]] &lt;math&gt;\left (i\ = \sqrt{-1}\right )&lt;/math&gt;
* the modulus &lt;math&gt;r=\operatorname{mod}(z)=|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&lt;/math&gt;
* the argument &lt;math&gt;\phi=\arg(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle formed by the complex number on a polar graph with one real axis and one imaginary axis. This can be found using the [[Algebra/Complex Numbers#Some_examples|right angle trigonometry]] for the trigonometric functions.

This is sometimes abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;r\left ( \cos \phi \ + i\sin \phi \right )=r\operatorname{cis}\phi&lt;/math&gt; and it is also the case that &lt;math&gt;r\operatorname{cis}\phi=re^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt; (provided that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is in radians).  The latter identity is called Euler's formula.

Euler's formula can be used to prove DeMoivre's formula:  &lt;math&gt;( \cos \phi \ + i\sin \phi )^n=\cos(n\phi)+i\sin(n\phi).&lt;/math&gt;  This formula is valid for all values of n, real or complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tablature (or tabs for short)''' is a way of notating music in a way that is easy to understand and easy to notate in digital form. Tablature is most common for guitar, bass (guitar), and drums, though tablature may exist for other instruments. One advantage of tablature is that it does not require the reader to be able to read standard music notation. There are, however, some pitfalls to tablature notation. For guitar, it doesn't usually show the rhythm or fingering of the song. So in order to be able to play a piece of music from tablature, it is essential to have heard the song before and be reasonably familiar with it.

== Notation ==

Tablature is written on lined paper similar to normal music paper (called a music staff). For guitar, each line corresponds to a string; thus there are 6 lines (4 for bass). Numbers are used to indicate which string to pick and which fret to stop. For example:
 e|-0---0---0---0---------
 B|-----------------------
 G|-----------------------
 D|-----------------------
 A|-----------------------
 E|-----------------------
Means you pluck the top E string 4 times on the open string.

Apparently there was a WikiCities project on tablature but it was shut down due to copyright violation. See the talk page here: http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Talk:Tablature  
So maybe we shouldn't include any copyrighted examples?  --[[User:Njk|Njk]] 14:12, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

There is a wiki for tab if your looking to post tableture in the wiki format or looking for more tabs to add to  wiki books [http://www.tabwiki.com tabwiki.com] --[[User:24.141.248.106|24.141.248.106]] 16:18, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== Discussion From [[Talk:Tabs]] ==

Could this be renamed as '''Tablature'''? I wasn't clear as to what this book was about until I clicked on it. I was pleasantly surprised though, I'd love to help out with this. -[[User:Njk|Njk]] 17:54, 5 May 2005 (UTC)
::Sure, I think that would be a good idea.  [[User:69.42.5.52|69.42.5.52]] 02:45, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

===Copyright issues===
I used to have a [http://tablature.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Tablature site] at [http://www.wikicities.com Wikicities] but it was taken down due to copyright infringement - making tabs is supposedly breaking copyright. I think that http://tabwiki.com is doing a fine job at the moment and more effort doesn't need to put into making pretty much exactly the same site. Especially since in the future the Administrators at Wikibooks may take down this section. [[Wikipedia:User:Jackhynes|Jack]] 11.23, 7 May 2005 (GMT)

===Tab Wiki===
I don't see why this module is needed, another tableture wiki already exists ([http://www.tabwiki.com www.tabwiki.com]) which has a much larger tab selection on it.  This might just be because I contribute to tabwiki but I just see a Tableture Module on WikiBooks as being redundant.
&lt;Br&gt;
PS. If any one wants to help out over at tabwiki we're always looking for more contributors :)

[[Image:Cranberrys_beim_Ernten.jpeg|right|thumb|harvest in a flooded bog]]
The '''cranberry''' is a small sour fruit. It is so sour that most people can't stand to eat fresh cranberries alone. Cranberries contain edible seeds and plenty of air. Cranberry juice has been shown to reduce bladder infections in a nursing home environment. Cranberries are popular as juice, dried fruit, and a [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] called [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|cranberry sauce]] — all with added [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] of course. One single growers' cooperative, Ocean Spray, controls 70% of the cranberry crop.

==Selection==
Ripe cranberries will bounce if they are in good condition. They should be shiny and plump and range in color from bright light red to dark red. Shriveled berries or those with brown spots should be avoided. Cranberries do not ripen after harvest.

==Storage==
Store fresh cranberries in a tightly-sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator. As with all berries, if one starts getting soft and decaying, the others will quickly soften and decay also. Be sure to sort out the soft ones if you plan to store them for more than a few days. Fresh cranberries may last up to 2 months in the refrigerator. Cooked cranberries can last up to a month in a covered container in the refrigerator. Washed cranberries may be frozen for up to 1 year in airtight bags.

==Preparation==
No matter what preparation method you choose, cook cranberries only until they pop; overcooking gives them a bitter taste. Since cranberries are almost 90% water, do not thaw frozen cranberries before cooking them. Thawing will cause the fruit to break down, resulting in soft berries. Cranberries may be baked with a [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]] to make a topping or [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|sauce]]. They are also good chopped with [[Cookbook:Orange|oranges]] to make a relish.

For [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods, first slice the cranberries open. Add all [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] from the recipe, and probably quite a bit more. Let this mixture soak in the refrigerator so that the sugar gets into the cranberries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Spherical Blend Texture ==

This technique maps a spherical blend texture to the outsides of an object.

Create a new material and name it something intelligent. Create a new texture for this material, change the texture type to Blend, and then in the texture properties, change the blend shape to &quot;Sphere&quot;.

[[File:BNTP img1.png]]


Back in the material buttons, go the &quot;MapInput&quot; tab and change the texture coordinates to Blank-Blank-Z and Nor and as demonstrated in the next screenshot:
[[File:BNTP_img2.png]]


Finally go the &quot;MapTop&quot; tab, and depress the Emit button and set the Texture Blending Mode to &quot;Add&quot;:
[[File:BNTP_img3.png]]

That's all there is to it, and here is how it looks:

== Backlighting ==

This is a technique that a rather famous blender user called &quot;@ndy&quot; uses. Very simple and effective.

All you need to do is place a Hemi light BEHIND the object you want to light in respect to the active camera. 

Breakdown:
First add a Hemi lamp to your scene:


[[File:BNTP img10.png]]


Next, Select the lamp THEN press and hold down the Shift key, and select the Camera. Press Control-C to bring up the copy attributes menu, and copy location AND rotation.


[[File:BNTP img11.png]]


Now select JUST your lamp, press R to rotate it, then press the X key TWICE to rotate around the local X axis. Using your numpad, key in &quot;180&quot; to rotate the object 180Degrees.

All that remains to do is to press G to grab the lamp, then press Z TWICE to move along the local Z axis, and move the lamp until it is past and behind the object of interest.
your resulting setup should look something like this:


[[File:BNTP_img13.png]]


And here is the rendered result:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a database abstraction layer? ==
A database abstraction layer (dal) is a couple of functions or a class which deals with every aspects of database handling.

First of all you have a function to connect and to disconnect to/from the database. You also have some functions to submit a query, and to get the results and finally you need to have some error-handling functions too.

== Why to use a dal instead of the regular php funcitons? ==

Of course you do not replace the php-functions, you just connect them to get a better performance when you need to develop your code, validate the data, etc...

If you use a really flexible dal, then you do not need to change every line of your code if you switch from one database type to the other.

== How to write a dal? ==

Most users should not be writing their own DAL, since there are several ready-to-use open-source DALs available. One of the benefits of a DAL is to make code more reusable, and writing your own DAL (unless it achieves wide acceptance in the PHP community) is counterproductive. The most common one is the [http://pear.php.net/package/DB PEAR:DB] package which is already installed on the majority of web servers.

You can find some less sophisticated dals in the source files of some well written open-source CMS sites also.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Redox Reactions/Oxidation state|next=Redox Reactions/Electrochemistry}}

== Redox ==

Redox reactions are chemical reactions in which elements are oxidized and reduced.

{{Info|1=
*''Losing'' electrons is '''oxidation'''.
*''Gaining'' electrons is '''reduction'''.}}

Specifically, at the most basic level one element gets ''oxidized'' by losing, or donating, electrons to the ''oxidizing agent''. In doing so, the oxidizing agent gets ''reduced'' by accepting the electrons lost, or donated, by the ''reducing agent'' (i.e. the element getting oxidized).

If it seems as though there are two separate things going on here, you are correct: redox reactions can be split into two '''half-reactions''', one dealing with oxidation, the other, reduction.

=== Mnemonic ===
Oil Rig

'''O'''xidation '''I'''s '''L'''oss. '''R'''eduction '''I'''s '''G'''ain

Alternatively:

LEO GER

'''L'''oose '''E'''lectrons '''O'''xidation. '''G'''ain '''E'''lectrons '''R'''eduction

=== Example ===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Fe} + \hbox{Cu}^{2+} \to \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + \hbox{Cu}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the complete reaction.  Iron is oxidized, thus it is the reducing agent.  Copper is reduced, making it the oxidizing agent.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Fe} \to \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the oxidation half-reaction.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^-\to \hbox{Cu}&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the reduction half-reaction.
|}

When the two half-reactions are summed, the result is:

{{Helpful hint|hint=If you cancel out the electrons on both sides, you get the original equation.}}

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hbox{Fe} &amp; \to \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \\
\hbox{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- &amp; \to \hbox{Cu} \\
\hline
\hbox{Fe} + \hbox{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- &amp; \to \hbox{Cu} + \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Balancing Redox Equations==

In a redox reaction, ''all electrons must cancel out''.  If you are adding two half-reactions with unequal numbers of electrons, then the equations must be multiplied by a common denominator.  This process is similar to balancing regular equations, but now you are trying to balance the electrons between two half-reactions.

=== Example ===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hbox{Fe}^{2+} &amp; \to \hbox{Fe}^{3+} + e^- \\
\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 + 2e^- &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- \\
\hline
\hbox{Fe}^{2+} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 + 2e^- &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- + \hbox{Fe}^{3+} + e^- \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The electrons don't completely cancel out.  There is one electron more on the left.  However, if you double ''all'' terms in the first half-reaction, then add it to the second half-reaction, the electrons will cancel out completely.  That means the half-reactions for this redox reaction are actually:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
2\hbox{Fe}^{2+} &amp; \to 2\hbox{Fe}^{3+} + 2e^- \\
\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 + 2e^- &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- \\
\hline
2\hbox{Fe}^{2+} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- + 2\hbox{Fe}^{3+} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


== Balancing Redox Equations in an Acidic or Basic Solution==
If a reaction occurs in an [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|acidic or basic]] environment, the redox equation is balanced as follows:

{{TextBox|1=
# Write the oxidation and reduction half reactions, but with the whole compound, not just the element that is reduced/oxidized.
# Balance both reactions for all elements ''except'' oxygen and hydrogen.
# If the oxygen atoms are not balanced in either reaction, add water molecules to the side missing the oxygen.
# If the hydrogen atoms are not balanced, add hydrogen ions until the hydrogen atoms are balanced.
# Multiply the half reactions by the appropriate number (so that they have equal numbers of electrons).
# Add the two equations to cancel out the electrons, as in the previous method, and the equation is balanced!}}

If the reaction occurs in a basic environment, proceed as if it is in an acid environment, but, after step 4, for each hydrogen ion added, add a hydroxide ion to both sides of the equation. Then, combine the hydroxide ions and hydrogen ions to form water. Then, cancel all the water molecules that appear on both sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Predicting Chemical Reactions|next=Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations}}

{{Wikipedia|Oxidation state}}
'''Oxidation states''' are used to determine the degree of ''oxidation'' or ''reduction'' that an element has undergone when bonding.  The oxidation state of a compound is the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms within the compound, which equals zero unless the compound is ionic.

{{Info|1=
*''Gaining'' electrons is '''reduction'''.
*''Losing'' electrons is '''oxidation'''.}}

The oxidation state of an atom within a molecule is the charge it ''would'' have ''if'' the bonding were completely ionic, even though covalent bonds do not actually result in charged ions.

== Method of notation ==

Oxidation states are written above the element or group of elements that they belong to (when drawing the molecule), or written with roman numerals in parenthesis when naming the elements.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _0 \\ Al \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| aluminum
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{+3} \\ Al \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| aluminum(III), an ion
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Determining oxidation state ==

=== For single atoms or ions ===

Because oxidation numbers are just the sum of the electrons gained or lost, calculating them for single elements is easy.

{{Info|The oxidation state of a single element is the same as its charge.  Pure elements always have an oxidation states of zero.}}

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _1 \\ K^+ \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _0 \\ Br \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _1 &amp; _{-1} \\ Na &amp; Cl \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that the oxidation states of ionic compounds are simple to determine.

=== For larger molecules ===

{{Helpful hint|hint=Remember that all the individual oxidation states must add up to the charge on the whole substance.}}

Although covalent bonds do not result in charges, oxidation states are still useful.  They label the hypothetical transfer of electrons ''if'' the substance were ionic.  Determining the oxidation states of atoms in a covalent molecule is very important when analyzing &quot;redox&quot; reactions.  When substances react, they may transfer electrons when they form the products, so comparing the oxidation states of the products and reactants allows us to keep track of the electrons.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{+1} &amp; _{-1} \\ H &amp; Cl \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| for hydrogen chloride
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{2(+1)} &amp; _{-2} \\ H_2 &amp; O \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
| for water
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{+3} &amp; _{2(-2)} \\ Cl &amp; O_2 \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| for the chlorite ion&lt;br&gt;
(notice the overall charge)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

{{Yellow Warning|Oxidation states do not necessarily represent the actual charges on an atom in a molecule. They are simply numbers that indicate what the charges would be if that atom had gained or lost the electrons involved in the bonding.  For example, &lt;math&gt;CH_4&lt;/math&gt; is a covalent molecule—the C has no charge nor does the H, however the molecule can be assigned a -4 oxidation state for the C and a +1 oxidation state for the H's.}}


DETERMINING OXIDATION STATES


The determination of oxidation states is based on knowing which elements can have only one oxidation state other than the elemental state and which elements are able to form more than one oxidation state other than the elemental state. Let's look at some of the &quot;rules&quot; for determining the oxidation states.

1.	The oxidation state of an element is always zero. 

2.	For metals, the charge of the ion is the same as the oxidation state. The following metals form only one ion: Group IA, Group IIA, Group IIIA (except Tl), Zn2+, Cd2+.

3.	For monatomic anions and cations, the charge is the same as the oxidation state. 

4.	Oxygen in a compound is -2, unless a peroxide is present. The oxidation state of oxygen in peroxide ion , O22- is -1.

5. For compounds containing polyatomic ions, use the overall charge of the polyatomic ion to determine the charge of the cation.
Here is a convenient method for determining oxidation states. Basically, you treat the charges in the compound as a simple algebraic expression. For example, let's determine the oxidation states of the elements in the compound, KMnO4. Applying rule 2, we know that the oxidation state of potassium is +1. We will assign &quot;x&quot; to Mn for now, since manganese may be of several oxidation states. There are 4 oxygens at -2. The overall charge of the compound is zero:
K Mn O4
+1 x 4(-2)

The algebraic expression generated is: 
1 + x -8 = 0

Solving for x gives the oxidation state of manganese:
x - 7 = 0
x = +7
K Mn O4
+1 +7 4(-2)

Suppose the species under consideration is a polyatomic ion. For example, what is the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate ion, (Cr2O72-)? 

As before, assign the oxidation state for oxygen, which is known to be -2. Since the oxidation state for chromium is not known, and two chromium atoms are present, assign the algebraic value of 2x for chromium:
Cr2 O7 2-
2x 7(-2)

Set up the algebraic equation to solve for x. Since the overall charge of the ion is -2, the expression is set equal to -2 rather than 0:
2x + 7(-2) = -2

Solve for x:
2x - 14 = -2
2x = 12
x = +6

Each chromium in the ion has an oxidation state of +6.
Let's do one last example, where a polyatomic ion is involved. Suppose you need to find the oxidation state of all atoms in Fe2(CO3)3. Here two atoms, iron and carbon, have more than one possible oxidation state. What happens if you don't know the oxidation state of carbon in carbonate ion? In fact, knowledge of the oxidation state of carbon is unnecessary. What you need to know is the charge of carbonate ion (-2). Set up an algebraic expression while considering just the iron ion and the carbonate ion:
Fe2 (CO3)3
2x 3(-2)
2x - 6 = 0 
2x = 6
x = 3

Each iron ion in the compound has an oxidation state of +3.
Next consider the carbonate ion independent of the iron(III) ion:
C O3 2-
x 3(-2)
x - 6 = -2
x = +4

The oxidation state of carbon is +4 and each oxygen is -2.

== Guidelines ==

Determining oxidation states is not always easy, but there are many guidelines that can help.  This guidelines in this table are listed in order of importance.  The highest oxidation state that any element can reach is +8 in XeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Element
!Usual Oxidation State
|-
| Fluorine
| Fluorine, being the most electronegative element, will always have an oxidation of -1 (except when it is bonded to itself in F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, when its oxidation state is 0).
|-
| Hydrogen
| Hydrogen always has an oxidation of +1, -1, or 0.  It is +1 when it is bonded to a non-metal (e.g. HCl, hydrochloric acid).  It is -1 when it is bonded to metal (e.g. NaH, sodium hydride).  It is 0 when it is bonded to itself in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
|-
| Oxygen
| Oxygen is usually given an oxidation number of -2 in its compounds, such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The exception is in peroxides (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) where it is given an oxidation of -1. Also, in F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxygen is given an oxidation of +2 (because fluorine must have -1), and in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where it is bonded only to itself, the oxidation is 0.
|-
| Alkali Metals
| The Group 1A metals always have an oxidation of +1, as in NaCl.  The Group 2A metals always have an oxidation of +2, as in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  There are some rare exceptions that don't need consideration.
|-
| Halogens
| The other halogens (Cl, Br, I, As) usually have an oxidation of -1.  When bonded to another halogen, its oxidation will be 0.  However, they can also have +1, +3, +5, or +7.  Looking at the family of chlorides, you can see each oxidation state (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0), Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (-1), ClO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+1), ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+3), ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+5), ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+7)).
|-
| Nitrogen
| Nitrogen (and the other Group 5A elements, such as phosphorus, P) often have -3 (as in ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but may have +3 (as in NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or +5 (as in phosphate, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;).
|- 
| Carbon
| Carbon can literally have any oxidation state (from -4, as in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, to +4, as in CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  It is best to find the oxidation of other elements first.
|}

In general, ''the more electronegative element has the negative number''.  Using a chart of electronegativities, you can determine the oxidation state of any atom within a compound.

== Periodicity ==

Oxidation states are another periodic trend.  They seem to repeat a pattern across each period.

'''Purpose: To demonstrate the object collision feature of Blender's Game Engine.'''

== Introduction to Object Collision ==

In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of object collision within the Blender Game Engine (BGE).  These physics simulations can be used for many things, from Blender games to use in animations, the bullet physics engine offers a massive number of possibilities, limited only by your imagination (and the amount of RAM your computer possesses).  The tutorials found within this wikibook on the subject of the BGE are generally focused on game creation, but the concepts taught within them can be applied to a multitude of situations.

With the mouse cursor over a 3D viewport, press NUMPAD-7 to switch to TOP view.

Press the spacebar and select Add &gt;Mesh &gt;Plane.  Press TAB to leave edit mode and enter object mode.
[http://img192.echo.cx/my.php?image=17bf.jpg]

Enlarge the plane by pressing S and dragging the mouse cursor away from the center of the plane. Click to stop re-sizing. The plane will serve as the 'floor'.

Add A UVSphere using the same sequence for adding the plane object.  Press TAB to enter object mode.  

With the mouse cursor over a 3D viewport, press NUMPAD 1 for Front view, then press G and move the sphere above the plane.  Click to exit Grab Mode.  You may need to scale the sphere down.  It will be the ball which collides with the floor.

Go to logic panel (move cursor over Button Viewport and press F4). 

Click on actor button (in the upper left corner of the logic panel), then Dynamic, then Rigid Body.  This activates physics properties for the sphere so it can bounce.

Change the value of &quot;Radius&quot; to 2.0. Notice the dotted line that appears around the sphere. This dotted line marks how big the physics engine thinks this sphere is. For now, set it back to 1.0.

Next, you want to add some colour to the sphere and the plane (see [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Quickie_Material]] for details), so you can tell the two apart during simulation.

Move the cursor over a 3D viewport and press P.  The sphere will drop down and collide with the plane.  Press ESC to end simulation

For fun, try rotating the plane in front or side (NUMPAD 3) view and press P again.  The ball will first hit the plane, then roll down.  Add several more planes rotated to differing angles and position them in the falling path of the ball to keep it going.

The '''gooseberry''' is a bittersweet little berry that the English have a passion for. Gooseberry wines, [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]] and [[Cookbook:Pudding|puddings]] were very popular in colonial days. Today most such recipes have all but disappeared from cookbooks.

Though this intriguing berry grows wild in many locations throughout the continental [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], it's generally cultivated in tropical zones such as Hawaii, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of South Africa|South Africa]], Asia, and Central and [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]]. At first glance the cape gooseberry with its inflated, papery skin, looks somewhat like a Chinese lantern. The juicy berries that hide inside the skin are opaque and golden in color. Imported cape gooseberries are available from March to July.

Gooseberries are cultivated on a commercial scale in Oregon, but the vast majority of the crop is canned. Fresh berries are usually imported and are found in specialty produce markets. The popularity of gooseberries has been increasing over the past few years and fresh berries are becoming easier to find. The berries taste of a sweet tangy mixture of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] and [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberry]]. The fruits make an interesting addition to [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]], cooked dishes, and as a garnish.

==Selection==
Choose hard, dry berries, with a rich sheen. If you are looking for less tartness, head for the pinkish or purplish tones. Look for those with a bright golden color; green berries are not ripe. However, pick gooseberries green for pies and [[Cookbook:Jam|jams]].

==Storage==
Gooseberries store well and will stay fresh in the refrigerator for about two weeks. They should turn pinker and softer during their time in storage. Once they turn purple, the fruit is still good for purees for another week.

==Preparation==
Gooseberries vary in their bitterness. Some varieties are too bitter to eat raw, so taste one first. The less-bitter varieties of gooseberries are often added to fruit salads or used as garnish for [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] plates. To use the berries, peel back the parchment-like husk and rinse. Remove the stems and tops with scissors before eating or cooking. Gooseberries may be poached and eaten cooked or added to [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or syrup for a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. To retain the shape of the berry, poach slowly. They are done when the seeds have escaped and the skins collapse.

==Varieties==
There are two types of gooseberries, the American and the [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]]. The European varieties have larger and more flavorful fruits.

*'''Pixwell:''' (American) This variety produces round 1/2-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] berries that are light green, maturing to a soft pink.

*'''Welcome:''' (American) This variety produces a sweeter and darker fruit at maturity than the Pixwell and also produces a 1/2-inch berry.

*'''Clark:''' The most productive of the European gooseberry types. The berries are very large and red when ripe.

*'''Fredonia:''' (European) Available early mid-season. Ripens several days after Clark. Berries are also large and red when ripe.</text>

The pennywhistle, also known as the tin whistle or tin flute, is a traditional end-blown flute, similar to the recorder in appearance and use. Its origins are in Ireland, but it since has come into use in many branches of Celtic folk and traditional music, being among the most common melody instruments both in slow airs and in dance tunes such as jigs and reels. In contemporary Celtic music, it often adds a powerful accompaniment to vocal music, and it's high natural tone can provide a balance of range in multi-instrumental arrangements.  

This wikibook provides a tutorial on the basic method of the pennywhistle, as well as an introduction to ornamentation, improvisation, and playing in a seisiún (pronounced &quot;session&quot; in english; a sort of Irish &quot;jam session&quot;). This is especially designed to help someone who already knows a bit about music, such as different keys and scales, but even the musically uninitiated will find much useful information.

==Selecting an instrument==

Before you begin playing, it is critical to select an instrument that best fits your needs, abilities, and, of course, price range.  It is usually best to try out several whistles, either by purchasing or by borrowing them, before you decide which one to continue using.  In particular, don't give up whistling just because you don't like a specific whistle!  There are hundreds of reasonably priced whistles on the market.  Some are squeaky, shrill, and hard to handle, while others feel as natural as your own voice, so keep trying until you find the right one.  Here are some guidelines to set you on the right track. 

===Styles of whistle===

The construction of a pennywhistle is very simple, as the whistle consists of only two parts.  The first is the ''bore'', a tube about 2 cm in diameter.  Six holes are located on the bore; these are covered by the fingers to create different pitches.  The second part is the ''mouthpiece'', which is usually made of molded plastic and fixed to the bore (exceptions are listed below).  

The most popular pennywhistles on the market today are probably also the best choice for beginners: inexpensive, with plastic mouthpieces.  I highly recommend the Sweetone, which has a good sound and is available for five to six U.S. dollars from various online stores.

Another inexpensive choice is the Clarke whistle, which is made in England of a single sheet of metal wrapped in a semiconical shape, with a raw block of wood inserted as the mouthpiece.  This offers a soft, breathy sound that is appropriate for certain songs, but requires much more breath than a plastic mouthpiece, making long notes or phrases all but impossible.

Most low-cost whistles are not tunable, meaning that the pitch of each note is fixed and cannot be changed to match that of other instruments.  Other whistles, including some as inexpensive as $15, can be tuned by moving the mouthpiece.  A tunable whistle may be a good investment if you plan on playing with other musicians very often, and especially if you are accompanied by an instrument such as a piano that cannot be easily tuned to match your pitch.

It should be mentioned that it is in fact possible to modify low-cost non-tunable whistles. Whistles such as a Generation or a Walton have the fipple (''mouthpiece'') glued on. To modify such whistles carefully heat the fipple in hot water to soften the glue and remove the fipple. Clean the glue off both the fipple and the bore. Grease the inside of the fipple and the outside of the bore with vaseline or lip balm or similar and replace the fipple. This provides an airtight fit and allows the fipple to be eased up and down making it the whistle tunable.

The bore of most whistles is made of unfinished tin or brass. Some brands, however, also offer a &quot;blackwhistle&quot;, which has an opaque black finish on the bore.  This makes no difference except for looks, and should never cost more than an unfinished whistle.  

Another alternative to plain metal is the wooden whistle offered by the Sweetheart Flute Company.  These instruments offer a sweet, mellow tone and make it easy not to sound squeaky or shrill, though some may not like the deviation from the more piercing traditional sound.  They are without exception very expensive, starting around $100.  Unlike most whistles, which require that the musician half-cover holes to achieve sharps and flats, wooden whistles can have keys added to sharp certain notes for an extra charge.

The final and most unusual non-metal whistles, such as the Water Weasel brand, are made of PVC pipe.

===Keys===

As mentioned above, most whistles play in a specific key.  For example, a whistle in the key of D plays the notes of D, E, F#, G, A, B, and C# without requiring the musician to manually sharp any notes.  Any notes that are not on this scale must be created by half covering holes (unless your whistle has keys to sharp notes; see &quot;Styles of Whistle&quot; above.)  If you wish to play a natural C on a D whistle, for instance, you must half-cover the B hole to achieve a B#, which is also a C.  Some people find it easy to manually sharp notes; others prefer to buy whistles in several different keys.

Since the vast majority of Irish music is written in the keys of G and especially D, whistles in D and G are the most common, although it is also easy to find whistles in the key of C.  Each key of whistle has a different fingering.  For instance, when playing a C whistle, the lowest note-- that with all the holes covered-- is a middle qb; on a D whistle, the lowest note is the D just above middle C.  As a result, it can be very difficult to switch between keys.  It is really a personal decision whether this or manual sharps is more cumbersome.  Some people refuse to do either, and either play only tunes in their key or transpose other tunes into it.

One exception to these basic remarks is the low D whistle offered by many companies.  These whistles are fingered in the same pattern as a middle D whistle, but are much longer and wider so that they play an octave lower.  They are often made out of unconventional materials, such as PVC pipe, and usually have a wooden block instead of a molded plastic mouthpiece.  Low whistles have a deep, haunting sound that adds a nice variety to any whistler's repertoire.  

The disadvantages of low whistles are that they are more expensive than small whistles, take immense reserves of breath, and have very large, widely spaced holes.  Unless you have exceptionally large hands, you will probably need to cover the holes with the flat, fleshy part of your fingers between the second and third knuckles, rather than with the fingertips, which many people find difficult to get used to.  That said, this style of fingering is exactly the same as that of a bagpipe, so if you have played the pipes it will be second nature to you.

==Playing the whistle==

For this we assume that you are playing a whistle with the standard D tuning, which is the default whistle tuning.

There is a great tin whistle tutorial especially suitable for beginners at [whistleaway.com[http://www.whistleaway.com/whistletutorial.asp]].

'''Position of Whistle and Fingers'''

Hold the whistle so that it comes from your mouth at about forty-five degree angle. If you are right-handed, your right hand should be on the bottom- for left-handers it is reverse. Your thumbs hold the whistle up from below. Place the top pad the first three of your fingers (not the tip) over each corresponding hole, tight enough for no air to leak. This should require very little pressure if the fingers are correctly placed -if you find holding the position for long periods uncomfortable, you may be pressing too hard. The pinkies should be placed where ever is comfortable and out of the way. They are not used. When all the holes are covered, that is D position. If you lift up the lowest finger, you have E position. Lift the next lowest finger, and it is F. Lift the next one and it is G-- so on through A, B, until C has no holes covered. Because the whistle is held in place by 'pinching' the fingers and thumbs slightly, most whistlers will keep their bottom finger (right ring finger for right handed players) down whilst playing a C -this has no real effect on the tone.

When putting the whistle to your mouth, the mouthpiece should be held between the lips, but usually not protrude into the mouth far enough to bang into the teeth, which could damage both the mouthpiece and your teeth!

'''Blowing'''

Hold the whistle in D position. With a slow steady stream of air, exhale lightly. If you blow too softly the note will not be clear. If you blow too hard, it will either be D in a higher octave or it will just squeak. Practice until the note is a clear, low D. Practice with the other notes, as well, until they all are clear, low notes. Each note takes slightly more air pressure than the one below it.

For a higher octave, you only have to blow a little harder. However, it takes a lot of practice to keep these notes from squeaking. Has anybody heard about how practice helps?! You may not believe it but it's true!

'''Tonguing'''

Tonguing is performed by tapping the roof of your mouth with your tongue, as if sounding a 'T' or 'D', at the beginning of your breath -if you were using your vocal chords rather than playing the whistle, it would give you a 'tooo' sound. It has the effect of beginning the note with a sharp attack rather than a breathy opening. Whether you tongue some, all, or none of the notes you play is entirely a stylistic choice. Tonguing can also be used mid breath to punctuate playing, as it momentarily stops the breath. This can specifically be used to break up a run of identical notes.


'''Irish Ornamentation'''

Before you try ornamentation, make sure you can play fairly well and quickly. And remember- they are not rules about ornamentation that you should follow. What ever is easiest and sounds best is they method you should use. Everyone has their own style.

''The placing of Ornamentations''

Some Irish music provides ornaments, but the majority leaves the ornaments up to you. Using the following devices the song can be made prettier. When ever you think one of them would enhance the sound, use it. However, it is best not to go overboard. 

''The Grace Note''

The grace note is a very short note played before another, main note. For the notes D, E, and F, lift the finger that covers the A hole, and quickly set it down. Let's use an example to explain this a little clearer. You have a song, in which the sequence of notes goes like this: 

A G grace note E F grace note D

First play the A, then the G, then put you fingers in the position of E, but with the A hole uncovered, play, and quickly replace the A finger. (tongue only the grace note, not the main note). Next play the F, then form the D, with the A hole uncovered, play, and quickly replace the A finger.

For the notes G, A, and C, they same thing is done, only it is not the A hole that is uncovered for the grace note, but the B hole. You can use other holes as well for grace notes. Remember, there are not rules. What sounds best is best.

The length of a grace should be only long enough to be distinct. Keep it as short as possible without the tones blending.

''Strikes''

A strike is easy- just tap your finger on the hole below the note you are playing. Like the tonguing you can separate notes with a strike, which can be used well if there are two or more equal notes in row. For example A A A or G G.

''Cuts''

The cut is another way to separate notes. Instead of tapping the belower note as we do it in a strike, we are lifting one finger at a higher note to interrupt the airflow. Essential for this are the forefinger and the ringfinder of your left hand. To cut the notes D E and F you are lifting your left ringfinger and to for cutting the notes G A and B you take your left forefinger. You might ask what is meant with &quot;lifting the finger?&quot; and that is a quite important question. It is not a lifting at all but rather a really short flipping of your finger. As if a beetle is sitting on your finger and you want to chase it of. 

''Slides''

A slide is a gradual transition from one note to another, as opposed to the ordinary form of quickly moving to the next note.  Generally done by gently rolling the finger onto or off of the hole, as opposed to the tapping required in quicker melodies.  

''Rolls and Vibratos''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note the word endings, and how they change in their plural forms:

Words ending in '''&quot;a&quot;''' or '''&quot;e&quot;''' get an '''&quot;s&quot;'''. casa-cases, note that the ending '''&quot;a&quot;''' '''always''' changes to '''&quot;e&quot;''' before the '''&quot;s&quot;'''

Words ending in '''&quot;à&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ans&quot;''' humà-humans

Words ending in '''&quot;è&quot;''' or '''&quot;é&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ens&quot;''' cinquè-cinquens 

Words ending in '''&quot;í&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ins&quot;''' camí-camins

Words ending in '''&quot;ò&quot;''' or '''&quot;ó&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ons&quot;''' camió-camions 

Words ending in '''&quot;ú&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;uns&quot;''' oportú-oportuns

Words ending in '''&quot;s&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ssos&quot;''' gos-gossos
 
Words ending in '''&quot;ix&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ixos&quot;''' baix-baixos

Words ending in '''&quot;tx&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;txos&quot;''' esquitx-esquitxos

Words ending in '''&quot;ig&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;itjos&quot;''' desig-desitjos

Words ending in '''&quot;aig&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ajos&quot;''' assaig-assajos


And finally,
words ending in '''any other consonant''' - simply get an extra '''&quot;s&quot;''' curt-curts


However, be careful with the following orthographic changes.

-'''ca''' becomes -'''ques''' vaca-vaques

-'''ga''' becomes -'''gues''' euga-eugues

-'''qua''' becomes -'''qües''' Pasqua-Pasqües

-'''gua''' becomes -'''gües''' aigua-aigües (in order to preserve the [gua] sound

-'''tja''' becomes -'''tges''' platja-platges

-'''ça''' becomes -'''ces''' caça-caces

[[Image:Grapefruit, half.jpg |thumb|A grapefruit, sliced in half]]
The '''grapefruit''' is a large [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] that is moderately sour and slightly bitter. It is well-known for causing dangerous interactions with drugs, so be sure to investigate this if you are taking any medication. Pink or red grapefruits tend to be sweeter and have more vitamins than the &quot;white&quot; (yellow) grapefruits.

To serve a grapefruit in the traditional manner, first cut it in half right across the axis. A small spoon may then be used to scoop out the pulp. You may wish to first cut around the center or around the edge, possibly using a bent serrated knife. You may wish to use a [[Cookbook:Grapefruit Spoon|grapefruit spoon]]. If the grapefruit is particularly sour, you might sprinkle some [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] on top.

An altogether different way to cut a grapefruit, preferred for use in salads or dessert dishes, is known as '''supreme'''. First both ends (poles) of the grapefruit are cut off, enough to expose the flesh. Then the skin and pith are cut away in strips (it is best to use a serrated knife to make curved cuts). Next the membranes are cut or peeled away from the flesh, leaving bare segments free of chewy membranes and bitter pith. This method is particularly useful for grapefruit and [[Cookbook:Pummelo|pummelo]] because the segments are so large compared to other citrus fruits.</text>

[[File:NIH_citrus.jpg|right|citrus fruit|thumb|A multi-colored assortment of limes, oranges, and lemons: all of them can provide zest to food and drink]]
The '''citrus''' [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]] are semi-tropical fruits that are usually eaten raw without the peel. Shavings from the peel, called [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]], are sometimes used in cooking. The [[Cookbook:Juice|juice]] has various uses, especially as a beverage. Citrus fruits mix sweet and tangy together in a blend that no other ingredient can match.

Types of citrus fruit include:

*[[Cookbook:Kumquat|kumquat]] – often eaten whole, and somewhat frequently cooked
*[[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] – popular as juice, fresh fruit, and [[Cookbook:Marmalade|marmalade]]
*[[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] – used for [[Cookbook:Lemonade|lemonade]] and to make foods sour
*[[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] – often substituted for lemon
*[[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]] – popular as a [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] food
*[[Cookbook:Tangerine|tangerine]] – like an orange, but sweeter and easier to peel
*[[Cookbook:Ugli Fruit|ugli fruit]] – like a huge and ugly tangerine
*[[Cookbook:Pummelo|pummelo]] – huge mild-tasting predecesor to the grapefruit</text>

The '''pummelo''' is a huge [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. It is the predecesor to the [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]]. Compared to a grapefruit, the pummelo is milder. It might be wise to assume that the grapefruit's well-known drug interaction problems apply to the pummelo as well. A pummelo can be served like a grapefruit.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{fruit}}

Many '''melons''' originated in the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] and gradually spread its popularity across [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]]. Ancient [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Romans]] enjoyed cantaloupes or muskmelons. Melon seeds were transported to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] by Columbus and eventually cultivated by [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] explorers in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]].

Melons are in the same [[Cookbook:Gourd|gourd]] family as [[Cookbook:Squash|squashes]] and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]]. Most melons have similar structure to winter squash with thick flesh and inner seed-filled midsection. So what’s the difference between melons and squashes? It’s the way that they’re used. Squashes are considered [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], while melons are known as [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]] with sweet and juicy flavor.

Melons are a good source of vitamin C and potassium. They have high water content are relatively low in [[Cookbook:Calorie|Calories]], and also [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] and cholesterol free. 

==Varieties==
There are many melon varieties. Cantaloupe, honeydew, and [[Cookbook:Watermelon|watermelon]] are the most well known varieties.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_cantaloupe.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Cantaloupe''' &amp;mdash; Also called a '''muskmelon''', this familiar fruit with orange flesh and khaki netted colored skin provides the most beta-carotene in the entire melon family. Select melons that are slightly golden with a light fragrant smell (an indication of its ripeness). Cantaloupe is typically available year-round, with a June through August peak season.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_casaba.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Casaba''' &amp;mdash; Unlike the other melons, casaba melons do not have an aroma. This is a large melon that is pale yellow when ripe and has white flesh with a sweet taste. This melon peaks in the fall, but starts showing up in markets in July through December.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_crenshaw.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Crenshaw''' &amp;mdash; These melons can weigh up to ten pounds and deliver a unique sweet and spicy flavor. They are a hybrid between the casaba and Persian melon with a yellowish skin and [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]-colored flesh. Peak season for Crenshaw melons is August through September, with the fruit season beginning in July and ending in October.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_honeydew.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Honeydew''' &amp;mdash; The sweetest of all the melons and averaging five to six pounds, honeydew melons have a creamy yellow rind when ripe and pale green flesh. It’s best from June through October, but is available year round.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_persian.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Persian''' &amp;mdash; This melon is quite similar to the Cantaloupe, but it slightly larger in size, has a greener rind, and on the outside it has finer netting. Persian melons peak in August and September with the season beginning in June and ending November.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_santa.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Santa Claus''' &amp;mdash; This melon is also known as the '''Christmas''' melon because it peaks during the month of December. This variety is similar to the watermelon with the green and gold stripes, but is about a foot long and isn’t as sweet as the other melons.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_sharlyn.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Sharlyn''' &amp;mdash; This melon tastes like a cantaloupe and honeydew combined. Sharlyn melons are sweet with netted outer layer, greenish-orange rind, and white flesh. The availability varies, so check your local supermarkets and farmer’s market.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Selection==
In general, melons should be shaped according to their variety. For example, cantaloupes should be round, etc. In addition, melons should not have cracks, soft spots, or dark bruises. You should look for a clean and smooth break at the stem and for most mature melons have a fruity fragrance (if not chilled).

==Storage==
Keep uncut melons at room temperature for two to four days or until fully ripe, then refrigerate for up to 5 days. Refrigerate cut up melon in a covered container up to 3 days. Remember that cut melons are aromatic and their smell will penetrate other foods.

==Preparation==
Always wash melons in warm soapy water before cutting to get rid of any impurity on the rind that might be carried from the knife blade to the flesh. Simply cut the melon in half and scoop out the seeds and strings. Melons can be cut into halves, quarters, wedges, cubes, or scooped into balls with a melon baller. Most melons will benefit from a squeeze of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon or lime juice]] to enhance the flavor. Serve at room temperature.</text>

[[Image:pomegranate_01.jpg|right|pomegranate]]
The '''pomegranate''' is a [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] the size of a large [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]]. The leathery reddish-pink skin shelters the membranous walls and bitter tissue that house compartments or sacs filled with hundreds of seeds. A translucent red pulp that has a slightly sweet and tart taste surrounds these seeds. Pomegranates are grown in California and throughout Asia and the Mediterranean countries.

Pomegranates are available in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] from September through December. Select fruit that is heavy for its size with bright, fresh color and blemish-free skin. You can refrigerate whole pomegranates for up to 2 months or store them in a cool, dark place for up to a month. Pomegranate seeds packed in an airtight container and stored in the freezer will keep for up to 3 months.

==Uses and Preparation==
Pomegranates are a versatile fruit and can be used as a garnish on sweet and savory dishes or pressed to extract the juice. To use a pomegranate, cut it in half and pry out the pulp-encased seeds, removing any of the light-colored membrane that adheres. The seed pods tend to squirt when they pop, and you will invariably pop quite a few of them while handling a pomegranate. The juice will stain, so be sure to wear an apron or clothing that you don’t mind getting stained. The juice can also stain your walls or countertops; a good way to avoid the squirting juices is to handle the fruit completely submerged in a large pot of water. The seeds will sink to the bottom, and the membrane will float. Use a strainer to scoop out the membrane, then pour the rest through a collander to collect the seed pods.</text>

'''Putting music in your film''' can be potentially very complicated. There are several ways to go about this, but each depends on your skill, experience and budget.   It is important to note that most professional composers will charge a lot of money for you to have their music in your movie. Many people do not understand just how important music is so you definitely need someone with experience. 

==Things to consider==
*What kind of film are you making, and what kind of music would fit in best?
*How long does the music need to play during the scene?
*How loud should the music be? Should it drown out any dialogue, or should it be strictly in the background?
*Should it be constant?
*What effect are you trying to convey?

==Facing The Music==
===The professional===
Hiring a professional composer would probably be the easiest option in your array. These people know exactly what they are doing and have resources at their disposal. See the list of popular film composers in Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_music Film Music].  The downsides are that you must choose a composer who has experience in the genre you want. If you want orchestral music to play through your chosen scene, [[Wikipedia:Trent Reznor|Trent Reznor]] would probably not be the best choice. It is possible that you may not be able to find a professional who will be willing to work on your movie without blowing most (or all) of your budget, however.

===Doing it yourself===

There are many ways for filmmakers to create a musical score on a personal computer.

;1. Live Musical Instruments
:One way to create a film score is to use a '''DAW''' (Digital Audio Workstation) with live musical instruments.

;2. Midi Sound Modules.
:Another method is to use MIDI with '''Midi sound modules''' (audio hardware) which is then recorded into a computer with DAW software.

;3. Software Musical Instruments
:Yet another ways is to do the film score totally digitally using '''software instruments''' inside the computer and controlled by a MIDI controller.

====1. Old-fashion Analog = DAWs====

You can create a film score with a live musician playing a real musical instrument.  Recording live musical instruments is very straight forward.  

'''Multitrack recording''' When a motion picture is scored by the London Philharmonic, the orchestra conductor watches the movie screen and conducts the musicians who play real musical instruments, live and in sync with the action on the screen.  This music is recorded via a microphone into a computerized DAW which works like a multi-track tape recorder.  Later, all the tracks are mixed down and added to the film's sound track.  This is very fast but expensive.  Fortunately, you can do the same thing in a very simple way using your personal computer... if you have the correct software, a quiet computer, a professional-quality microphone which is connected to your computer usually through a tiny mixing board (or microphone preamp) which connects to the computer via USB, FireWire, or analog connection.

Using almost any computer (Windows or Macintosh), you can turn your computer into a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), which is a very powerful multi-track tape recorder inside  your computer.  As an example, all Macintosh computers come with a free digital audio workstation program which is disguised as a music program called [[Wikipedia:GarageBand|GarageBand]].  Try it!

Basically, all you need to turn your computer into a multi-track recording system for film scoring is a computer program, a professional quality microphone, and a preamp.

;1.  The Software
:The computer program must be able to play a movie clip (usually just one scene of your movie as a QuickTime movie or a AVI movie) while the program records a single track of audio.  (Most modern music program are DAW programs.  Older programs only worked with MIDI but now audio recording features are included in almost all music programs.)  An example of a very simple music program is [http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ Apple's GarageBand].

;2. The Preamp
:This can be a preamp or tiny mixer board which connects to the computer via USB, FireWire or directly to the analog audio input of your computer.  A good example of preamp is M-Audio's low-cost USB device [http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FastTrackUSB-main.html FastTrackUSB].  This works with Apple's GarageBand and is sold at the Apple Store.  However, the reviews of this product at the [www.apple.com/store Apple Store] are not all favorable.  Similarly the M-Audio MobilePre USB Audio Interface also has unfavorable reviews at the [www.apple.com/store Apple Store].  A more expensive interface for FireWire is [http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FireWire410-main.html M-Audio's FireWire410].  A typical analog mixing board is the [http://www.behringer.com/UB1202/index.cfm?lang=ENG Behringer Eurorack UB1202FX Mixing Board].

;3. The Microphone
:And finally you need a professional microphone with XLR connectors.  See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone Wikipedia's Microphone]. [http://www.musiciansfriend.com/ Musician's Friend] has a [http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=99537&amp;g=home&amp;s=articles&amp;src=3SOSWXXA microphone buyers guide].  At the [http://aes.org Audio Engineering Society]'s convention, you can listen to many different microphones.  The next [http://aes.org/events/121 AES Convertion] is in San Francisco in October.

'''One track at a time.'''  Unlike the London Philharmonic which has a hundred musicians, you will probably have only one musician.  Hopefully, that one musician can play lots of instruments, one at a time.  So rather than record all the musical tracks for a scene at one time like the London Phiharmonic, you will record one track with each pass through the scene until you build up a complete musical score.  Each time you record a new track, the musician listens to the previously recorded tracks plus the audio from the movie and adds one more instrument to the mix.

;Side Note
:  If you are a filmmaker with no skill with a musical instrument, try creating a '''humming score'''.  Set up your computer so you can record audio in sync with your movie.  You can use programs like GarageBand, Final Cut Express or Final Cut Pro to record audio in sync with a movie.  iMovie also works but it can record only one track. To create a humming score, you watch your movie and make musical sounds with your mouth... including humming.  If you follow the usual procedures for creating a film score via a multi-track recorder, you will be amazed how good a humming score you can create.  To do this, start by recording a track with the melody.  An alternative is to start by recording a rhythm track instead of a melody.  Then simply watch the movie over and over again, adding more and more tracks as you make music with your mouth.  I know this sounds really dorky but it actually works well for a temp track and a guide for your film composer.

====2. Midi Modules = External Hardware====

External midi sound modules were very popular at one time.  Unfortunately, the sounds produced by these modules (such as the Proteus) were not natural and the external hardware took up a lot of space.  Now e-Mu sells a replacement for the Proteus which is [http://www.emu.com/products/product.asp?category=501&amp;subcategory=168&amp;product=15023 software].

====3. Midi with Software Instruments inside your Computer====

Thanks to the advancement of technology, it is entirely possible to simply create a digital musical score yourself using musical instruments that exist only inside your computer. The cost of this method depends on what instruments you want to have in the music. As and example, GarageBand is free with all new Macintosh computers.  

;Digital vs. Analog vs. MIDI
:Remember that while digital music is very easy to accomplish (using a midi keyboard and a guitar software instrument), if you wanted to have 'real' guitars or good-quality singing in your song, for example, you would have to purchase a USB interface, which would allow you to link up your guitar to the computer through it. You would then require some recording software such as [[Wikipedia:Cubase|Cubase]].  But also realize that another alternative is connecting a '''midi guitar''' to the computer via a '''midi interface''' (not analog) and use a software instrument which has the sound of guitar inside your computer.  You have lots of choices.

If you wanted to mix digital elements in with this, or even create an entirely digital song, you would need a program such as [[Wikipedia:Reason (program)|Reason]] and a [[Wikipedia:Midi Keyboard|Midi Keyboard]].  This method, while much cheaper than the previous, will still cost a fair amount of money - for a copy of ''Reason'', ''Cubase'', a ''USB Interface'' and a ''Midi Keyboard'' you could expect to pay around '''£580/£1097''', Apple computers are costly as well. Like most things, however, a lot of money could be saved by not using things such as ''Logic Pro'' (which is the industry standard). There is no use having brilliant music if your film is terrible, as it is most likely to be after spending your budget.  (Note:  Apple's Logic is designed for musicians... which is great but filmmakers who are not musicians will find it awkward to use.  Robert Purser in Digital Puppet magazine (Winter 2006) found Logic Express (the lit version of Logic) to be extremely poor for anyone who is not an experienced musician with electronic gear.

Fortunately, all [[Wikipedia:Apple_Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computers come with [[Wikipedia:ILife|iLife]] software which has good resources, too, for digital music making and also for video editing.  With [[Wikipedia:GarageBand|GarageBand]] in iLife 06, you can create digital music using the built-in software instruments and your music will be in sync with your movie which you watch on the screen as you create your film score.  One advantage of GarageBand is you do not need a MIDI interface or a MIDI keyboard.  With the feature called &quot;Musical Typing&quot;, you can use the Macintosh computer's keyboard (which is not velocity sensitive) as you play and record the music, one track at a time, and then later go back and adjust the velocity of each note (still in GarageBand). While this seems extremely awkward for musician, computer nerds who are filmmakers will find it rather easy.

Note:  Robert Elliott of Wikiversity's free course in [[v:Filmmaking|film scoring for filmmakers]] recommends getting the optional Jam Pack: Symphony Orchestra for GarageBand from Apple Computer.  The natural musical instruments of the symphony orchestra are great for making musical sound effects which sound like a real film score.  (There are similar packages from other manufacturers such as Mark Of the Unicorn.)

===Film Scoring Theory===

The purpose of adding music to a scene is to create a '''mood'''.  That is the purpose of music in a film -- to create the moods that the director wants the audience to feel. Without the audience realizing it, your job is to get the audience to react to the movie as the director wants.

;Special Note - Music from Speaking Voices
:Every dramatic scene has music in it, long before you add a musical film score.  The actors' spoken words have music in them.  If you do not believe me, try reading a script in a monotone voice.  Gifted actors will have a three octave range in their speaking voices.  Therefore, for many scenes with dialog, you do not need any music, as long as the actors create the proper mood with their speaking voices.

:Look at very old classic movies which have no musical score such as '''Angels with Dirty Faces'''.  When you hear James Cagney and Pat O'Brien speak, their voices are very musical... almost like stage voices - both beautiful and melodic.  Listen to how many octaves their voices range in a single sentence. Then look at more modern motion pictures which have a more natural style of speaking.  With the old classics, they do not need any additional music. But with modern movies with more natural speaking voices, much of the music of the speaking voice is missing... so much of the necessary mood is missing.  The mood can be added only by having a film score.

'''Correcting the Mood''' Also be aware that sometimes, the actors' dialog creates a mood... but it is the '''wrong''' mood.   As an example, an actor might pretend to be happy but, in reality, he is crying inside.  The words of the actors are the opposite of the mood the director wants in the scene.  You must add music (or musical sound effects) to correct this and to create the proper mood.  Your music tells the audience what the real mood is.  Without your music in this scene, the audience can be confused.

=====Music Can Be Just Sounds=====

The most important thing to understand about film scoring is the music can be just sounds that create the mood. That is '''Musical Sound Effects'''.  Music does not need a melody, a rhythm, or anything special.  Since the music's only purpose is to create the proper mood, just one, two, or three notes is all you need most of the time.  Try creating the mood with musical sound effects which has the same impact but a whole lot cheaper.

Try using GarageBand and Apple's Jam Pack: Symphony Orchestra to create moods.  As an example, you can add a '''violin trill''' to a scary scene which give the feeling of danger, doom, and dread.  Just one note played expressively creates all the mood you need.

=====Music Must Follow The Mood=====

The second most important thing to understand about film scoring is the mood in a scene changes from sentence to sentence. When two people are talking and new information is being introduced rapidly, the mood is continually changing.  When the mood changes, the music must change to match the mood.  Songs cannot do this because a song has only one mood.

;Songs = One Continual Mood
:When there is a conversation, you cannot use a song for film score.  Songs have only one mood.  When the mood of the scene changes, a song cannot follow the mood changes.

There are only two times when songs are appropriate for a film score.  If you have an action scene (with no conversation) or a montage scene, the film score will need only one mood for the entire scene.  In this case, a song is ideal.   So if you wish, you can hire a local band or you can use pre-recorded songs... if you can afford it.

====Scoring for Background and Dialog====

There are basically two kinds of music in a scene which has dialog -- '''background''' music and '''narrative''' music.  Background music enhances the mood of the scene.  Background music must be very soft and thin.  It is heard faintly in the background.  Warning: If you write loud music for a scene with people talking, when it comes time to mix all the audio together, someone (usually the director) will turn down the volume of your music and no one will hear it clearly.  So when you write background music, make sure it is very simple (i.e., a single melody which is simple with no counter melodies and no strong rhythm such as drums).  For background music, it must be just a simple melody played by only one or two instruments.

Narrative music is music which tells a story (think &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;).  Therefore, narrative music must be inserted between the dialog of the actors.  Normally, the only way you can do this is to add gaps between the dialog when you edit the scene.

When people are talking, your music must NEVER step on the dialog.  The dialog is the most important part of the movie so when there is dialog, the music must be in the background.  So if you want to add music which helps tell the story, there must be gaps between the dialog for you to add the narrative music. These gaps are usually only one to three seconds long.  Once they are filled with music or musical sound effects, the audience does not notice the pause in the actor's dialog.  It all seems natural.  The music seems to become part of the conversation.

Therefore, it is best if the editor and the composer are the same person.  With personal movies, this is not a problem.  The same computer which edits the movie can help create the film score for the movie just by using different software.

===Practical Experience in Film Scoring===

Currently, there is no easy way to practice film scoring.  You cannot go to a website and download a scenes which needs a film score so you can practice film scoring.

Today, many motion pictures are edited with Final Cut Pro or other editing software for personal computers.  It would take only ten minutes to render a scene without music for people around the world to practice creating film scores with computer programs such as GarageBand.

This has never been done, even though it would be terrific publicity for a motion picture.  There could be a dozen scenes on a DVD-Video disk.  When budding film composers have completed a film score, they can post it on a website for other people to listen to and compare with all the other film scores for the same scene.

====Creating your Demo Reel====

If you want a job in film scoring, you need examples of your film scores to show film producers just how good you are.  That makes perfect sense.  How can you get hired doing film scoring of movies if you do not have any great scenes for your demo reel?

Currently, there are no websites where you can order scenes from television dramas and motion pictures that are all ready for you to score and then to put on a DVD-Video disk for your demo reel. There should be dozens of film distributors who offer this service.  And since you are promoting their motion picture, they should offer this service for free.

====Film Editing vs. Film Scoring====

The editing of a scene and the scoring of the scene should go hand in hand.  If you are curious about doing film scoring '''and''' film editing together, [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] also sells a disk called '''&quot;Blindman's Bluff&quot;''' which shows how two scenes where edited and scored using just musical sound effects.  The second scene on this disk is extremely short.  By adding gaps between the dialog and adding narrative music, the entire mood of the scene changes and the scene becomes twice as long, yet all the dialog remains the same.

===Local Bands===

This is more of a sub-method than anything else. If you have no real musical talent, many local bands would be more than happy to write, record and perform music for your film in exchange for credit and a small amount of money.

===Public Domain===
Finally, it is possible to, like [[Wikipedia:Ed Wood, Jr|Ed Wood]], use music that is in the [[Wikipedia:public domain|public domain]]. This includes music from films or songs that were copyrighted before 1923. [http://www.pdinfo.com/ This site] is a good read.

==Spotting Session==

When you are hired as a composer on a motion picture, you will probably sit down with the director and/or the producer who will tell you what emotions they want in the movie.  This is called the '''spotting session'''.  Never rely on what the actors say in the movie.  The underlying mood is usually something different from the dialog.  Only the director can tell you what moods you need to create.

The biggest problem that a composer has with the director (and vise versa) is the lack of communication.  You need to ask the director what mood the audience is supposed to feel.  Don't be surprised if you get a blank stare and the comment, &quot;Isn't it obvious?&quot;.  Directors have been working with their vision for the movie for the last three to five years.  They assume that you automatically understand. Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Take a few minutes to find out EXACTLY what the director wants the audience to feel for each piece of dialog in the movie.

==Usage of music==
Okay, so you have your materials, your band is waiting and ready, your fingers are poised on your midi keyboard. What now? Well, before putting music into a scene it is important to think about what you want the audience to feel. Do you want them to be scared? Excited? If, for example, you have an action scene in which a juggernaut is speeding down a highway towards a roadblock, you would not usually wish to accompany this with soft classical music. A good idea when planning the inclusion of music into a movie is:
*Watch the movie all the way through.
*Stop the movie when you see parts that require music.
*Note down the number of the starting frame.
*Plan how long you would like the music to last.
*Note down the number of the frame where the music stops.
*Plan what kind of music you would like and how you would like it to behave - should it be low and constant, swirling in and out of earshot? Should it be loud, aggressive, constant? 
*If you get stuck on how the music should behave, go rent out some critically acclaimed movies and study how music is used.

==Introduction==
A common misconception is that the lipid bilayer is just that, a lipid bilayer. This is not true. The plasma membrane is filled with a group of proteins called membrane proteins. Some of these membrane proteins show only contact surfaces with either the inside or the outside of the cell and some of them stick out at both ends. Among other functions these proteins serve to anchor the cells cytoskeletal components to neighboring cells, can actively transport various molecules over the plasma membrane, receive signal molecules on the outside and relay the signal inside the cell. They form the connection with the outside of the cell. As is in the plasma membrane this feature is also documented in the membranes of cell organelles such as the endoplastic reticulum or the Golgi-complex.

==Protein requirements for membrane incorporation== 
What distinguishes membrane proteins from other proteins? All proteins are formed from 20 aminoacids with varying side chains (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, negatively/ positively charged). When the RNA transcript is translated into the primary structure, the side chains of the string of aminoacids form non-covalent bonds with other side chains in the molecule thus reaching its 3D structure and biological activity. Now, the inside of the cell, including the compartments in the organelles, are water based. For proteins to be active in this area they must be readily soluble and thus hydrophilic on the outside. So the outer side chains of the 3D structure must be hydrophilic. The same holds true for membrane proteins. They will function in a area where part of the protein must reside in hydrophobic conditions, namely the inside of the lipid bilayer. Thus, part of membrane proteins have hydrophobic residues sticking out on the surface to facilitate incorporation in lipid bilayers.

==Examples of membrane proteins==

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Proteins and channels|&lt;&lt; Proteins and channels]] | Hydrophobicity | [[../Self-assembly|Self-assembly &gt;&gt;]]

Hydrophobicity literally means &quot;fear of water&quot;. The opposite of this is hydrophilicity which means &quot;love of water&quot;. These two terms denote the properties of molecules or parts of molecules to bond with water (hydrophilicity) or reject water (hydrophobicity). This effect is seen when one puts a drop of oil on water. The oil (hydrophobic) remains on the surface and sticks together in stead of mixing with the water (hydrophilic). 
In cells these properties are essential. Most of the cell is hydrophilic but there are hydrophobic borders (membranes) which compartmentalize the cell into different spaces and hereby separate reactions. Of course there must be some sort of interaction between compartments and this is facilitated by membrane proteins (look here to read up on membrane proteins).

These membranes are formed with molecules with hydrophobic properties, such as phospholipids, cholesterol and membrane proteins. The phospholipids and membrane proteins also have hydrophilic properties which stand in contact with the cytosol or the extracellular matrix.

Self-assembly occurs due to the thermodynamics, if the phospholipids are in a water (or other polar solution) the tails will want to be 'away' from the solution. The could all go to the top (like oil on water), or they could have the tails point toward each other. With the tails pointing toward each other, this could form 2 different formations.

First would be a micelle which would like like a ball with the phospholipid heads on the outside and the tails pointing together like this or in the form of a lipid bilayer:

My name is Matthew Butler. I'm 23 years old, and have been employed as technical support for the past 3 1/2 years. In my spare time I am involved in various projects, including learning [[Esperanto]] and using [http://www.blender3d.org Blender 3D]. Currently, I plan on writing up some tutorials for [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] to contribute to an excellent documentation effort.

Question or comments, feel free to e-mail me (from your toolbox on the left).

[[Image:CDC_greenbean.jpg|right|green beans]]
The '''green bean''', also known as the '''snap bean''' or '''string bean''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Bean|bean]] that is eaten with the pod. Green beans are normally eaten fresh or nearly fresh, not dried.

These beans are often called string beans because a fibrous string runs along the seam of the bean. The string becomes noticeable as the ends are snapped off. The snapping noise is the source of these beans' other name.

Fresh green beans are available all year, with a peak season of May to October. Green beans are also available canned and frozen.

==Selection and Storage==
It is best to hand-pick green beans from a market that sells them loose. To ensure uniform cooking time, select beans of similar size and shape. Choose slender beans (no thicker than a pencil) that are crisp and free of blemishes. The beans should be a bright green color. Do not purchase beans that are stiff or have the seeds visible through the pod because those beans will be tough.

Keep green beans dry in a perforated plastic bag in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for 4 to 5 days.

==Preparation==
Wash beans thoroughly in clear, cool water. Beans can be cooked whole, cut crosswise or diagonally, or [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]]-cut (i.e., cut along the length of the bean). If you want sweet tasting, crisp fresh beans, cut them as little as possible. Cut older, more mature beans in the French style (i.e., lengthwise).

[[Cookbook:Stir-frying|Stir-frying]] is one of the easiest ways to prepare green beans. This method maintains more nutrients than other cooking methods. Whatever cooking method you choose, remember to cook beans as little as possible, using the least amount of water possible.

[[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiling]], [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]], and [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaving]] are other common methods for preparing green beans. When boiling, beans may release some nutrients into the water, so try to re-use the bean water to regain some of the nutrients lost. For example, you can use the water to boil [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creating it==
I volunteer to create this tutorial (I'll start work on it when home and have blender to work with directly). However, I think subsurf edge creases, as detailed in [http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Weighted_Creases_for_subsurfs.358.0.html Weighted Creases for Subsurfs], should be moved to an intermediate tutorial. But I can create this one as well if so desired. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 02:18, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

: Great!  Thanx for your help!  I wouldn't consider subsurf edges to be intermediate.  Since you're planning on helping out a bit around here, let me sort of explain what my vision is for the book.

: Beginner Tutorials focus on learning how to use the tools, hotkeys available in the blender.  this is mostly technical documentation 

: Intermediate Tutorials focus on the artistic use of the tools learned in the beginner tutorials.  Some people say that you can't teach somebody to be an artist.  I beg to differ.  The ability to become an artist is in the desire.  Artistic modeling, artistic lighting, artistic scene creation, artistic animation.

: Advanced Tutorials focus on the advanced functions of the Blender, such as python scripting for advanced animation, advanced modeling, etc.

: If you can see my vision here (and if you can agree with it), then you'll see why I want subsurf edges to be in the Beginner Tutorials.  Obviously a lot more tutorials will need to be created in the Beginning Tutorials part to make it comprehensive.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 21:56, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

: I didn't really see much effect from the bit about the subsurf creases . . . I'm not sure what was supposed to happen there. If this is an important tool, perhaps it would be useful to put in a tutorial page specifically dedicated to it? -- Glasnerven
== Great Work ==

I haven't been around for awhile, but I popped my head in today and saw this.  I want to congratulate those have have been working on this tutorial.  It looks great so far.  Keep it up!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 14:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I agree. Nice tutorial.

==Suggestions==
The article says &quot;On our Sharp Falloff mountain, the second one we did, select the first two edges on the right (starting from the point down).&quot; Maybe it's just me, but I find this sentence confusing and I don't know which edges it means. I suggest it be accompanied by a screenshot. I understand the page isn't finished, I just thought I'd suggest that. [[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 19:57, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

:I Agree. Some clearification would be appreciated. [[User:217.212.250.6|217.212.250.6]] 16:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

::Make sure you are in side view '''NUM3''' and then its easy to see which two edges, i.e. starting from the top point of the mountain select the first two edges on the right side (in side view there is only a &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; side of the mountain). --[[User:203.144.160.243|203.144.160.243]] 12:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

I'm trying to change the radius of influence but NOTHING seems to be working. This is very frustrating because I went through this part of Noob-to-Pro many versions back and this part went smoothly. I'm pressing Gkey to grab the vertex, then rolling the mouse-wheel, pressing pgUP, pgDN, nothing is working. Yes, proportional edit falloff is on with 'smooth' selected. I've tried what the other note says also (ALT + NUM+ pgUP/pgDN) and that doesn't work. Could I get some clarification here?   ***I fixed the problem by restarting blender... ***

:I had the exact same problem and restarting blender fixed it.  I'll write this into the main article.  [[User:Khono|Khono]] ([[User talk:Khono|talk]]) 21:15, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

In the 'First mountain' section I think the ''radius of influence'' acts as a sphere rather than a circle, which if correct would be worth mentioning as sometimes vertices aren't affected as you would expect within the radius of influense from the 2D views, especially when playing around with a larger radii. This is, therefore, due to them not actually being within the 3D 'sphere of influence'.

I cannot make the radius of selection thing do a thing.  Not with ALT or whatever.  Not after a restart either.  Nothing, nada zilch.

==Miscellaneous Comments==

The 'Shaping the World' section doesn't seem very clear, i.e. we don't seem to be trying to acheive anything useful on the model. Perhaps a picture would help here. Maybe as an explanation the author could say he was aiming to make the moutains look a little more 'real' by making the vertices/edges less uniform through rotating them.

Great tutorials in general, very much appreciated by me &amp; I'm sure many others.
[user: mr_spoon, entry: 2/Jan/06].

I am enjoying this tutorial but would have appreciated something more on what to do with our hat wearing figure and the mountians. Such as how do we place it in the &quot;mountain range&quot;. I don't want to edit anything as I am SUCH a n00b right now (ie: went and bought a multi-button mouse for my mac last night!).

I would like to second that last point..(I am a complete Noob too). It woul be great if there were instructions on how we could insert our man/hat inot the mountain scence :)

:I took the first line to be a segway only (kind of a joke), not meaning that we would actually insert the man into the scene. --[[User:203.144.160.243|203.144.160.243]] 12:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

== 8-Bit? ==

Actually, anything 3D would be to powerful for an 8-Bit console. Even something as chunky as that. - A Guest that'll probably never post again

== Smoothing things out ==

&quot;On our Sharp Falloff mountain, the second one we did, select the first two edges on the right (starting from the point down).&quot; Which point down? Top? This is a bit confusing. 

Also, it seemed impossible to drag to get a value of 1 for the crease, no matter how far I zoomed out I couldn't get 1. Typing 1 worked fine though. '''Correction''' -- when using the menu that comes up when you hit space, the location of the mouse pointer is wherever the last menu choice is. So if you choose ''space-&gt;edit-edges-&gt;crease subsurf'' the mouse might be far away from the relevant edge. This will cause the effect of the mouse motion to be less pronounced, and more fine-grained, and it may not be able to get to the value of 1. 

Great tutorial in general! Thanks for all the hard work.

It took me a while to get the radius to change too.  What I didn't find clear from the page was the exact order of events:
# Select vertex/vertices
# Specify operation (e.g. G)
# THEN use the mouse wheel to adjust the radius of influence
# Make the operation (move the mouse, specify axis and amount, etc.)

== Naturalness? ==

At the very beginning of this section, you say &quot;select the second vertex from the top in the center&quot;. Could you just explain a little more which vertex you mean exactly and on what mountain (the one with the smooth falloff, or the one with the sharp falloff) this vertex exists? I think a picture for the vertex that should be selected may be a great help.

== About newbie notes ==

I'm starting to think that &quot;newbie notes&quot; should instead be called &quot;pro notes&quot;. The tutorial is meant for newbies anyway, so why call advanced tips &quot;newbie notes&quot;? Some &quot;newbie notes&quot; I've encountered also tend to confuse newbies rather than enlighten.

Considering the books &quot;Noob to Pro&quot; aspect, I think Pro notes would be better for any kind of note that adds insight to a concept, or presents another way to do something.  A few other tutorials I notice use the &quot;Noob Notes&quot; but I think the title best fits a note that highlights a common mistake made by newbies. --[[User:Vi3gamehkr|Vi3gamehkr]] ([[User talk:Vi3gamehkr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vi3gamehkr|contribs]]) 20:15, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== Append/Link ==

Some more clarification on appending/linking to the new project would be nice. I can't seem to get it to happen.

I agree, I've followed the steps multple times and nothing seems to happen when I click load library.

==Smoothing things out==

''Noob Henry: What I do is take the mountain, and then set a subsurf level of two. Then, I hit the 'set smooth' button, and use the individual vertices to make it look authentic.''
==Shaping the world==

[Noobie Roy says: Huh??? I don't understand what I'm supposed to be achieving here. What is supposed to happen when I rotate? As far as I can see, nothing at all happens. Can you maybe show us a before and after screenshot? Or maybe explain in more detail? Thanks!]
[Noobie Sean says: Roy, you made the mountains by using proportional editing with grab/move.  Moving one vertex moved its neighbours, within the proportional circle.  Rotate and scale also use proportional editing to rotate or scale about the selected vertex much like the grab/move operation.]

[Noobie Larry says: I tried rotating just that one point but nothing happens]

[One thing to watch out for is the range of affected vertices.  If the range is too small, then rotating will affect just the selected vertex.  If the range is too large, it will rotate everything together.  You can adjust the range by scrolling.]

[Dusty says: To answer Noobie Roy, the reason nothing may happen, is that the circle of influence may be only including the vertex that you have selected when you first hit R. After pressing R scroll the mouse wheel to increase the circle include the other vertices next to the one selected, then type 90 and you'll see the effect. Scroll the mouse wheel further more (to include more vertices) and you see the effect spread out.]

[Another newbie says: two things to keep in mind here: really weird things will happen here if you set the rotation/scaling pivot to &quot;3d cursor&quot; at this point (I assume the intention is to rotate around the single selected vertex, so the other pivot modes will all work, I think), and (as Dusty says) you must increase the effective radius quite a bit (use the scrollwheel after pressing '''RKEY''', just keep going until you are affecting half the plane to see what's going on). What makes it a bit confusing is that some vertices seem to be inside the initial affected region (with the radius you used to create the previous mountain) in the two-dimensional side view, but that affected region is actually a three-dimensional '''sphere''', so you cannot tell from just that side view what vertices are inside the affected region. I am not explaining this very well, but it helps to have more than one 3d view open so you can see that every vertex is outside the affected radius in at least one view (try splitting the main view into 4 equally sized parts so you can have a top, front, side and &quot;free&quot; 3d view open all at the same time).[Yet another noob says: if you are following the tutorial exactly, your proportional edit falloff will be at sharp at this point. This makes the effect of the rotation hard to see unless your circle of influence is quite large.]

[Dbproguy mentions: From what I am seeing, this effects the texture of the mountain, so it's not so plain.]

[hendric: Newbie, but I think I got the tutorial demonstrating what it should be doing.  I added screenshots of my full workspace and changed the wording to explain a little better. I am wiki-illiterate so any changes to prettify it are welcome.]

:First, thanks for working hard to create this tutorial, I really appreciate it, but I had some difficulty following this section. When we're told to rotate -90 degrees. I think it would be helpful to know which axis you're talking about, I assumed (based on the text) it was the side view (thus around the x axis), however the screenshots look more like it was rotated around the y axis. Also, Did the height of the mountains change somewhere? I cannot seem to get my view to look like yours no matter what combination of + or - 90 degrees around the x or y axis I try [[User:Lxxxv|Lxxxv]] ([[User talk:Lxxxv|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lxxxv|contribs]]) 22:08, 16 September 2011 (UTC)

== 14 Adding the Hat Guy, for noobies reading the book. ==

I followed the previous tutorials on modeling the simple person and his hat and his armature. This file is saved separately as suggested by this tutorial and commenced work on a new one. Later, when I bring in the hat guy into another layer, your tutorial needs to mention:
a. The person 'cube' as he's called,
b. The hat, called 'circle'
c. His armature,
all three have to be imported, and the parent-child relationship between the hat and the head need to be re-defined.
Then, the parent-armature relation has to be defined too. However, since the simple person is drawn at rest position
and the armature is in a pose, the import brings the two cutting-through each other. Thus, a parent&gt;armature creates
ugly and bizarre appendages to the limbs and other areas.

The section of appending the hat-person has to be expanded.
You need to mention a pre-append stage, where the armature has to be kept at the rest position before appending.
Then, a post-append stage mentions the simple step of how to move the three components into a new layer,
and then how to re-establish the parent&gt;child and parent&gt;armature relationships.
Finally, switch on the view on both layers, scale and shift the person to correctly stand on the terrain,
and add salt and pepper to taste.

niyam bhushan

==Naturalness - Proportional Editing==
I noticed in a &quot;noob note,&quot; a comment about proportional editing settings.  First off, if it is more efficient (doesn't create more vertices/mesh) why don't we just change that section of the tutorial to use it.  Secondly, where are the &quot;proportional editing settings?&quot; --[[User:Vi3gamehkr|Vi3gamehkr]] ([[User talk:Vi3gamehkr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vi3gamehkr|contribs]]) 20:20, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== The Append Button ==

Where can you find the 'append' button. At the last bit you press Shift + F1, but i see no 'append'. I do see the 'link' button. A picture would be nice :)

== Keys ==

Do you seriously have to format the alphabet hotkeys like *KEY? Up until this tutorial, if you wanted to scale, it would have been just &quot;S&quot; not &quot;SKEY&quot;. I think it's really annoying.</text>

'''Baba ganoush''' is a common Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dip with a creamy, somewhat smoky flavor. It is usually eaten with [[Cookbook:Pita|pita bread]] although [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]] or a crispy [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] also work well.

==Ingredients==
* 1 medium-large [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]], any variety, 1 to 1&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] raw [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]
* Juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] 
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]] or [[Cookbook:Cayenne_pepper|cayenne pepper]], as a garnish

==Procedure==
# Roast the eggplant. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the flesh should be fully cooked and the skin should be burned and falling off easily. An effective method is to prick the eggplant and place it a few inches under a broiler, turning it as the exposed skin blackens, about every 3-4 minutes. Place a pan underneath to catch the juices, and discard them. 
# Scrape off the eggplant skin. It's all right if you miss a few burned bits.
# Finely chop or blend the eggplant flesh with the rest of the ingredients. The consistency should be smooth. Reserve a bit of the olive oil, and drizzle that over the top. Sprinkle with some paprika or cayenne.(I use lemon instead of lime juice.)

[[Image:Asimina triloba red fern farm.jpg|thumb|right|pawpaw]]
[[Image:ARS_pawpaw.jpg|thumb|right|pawpaws]]
The '''pawpaw''' (also '''paw paw''' or '''paw-paw''') is a fruit that is 3 to 5 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long. The pawpaw tree, ''Asimina triloba'', grows in the non-coastal parts of the southeastern quarter of the USA.
The pawpaw is related to the [[Cookbook:Cherimoya|cherimoya]] and soursop, not the [[Cookbook:Papaya|papaya]]. Pawpaws taste and feel somewhat like [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], and can generally be used in recipes calling for bananas.

Pawpaws are nutritious fruits, better in most ways than bananas. Pawpaws have more protein, fewer carbohydrates, more fat, and about the same amount of potassium. The fat is better, being more monounsaturated and less saturated. Pawpaws have much more iron, zinc, phosphorus, calcium, copper, and manganese. Unlike most plant foods, pawpaws contain all of the essential amino acids.

Fresh pawpaw is very perishable, lasting no more than 3 days at room temperature. It will keep for about three weeks at a temperature of 4°C to 7°C (40°F to 45°F).[http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/pawpaw.html]

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Pawpaw|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|1|1}}

Pawpaws ripen during a four week period in August/September, after which they are harvested, making them available from late August to October.

Living communally is beautiful.  For tens of thousands of  years humans lived together in tribes.  These tribes were necessary for the survival of fragile humans in a hostile environment.  With the environment conquered

Nowadays the standard unit is the family, or just the couple or many of us even live alone.  The sixties and seventies saw the first wave of experimental communes.  Many of these failed.  There were many reasons for these failures Power games, politics, hierarchies and bad ownership structures.  Yet the alternative of each of us living alone and alienated is just as unsatisfactory, 

Living communally is more efficient and puts less strain on our Planet's sorely stressed resources.  An appliance can be shared among many people - do 20 people really need 20 dishwashers.  We can share cooking, cleaning, childcare and can create together.  Living with others accelerates our growth as other people present a mirror

This manifesto outlines a vision for future communes and

It is time to draw lessons from the failures of past communal living experiments and try again.  Getting it right could make the difference.

==Communal Living.==

I recently stayed in a Squat where close to 30 people were living communally.  The squat was semi-official - the owner knows they are there and has given them permission to stay for a couple of years. This quasi-legitimacy has encouraged those living there to put a lot of energy and juice into the place.  This living, sharing and creating together was really beautiful - it reminded me a lot of Rajneeshpuram and living there. There is something so beautiful about living together.  It is also really practical as sharing appliances, cooking, cleaning and childcare is a lot more efiicient than each having our own.

In the end I could not stay, there was not enough space and there were some politics so it did not work out.  It did however make me think of communal living and wonder if it is not time maybe to try again.  All Sannyasins carry scars from the failure of past communes especially from the huge wound that was the implosion of Rajneeshpuram.  This makes many of us reluctant to try again.  However if we learn from the mistakes of the past it is possible to create a commune which can work and survive.

So what are the mistakes of past communities and how do we avoid them?

==Governance==

Its tempting to think we are evolved enough to do everything by consensus and there is no need for the rigidity of formal structures.  This just abandons power to the alpha males and females of the group and means the quieter voices don't get a fair say.  Structure does not have to mean hierarchy.  Of course democracy creates politics but until we are all in perfect harmony it is the best system possible.

Governance is a *hard problem* as proved by the struggle so many countries, communities and societies have with it.  Democracy has however evolved and there are some good new styles of democracy which would work well in a community.

One such style is Direct democracy which comprises a form of democracy and theory of civics wherein all citizens can directly participate in the decision-making process.  Direct democracy in its traditional form is rule by the people through referenda. The people are given the right to pass laws, veto laws and withdraw support from a representative (if the system has representatives) at any time.

The main objection to Direct Democracy is that deciding all or most matters of public importance by direct referendum is slow and expensive, and can result in public apathy and voter fatigue.  The solution to this is Delegated Democracy.

In delegated democracy all people have a vote on all issues as with direct democracy but they can delegate their vote in any area to any other person.  If I vote on a topic my vote is counted if I do not bother to vote and I have delegated votes in that field to someone else then my vote is added to their tally.

Some examples:

- Nina is a great cook and nutritionist and I trust her with regards to running the kitchen and feeding us.  Therefore I delegate my votes on food buying and cooking to Nina thus if there is ever the need to vote in this area Nina will cast my vote on my behalf.
- My friend Naoise knows a lot about money and is trustworthy and I think has a good balance between investing and being too cautions. I would delegate my investment votes to him in most instances (although it is an areas which interests me a bit so at certain jey moments I may well vote myself). 
- If friends decided to delegate their votes to me on certain areas where I feel confident (community, governance :-), education) I would be honored to vote on their behalf.

Remember you can alwats still vote yourself and you can always move your vote from one person if you feel they no longer adequately rtepresent you.

==Ownership==

After watching many communes go down the tubes and seeing past effort go to waste many are understandably reluctant to commit energy and money to something without a clear idea of what might happen to it.  This is what makes communal ownership so important. 

If the commune is incorporated as a Limited Liability Partnership all those involved in it can legally have a share of it.  That way if one wishes to leave one can sell out or if it does not work and needs to be wound up any assets will be shared out among those who contributed

== Project information ==

For background information on the start of this wikibook, read this [http://kairosnews.org/node/4418 first] blog or the [http://kairosnews.org/node/4435 second] one by MattBarton.exe on [http://www.kairosnews.org Kairosnews].  As best as I can see it, it started as a class collaboration. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 18:25, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

We are also discussing this project at the computers and writing forum at mattbarton.net.

== Project Discussion ==

~I am thinking a handbook would be the place to start. After rifling through about a dozen of them, I really can't stand the thought of students paying 50 and now sixty bucks for these things. It only looks like it's going to get worse...

And I agree with Matt that it will be easier to put the theory aside for now and just work with the mechanics.

After some sifting then, I found a couple that had interesting ways of organizing or presenting
*The Everyday Writer by Andrea Lundsford
*Prentice Hall Reference Guide by Muriel Harris
*{other that are in my office, will post soon}

These seem to be the super-sized handbooks (they more resemble textbooks)&amp;mdash; maybe more than we need to cover, but maybe not

Boy, wouldn't it be great to have them involved in our project? Which reminds me, we do need to get a woman's voice in all of this, the sooner the better.

== Front-page image ==

New image seems to be taking. No complaints as of yet. - Luke

I think I speak for the class when I say that ''we want the front-page title image to stay.''  Some of the comments people in class have made are:

'''-It is a great introduction for the book.
-It sets the book apart from others.
-Makes the book more visually appealing.
-It defines the goal of our book.'''

I am putting the image back up.

:I personally, despite liking the Wikibook, thought the cover was cheesy. For a better cover, perhaps you could scan a sheet of paper, switch to Courier New, and type out the title?--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 00:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

Currently, the following two images are being used. The light one is used in the print version of the book, the brown one on the front page. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:57, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

----
I propose a different image: [http://i36.tinypic.com/hrn254.jpg Link]
I made it using Inkscape, so there's an SVG source to it, and the pen is a public domain image from [http://openclipart.org/ openclipart.org]. If anyone's in favour of using it, I'll put up an SVG version in the public domain. --[[User:Rotw|Rotw]] ([[User talk:Rotw|talk]]) 17:21, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

== Suggestions ==
~
I've noticed that this project doesn't seem to be paying attention to the recent moves I've seen in composition away from writing prose that will earn an A in History 201 to really interrogating how we compose--always within a rhetorical context for an envisioned audience and not most effectively in the five-paragraph theme.  Why not make a move toward looking at multimodal composing from a rhetorical standpoint at least in addition to your current presentation?
~

== Discussion about the body who created this project ==

This is a really interesting class project. I'm wondering, what kinds of follow-on writing or discussions are you all having as a class? [[User:Electricbody|Electricbody]] 05:05, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

We've been discussing it in class quite regularly. Many of these discussions have been quite interesting and insightful, ranging from design issues to matters of tone and clarity. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:27, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:This is absolutely fantastic. Thanks for all your work, and organizing it. This stage of the work may be even more interesting. How can your next class improve the work to an even higher level? Improving something that is already pretty good is more challenging than bringing something up to decent. Can a class, working together create a book better than any of the expensive textbooks out there? So far the results look great, without reading through the whole thing. Keep up the great work. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] 16:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

--I sure hope so, Taxman. Only time will tell! ----[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 19:37, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

== Critiques ==
Bravo. I liked this Wikibook. I read a few pages and skimmed through. I instantly saw it had something more intelligent to say than other books on writing. --[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 00:03, 3 August 2006 (UTC) (AKA: Kamisama@Writingforums.com)

== Page numbers on PDF version ==

The PDF version does not have page numbers. It is not part of the writing process, but still would be nice to have, if possible, thanks. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 14:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== PDF version seems corrupt ==
Repeated attempts to download the pdf gives only a 0 bytes file. This is the only book which I tried which did that.--[[User:Motorhead|Motorhead]] 04:07, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

== AP English ==

this is designed for first year college but would it work for me in AP English? [[User:Ugluk|Ugluk]] 03:07, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

I don't see why not. Might work even better in that context. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 16:51, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

== Another module to merge here ==
It seems that [[Media book:Writing a Press Release]] might be a good fit here. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== PDF version seems corrupt ==
This book's PDF version doesn't work. It's a good book, so please do something... do anything![[NOt registered]]
15:51, 1 July 2007 (What is UTC?!)

I downloaded it recently, and it seemed to work fine. What's the problem, exactly?--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 22:05, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== New Parts of book ==

I've added some new sections that will hopefully be completed soon. The teacher's handbook is meant to explain how to use this wikitext with students as well as general concerns about teaching writing. The Writing for the Web section should talk about blogs, discussion boards, and wikis, as well as more general advice about making web pages. It won't be specifics about how to use Frontpage or HTML code; just an introduction to these environments.--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 21:08, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

== SUGGESTION ==

I have been teaching composition and rhetoric at the college level for 15 years.  I am sick of the expensive and, usually, old school approach of many writing/reader textbooks. So, I am interested in using this wikibook next fall for my two english composition courses.  However, I use the writing as process with a portfolio, and I am trying to move to the e-portfolio to cut down on paper.  I noticed, however, that you don't have a section on portfolios.  Can you add a section on the portfolio in composition, but also as a learning assessment tool for any course?  I would love to help put it together.
Thanks,
Rebecca

== Editing and revising ==

There has been a shift in the definition of the contrast between '''editing''' and '''revising'''. Quoting the current introductory chater[[Rhetoric_and_Composition/The_Stages_of_the_Writing_Process|[1]]]:

:You can't edit what hasn't been written. That's why editing comes after drafting. For our purposes, it's important to distinguish between deciding what needs to be improved and actually making the changes. We'll call the decision-making process &quot;editing&quot; and making the changes the &quot;revising&quot; process.

As I understand it, here, ''editing'' refers to the process of collecting issues while revising to the process of fixing issues.

The current setup of later chapters has a different concept, one, in which ''editing'' refers to making stylistic changes within the scope of single paragraph, including the choice of words and sentence structure, while ''revising'' refers to making larger changes such as changing the order of chapters, their division or focus.

Yet another [[Rhetoric_and_Composition/Revising|section]] of the book has three level model:
* '''revising''' - audience, organization, content, support, concision
* '''editing''' - usage, word choice, transitions, mechanics
* '''proofreading''' - spelling, punctuation, typography

Whatever the preferred concept, the parts will need to be aligned at some point.

== Merger of Writer's Handbook ==

From what I understand and can see in the page history, Writer's Handbook has been merged around December 2005 into this book, after this book has been written. It seems like an unfortunate decision to me, but what do I know.

The focus of Rhetoric and Composition was on the college writer, as suggested by the title, while the focus of Writer's Handbook was on anyone who writes for living, isn't it? There are overlaps between Rhetoric and Composition and Writer's Handbook. While the content of Rhetoric and Composition is outlined in detail on the front page, the Writer's Handbook, containing valuable material, is mentioned only as a single item.

I find it hard to imagine that someone would have the skill and time here to really merge and integrate the two materials together, instead of just concatenating them, one next to the other.

I don't know whether I should propose to divorce the two books again. In any case, even without the divorce, these two books are best viewed as separate ones. What I can imagine is that instead of the concatenation, the books can be continually enriched from one another, as if they were two forks of a past project, but each keeping its own structure.

Admittedly, though, Writer's Handbook has the coverage of mechanics, including grammar, punctuation, comma splice and the like, which Rhetoric and Composition does not have. So they indeed seem kind of complementary.

Well, said enough. I wonder what other views there are

--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:05, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

: Looking again at [[Rhetoric and Composition/Detailed TOC]], the ''Writer's Handbook'' could be renamed to ''Grammar and Mechanics'', and given the space on the front page that it deserves. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:13, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

: As regards the proposed renaming, given ''mechanics'' refers to spelling and punctuation, we can safe the reader one new word to learn and name it ''Grammar, Spelling and Punctuation'', or ''Conventions'', as it is called somewhere, although I do not rememer where.

: This renaming would encourage a moving of the section on Citations and the section on Giving Feedback from the Writer's Handbook to the Rhetoric and Composition proper. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:32, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

==Renaming of &quot;Writer's Handbook&quot;==
I have renamed the &quot;Writer's Handbook&quot; part to &quot;Grammar and Mechanics&quot;, to let the title tell more about its contents. From what I understand, &quot;Writer's Handbook&quot; was the title of the part when it was a separate book, before it was merged into Rhetoric and Composition. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:11, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

Position Paper


A Woman’s Place
July 11, 2011
	Is Facebook and similar web sites the best approach to meet someone? I have wrote and commented on the first article issued in The New Yorker called” Looking for Someone “on computer correspondence leading to social interaction at parties and possibly dating. It is interesting to know how many people access Facebook and for what reasons. There is also E-Harmony and Match.com for singles to chat and possibly lead to dating. [How does this sentence relate to the rest of the paragraph?]
	Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) met Sheryl Sandberg (Google) through social networking and e-mailing each other started a relationship similar to dating. Their relationship developed into business relationship and Sandberg resigned from Google to join Facebook.Eric Schmidt CEO of Google declined Sandberg’s request to promote to Chief Operating Officer stating ,at the current time it would only complicate matters, however Zuckerberg offered the same position to Sandberg and she accepted.
	Although this relationship is not personal, it became a very successful business relationship.”Since Sandberg joined Facebook and made it into business revenue has increased in advertising, employees increased from one-hundred and thirty to twenty-five hundred employees and Facebook subscribers seventy million to seven hundred million in the last three years.
	Sandberg’s approach with Zuckerberg and with the employees of Facebook was respectful and always opens for debate. Sandberg asked Zuckerberg questions like those that “What do you believe,” and “What do you care about?” and “What’s the mission?” therefore with more time to pass Zuckerberg stated, “There are people who are good managers and can manage a huge organization. There also are some people who are analytic and focused on strategy however not usually both.Sandberg stated,”Facebook is a company driven by instinct and human relationships.”
	Sandberg’s former colleagues thought it was an insult with her departure and she should have handled it differently. When Sandberg started with Facebook, she received many compliments from her new colleagues. Chris Cox (president of product for Facebook) complimented Sandberg taking the initiative and introducing herself to many employees. They would clearly understand that Sandberg would take the time to listen to their individual input and the value each employee’s opinion. .Zuckerberg says, “Sandberg will handle advertising, hiring &amp;firing management and deal with all the Political issues that I prefer not to do.Facebook is utilized for various reasons for example like this business relationship and the different ways that it has become more successful especially with Sandberg onboard. I interviewed some individuals for their experiences with Facebook and some people will agree that it is more for convenience of correspondence when other family members are out of state. Others have related that quotes and comments inspire them and motivate them daily.
	E-Harmony’s founder Dr Neil Clark Warren psychologist started a simple 4-step process for singles that are compatible for one another. The first questionnaire is based on attitudes, beliefs, personality and preferences. The analysis is scientific 29-dimension profile. In addition, 5% of marriages in the U.S. are started from E-Harmony.Match.com is also for singles and this site starts with pictures of singles in your zip-code area. Dr Helen Fisher biological anthropologist conducted a study based on attitudes and behaviors of 5200 singles 21 to65.72% singles would live with someone without being married and 54% of the men fell in love at first sight and 44% women reported they fell in love at first sight.55% men and women remain in long term relationships longer than 2 years.35% started with a one night stand and 49% fell in love after being friends in the beginning of the relationship.
	There have been beautiful heart-warming stories shared with me, many people have found compatible partners and even married. Some individuals have reconnected with others they went to middle school and high school. It has been another form of modern communication. In the past, we had the telephone and that was before cell phones however, majority of our population would not leave home without their cell phones. People actually spent time socializing over meals and family members’ conversed during dinner. Parents were able to interact with children and problem solves their current situations. Family members shared more intimacy and seemed to have more support for one another. “The Way We Never Were, “by Stephanie Koonz states the 1950’s era was in fact for example “Leave it to Beaver.”In this book, there are various examples of family structure, values, beliefs and changes in different decades.
	There are unsafe circumstances that can arise when an individual makes a decision to have friends added to their profile and turns out to become an argument and or cyber “bullying.”Some of them individuals will intimidate others and sometimes have other individuals do the same. Another form of peer pressure and getting teens and young adults to be involved in destructive behavior there are no set rules or policies when utilizing these sites but when does it become a legal action? Most parents have to take the initiative to educate their children and continuously monitor their activities while utilizing these sites for safety reasons.
	I have met another male individual who shared his experience meeting a younger female from Hawaii. They both were in an agreement to move in together and because the female was communicating with other males, the relationship ended in a domestic violence. In fact, the relationship did not last one month. The female became angry and combative so the male drove her to the Police station and that is where she was charged with domestic violence from the bruises on the males arm. This couple met on Match.com.
	I have researched some sites on how individuals utilize Facebook, Match.com and E-Harmony .Most of the child pornography and pedophiles start on Facebook for the simple fact “Everyone is on Facebook since My Space collapsed.” The Denver Post issued an article on July30, 2011 with information on pedophiles and child pornography. The detectives are able to locate what computer pictures and solicitation come from and sometimes the actual person performing such acts...In Denver, Co the rate has increased with child solicitation on the internet. I have also researched sites to assist parents with the safety for their children. We are sometimes left with the impression “Who is really on the other end?”

== Ideas for New Sections - ENGL 656 ==

In looking at the big picture of this e-book, I wondered what everyone would think of adding more genres. Specifically, I think it would be valuable to add the topics of memoirs, reviews, commentaries and proposals. Within one semester, I will not be able to tackle all of these sections, but I could begin to develop skeletons and suggestions for each topics content. What do you think?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''Demography''' is the study of human population dynamics. It encompasses the study of the size, structure and distribution of populations, and how populations change over time due to births, deaths, migration, and aging. Demographic analysis can relate to whole societies or to smaller groups defined by criteria such as education, religion, or ethnicity.

==Why study demography?==
Before proposing complex theories to explain sociological phenomena (e.g., [[w:World Systems Theory|World Systems Theory]]), especially at the macro and/or societal levels, sociologists should first turn to demographic indicators  for possible explanations.  Demographic analysis is a powerful tool that can explain a number of sociological phenomena.  

For instance, in examining the elements that led to the first [[w:World War I|World War]], most people turn to [[w:World war 1#Diplomatic and political origins|political and diplomatic conflicts]] but fail to consider the implications of expanding populations in the European countries involved.  Expanding populations will result in increased competition for resources (i.e., food, land, access to trade routes and ports, etc.). Expanding populations may not be the primary cause of World War I, but it may have played a role in the increased hostilities leading up to the war.  In this fashion, demographic indicators are often informative in explaining world events and should be turned to first as explanations.

==History==
The study of human populations has its roots, like sociology generally, in the societal changes that accompanied both the scientific and industrial revolutions.  Some early mathematicians developed primitive forms of [[w:life table|life tables]], which are tables of life expectancies, for life insurance and [[w:actuarial science|actuarial]] purposes.  [[w:Census|Censuses]], another demographic tool, were institued for primarily political purposes:
*as a basis for taxation
*as a basis for political representation

The development of demographic calculations started in the 18th century. Census taking, on the other hand, has a long history dating back close to 2,000 years among the Chinese and the Romans and even further back in history among some groups in the Middle East.  Most modern censuses began in the late 18th century.

==Data and Methods== 
Demography relies on large data sets that are primarily derived from [[w:census|censuses]] and registration statistics (i.e., birth, death, marriage registrations). Large data sets over long periods of time (e.g., the U.S. census is conducted every 10 years) are required to develop trends in demographic indicators, like birth and death rates.  

In many countries, particularly in developing nations, reliable demographic data are still difficult to obtain. In some locales this may be due to the association of ''census'' with ''taxation''.

===Demographic Indicators===
Because demography is interested in changes in human populations, demographers focus on specific indicators of change.  Two of the most important indicators are birth and death rates, which are also referred to as [[w:fertility|''fertility'']] (see also [[w:fecundity|fecundity]]) and ''mortality''.  Additionally, demographers are interested in migration trends or the movement of people from one location to another.  Some of the specific measures used to explore these elements of population change are discussed below.

===Fertility and Fecundity===
'''Fertility''', in demography, refers to the ability of females to produce healthy offspring in abundance.  '''Fecundity''' is the potential reproductive capacity of a female.  Some of the more common demographic measures used in relation to fertility and/or fecundity include:
*'''crude birth rate''': the annual number of live births per thousand people 
*'''general fertility rate''': the annual number of live births per 1000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44). 
*'''age-specific fertility''' rate: the annual number of live births per 1000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.) 
*'''total fertility rate''': the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates
*'''gross reproduction rate''': the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates 
*'''net reproduction rate''': the number of daughters who would be born to a woman according to current age-specific fertility and mortality rates

Another important demographic concept relating to fertility is ''replacement level''. Replacement level fertility refers to the number of children that a woman (or monogamous couple) must have in order to replace the existing population. Sub-replacement fertility is a fertility rate that is not high enough to replace an existing population. Replacement level fertility is generally set at 2.1 children in a woman's lifetime (this number varies by geographic region given different mortality rates). Sub-replacement fertility is below approximately 2.1 children in a woman's life time. The reason the number is set to 2.1 children per woman is because two children are needed to replace the parents and an additional one-tenth of a child is needed to make up for the mortality of children and women who do not reach the end of their reproductive years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2009&quot;&gt;carr, deborah. 2009. “worries over a population implosion.” Contexts 8:58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, women don't have one-tenth of a child; this results from statistical averaging between women who have more than two children and those who have two or fewer children.

The chart below illustrates trends in childbearing by region of the world.  Fertility rates dropped earlier in the more developed regions of the world, followed by Asia and Latin America.  Fertility rates are just starting to decline in Africa.

[[Image:Trends in TFR 1950-2050.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The chart below highlights the varied fertility rates of specific countries as some have very low fertility rates, many have moderate rates, and some have very high rates.

[[Image:Total Fertility Rate for Select Countries, 2010.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The following chart illustrates the relationship between contraceptive use and the total fertility rate by regions of the world.  Increased contraceptive use is associated with lower numbers of children per woman.

[[Image:Scatterplot of contraceptive use and TFR by region 2010.png|center|thumb|400px]]

One of the strongest predictors of fertility rates is women's [[Introduction_to_Sociology/Education|educational attainment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mare2006&quot;&gt;Mare, R.D., &amp; Maralani, V. (2006). The Intergenerational Effects of Changes in Women's Educational Attainments. ''American Sociological Review'', 71(4), 542-564.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost universally, higher levels of educational attainment result in lower fertility rates.  It is not, however, education itself that causes declines in fertility but rather its association with other factors that reduce fertility: women with higher levels of education delay marriage, have improved labor market opportunities, are more likely to use [[w:contraception|contraception]] during intercourse, and are less likely to adopt traditional childbearing roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mare2006&quot;/&gt;

Fertility rates are also closely related to a country's level of development, which influences other factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr2007&quot;&gt;carr, deborah. 2007. “the cost of kids.” Contexts 6:62.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, women who have kids in developed countries have increased opportunity costs, meaning they will make less money because of time spent outside the workforce raising kids.  This is true in developed countries because women are more likely to be highly skilled and well-paid (relative to women in developing countries). Additionally, delayed childbearing, probability of a child reaching adulthood, norms about ideal family sizes, and pervasiveness of contraceptives will all reduce fertility rates.  But one of the biggest factors is the cost of children.  In undeveloped and developing countries, children are often an economic asset to parents as they serve as cheap labor on the farm; they don't require pay, just food and shelter.  That is not the case in developed countries, where very few people work in agriculture (roughly 2% in the US).  Instead, children are an economic liability, meaning they cost money while not generating money for the parents.  The cost of raising a child from birth to 17 in a middle-income home in 2005 was $191,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr2007&quot;/&gt;  That cost goes up if parents pay for a child's college education, which averages between $12,000 and $30,000.  Thus, the cost of raising children in developed countries reduces fertility rates in those countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr2007&quot;/&gt;

===Mortality===
'''Mortality''' refers to the finite nature of humanity: people die.  Mortality in demography is interested in the number of deaths in a given time or place or the proportion of deaths in relation to a population.  Some of the more common demographic measures of mortality include:
*'''crude death rate''': the annual number of deaths per 1000 people 
*'''infant mortality rate''': the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per thousand live births 
*'''life expectancy''': the number of years which an individual at a given age can expect to live at present mortality rates 

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have relatively more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[w:Life table|life table]] which summarizes mortality separately at each age.

This chart depicts infant mortality by region of the world.  The less developed regions of the world have higher infant mortality rates than the more developed regions.

[[Image:Infant Mortality Rate by Region 1950-2050.png|center|thumb|400px]]

This chart depicts life expectancy by region of the world.  Similar to infant mortality, life expectancies are higher in more developed regions of the world.

[[Image:Life Expectancy at Birth by Region 1950-2050.png|center|thumb|400px]]

According to recent research,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata2007&quot;&gt;Kolata, G. (2007). A Surprising Secret to a Long Life: Stay in School. The New York Times. Retrieved January 3, 2007. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/health/03aging.html]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the best predictors of [[w:longevity|longevity]] (i.e., a long life) is education, even when other factors are controlled: the more educated you are, the longer you  can expect to live.  A few additional years of schooling can add several additional years to your life and vastly improve your health in old age.  The mechanism through which this works is not the schooling itself, but schooling's influence on other health-related behaviors.  The more education someone has, the lower his/her likelihood of smoking and engaging in unhealthy and high risk behaviors.  Education also increases the probability of people engaging in healthy behaviors, like frequently exercising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata2007&quot;/&gt;

Other factors associated with greater longevity include:
*wealth: money increases access to good healthcare, which improves health and increases longevity
*race: whites live longer than blacks, though this is due to other social disparities, like income and education, and not to race itself
*ability to delay gratification: with the ability to delay gratification people live healthier lives and engage in healthier behaviors (e.g., exercise)
*larger social networks: having a large group of friends and close relationships with relatives increases your [[w:social support|social support]], which positively influences health
*job satisfaction: people in more powerful and more satisfying jobs tend to be healthier than people in less satisfying jobs

==The Demographic Transition==
[[Image:Stage5.svg|right|thumb|300px]]

The '''demographic transition''' is a model and theory describing the transition from high birth rates and death rates to low birth and death rates that occurs as part of the economic development of a country. In pre-industrial societies, population growth is relatively slow because both birth and death rates are high.  In most post-industrial societies, birth and death rates are both low.  The transition from high rates to low rates is referred to as ''the demographic transition''.  This understanding of societal changes is based on the work of Thompson,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson1929&quot;&gt;Thompson, W. C. 1929.  The American Journal of Sociology 34:959-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Blacker,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blacker1947&quot;&gt;Blacker, C. P. 1947. Eugenics Review 39:88-101.&lt;/ref&gt; and Notestein,&lt;ref name=&quot;Notestein1945&quot;&gt;Notestein, F. W. 1945. Pp. 36-57 in Food for the World, Editor T. W. Schultz. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who derived the model based on changes in demographics over the preceding two hundred years or so.

The beginning of the demographic transition in a society is indicated when death rates drop without a corresponding fall in birth rates (usually the result of improved sanitation and advances in healthcare). Countries in the second stage of the demographic transition (see diagram) experience a large increase in population.  This is depicted in the diagram when death rates fall in stage two but birth rates do not fall until stage three.  The red line begins its rapid upward growth in stage two and begins to level off at the end of stage three.

By the end of stage three, birth rates drop to fall in line with the lower death rates. While there are several theories that attempt to explain why this occurs (e.g., Becker and Caldwell, who view children as economic commodities),&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker1960&quot;&gt;Becker, Gary S. 1960. &quot;An Economic Analysis of Fertility.&quot; Pp. 209-31 in Demographic and Economic Change in Developed Countries, Edited Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldwell1982&quot;&gt;Caldwell, John C. 1982. Theory of Fertility Decline. Sydney: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; why birth rates decline in post-industrial societies is still being evaluated.  Many developed countries now have a population that is static or, in some cases, [[w:population decline|shrinking]].

As with all models, this is an idealized, composite picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. Whether or not it will accurately depict changes in developing societies today remains to be seen. For more information on the demographic transition, see [http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/Demotrans/demtran.htm here].

==Population Growth and Overpopulation==
[[Image:Time Between Billions in World Population Growth.png|right|thumb|400px|The time it takes to introduce additional billions of people has decreased since the first billion mark was reached.]]

'''Overpopulation''' indicates a scenario in which the population of a living species exceeds the [[w:carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of its [[w:ecological niche|ecological niche]]. Overpopulation is not a function of the number or density of the individuals, but rather the number of individuals compared to the resources they need to survive. In other words, it is a ratio: ''population'' over ''resources''. If a given environment has a population of 10, but there is food and drinking water enough for only 9 people, then that environment is overpopulated, while if the population is 100 individuals but there are food and water enough for 200, then it is not overpopulated. Resources to be taken into account when estimating if an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water, food, shelter, warmth, etc. In the case of human beings, there are others such as [[w:arable land|arable land]] and, for all but tribes with primitive lifestyles, lesser resources such as jobs, money, education, fuel, electricity, medicine, proper sewage and garbage management, and transportation.

[[Image:Growthbydevelopedvslessdeveloped.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The majority of world population growth today is occurring in less developed countries.]]

Presently, every year the [[w:world population|world's human population]] grows by approximately 80 million.  About half the world lives in nations with [[w:sub-replacement fertility|sub-replacement fertility]] and [[w:population growth|population growth]] in those countries is due to immigration. The United Nations projects that the world human population will stabilize in 2075 at nine billion due to declining fertility rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN-pop&quot;&gt;http://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; All the nations of East Asia, with the exceptions of Mongolia, the Philippines, and Laos, are below replacement level. Russia and Eastern Europe are dramatically below replacement fertility. Western Europe also is below replacement. In the Middle East Iran, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey, and Lebanon are below replacement. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are similar to Western Europe, while the United States is just barely below replacement with about 2.0 births per woman. All four of these nations still have growing populations due to high rates of immigration. 

Much of the projected growth is expected to come from African countries where birth rates remain high.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost2009&quot;&gt;frost, ashley e., and f. nii-amoo dodoo. 2009. “men are missing from african family planning.” Contexts 8(1):44-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  While birth rates in most countries have fallen since 1990, in some parts of Africa birth rates have actually increased and the average woman has more than five children, well above the replacement rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost2009&quot;/&gt;

===Early Projections of Overpopulation===
Early in the 19th century, [[w:Thomas Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] argued in ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'' that, if left unrestricted, human populations would continue to grow until they would become too large to be supported by the food grown on available agricultural land.  He proposed that, while resources tend to grow arithmetically, population [[w:exponential growth|grows exponentially]]. At that point, the population would be restrained through mass famine and starvation. Malthus argued for [[w:population control|population control]], through ''moral restraint'', to avoid this happening. 

The alternative to moral restraint, according to Malthus, is biological and natural population limitation. As the population exceeds the amount of available resources the population decreases through famine, disease, or war, since the lack of resources causes mortality to increase. This process keeps the population in check and ensures it does not exceed the amount of resources.

Over the two hundred years following Malthus's projections, famine has overtaken numerous individual regions. Proponents of this theory, [[w:Neo-Malthusians|Neo-Malthusians]] state that these famines were examples of [[w:Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian catastrophes]]. On a global scale, however, food production has grown faster than population. It has often been argued that future pressures on food production, combined with threats to other aspects of the earth's habitat such as [[w:global warming|global warming]], make overpopulation a still more serious threat in the future. 

===Population as a function of food availability===
There are some scholars who argue that human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply - populations grow when there is an abundance of food and shrink in times of scarcity. This idea is only slightly less problematic than the idea that human population growth is not guided by food production, as it suggestions that that every time food production is intensified to feed a growing population, the population responds by increasing even more. Some human populations throughout history support this theory, as consistent population growth began with the agricultural revolution, when food supplies consistently increased. 

Critics of this idea point out that birth rates are voluntarily the lowest in developed nations, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, the population is decreasing in some countries with abundant food supply. Thus, human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. Critics cite other factors that contribute to declining birth rates in developed nations, including: increased access to contraception, later ages of marriage, the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside of childrearing and domestic work, and the decreased economic 'utility' of children in industrialized settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker1960&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldwell1982&quot;/&gt; The latter explanation stems from the fact that children perform a great deal of work in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; this interpretation may seem callous, but it has been cited to explain the drop-off in birthrates worldwide in all industrializing regions.

For some, the concept that human populations behave in the same way as do populations of bears and fish is hard to believe; for others it indicates a feasible solution to population issues. In either case, since populations are tied to the food they consume, discussions of populations should not take place without considering the role played by food supply.  There is a substantial body of research that has considered the ability of the planet to provide sufficient food for the world's growing population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godfray2010&quot;&gt;Godfray, H. Charles J. et al. 2010. “Food Security: The Challenge of Feeding 9 Billion People.” Science 327:812-818.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research suggests that the planet can potentially provide sufficient food for the projected peak population of humans of 9 billion people, but only if agriculture is carefully managed.  Factors that must be considered include: genetically modified crops, employing agricultural tools in correct, context-specific ways, aquaculture, and simultaneously working to limit harm to the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godfray2010&quot;/&gt;

===Effects of overpopulation===
In any case, many proponents of population control have averred that famine is far from being the only problem attendant to overpopulation.  These critics point out ultimate shortages of energy sources and other natural resources, as well as the importance of serious communicable diseases in dense populations and war over scarce resources such as land area. A shortage of arable land (where food crops will grow) is also a problem.

The world's current agricultural production, if it were distributed evenly, would be sufficient to feed everyone living on the Earth today. However, many critics hold that, in the absence of other measures, simply feeding the world's population well would only make matters worse, natural growth will cause the population to grow to unsustainable levels, and will directly result in famines and deforestation and indirectly in pandemic disease and war.

Some of the other characteristics of overpopulation include:
*Child poverty
*High birth rates
*Lower life expectancies
*Lower levels of literacy
*Higher rates of unemployment, especially in [[w:urban|urban]]
*Insufficient arable land
*Little surplus food
*Poor diet with ill health and diet-deficiency diseases (e.g. [[w:rickets|rickets]])
*Low per capita GDP
*Increasingly unhygienic conditions
*Government is stretched economically
*Increased crime rates resulting from people stealing resources to survive
*Mass extinctions of plants and animals as habitat is used for farming and human settlements

[[Image:Percentage of Population Living in urban areas 1950-2050.png|center|thumb|400px|Urbanization results from both industrialization (increasing efficiency among farmers) and population growth.]]

Another point of view on population growth and how it effects the standard of living is that of [[w:Virginia Abernethy|Virginia Abernethy]]. In ''Population Politics'' she shows evidence that declining fertility following industrialization only holds true in nations where women enjoy a relatively high status. In strongly patriarchal nations, where women enjoy few rights, a higher standard of living tends to result in population growth.  Abernathy argues that foreign aid to poor countries must include significant components designed to improve the education, human rights, political rights, political power, and economic status and power of women.

===Possible Solutions to Overpopulation===
Some approach overpopulation with a ''[[w:survival of the fittest|survival of the fittest]]'', ''[[w:laissez-faire|laissez-faire]]'' attitude, arguing that if the Earth's ecosystem becomes overtaxed, it will naturally regulate itself.  In this mode of thought, disease or starvation are &quot;natural&quot; means of lessening population. Objections to this argument are:
#in the meantime, a huge number of plant and animal species become extinct
#this would result in terrible pollution in some areas that would be difficult to abate
#it obviously creates certain moral problems, as this approach would result in great suffering in the people who die

Others argue that economic development is the best way to reduce population growth as economic development can spur demographic transitions that seem to ''naturally'' lead to reductions in fertility rates. 

In either case, it is often held that the most productive approach is to provide a combination of help targeted towards population control and self-sufficiency. One of the most important measures proposed for this effort is the empowerment of women educationally, economically, politically, and in the family. The value of this philosophy has been substantially borne out in cases where great strides have been taken toward this goal. Where women's status has dramatically improved, there has generally been a drastic reduction in the birthrate to more sustainable levels. Other measures include effective [[w:birth control|family planning]] programs, local [[w:renewable energy|renewable energy]] systems, [[w:sustainable agriculture|sustainable agriculture]] methods and supplies, [[w:reforestation|reforestation]], and measures to protect the local environment.

[http://www.utne.com/web_special/web_specials_archives/articles/799-1.html David Pimentel], a Cornell University professor of ecology and agricultural sciences, sees several possible scenarios for the 22nd century: 
#a planet with 2 billion people thriving in harmony with the environment
#or, at the other extreme, 12 billion miserable humans suffering a difficult life with limited resources and widespread famine
Spreading awareness of the issues is an important first step in addressing it.

===Underpopulation===
Once countries pass through the demographic transition, some experience fertility rate decreases so substantial that they fall well below replacement level and their populations begin to shrink (as has Russia's in recent years, though emigration has also played a role in Russia's population decline).  A new fear for many governments, particularly those in countries with very low fertility rates, is that a declining population will reduce the GDP and economic growth of the country, as population growth is often a driving force of economic expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2009&quot;/&gt;  To combat extremely low fertility rates, some of these governments have introduced pro-family policies, that include things like payments to parents for having children and extensive parental leave for parents.  Such policies may reverse the low fertility rates, but they also seem to be shortsighted in light of the concerns associated with overall world population growth.

==Migration==
The likelihood of a given individual in the U.S. moving to another place in the U.S. in any given year has declined over the last 40 years.  Only about 1 in 10 Americans have moved in the last year, which is about half the proportion that changed residences annually in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;&gt;Roberts, Sam. 2008. “Data Show Steady Drop in Americans on Move.” The New York Times, December 21 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/us/21mobility.html?_r=1 (Accessed December 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCensusPopSurvey2008&quot;&gt;Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, 2008 Annual Social and Economic Supplement&lt;/ref&gt;  The reduction in moves is attributable to aging populations (older people are less likely to move) and an increase in dual-career couples. Those who do move are generally driven by jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;

Close to 37% of Americans have never moved from the community in which they were born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;  There are wide variations in native inhabitants, however: 76% of Texans were born in-state while only 14% of Nevadans were born in-state.  Some states lose a large number of people who were born in the state as well, like Alaska, where only 28% of the people born in that state have remained there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;
Immigration is often a controversial topic, for a variety of reasons, though many have to do with competition between those already living in the destination location and those arriving in that location.  One recent study finds that one type of competition between immigrants and non-immigrants may be overstated.  Some people have suggested that natives' opportunities to attend college are negatively impacted through competition with immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neymotin2009&quot;&gt;Neymotin, Florence. 2009. Immigration and Its Effect on the College-Going Outcomes of Natives. Economics of Education Review. 28, 5:538-550.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neymotin (2009) finds that competition with immigrants does not harm the educational outcomes of U.S. natives and may in fact facilitate college attending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neymotin2009&quot;/&gt;

==Urbanization==
'''Urbanization''' is the physical growth of [[w:urban area|urban area]]s as a result of global change. Urbanization is also defined by the United Nations as movement of people from [[w:rural|rural]] to urban areas with population growth equating to urban migration. The United Nations projected that half of the world's [[w:World population|population]] would live in urban areas at the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;InternationalHeraldTribune2008&quot;&gt; http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/news/UN-GEN-UN-Growing-Cities.php The Associated Press. February 26, 2008. UN says half the world's population will live in urban areas by end of 2008. International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  Urbanization is closely linked to [[w:modernization|modernization]], [[w:industrialization|industrialization]], and the sociological process of [[w:rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].

===Movement===
[[File:Urbanized population 2006.png|thumb|right|300px|Percentage of population which is urbanized, by country, as of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unicef2008&quot;&gt;http://www.unicef.org/sowc08/docs/sowc08_table_StatisticalTables.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As more and more people leave villages and farms to live in cities, urban growth results. The rapid growth of cities like Chicago in the late 19th century and [[w:Mumbai|Mumbai]] a century later can be attributed largely to rural-urban migration and the demographic transition.  This kind of growth is especially commonplace in [[w:developing country|developing countries]].

The rapid urbanisation of the world’s population over the twentieth century is described in the 2005 Revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects report. The global proportion of urban population rose dramatically from 13% (220 million) in 1900, to 29% (732 million) in 1950, to 49% (3.2 billion) in 2005.  The same report projected that the figure is likely to rise to 60% (4.9 billion) by 2030.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WUP2005/2005wup.htm World Urbanization Prospects: The 2005 Revision, Pop. Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UN]&lt;/ref&gt;. Urbanization rates vary between countries.  The United States and United Kingdom have a far higher urbanization level than China, India, Swaziland or Niger, but a far slower annual urbanization rate, since much less of the population is living in a rural area.

===Causes===

[[File:Manila shanty.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Urbanization is not always attributed to high density. In [[w:Manila|Manila]], the cost of living has forced residents to live in low quality [[w:slum|slum]]s and [[w:shanty town|shanty town]]s]]

People move into cities to seek economic opportunities. A major contributing factor is known as &quot;[[w:rural flight|rural flight]]&quot;. In rural areas, often on small family farms, it is difficult to improve one's standard of living beyond basic sustenance. Farm living is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions, and in times of drought, flood or pestilence, survival becomes extremely problematic. In modern times, [[w:Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[w:agriculture|agriculture]] has negatively affected the economy of small and middle-sized farms and strongly reduced the size of the rural labour market. Cities, in contrast, are known to be places where money, services and wealth are centralized. Cities are where fortunes are made and where social mobility is possible. Businesses, which generate jobs and capital, are usually located in urban areas. Whether the source is trade or tourism, it is also through the cities that foreign money flows into a country. Thus, as with immigration generally, there are factors that ''push'' people out of rural areas and ''pull'' them into urban areas.

There are also better basic services as well as other specialist services in urban areas that aren't found in rural areas. There are more job opportunities and a greater variety of jobs. Health is another major factor. People, especially the elderly are often forced to move to cities where there are doctors and hospitals that can address their health needs. Other factors include a greater variety of entertainment (e.g., restaurants, movie theaters, theme parks, etc.) and better quality of education in the form of universities.  Due to their high populations, urban areas can also have much more diverse social communities allowing others to find people like them when they might not be able to in rural areas.  These conditions are heightened during times of change from a pre-industrial society to an industrial one. 

===Economic effects===
As cities develop, effects can include a dramatic increase in costs, often pricing the local [[w:working class|working class]] out of the real estate market. For example, Eric Hobsbawm's book ''The age of the revolution: 1789–1848'' (published 1962 and 2005) chapter 11, stated &quot;Urban development in our period [1789–1848] was a gigantic process of class segregation, which pushed the new labouring poor into great morasses of misery outside the centres of government and business and the newly specialised residential areas of the bourgeoisie. The almost universal European division into a 'good' west end and a 'poor' east end of large cities developed in this period.&quot; This is likely due the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind, making the western edges of towns preferable to the eastern ones. Similar problems now affect the developing world; rising inequality results from rapid urbanization. The drive for growth and efficiency can lead to less equitable urban development&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant2008&quot;&gt;Grant, Ursula (2008) Opportunity and exploitation in urban labour markets [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/1969.pdf] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Urbanization is often viewed as a negative trend, but can in fact, be perceived simply as a natural occurrence from individual and corporate efforts to reduce expense in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs, education, housing, and transportation. Living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity, diversity, and marketplace competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaeser1998&quot;&gt;Glaeser, Edward. 1998. &quot;Are Cities Dying?&quot; The Journal of Economic Perspectives. 12(2):139–160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===
One environmental concern associated with urbanization is the [[w:urban heat island|urban heat island]]. The urban heat island is formed when industrial and urban areas are developed and heat becomes more abundant. In rural areas, a large part of the incoming solar energy is used to evaporate water from vegetation and soil. In cities, where less vegetation and exposed soil exists, the majority of the sun’s energy is absorbed by urban structures and asphalt. Hence, during warm daylight hours, less evaporative cooling in cities allows surface temperatures to rise higher than in rural areas. Additional city heat is given off by vehicles and factories, as well as by industrial and domestic heating and cooling units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park1987&quot;&gt;Park, H.-S. (1987). Variations in the urban heat island intensity affected by geographical environments. Environmental Research Center papers, no. 11. Ibaraki, Japan: Environmental Research Center, The University of Tsukuba.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect causes the city to become 2 to 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F (1 to 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C) warmer than surrounding landscapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-heat&quot;&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ &quot;Heat Island Effect&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;. Impacts also include reducing soil moisture and intensification of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gtresearchnews&quot;&gt;&quot;Heating Up: Study Shows Rapid Urbanization in China Warming the Regional Climate Faster than Other Urban Areas&quot; [http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/china-climate.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of urbanization may be an overall positive for the environment. Birth rates of new urban dwellers fall immediately to the replacement rate (2.1), and keep falling. This can prevent overpopulation (see discussion below). Additionally, it puts a stop to destructive subsistence farming techniques, like [[w:slash and burn|slash and burn]] agriculture. Finally, it minimizes land use by humans, leaving more for nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand&quot;&gt;Brand, Stewart. Whole Earth Discipline.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing forms of urbanization===
Different forms of urbanization can be classified depending on the style of architecture and planning methods as well as historic growth of areas.  In cities of the [[w:Developed country|developed world]] urbanization traditionally exhibited a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area.  Recent developments, such as inner-city redevelopment schemes, mean that new arrivals in cities no longer necessarily settle in the centre. In some developed regions, the reverse effect, originally called [[w:counter urbanisation|counter urbanisation]] has occurred, with cities losing population to rural areas, and is particularly common for richer families.  This has been possible because of improved communications and means of transportation, and has been caused by factors such as the fear of crime and poor urban environments. Later termed ''&quot;[[w:white flight|white flight]]&quot;'', the effect is not restricted to cities with a high ethnic minority population. When the residential area shifts outward, this is called [[w:suburbanization|suburbanization]]. Some research suggests that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown both in developed and developing countries such as India &lt;ref name=&quot;Sridhar2007&quot;&gt;Sridhar, K. 2007. Density gradients and their determinants: Evidence from India. Regional Science and Urban Economics 37(3):314-344&lt;/ref&gt;.

Urbanization can be planned or organic. Planned urbanization, (e.g., [[w:planned community|planned communities]]), is based on an advanced plan, which can be prepared for military, aesthetic, economic or [[w:urban design|urban design]] reasons. Organic urbanization is not organized and happens haphazardly. [[w:Landscape planning|Landscape planners]] are responsible for landscape infrastructure (e.g., [[w:public park|public park]]s, [[w:sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage systems]], [[w:Greenway (landscape)|greenways]], etc.) which can be planned before urbanization takes place, or afterward to revitalize an area and create greater [[w:livability|livability]] within a region. Planned urbanization and development is the aim of the [[w:American Institute of Planners|American Institute of Planners]].

There's also a [[Cookbook:Pawpaw_Lassi|pawpaw lassi]]. I don't know what people want to do with that. The mere usage of pawpaw makes it highly American, but maybe it belongs on the main Lassi page anyway. Probably it should at least have a link from here. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] ([[User talk:AlbertCahalan|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlbertCahalan|contribs]]) 23:08, 9 May 2005  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:: DO NOT SPLIT. I think it is great to have all these simple recipies together on one page, until it gets overloaded.  The five that are there now look good together, and it seems like up to about a dozen would be OK. And I vote for taking the split tag off the article.  The Pawpaw Lassi article should be merged into here.  Maybe this article needs some new main divisions, one for India/Asia/authentic and one for Other/international/etc?

: Pawpaw refers to both the widely distributed tropical fruit Carica papaya, as well as the American fruit, Asimina triloba.  In the US, &quot;pawpaw&quot; is A. triloba.  Outside of the US, pawpaw most likely would refer to C. papaya, although I believe &quot;papaya&quot; is the most common name (globally, for English speakers) for this fruit. I'm going to change &quot;pawpaw&quot; in this article to &quot;papaya&quot;, as I really doubt that A. triloba is the fruit being used in this dish. If A. triloba is in fact the intended fruit, please change it back.  If this defies a regional usage of &quot;pawpaw&quot; for C. papaya, and you are tempted to change it back, please add a note making it clear which fruit is being referred to.

==Clarification==

I'm a bit confused by this key. If you could, maybe add english words with the sounds. Are latin vowels constant? Does I always make the same sound? When is each sound used?



==Inaccuracy==

The table seems to be, grossly inaccurate. I cite http://www.jstor.org/view/00978507/ap020167/02a00150/0 or Allen's Vox Latina as evidence; the IPA representation of the long i is [i:] (triangle colon, of course, not an ordinary one), and similarly with the other Latin vowels; length, not tenseness is the issue. However, I am not sure what the current opinion in the field is, nor have I found any terribly explicit statement either way. I will edit the page when I am more certain.

==Moved from Module Page==

Note: this is very unfinished, but it's late and I'm tired.
To do: clean this up, add diphthongs and digraphs.  Redundancy (pointlessness?) in light of [[w:en:Latin phonemes|wikipedia article]]? Not that one's perfect, but it seems a waste to create two flawed documents rather than synthesize them into a better whole...

&quot;and most of this can be averted by choosing a non-conductive floor surface such as floorboards, or tiles. Make sure you don't do this in an unfinished basement!&quot;

I would think you would want a conductive floor surface to help ground out any static charges that might build up. 
:If you see a mistake JUST FIX IT! -CarbonUnit

Also, I've worked in an unfinished basement before... Never had any problems with static.

Some RAM chips do not go in either way

== many faults ==

Many faults in this book:

Power Up: &quot;Then press the power button...&quot; should be double check everything (again) then press the power button...
Expansions and Connections: &quot;Next, close the case and take your computer to where you will be using it.&quot; Don't close the case until the system is confirmed working and that all fans are running, then you can close the case

In general the whole end of the guide is bad. PC building and testing... CPU (and heatsink/fan) -&gt; mainboard... ram -&gt; mainboard... Mainboard -&gt; chassis... video card -&gt; mainboard... power supply -&gt; mainboard and fans... monitor -&gt; video card... keyboard -&gt; mainboard... DO NOT CONNECT ANYTHING ELSE!... double check everything... power on system... wait for POST, if system has hardware monitoring go into the BIOS and check the numbers... unplug system, note that I did not say to power it off with the power button and then unplug it, you need to unplug it to drain the PSU.... Now you can connect your other stuff and then double check everything again and POST the system.

&quot;you should choose an area without carpet on the floor, as carpet tends to attract a lot of static, and most of this can be averted by choosing a non-conductive floor surface such as floorboards, or tiles. Make sure you don't do this in an unfinished basement!&quot;....... non-conductive floor surface WTF are you talking about. YOU WANT A CONDUCTIVE (preferably earth grounded) SURFACE! to prevent any voltage differentials (static) from building up

I'm going to have to rewrite this book and show you how to do it the old school way. My first self built was a 286, I've been doing this as a hobby and professionally for many many years.

== Grounding ==

I believe that regardless of an anti-static mat, that an anti-static strap should always be used, especially if the person is constructing a computer for the first time, I do not however want to change the artcle as I have no cited source to base my oppinion on. You can still damage components on an anti-static mat.

[[User:Tyler.szabo|Tyler.szabo]] 04:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)yu

:It all depends on the type of anti-static mat, the static charge of the person and the conductivity of the workbench/surfaces in contact with the components. I have always built my own computers from components and never used any anti-static methods, at best I sometimes tried to make sure I gave the chance of any static to discharge before touching the components by contacting a grounded metal structure first.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:21, 15 July 2013 (UTC)

== Sequence of actions ==

Connecting Power supply is said to be the first thing to do. In reality it would obstruct the rest of assembly with its numerous cables hanging around and closing off access to processor. In fact, even mounting motherboard with power supply sitting there is ridiculously hard. The power supply should be installed after motherboard and processor (and fan), but before installing optical disk drive - it may be impossible/hard to connect power cables to motherboard if it is there (not a huge problem, but still). I propose the following sequence:
#Remove the freaking power supply
#Motherboard
#Processor
#Fan
#Memory, Expansion cards
#Power supply
#Connect cables to mb
#HD, CD, FD
#Connect all other cables

That was [[User:Grue|Grue]] 17:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

Installing the power supply *first* may not be the best action, but I think *removing* the power supply can be more hassle than it is worth.

I have seen some PC chassis form factors where the power supply blocked access to everything else.
On the other hand, I have been fortunate enough that most of the PC chassis I've worked on have been big enough that there was no overlap. One chassis I worked on has a hinge so that the motherboard would swing down, so you could install the CPU, RAM, etc. far away from the power supply. In those cases, removing the power supply would be an unnecessary hassle.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 19:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

== clean room ==

I removed 

:A clean room is a better place to work on your computer or to build a computer. a type 100 or above is perfict you could use a clean room type 50 for that matter but if oyu want to open your hard drive up use a type 100 clean room..

While yes, a clean room would be adequate, it is overkill for putting together a computer.
Put a computer together in a room filled with cigaretter smoke, and it will work just fine.
Also, opening up a hard drive is not something I would recommend, unless you *want* to destroy it.

Perhaps this should be made account editing only? Unlike most articles, if a vandal got in here and wasn't caught he could do hundreds or thousands of dollars of damage. I will give no examples of type as your average vandal is to lazy to go into much depth and might get bored and turn away, and examples here would tell him how.

Cookbook:Grilling is a disambiguation page. This is necessary, because there are at least 3 meanings of this term.

Cookbook:Barbecue follows the dictionary definition. Maybe you'd like to change the English language, but this isn't the place to do it. Go to http://m-w.com/ and look up barbecue please. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:45, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

We wouldn't need a disambiguation page if you didn't keep posting the wrong information.  Also, aren't disambiguation pages are marked 'Disambigusation Page'.  Dictionaries are inferior to encyclopedias, and since we're using Wikibooks, lets use Wikipedia's definition.  Unless ''you'd'' like to rewrite that.  Seriously, check out [[w:Barbecue]] and stop using an incorrect definition. [[User:207.171.167.101|207.171.167.101]] 10 May 2005

I checked it out, and you're still wrong. Why do you believe that &quot;The term barbecue is incorrectly used interchangably with grilling&quot;? Who are ''you'' to say that the most people are incorrect? Language is defined by usage, and so ''you'' are incorrect. If everybody else thinks that barbecuing is cooking with fire, then that's what it means. I'll use a dictionary to determine this, because maybe you wrote the Wikipedia entry. The dictionary agrees with what I've always thought, and what everybody I'd ever met used as the definition. You're the first person I've ever encountered who would defy the dictionary on this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The term '''Collective behavior''' refers to social processes and events which do not reflect existing [[w:social structure|social structure]] (laws, conventions, and [[w:institutions|institutions]]), but which emerge in a &quot;spontaneous&quot; way.  Collective behavior might also be defined as action which is neither [[w:Conformity|conforming]] (in which actors follow prevailing [[w:norm|norm]]s) nor [[w:Deviance|deviant]] (in which actors violate those norms).  Collective behavior, a third form of action, takes place when norms are absent or unclear, or when they contradict each other.  Scholars have devoted far less attention to collective behavior than they have to either conformity or deviance.  

Examples of collective behavior include: [[w:Revival meeting|religious revival meetings]] (like those depicted in the documentary [[w:Marjoe|Marjoe]]), a panic in a burning theater (e.g., the Kentucky [[w:Beverly Hills Supper Club fire|Beverly Hills Supper Club fire]]), a sudden widespread interest in a website (e.g., [[w:MySpace|MySpace]]) or clothing item (e.g., [[w:Stephen_Colbert_(character)#Non-fictional_elements|wriststrong bracelets]]), a collective social movement to improve the environment (e.g., [[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]]), or the rapid spread of [[w:rumors|rumors]] (e.g., [[w:Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Religion.2C_citizenship.2C_and_loyalty|that Barack Obama is Muslim or not a US citizen]]). These diverse actions fall within the area sociologists call collective behavior. 

Collective behavior differs from ''group'' behavior in three ways:
#collective behavior involves limited and short-lived social interaction while groups tend to remain together longer
#collective behavior has no clear social boundaries; anyone can be a member of the collective while group membership is usually more discriminating
#collective behavior generates weak and unconventional norms while groups tend to have stronger and more conventional norms

Traditionally, collective behavior in sociology includes four forms&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumer1951&quot;&gt;Herbert Blumer, &quot;Collective Behavior,&quot; in A. M. Lee, ed., ''Principles of Sociology,'' New York, Barnes &amp; Noble, 1951, pp. 67-121.&lt;/ref&gt;: the crowd, the public, the mass, and the social movement.  While there is a degree of debate over what should be included under the label of &quot;collective behavior&quot; among sociologists today, often included are additional behaviors like: rumors, riots, trends, and fads.

==Why Study Collective Behavior?== 
Aside from the intrinsic interest of understanding why large groups of people behave the way they do, there are practical reasons why the study of collective behavior is important. Two examples might illustrate the practical importance:

[[File:Who - 1975.jpg|right|thumb|200px| The Who following a performance in 1975.]]

{{quote box|
width 50%|align=center
|quote=&quot;On December 3, 1979, eleven fans were killed by compressive [[w:asphyxia|asphyxia]] and several dozen others injured in the rush for seating at the opening of a sold-out concert by English rock band [[w:The Who|The Who]]. The concert was using &quot;[[w:festival seating|festival seating]]&quot;, (also known as &quot;general seating&quot;), where the best seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Due to the festival seating, many fans arrived early. When the crowds waiting outside heard the band performing a late sound check, they thought that the concert was beginning and tried to rush into the still-closed doors. Some at the front of the crowd were trampled as those pushing from behind were unaware that the doors were still closed. Only a few doors were in operation that night, and there are reports that management did not open more doors due to the concern of people sneaking past the ticket turnstiles.&quot;
}}

Better architectural design and crowd management might have avoided this tragedy. How to redesign buildings and manage crowds are two types of knowledge that can result from the study of collective behavior. Understanding how people behave in riots, what sets them off, and how they can be rapidly concluded is also knowledge that can result from the study of collective behavior.  Additionally, understanding how humans react during natural disasters and ensure that the damage that occurs is entirely a result of the disaster and not the human response to it. 

Another motivation for studying collective behavior is in order to actually change elements of society.  This is the component of collective behavior known as &quot;social movements.&quot;  Again, an example may help illustrate this point:

[[Image:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|right|240px|Police attack civil-rights marchers outside Selma, Alabama, on Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965.]]

{{quote box|
width 50%|align=center
|quote=&quot;On March 7, 1965, African American leaders led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from [[w:Selma|Selma]] to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, state troopers and local law enforcement attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, tear gas, rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response. Eight days after the first march, [[w:Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] delivered a televised address to garner support for the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:

''But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.''

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on August 6. The 1965 act suspended [[w:poll taxes|poll taxes]], [[w:literacy tests|literacy tests]] and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000 new black voters had been registered. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled.&quot;
}}

Understanding how to organize a social movement to pursue social change is one of the areas studied by sociologists. Better understanding how to organize such a movement can provide movement members the tools they need to succeed.

Various forms of collective behavior are examined in detail in the following sections.

==Crowds==
A ''crowd'' is a gathering of people who share a purpose or intent and influence one another. Crowds are a common occurrence in modern life.  Most sporting events, concerts, and other performances result in the gathering of crowds.  Blumer (1951) differentiated four types of crowds:
*casual - loose collection of people with no real interaction (e.g, people at the mall)
*conventional - deliberately planned meeting (e.g., community meeting organized by political leaders)
*expressive - depicts a crowd at an emotionally charged event (e.g., a political rally or soccer game in Europe or Latin America)
*acting - a crowd intent on accomplishing something (e.g., fans rushing a stage during or after a concert)

When crowd behavior is directed toward a specific, violent end, the result is a [[w:ochlocracy|mob]].  Mobs tend to be highly emotional.  Examples of mob violence include the [[w:lynching|lynchings]] in the Southern U.S. during the 19th and 20th centuries.  Violent crowd behavior without a specific goal is a [[w:riot|riot]].  Because riots do not have a specific end, it is assumed that their intention is to express general dissatisfaction.

===Diffuse Crowds===
Collective behavior can also refer to behavior that is diffused or dispersed over large distances.  Not all collective behavior has to occur in the immediate vicinity of others (compact crowds).  This is especially true with the advent of mass media, which allows for the rapid distribution of information around the world.

===Theories of Crowd Behavior===
====Contagion Theory====
Originally proposed by Gustave LeBon (1896), ''contagion theory'' proposes that crowds exert a hypnotic influence on their members.  The hypnotic influence, combined with the anonymity of belonging to a large group of people, results in irrational, emotionally charged behavior.  Or, as the name implies, the frenzy of the crowd is somehow ''contagious'', like a disease, and the contagion feeds upon itself, growing with time.  This also implies that the behavior of a crowd is an emergent property of the people coming together and not a property of the people themselves. 

There are several problems with LeBon's theory.  First, contagion theory presents members of crowds as irrational.  Much crowd behavior, however, is actually the result of rational fear (e.g., being trapped in a burning theater) or a rational sense of injustice (e.g., [[w:2001 Cincinnati Riots|the Cincinnati race riots]]).  Second, crowd behavior is often instigated by and guided by individuals.  That the crowd seems to take on a life of its own is certainly true, but the influence of the individual should not be overlooked.

It is also worth noting that LeBon's book is from the perspective of a frightened aristocrat. He interprets the crowd episodes of the French Revolution as irrational reversions to animal emotion, which he sees as characteristic of crowds in general. Blumer sees crowds as emotional, but as capable of any emotion, not only the negative ones of anger and fear.

====Convergence Theory====
''Convergence theory'' argues that the behavior of a crowd is not an emergent property of the crowd but is a result of like-minded individuals coming together.  In other words, if a crowd becomes violent (a mob or riot), convergence theory would argue that this is not because the crowd encouraged violence but rather because people who wanted to become violent came together in the crowd.

The primary criticism of convergence theory is that there is a tendency for people to do things in a crowd that they would not do on their own.  Crowds have an anonymizing effect on people, leading them to engage in sometimes outlandish behavior.  Thus, while some crowds may result from like-minded individuals coming together to act collectively (e.g., political rally), some crowds actually spur individuals into behavior that they would otherwise not engage in.

====Emergent-Norm Theory====
''Emergent-Norm Theory'' combines the above two theories, arguing that it is a combination of like-minded individuals, anonymity, and shared emotion that leads to crowd behavior.  This theory takes a symbolic interactionist approach to understanding crowd behavior.  It argues that people come together with specific expectations and norms, but in the interactions that follow the development of the crowd, new expectations and norms can emerge, allowing for behavior that normally would not take place.

====Crowds as &quot;Gatherings&quot;====
More recent research into collective behavior has begun to change sociological thinking on crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;&gt;Schweingruber, David S. and Clark McPhail. 1999. A Method for Systematically Observing and Recording Collective Action. Sociological Methods and Research. 27:451-498.&lt;/ref&gt;  This new approach distinguishes what brings people together as a gathering from what they do once gathered.  Most gatherings are temporary and are formed by an assembling process.  Individuals who gather are often acquainted and invited or informed about the gathering.  Once gathered, the subgroups of individuals who already know one another tend to stay together throughout the gathering.  There are, of course, some solitary individuals as well.  

This line of research also dispenses with the idea that crowds impair judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;/&gt;  Alcohol and drugs, which can contribute to deviant behavior, certainly can impair judgment and influence the actions of crowds, but crowds themselves do not impair judgment.  The actions of individuals at gatherings also illustrate that individuals remain independent, sometimes responding to solicitations, sometimes ignoring them, sometimes interacting with their subgroup, and sometimes acting spontaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;/&gt;

Gatherings also exhibit dispersing processes that end the gatherings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;/&gt; Sometimes these are emergency dispersal, as when authorities arrive and try to end the gathering.  Sometimes they are planned or the enthusiasm of the gathering wanes and people simply leave.  Perhaps the key point of the &quot;crowds as gatherings&quot; approach is that there is a great deal of variation in gatherings.

==Panic==
Panic is a sudden terror which dominates thinking and often affects groups of people. Panics typically occur in disaster situations, such as during a fire, and may endanger the overall health of the affected group. Architects and city planners try to accommodate the symptoms of panic, such as herd behavior, during design and planning, often using simulations to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit.

===Moral Panic===
A ''moral panic'' is a mass movement based on the perception that some individual or group, frequently a minority group or a subculture, poses a menace to society. These panics are generally fuelled by media coverage of social issues (although semi-spontaneous moral panics do occur), and often include a large element of mass hysteria. A moral panic is specifically framed in terms of morality, and usually expressed as outrage rather than unadulterated fear. Though not always, very often moral panics revolve around issues of sex and sexuality. A widely circulated and new-seeming [[w:urban legend|urban legend]] is frequently involved. These panics can sometimes lead to mob violence. The term was coined by Stanley Cohen in 1972 to describe media coverage of [[w:Mods and Rockers|Mods and Rockers]] in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.

Recent moral panics in the UK have included the ongoing tabloid newspaper campaign against pedophiles, which led to the assault and persecution of a pediatrician by an angry, if semi-literate, mob in August 2000, and that surrounding the murder of James Bulger in Liverpool, England in 1993. [[w:moral panic|(See this page for examples of moral panic.)]]

==Riots==
[[File:Protest 0112.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Confrontation between protesters and riot police during a Belizian riot, 2005.]]

A riot is a form of civil disorder characterized by disorganized groups lashing out in a sudden and intense rash of violence, vandalism or other crime. While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots are typically chaotic and exhibit herd-like behavior. Riots often occur in reaction to a perceived grievance or out of dissent. Historically, riots have occurred due to poor working or living conditions, government oppression, taxation or conscription, conflicts between races or religions, the outcome of a sporting event, or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances. Riots typically involve vandalism and the destruction of private and public property. The specific property to be targeted varies depending on the cause of the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.

==Mass Hysteria==
''Hysteria'' is a diagnostic label applied to a state of mind, one of unmanageable fear or emotional excesses. People who are &quot;hysterical&quot; often lose self-control due to the overwhelming fear.

The term also occurs in the phrase ''mass hysteria'' to describe mass public near-panic reactions. It is commonly applied to the waves of popular medical problems that ''everyone gets'' in response to news articles, such as the [[w:yuppy flu|yuppy flu]] of the late 1980s. A similar usage refers to any sort of ''public wave'' phenomenon, and has been used to describe the periodic widespread reappearance and public interest in UFO reports, crop circles, and similar examples. 

Hysteria is often associated with movements like the [[w:Salem Witch Trials|Salem Witch Trials]], [[w:Red Scare|the Red Scare]], [[w:McCarthyism|McCarthyism]], and [[w:Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic ritual abuse]], where it is better understood through the related sociological term of ''moral panic''.

Mass hysterias can also exhibit themselves in the sudden onset of [[w:psychogenic|psychogenic]] illnesses, or illnesses that are the result of psychology and not an external source (e.g., like a pollutant or infectious agent).  A recent example of psychogenic illness resulting from mass hysteria occurred in [[w:Jilin|Jilin]], China in 2009 when hundreds of workers at an acrylic yarn factory began to fall ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs2009&quot;&gt;Jacobs, Andrew. 2009. “Chinese Workers Say Illness Is Real, Not Hysteria.” The New York Times, July 30 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/world/asia/30jilin.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss (Accessed July 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors in China determined that, for most of those who fell ill, there were no physical indications of poisoning, which is what the workers claimed caused the illness.

==Fads==
A fad, also known as a craze, refers to a fashion that becomes popular in a culture (or subcultures) relatively quickly, remains popular, often for a rather brief period, then loses popularity dramatically. ([[w:fad|See this page for a list of fads.]])

==Rumors==
A '''rumor''' is often viewed as &quot;an unverified account or explanation of events circulating from person to person and pertaining to an object, event, or issue in public concern&quot; (p. 33)&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1951&quot;&gt;Peterson, Warren, and Noel Gist. 1951. Rumor and Public Opinion. The American Journal of Sociology. 57(2):159-167.&lt;/ref&gt;, though the definition can vary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendleton1998&quot;&gt;Pendleton, S.C. (1998), 'Rumor research revisited and expanded', Language &amp; Communication, vol. 1. no. 18, pp. 69-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumors generally involve some kind of a statement the veracity of which is not quickly or ever confirmed.

Rumors have three basic characteristics 
#they're transmitted by word of mouth
#they provide &quot;information&quot; about a person, happening, or condition
#they express and gratify the emotional needs of the community 

There are also various types of rumors, including:
#Pipe dream rumors, which reflect public desires and wished-for outcomes
#Bogie or fear rumors that reflect feared outcomes
#Wedge-driving rumors that intend to undermine group loyalty or interpersonal relations

As rumors travel they grow shorter, more concise, and more easily grasped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allport1951&quot;&gt;Allport, Gordon, and Joseph Postman. 1947. Psychology of Rumor. Russell and Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;  About 70% of details in a message are lost in the first 5 to 6 transmissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allport1951&quot;/&gt;  Negative rumors are more likely to be disseminated than positive rumors.

Rumors may be part of a collective explanation process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordia2004&quot;&gt;Bordia, Prashant, and Nicolas DiFonzo. 2004. Problem Solving in Social Interactions on the Internet: Rumor as Social Cognition. Social Psychology Quarterly. 61(1):33-49.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordia and DiFonzo found that 29.4% of statements on archived internet message boards are sensemaking statements that attempt to solve problems.  The rest of the discussion revolves around these statements.

[[File:ObamaSouthCarolina.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two prominent rumors about Barack Obama circulated during his 2008 Presidential Campaign, that he was not born in the U.S. and that he is Muslim.]]

Rumors may also be be political communication strategies. Media and particular cultural-historical conditions may facilitate a rumor's diffusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harsin2006&quot;&gt;Harsin, Jayson. 2006. The Rumour Bomb: Theorising the Convergence of New and Old Trends in Mediated US Politics. Southern Review: Communication, Politics &amp; Culture. 39(1):84-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, Jayson Harsin introduced the concept of the &quot;rumor bomb&quot; to describe the widespread phenomenon of rumoresque communication in contemporary relations between media and politics, especially within the complex convergence of multiple forms of media, from cell phones and internet, to radio, TV, and print. Harsin treats rumor as a particular rhetorical strategy. For Harsin a &quot;rumor bomb&quot; extends the definition of rumor into a political communication concept with the following features:
#A crisis of verification. A crisis of verification is perhaps the most salient and politically dangerous aspect of rumor.
#A context of public uncertainty or anxiety about a political group, figure, or cause, which the rumor bomb overcomes or transfers onto an opponent. 
#A clearly partisan even if an anonymous source (eg. &quot;an unnamed advisor to the president&quot;), which seeks to profit politically from the rumor bomb’s diffusion. 
#A rapid diffusion via highly developed electronically mediated societies where news travels fast.  

Examples of rumors include:
*the alleged removal of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq to Syria&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSUN&quot;&gt;http://www.nysun.com/foreign/saddams-wmd-moved-to-syria-an-israeli-says/24480/&lt;/ref&gt;
*sexual innuendo in [[w:The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)#Controversy|The Little Mermaid]] adaptation by Disney
*sexual innuendo in [[w:The_Lion_King#Alleged_subliminal_messaging|The Lion King]], another Disney film
*sexual innuendo in [[w:Aladdin_(1992_film)#Controversies|Aladdin]], another Disney film
*that John McCain had an illegitimate black child &lt;ref name=&quot;BostonGlobe2004&quot;&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/&lt;/ref&gt;
*that Barack Obama is a [[w:Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Obama.27s_name|Muslim]] and [[w:Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories|was not born in the U.S.]]

ISBN 0697075257&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[w:game Theory|game theory]] to suggest that even a panic in a burning theater can reflect rational calculation: If members of the audience decide that it is more rational to run to the exits than to walk, the result may look like an animal-like stampede without in fact being irrational. In a series of empirical studies of assemblies of people, McPhail (1991)&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhail1991&quot;&gt;McPhail, Clark. 1991. The Myth of the Madding Crowd. .Aldine. ISBN 0202303756&lt;/ref&gt; argues that crowds vary along a number of dimensions, and that traditional stereotypes of emotionality and unanimity often do not describe what happens in crowds.

The Network+ Exam is just one exam, and for those who took it before January 1st, 2011, it never expires. (Those taking the test after that date must either retake it at a set interval or submit proof of their continuing education in networking. The COMPTIA website has more details.) It has 100 multiple-choice &quot;situational and identification&quot; questions. Basically, if you know your hardware and software, as well as know what to do in a given situation, you should pass. You are given 90 minutes to take the exam, which should be plenty if you are fully prepared. It's recommended by CompTIA that you already have an A+ Certification under your belt and at least nine months networking experience, but the only prerequisite for taking the exam is paying the exam fee ($240 US). Minimum passing score is 720 on a scale of 100-900, but that doesn't really mean what you think it means: some questions are worth more than others. The test is available in English, German, Japanese and Korean.

While the A+ certification is definitely an industry standard and a prerequisite for many jobs, the Network+ is less so, but gaining in popularity. 

The goals of the Network+ Certification is to ensure that employers hire people who will not need to be trained in network fundamentals before being hired. A Network+ Certified tech should be able to make recommendations for installing or expanding a network, document and perform preventative maintenance on a network, and troubleshoot network problems as they arise. Having an A+ and Network+ Certification ''should'' mean that you are fully capable of being an on-site technical support person, a network administrator of a local area network, or a valuable asset to an enterprise-level networking team, but not exactly be running it.

==Scope of this Wikibook==

The scope of this book is to provide a solid foundation for network administration. It should include all of the information that is needed to pass the CompTIA Network+ Exam, and match its scope. In fact, the finished product ''should'' look like the official CompTIA Network+ exam objectives, but expanded with more information and explanation.

==Structure of this Wikibook==

This &quot;book&quot; is not a &quot;book&quot; per se, but rather a few introductory pages and, more importantly, a study guide with a collection of links to articles in Wikipedia and the most relevant information summarized for each concept. The reason for this is twofold: there is no need to &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot; when there are so many great articles that serve the purpose of explaining, say, the [[wikipedia:OSI model|OSI model]]. Two, a  person interested in this &quot;book&quot; is one that wants to take and pass the Network+ Exam, and this method may be better suited to them than a traditional book, allowing them to quickly review concepts just before the exam or delve into the details of anything not immediately familiar. 

==Exam overview==

The objectives of the Network+ exam are broken down into 6 categories: 

;[[Network Plus Certification/Technologies|Network Technologies]]
:Understand the protocols used over a network and the ports they use, the addressing systems used on a network, and how a network can be implemented via wireless technologies.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Media and Topologies|Network Media and Topologies]]
:Identify cables and connectors used to network computers together, understand the various manners in which a network can be physically laid out, and have knowledge of the standards used for communication within a network and between networks.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Devices|Network Devices]]
:Differentiate between the various devices used on a network and understand their function, installation, and configuration.  Have deeper knowledge of the functions of a switch and the factors to consider when setting up a wireless network.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Management|Network Management]]
:Understand the different conceptual layers in the networking model, the need for proper network documentation, the process of troubleshooting network problems, and the options for increasing network performance.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Tools|Network Tools]]
:Be aware of the command line, software, and hardware tools available for installation, testing, and troubleshooting networks.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Security|Network Security]]
:Know what hardware devices, software, and policies will ensure the security of the data and devices on a network and be aware of the corresponding threats they are designed to guard against.  Have knowledge of the methods users can use to securely access a network and how their identities can be verified before granting access in the first place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">okay, i daredn't change this myself before being certain, as the author has clearly made a lot of effort with this piece. three things:
# mussolini's agression was not necessarily 'foolish' - in principle it could have been bold and daring - he just didn't have the calibre and quantity of troops, mechanized divisions etc.
# battle of britian and russia - hitler had always been planning agression against the soviets. The whole idea of invading france after a pact with stalin was to avoid a war on two fronts. His plan was to sweep over western europe, including britain if he had to. His long term goal was always to invade russia, he didn't 'then turn to russia' after failing to conquer britain. After all, they were idealogical enemies. He greatly respected the british (a dubious honour for us), and didn't have any huge desire to invade them - that was arguably to prove his downfall. He never turned the full might of germany's war machine against the island. God knows what would have happened had he done so.
# &quot;The Worldwide Great Depression&quot; was naturally worldwide - that, in my experience, has always been taken as given. Is 'worldwide' really necessary? I have always read it simply as &quot;The Great Depression&quot;

What do most people find a more preferable way to break up sections of WWII on a page; by Theatre/Campaign or Year?

== Pacific theatre has US bias - no Burma campaign ==

The pacific theatre headings don't seem to cover the Burma campaign at all. Although I say US bias, I believe that there was US involvment there as well. In the UK it is often called the forgotten war. --[[User:David Woolley|David Woolley]] 13:53, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

'''Pan frying''' is [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] in a [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pan]]. Typically it implies that a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] is used with an amount of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. Pan frying would be used for something like thin white fish or [[cookbook:trout|trout]]. It's also used for [[cookbook:browning|browning]] chicken, Quorn meat, and tofu.

When pan frying, the amount of oil in the frying pan is adjusted to come part way up the side of the food being fried. Generally, the bottom 1/3 to 1/2 of the food will be in the oil. The amount of oil is between that used in [[cookbook:deep frying|deep frying]], where the food in completely immersed in oil, and [[cookbook:sautéing|sautéing]], where only the bottom surface of the food is in contact with the oil.</text>

'''Red Pepper''' is an ambiguous term. Certainly, it involves a red-colored [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]. Beyond that though...

*ripe [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]]
*powdered dried [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|Cayenne peppers]]
*whole red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] (generally hot ones)

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

This seems to be a pretty shoddy translation from some other language. What on earth is a geneeskundeuniversiteit, and why don't we spell it geneeskunde-universiteit, as &quot;Het Groene Boekje&quot; tells us? Is it a translation of the American word &quot;medical school&quot;?

In The Netherlands and Belgium alike, medicine is taught at a &quot;geneeskundefaculteit&quot;, that is, a department of medicine, which tends to be affiliated with a larger &quot;universiteit&quot;. It is emphatically *not* particularly expensive to study medicine, since the departments of medicine charge the same amount of tuition as other university departments.

And then the sentence &quot;Elly is zeker mooi&quot;. Although &quot;zeker&quot; literally translates as the adverb &quot;surely&quot;, it is also used as an unstressed particle to create a rhetorical question with positive answer expected and slight disapproval implied (or something like that). The Dutch system of particles is surely interesting and complex, but this is a very confusing example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A minor problem with 'Algebraic Operations on Sequences'

I believe that there is a problem with the 4th result (about quotient of 2 limits)
I reckon it is not enough that y_n is non-zero for all n, but believe that we also need to assume that the limit of the y's is also nonzero. Otherwise there would exist a counter-example where the y_n are alternatively positive and negative, while tending to zero.

Does anyone agree?

[[User:82.27.163.136|82.27.163.136]] 10:07, 18 February 2006 (UTC)madmath789

Yes, your correct, and now the article assumes the limit is not zero, but allows some of the y_n's to be zero. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:41, 5 January 2009 (UTC)


==Completeness==
There seems to be a general confusion here about the differences between the least upper bound property and completeness.  In particular some of the theorems stated are not equivalent to the least upper bound axiom, and hence could not be used as an axiom defining the real numbers. I think we should be a bit more careful about how we use the term completeness.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:45, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Definition==

Recall that a function from a set X to a set Y is a mapping &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; such that f(x) is a unique element of Y for every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  In analysis, we tend to talk about functions from subsets &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.


The definition for the limit of a function is much the same as the definition for a sequence.  In fact, as we will see later, it is possible to define functional limits in terms of sequential limits.  For the moment, however, let us just give the definition:  


Given a subset &lt;math&gt;A \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0: \exists \delta: 0&lt;|x-c|&lt;\delta \implies |f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;


The requirement &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is somewhat technical.  It is an expression of the idea that the behavior of a function '''near''' a point shouldn't be affected by its behavior '''at''' the point.  Thus f(x) need not be defined at c to have a limit there.


This definition gives a lot of people a lot of trouble, so it is best to spend some time puzzling it out, working examples, etc.  One way to conceptualize the definition is this:  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; means that we can make f(x) as close as we like to L by making x close to c.  


We can also define what it means for a function to diverge to infinity, and what it means for a function to have a limit at infinity:


*We say that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = \infty&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall M&gt;0: \exists \delta: 0&lt;|x-c|&lt;\delta \implies f(x)&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

*We say that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = -\infty&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall M&gt;0: \exists \delta: 0&lt;|x-c|&lt;\delta \implies f(x)&lt;-M&lt;/math&gt;

*We say that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0: \exists M: x &gt; M \implies |f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

*We say that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0: \exists M: x &lt; -M \implies |f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.


As an exercise, see if you can define what it means for a function to have limit &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==Sequential Limits==

We might just as well have given the following definition of the limit:


Given a subset &lt;math&gt;A \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall (x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n \not= c, \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(x_n) = c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(x_n)) = L
&lt;/math&gt;


Note that the requirement &lt;math&gt;x_n \not= c&lt;/math&gt; corresponds with the requirement &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  


As an exercise to test your understanding, prove that these two definitions are equivelant.  Note that taking the contrapositive gives a good criterion for determining whether or not a function diverges:


If &lt;math&gt;\exists (x_n), (y_n): (x_n)\rightarrow c, (y_n)\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(x_n)) \not= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(y_n))&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.


We will be using this formulation extensively in the examples.

==Algebraic Operations/Ordering Theorems==
By applying the corresponding theorems for sequential limits, we find that functional limits are unique, that they preserve algebraic operations and ordering, and that a corresponding &quot;Squeeze Theorem&quot; holds.  If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}g(x) = M&lt;/math&gt;, then:


* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} af(x) = aL&lt;/math&gt; 

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) + g(x) = L + M&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)g(x) = LM&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L}{M}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming 
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; are non-zero.

* If &lt;math&gt;\exists \delta: f(x) &gt; g(x) \forall x \in A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L &gt; M&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;L=M, f(x) \leq h(x) \leq g(x) \implies \lim_{x \rightarrow c}h(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;

* If L = 0 and h(x) is bounded, then  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)h(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples===

We'll be giving many more examples in the section on continuity.  Unfortunately, it is hard to properly define many of the most elementary functions without appealing to derivatives, integrals, and power series, so many of the examples here may seem a bit contrived.  We'll start with a relatively nice function and move on to some nastier, unintuitive ones, with the goal being some kind of intuition about what can go right and wrong with limits.


* Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left \{
\begin{matrix}
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x = 0 \\
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x \not= 0 \\
\end{matrix}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.




* Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left \{
\begin{matrix}
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x\leq 0 \\
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x &gt; 0 \\
\end{matrix}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;  does not exist.

Consider the sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_n) = (\frac{1}{n}), (y_n = (\frac{-1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;.  Each converges to zero, but &lt;math&gt;(f(x_n)) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(f(y_n)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and these have different limits as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the limit does not exist.


The next example is often given as a demonstration of just how nasty functions can get.  It is not continuous at any point of its domain.

* Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left \{
\begin{matrix}
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x \in \mathbb{Q} \\
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q} \\
\end{matrix}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist for any &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given &lt;math&gt;x \in R&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be any rational number in the interval &lt;math&gt;(\frac{-1}{n},\frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; be any irrational number in the same interval (&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; are gauranteed to exist by density of the rationals and irrationals).  Given any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0, |x_n - 0| &lt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y_n - 0| &lt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;(x_n),(y_n) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.  However, (f(x_n)) = 1 and (f(y_n)) = 0, so their limits are 1 and 0.  Since these are not equal, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y\rightarrow x} f(y)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.


Now we finally get to a limit that actually exists.  Don't get too excited, though.  The function is still extremely nasty (nastier than the previous two, perhaps), and the fact that it has a limit everywhere is one of its nastier aspects.


* Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left \{
\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{q} &amp; \mbox{if }x = \frac{p}{q} \in \mathbb{Q}\\
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q} \\
\end{matrix}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.


The idea is to show that the denominators of the rational numbers near f(x) are arbitrarily large.  Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N} &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;S = {\frac{p}{q} \in Q: 0&lt;|\frac{p}{q} - c|&lt; 1, q \leq N}&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a finite set, since the numerators and the denominators are bounded and can therefore only take on a finite number of values.  Thus, let &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; be the element of S such that &lt;math&gt;|\frac{p}{q} - c|&lt;/math&gt; is minimized, and let &lt;math&gt;\delta = |\frac{p}{q} - c| = \delta&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\forall 0&lt;|x-c|&lt;\delta: |f(x)-0| = |f(x)| = 0 &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;(if x is irrational) or &lt;math&gt;|f(x)-0|= |f(x)| &lt; \frac{1}{N} &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus 
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition on an Arbitrary Metric Space==

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(Y,d_2)&lt;/math&gt; be metric spaces. And let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;

The limit as &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;a \in X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;L \in Y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0 \text{ }\exists \delta \text{ such that if }
0&lt;d_1(x,a)&lt; \delta \text{, } d_2(f(x),L) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

This is denoted &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} f = L&lt;/math&gt;</text>

'''Chocolate truffles''' are soft chocolate balls. This recipe makes about 24.

==Ingredients==
*8[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (227[[Cookbook:g|g]]) bittersweet/plain [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] (chopped into small pieces)
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (likely Imperial ones: 108 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], 7.2 US tablespoons, or 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] shy of 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]) [[Cookbook:Double Cream|double cream]] (48% fat)
*[[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
*[[Cookbook:Icing sugar|Icing sugar]]

In the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], try using 2 tablespoons unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] with 5 1/3 tablespoons heavy cream.

==Procedure==
# Put the chocolate in a bowl and set over (a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]]).
# Heat until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally.
# Remove from the pot of hot water.
# Add the cream and stir well.
# Leave to cool.
# Cover and refrigerate for 35 minutes or until the mixture is just firm enough to hold its shape.
# [[Cookbook:Sifting|Sift]] a layer of cocoa powder and icing sugar together onto a plate.  The icing sugar is to make sure the cocoa powder isn't too bitter.  
# Take a heaped [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoonful]] of the chocolate mixture and shape it into a ball.
# Roll each truffle in the cocoa powder/icing sugar to coat all over in an even layer.  Shake off the excess and set on a tray.
# Continue shaping and coating the remaining truffles. Set on a tray, making sure they don't touch each other.
# Cover and refrigerate. Remove 15 minutes before serving.


=== Variations ===
* Vanila Truffle - Use White chocolate, reducing the icing sugar to preference. Add about 1/2 tablespoon of vanila extract.

* Citrus Zest - Use white chocolate, reducing icing sugar content to prefernece. Add about 1 to 3/4 of a tablespoon of diluted lime coridial, and a couple of pinches of ground zest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Religious Development===
--
The most general sociological theory of the formation of religions so far is contained in R. Stark &amp; W. S. Bainbridge's book &quot;Theory of Religion&quot;. This theory is outlined roughly below:

Most religions start out their lives as cults or sects, i.e. groups in high tension with the surrounding society. Over time, they tend to either die out, or become more established, mainstream and in less tension with society. Cults are new groups with a new novel theology, while sects are attempts to return mainstream religions to (what the sect views as) their original purity. Mainstream established groups are called denominations. The comments below about cult formation apply equally well to sect formation.

There are four models of cult formation: the Psychopathological Model, the Entrepreneurial Model, the Social Model and the Normal Revelations model.

According to the Psychopathological Model, religions are founded during a period of severe stress in the life of the founder. The founder suffers from psychological problems, which they resolve through the founding of the religion. (The development of the religion is for them a form of self-therapy, or self-medication.)

According to the Entrepreneurial Model, founders of religions act like entrepreneurs, developing new products (religions) to sell to consumers (to convert people to). According to this model, most founders of new religions already have experience in several religious groups before they begin their own. They take ideas from the pre-existing religions, and try to improve on them to make them more popular.

The Social Model emphasises not the founder of the religion, but rather the early religious group. According to this model, religions are founded by means of social implosions. Members of the religious group spend less and less time with people outside the group, and more and more time with each other within it. The level of affection and emotional bonding between members of a group increases, and their emotional bonds to members outside the group diminish. According to the social model, when a social implosion occurs, the group will naturally develop a new theology and rituals to accompany it.

The Normal Revelations model was added to the theory by Stark in a latter work. According to the Normal Revelations model, religions are founded when the founder interprets ordinary natural phenomena as supernatural; for instance, ascribing his or her own creativity in inventing the religion to that of the deity.

Some religions are better described by one model than another, though all apply to differing degrees to all religions.

Once a cult or sect has been founded, the next problem for the founder is to convert new members to it. Prime candidates for religious conversion are those with an openness to religion, but who do not belong or fit well in any existing religious group. Those with no religion or no interest in religion are difficult to convert, especially since the cult and sect beliefs are so extreme by the standards of the surrounding society. But those already happy members of a religious group are difficult to convert as well, since they have strong social links to their pre-existing religion and are unlikely to want to sever them in order to join a new one. The best candidates for religious conversion are those who are members of or have been associated with religious groups (thereby showing an interest or openness to religion), yet exist on the fringe of these groups, without strong social ties to prevent them from joining a new group.

Potential converts vary in their level of social connection. New religions best spread through pre-existing friendship networks. Converts who are marginal with few friends are easy to convert, but having few friends to convert they cannot add much to the further growth of the organization. Converts with a large social network are harder to convert, since they tend to have more invested in mainstream society; but once converted they yield many new followers through their friendship network.

Cults initially can have quite high growth rates; but as the social networks that initially feed them are exhausted, their growth rate falls quickly. On the other hand, the [[exponential growth|rate of growth is exponential]] (ignoring the limited supply of potential converts): the more converts you have, the more missionaries you can have out looking for new converts. But nonetheless it can take a very long time for religions to grow to a large size by natural growth. This often leads to cult leaders giving up after several decades, and withdrawing the cult from the world.

It is difficult for cults and sects to maintain their initial enthusiasm for more than about a generation. As children are born into the cult or sect, members begin to demand a more stable life. When this happens, cults tend to lose or de-emphasise many of their more radical beliefs, and become more open to the surrounding society; they then become denominations.

The goal or dream of most founders of religions is to convert their entire society; but of the myriad religions founded throughout history, few have been very successful. Most of the world's religious people adhere to one of a few major religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism). It is very difficult for a religion to grow to this size.  Most of these religions (especially Christianity) became established when they were adopted by politically powerful individuals. The religion of the common people took much longer to change (sometimes centuries).

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Dutch Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]

This is an old [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Dutch]] recipe for a very 'powerful' chocolate pie.

== Ingredients ==

=== Crust ===
* 2-3 packs of 'marie' biscuits (also known as 'rich tea' biscuits)
* cold black coffee or other taste makers

=== Filling ===
* 150/200 gram [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
* 150/200 gram [[Cookbook:Granulated_Sugar| granulated sugar]]
* 250-500 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (use about 750grams or something for more then 2 layers of biscuits, and adjust cocoa/sugar amount to match or adjust to taste)
* some [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (about 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]])

=== Topping ===
* chocolate sprinkles 

=== Tools ===
* A dish of some sort with high enough edges (this is important too, an apple pie baking mold or similar '[[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform]]' will probably do. about 26[[Cookbook:cm|cm]] in diameter)
* A cooking pot that can take all the filling ingredients
* A spoon (preferably a [[Cookbook:Wooden_Spoon|wooden spoon]])

== Procedure ==
# Take a wide/big pan and melt the butter
# Add the sugar and stir/dissolve this into the butter
# Stir the cocoa through the sugar/butter mixture. optionally make this a little more liquid with some milk (not too much!!)
# Take the biscuits and dip them into the cold black coffee. put these on the bottom of the dish.
# After creating a layer of biscuits pour/smear the chocolate mix on top of it then make another layer with dipped biscuits and pour/smear another layer of chocolate
# Repeat this until you run out of chocolate/biscuits.
# Finally place the chocolate sprinkles on top and put it in the fridge until it's hard enough to consume.
# Enjoy!

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==
* Measurements shouldn't be taken to be precise, play with the amounts to your likings
* Milk is optional, too much will make the cake less solid
* Coffee is optional. Addition is to taste.
===Vegan Variation===
Remove the milk, remove the chocolate sprinkles(unless you have vegan ones) and replace the butter by 2/3 [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]] butter and 1/3 [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or just all margarine.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Conjugation of Double Bonds===
A diene is said to be conjugated when its double bonds are not directly next to each other, but rather separated by a single bond in between them (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  

Conjugated dienes are particularly stable due to the delocalization of the pi electrons along sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized orbitals, and they also tend to undergo reactions atypical of double bond chemistry.  For instance, chlorine can add to 1,3-butadiene (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to yield a mixture of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene (ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHCl-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 1,4-dichloro-2-butene (ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl).  These are known as 1,2 addition and 1,4 addition, respectively.  1,2-addition is favored in mild reaction (irreversible) conditions (the kinetically preferred product) and 1,4-addition is favored in harsher reaction (reversible) conditions (which results in the thermodynamically preferred product).  

Another interesting conjugated diene reaction is the Diels-Alder reaction, in which a conjugated diene reacts with an alkene (called a  &quot;dienophile&quot; in this case) in order to yield a cyclic product. In Diels-Alder type reactions, the substituent on the dienophile will go into either an exo or endo position in the final product.  (&quot;''Endo''&quot; in this case meaning ''trans to the substituents on the ends of the diene'', and &quot;''exo''&quot; meaning the same thing, only ''cis''.)

[[Image:01-rhubarb_stalks.jpg|thumb|right|storebought rhubarb stalks]]
Rhubarb is a relative of buckwheat and has an earthy, sour flavor. Rhubarb thrives in cold climates and originated in Western [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibet]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mongolia|Mongolia]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Siberia|Siberia]] and neighboring areas. The traditional role was medicinal &amp;mdash; the dried root was a popular remedy for a wide range of illnesses. Its primary function was to induce vomiting, although rhubarb is also a mild astringent. This medicinal role caused the price of the dried root to rise. In 1542, rhubarb sold for ten times the price of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]] and in 1657 rhubarb sold for over twice the price of opium in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of England|England]] (Schneider, 2001). Beginning in the eighteenth century, rhubarb began to be consumed in foods, primarily drinks and [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] [[Cookbook:Stew|stews]].

Botanically speaking, rhubarb is considered a vegetable, but it's most often treated as a fruit — though it's rarely eaten raw. Just like fresh [[Cookbook:Cranberry|cranberries]], rhubarb is almost unbearably tart on its own and needs the sweetness of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], or fruit juice added to it to balance out the acidity. Rhubarb's nickname is the &quot;pie plant&quot; because that is the primary use for this vegetable.

Rhubarb was introduced to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] at the end of the eighteenth century. Today most rhubarb is frozen for commercial and institutional use; only about a quarter of the crop is sold fresh.

==Selection==
Hothouse, or strawberry, rhubarb appears in markets as early as January and continues to be stocked through April. Field-grown, or cherry, rhubarb begins to arrive in markets in March and can continue to arrive through the summer (depending on the area where it is grown). Spring stalks are the juiciest and most-tender.

Fresh stalks are flat, not curled or limp. When stalks that have been pulled-not cut-from the field are available; choose them. Pulled stalks dry out less rapidly. Size is no indicator of tenderness. Deep red stalks are sweeter and richer.

==Storage==
Wrap rhubarb in plastic wrap and store it in the coldest part of the refrigerator for up to one week. Cooked and raw rhubarb both freeze well.

==Preparation==
Cut off and discard and leaves (see warning below). Rinse and trim from base and tip. You may peel or cut with the skin intact. Remember to cook only in non-aluminum pots only due to the acidic nature of rhubarb.

==Warning==
Never eat rhubarb leaves, cooked or raw. Eating the leaves can be poisonous because they contain oxalates. This toxin, plus another unknown toxin also found in the leaves, has been reported to cause poisoning when large quantities of raw or cooked leaves are ingested.

Rhubarb stalks are also rich in vitamin K, important to note for people taking bloodthinners.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">From Hatfield, Elaine. Equity Theory and Research. Blumberg, Herbert H. Small Groups and Social Interaction.  John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.; 1983.
Four Propositions:
1: Individuals will try to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes equal rewards minus punishments)
2a: Groups (or rather the individuals comprising these groups) can maximize collective reward by evoloving accepted systems for equitably apportioning resources among members.  Thus, groups will evolve such systems of equity, and will attempt to induce members to accept and adhere to these systems.
2b: Groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish members who treat each other inequitably.
3: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they will become distressed. The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress they will feel.
4. Individuals who discover they are in inequitable relationships will attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity.  The greater the inequity that exists, the more distress they will feel, and the harder they will try to restore equity.

equity is in the eye of the beholder

only two ways to alter equity - altering their own or their partner's relative gains

applies to: exploiter/victim relationships, philanthropist/recipient relationships, business relationships, and intimate relationships

Notes:  
lot of problems with this theory:
-still isn't deterministic; there is no way of knowing if a person will try to resolve the inequity and, if so, how
-completely subjective - everyone's definition of equity is unique

Formula:
&lt;math&gt; \frac{(O_A-I_A)}{(|I_A|)^{k_A}} = \frac{(O_B-I_B)}{(|I_B|)^{k_B}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt; designate a scrutineer's perception of Person A's and Person B's inputs
*&lt;math&gt;O_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_B&lt;/math&gt; designate his or her perception of Person A's and Person B's outcomes
*and &lt;math&gt;|I_A|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|I_B|&lt;/math&gt; designate the absolute value of their inputs

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trying to get a Wiki book book started on Iraq WMD. If there is support it will go forward as a wiki project otherwise ill take it offline and do it as a personal (c) project. If enough rational people collaborate here great. 

I am only retaining copyright for reasons that will be obvious to anyone who reads copyright discussion threads but knee jerk immature ultraleftist probably will (1) not understand and (2) use as a basis to attack my sincerity and credibility. At least that is what they have done in the past.

I will post a personally copywrited article based on the opening quote, and once I have done that I will back revise the post with the credit.

I have studied the issue in depth and my peculiar take on it is this -  I was opposed to the invasion and highly sceptical about all of the big issues - the aluminum tubes, yellowcake etcetera.

However, I have also studied somewhat the history of the saddam wmd in the 90's .

Anyone who does that, a whole new picture emerges. 

Then it is apparent that the right, while getting carried away, was not a glaringly unreasonable as the left believes.

Thus, I am right down the center on many aspects of the issue.

Based on my experience on the web, it is almost impossible to have a NPOV discussion of this issue on either side.

I hope this works...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Old Text=

(User:- This tutorial, though still under construction, is very helpful because it addresses what I believe is a new panel, 'Links and Pipeline', in 2.42. A lot of the other tutorials seem to date before this addition. It is also very explanatory which helps a lot. Thanks.)

Below is old text for this page.  I want to preserve it to use elsewhere.  Please disregard for now.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Materials are what gives an object its basic colour and 'feel'.  For example, plastic is quite hard and smooth so it reflects light well, while cotton is soft so it mostly only reflects ambient light.
&lt;/p&gt;

=Adding A Material=
&lt;p&gt;
To add a material, select your object, and click the Shading button (a shaded sphere) or press F5.
In the Material box, click &quot;add new&quot;.  (If you can't see this button, your object already has a material.) Your object now has a material and you can change lots of settings.  The most interesting ones are Textures (see next page), the Colour and Alpha (transparency) sliders in the same box, and the next two boxes, Shaders and Mirror Transparency.  Your material will be called something like Material.001.  You can change this name by clicking on the name box.  Naming things is good!  It makes things much less confusing later on.
&lt;/p&gt;

=Shaders=
&lt;p&gt;Shaders are what makes the difference between the way light behaves on cotton, plastic and many other objects.  The reflectivity slider controls how much ambient light is reflected (move it and watch the preview).  The Halo button turns your object's vertices into points of light.  Specularity controls how much light bounces directly off objects (think sunlight reflecting off the sea), and hardness controls the angle at which specularity is noticible.
Translucency is used to light a surface if the side facing away from the eye point is receiving light. Ambient colour sets the amount of global ambient color the material receives.
Emittivity will make the material glow in the dark (good if a particular object is too dark).
&lt;/p&gt;

=Mirror Transparency=
&lt;p&gt;
The mirror transparency tab is used to control reflections and transparency.  You should have raytracing turned on on the render tab to use these settings (Ray button after you press F10).&lt;br&gt;
Reflectivity makes your object reflect other objects.  Press Ray Mirror to turn it on and the slider to control the amount.  Depth controls how many times a reflection can bounce before it reaches the camera (if two reflective objects are next to each other, they will only reflect each other this number of times).  
Ray Transparency is used to make objects see-through.  The Alpha slider on the materials tab controls how transparent the material is; IOR stands for Index of Refraction - how much light bends when it passes into or out of the object.  (If it is 1, light passes straight through and the object often looks fake.  Glass has a typical IOR of 1.5, and water is about 1.33.)  ZTransp does not rely on raytracing, but Ray Transp looks much better.  The object will not be transparent without ZTransp or Ray Transp checked.

EDIT: Translucency will make the object translucent. 
translucent means:
Transmitting light but causing sufficient diffusion to prevent perception of distinct images.
(clear)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=Updating=

I am updating the text so it fits 2.59 I have done the first part until Specifying Colors &lt;s&gt;and hope to do the rest asap.&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; done!

Good on ya! BTW you may want to get an account if you're going to do this consistently. --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 08:24, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

[[Image:NCI_flour_tortillas.jpg|thumb|right|Flour tortillas]]

[[Cookbook:Tortilla|Tortillas]] are a type of [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[:Category:Central American recipes|Central America]] commonly made from [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa]]. This recipe is for the wheat flour variety.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 cups (950ml) unbleached all purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening
* 1 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water, more if needed
* 4 teaspoons baking powder (optional, for thicker and chewier tortillas)

== Procedure ==
# In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and baking powder. 
# With a pastry blender, a fork or your hands, gradually work in the lard or shortening until it is all incorporated. 
# Add enough warm water to make a soft but not sticky dough. 
# Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 5 minutes.
# Divide the dough into 1/4 cup (3 oz / 90g) portions and form them into balls.
# Roll each ball into a flat round about 6 inches (15cm) in diameter and 1/8 inches (0.3cm) thick.
# Heat a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. 
# Place the tortillas one at a time into the dry hot skillet; cook until brown on one side, then turn and brown the other side. (approx. 1 minute/side)
# Remove from the skillet and keep warm in cloth towel.

The '''snow pea''' is a type of pea that is eaten whole, immature, and still in the pod. It is commonly [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]] in [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asian cuisine]]. They can also be eaten as sprouts.

Snow peas should be shiny and flat, with very small peas that are barely visible through the pod. Smaller pods are the sweetest and the most tender.

It is best to serve fresh peas the day they are purchased. If they must be stored, place them in a perforated plastic bag in the refrigerator. Do not wash them before they are stored.

Rinse snow peas before use. To trim snow peas, cut the tips from both ends of the pod. This can be done with kitchen shears.</text>

Dutch Cuisine is usually quite simple. A traditional dinner (since about 19th century) usually consists of boiled potatoes, panfried meat (popular choices are: pork chops, beef balls, thick sliced pork bellies) and a boiled vegetable (e.g. cauliflower, green beans, broccoli). A dinner is not complete without some sort of dessert.

&lt;nowiki&gt;Didn´t help me- I selected the texture I wanted to use, but it didn´t apply on screen- I don´t know what to do, so that the texture is taken over to the model...something like an Enter-Button...?!&lt;/nowiki&gt;


=Applying textures=

I'm having trouble actually applying my texture to a plane. Can anyone help?

[[File:StucciTextureShadow.png|left|150px]]
After added the Stucci texture and affected it with the normal, an aliased shadow will appear in our rendered work. I fixed it by pressing 'Nor' button in the 'Map To' tab again, so the text 'Nor' turns yellow.

I wonder how come this shadow appear and why it's quality is rather low? --[[User:Weeix|Weeix]] ([[User talk:Weeix|talk]]) 15:41, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

i cant seem to apply this tutorial to the blender 2.61 version that &quot;spotty&quot; button that your supposed to press is not on my blender program or has another name that isnt spotty button so i cannot complete this tutorial wich i really wish i could.

This Tutorial is actually very hard to follow for a Noob like me with Blender version 2.60 + Updates would be nice for these and many other tutorials on this book.</text>

While topics in contract law may be universal,  this book will focus primarily on the American (USA) law of contracts.

This book discusses the legally binding obligations that parties can voluntarily enter into and how the courts deal with enforcing those obligations.  

Note: This is an extremely early version and is likely to contain mistakes. This page is not a substitute for legal representation. Also, this is a general overview of contract law as it is practiced and enforced in the United States. The details may be different depending on which State(s) is(are) involved.  Nevertheless, the writers encourage every person to acquaint themselves with the principles of a legal system that governs nearly all sales and transactions.  The world is, after all, a &quot;global marketplace.&quot;



=Legal Theories of Contracts=
==What is a Contract?==

      A working definition of Contract comes from the American Law Institute's 
      Restatement 2nd:

      § 1. Contract Defined:

      A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, 
      or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.

Another definition comes from the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which specifically
covers contracts for &quot;Goods&quot; (instead of services):

      § 1-201(11) [Revised § 1-201(11)]: 

      “Contract” means the total legal obligation which results from the parties’ 
      agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law. 

Both of these definitions make clear that not all promises or agreements are contracts. The promises or agreements that are contracts are the ones the legal system will enforce. That definition certainly appears circular: which ones will our legal system enforce?

That enforcement mechanism kicks in when a contract has been formed and it has been breached. The legal system is then asked to supply a remedy. These concepts of formation, breach, and remedy will play a large part in our discussion. While not always taken in that order, those are also the major topics around which your Contracts course is organized. And they form the basis for a claim for breach of contract, as we will now see.

==Economic Analysis==

=Was There a Breach of Contract?=
These three elements of a claim for breach of contract reflect the major topics of Contract Law:

      The first element is called Formation.

      The second element is called Performance and Breach.

      The third element is called Remedies.

The only other major topic in Contracts is Third Parties. Contracts is so much fun that one person is a party! It takes two to make a contract, however, so the first two parties are the parties to the contract. The &quot;Third Party&quot; is a party who is not a party to the contract.

It is clear that the parties to a contract have certain rights and obligations towards each other as defined in the contract. Sometimes third parties can have rights and obligations by virtue of the contract as well. The parties to the contract may have intended for the contract to benefit a third party, in which case the third party would be a beneficiary of the contract (third party beneficiary). The parties to the contract might also seek to assign their rights under the contract or to delegate their duties under the contract to a third party (assignment and delegation).

To succeed, the plaintiff must prove that all the elements of a claim are satisfied. To defeat the plaintiff's claim, the defendant needs to knock out only one element. You will find it helpful when analyzing Contracts cases to figure out which element the defendant is contesting.

==Sources of Contract Law==

Contracts always involve the future. Problems frequently arise because events did not turn out as one or both of the parties had anticipated and they look to contract law to provide the solution for that particular situation. Where do we go to find the rules to resolve contract disputes?

There is a hierarchy of sources. [Insert chart here.]

The principal state statute you will deal with in Contracts is the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC or Code). The Code has a number of parts, called Articles, that apply to different transactions. You will be concerned with Article 1, which contains General Provisions that apply to the whole Code, and Article 2, Sales.

The UCC is an odd duck. One of its principal goals, expressed in § 1-102(2)(c) [Revised § 1-103(a)(3)], is “to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.” You would think the easiest way to make the law uniform would be to enact a federal law. But that is not the way of the Code. The Code is promulgated by two groups, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL), and the American Law Institute (ALI). After both of these groups have approved proposed statutes that are drafted by a committee of experts, NCCUSL then takes the proposal to each state, asking the state to enact it. If every state enacts the same law, then the law is uniform. NCCUSL and the ALI have had tremendous success with the UCC, getting most of it enacted in every American jurisdiction.

However, the UCC is not entirely uniform. Legislatures are of course free to change the proposed version in the course of enacting the law, and most legislatures have taken advantage of that freedom. The CALI lessons will cite to the Uniform version of the Code, but you should be aware that your state may have a nonuniform provision.

====Application of UCC Article 2====

The subject matter of UCC Article 2 is, as expressed in § 2-102, “transactions in goods,” and generally, the sale of goods. So whenever your facts indicate that the contract involves the sale of goods, you should go to UCC Article 2 for the rule. But what are “goods”?  Section 2-105(1) provides this definition:

      (1) &quot;Goods&quot; means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable
          at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in
          which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in
          action. &quot;Goods&quot; also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and
          other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to
          be severed from realty (Section 2-107).

So goods are movable. All well and good. But if a transaction is a hybrid, involving both goods and non-goods, do we apply Article 2? One approach to this problem, from the case of Bonebrake v. Cox, 499 F.2d 951 (8th Cir. 1974), asks us to determine whether the sale of goods was the &quot;predominant purpose&quot; of the transaction. If it was, then Article 2 is applied to the entire transaction.

====The Common Law====

What if we have a sale of goods (please double check this info as it is not as 'good' as it would appear), but we find no rule in Article 2 that addresses our issue? For example, Farmer claims that because he was drunk when he made the agreement with Cereal Company, the agreement is not binding. UCC Article 2 has no rule on whether agreements a person makes when drunk are enforceable. Where do we go to find the applicable rule? UCC § 1-103 (Revised § 1-103(b)) tells us:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 1-103. Supplementary General Principles of Law Applicable. 
Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where do we find these “principles of law and equity”? In a few states, notably Louisiana, which has a French Civil Code tradition, and California, which adopted the Field Code developed by law reformer David Dudley Field in the 19th century, general principles of law, including contract law, are found in statutes. These statutes, however, are often broadly stated and will not answer your question. For example, if you were researching in California whether agreements a person makes when drunk are enforceable, you would find this applicable statute in the Civil Code:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 39. Conveyance or contract; rescission; rebuttable presumption.

(a) A conveyance or other contract of a person of unsound mind, but not entirely without understanding, made before the incapacity of the person has been judicially determined, is subject to rescission ....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In most jurisdictions, general principles of contract law are a matter of common law; that is, the tradition of judge-made law handed down in judicial opinions. In a state where contract law is found in a code, like California, there is still a strong common law tradition because the courts must interpret the code to determine whether it is applicable to a particular situation.

In theory, if you wanted to know what the common law rule is, such as whether an agreement made by a person when drunk is enforceable, you would have to read all the cases on point and attempt to distill the rule from them.

In practice, someone has already done that work for you. Enter the Restatement. The Restatements are another project of the American Law Institute. As suggested by the title, a Restatement represents a distillation of the principles of law into “black letter” rules that can be easily, perhaps too easily, stated. We are blessed with an excellent Restatement in our area, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

CALI Contracts lessons will occasionally refer to a section from the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (and since it is the only Restatement we will refer to, we may often just call it &quot;the Restatement&quot;). But don’t assume that just because the Restatement states a rule that it is “the law.” Each Restatement is written by a committee of lawyers, judges, and law professors. It reflects the opinion of the authors as to what the general principle is or should be. It is not mandatory authority because it is not enacted by a legislature, and it may not reflect the rule in a particular jurisdiction.

====Federal Courts, State Courts, and the Applicable State Law====

Sometimes the contracts cases you study have been decided by a federal court. In those cases, it is helpful to ask how the court got jurisdiction. Frequently (but not always) the cases are in federal court because of diversity jurisdiction; that is, the federal court takes jurisdiction when the plaintiff and the defendant are citizens of different states.

====Default Rules and Freedom of Contract====

Have you studied Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 305 U.S. 673 (1938), in Civil Procedure yet? For our purposes, the gist of it is that the Supreme Court declared that there is in general no federal common law of contracts. Whether a case is heard in federal court or in state court, the court will apply the law of the relevant state.

Which state’s law will the court apply? That question is answered by the choice of law rules. You may eventually study that subject in a course called Conflicts of Law. According to the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (yes, there is a Restatement for that, too), the general rule for choice of law in a contracts case is found in § 188:

      § 188. Law Governing In Absence Of Effective Choice By The Parties

      (1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in § 6.

      (2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see § 187), the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of § 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:
            (a) the place of contracting, 
            (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, 
            (c) the place of performance, 
            (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and 
            (e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties. These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.

      (3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in §§ 189-199 and 203.

According to Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 188, the general rule is that the local law of the state that &quot;has the most significant relationship to the transaction&quot; will govern. There is an even narrower rule for contracts involving the sale of chattels (goods). Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 191 provides:

      § 191. Contracts To Sell Interests In Chattel

      The validity of a contract for the sale of an interest in a chattel and the rights created thereby are determined, in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties, by the local law of the state where under the terms of the contract the seller is to deliver the chattel unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in § 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied. 

We’re not going to go into those rules in detail, but we will use this opportunity to emphasize the important principle called Freedom of Contract. Contract law is generally not regulatory. It is facilitatory -- it facilitates the making of agreements between the parties. When we speak of the rules of contract law, we don’t mean rules in the sense of inflexible commandments. We are generally speaking of “default rules” -- the rules that apply in the absence of the parties’ agreement. In fact, this point is nicely captured by the caption to Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 188: Law Governing In Absence Of Effective Choice By The Parties.

Unless it is a formation rule or a matter of policy is involved, the parties are generally free to use freedom of contract to change the default rule. This principle is stated in UCC § 1-102(3) [Rev. § 1-302(a)], which provides that &quot;The effect of provisions of this Act may be varied by agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Act. &quot;

==Valid Contract Formation==

===Basic Vocabulary===

'''Agreement''' 

An agreement consists of an offer and an acceptance, this sometimes referred to as mutual assent.

'''Offer''' 

According to the Restatement of Contract Law, &quot;an offer is a manifestation of an intent to be contractually bound upon acceptance by another party.&quot;  In other words, when a potential party to a contract makes others aware that he wants to enter into a contract, an &quot;offer&quot; has been made.  

An offeror must spell out enough terms such that the offeree can merely say &quot;I accept.&quot;  For example, &quot;I'll buy your house&quot; isn't enough to constitute a valid offer.  At a minimum, a price and boundaries for what land will be sold must be included within the offer.  However, there are jurisdictions in which an advertisement stating that a car will be sold for a certain price is considered legally binding on the advertisers.

Offers can be made with an expiration date on them.  If an offer is made with no explicit expiration date, the courts will create one based on local business customs, how the parties have handled in the past, and the nature of the contract.

Separate agreement can be made to extend the length of time of previous offers.  The agreements, usually called &quot;option contracts&quot;, bind the original offeror to keep his offer valid and exclusively available to the original offeree for some period of time, usually in exchange for some amount of money.

It is important to distinguish between an offer and merely an invitation to treat.  An invitation to treat is generally an offer to the world, such as goods on display in a shop, or an advertisement in a newspaper.  Where an invitation to treat occurs, it is the one wishing to purchase a product that makes the legal 'offer' to the owner who then 'accepts'.

'''Acceptance'''

Accepting the terms of the offer.

'''Consideration'''

This element is broken down into two parts: First, the consideration given in return for the promise or performance must be of legally sufficient value. It may be money, an action the party has no legal duty to do, or not taking an action the party has a legal right to take. Second, the consideration must consist of bargained-for exchange. This element distinguishes contracts from gifts. This is a continuance of the concept of mutual assent, a meeting of the minds between offeror and offeree. Note that &quot;legally sufficient value&quot; does not save either party from an unwise contract. Under the doctrine of '''freedom of contract''', people are free to bargain and contract as they wish. Just because one party may think their offer or acceptance is unequal to the value of consideration they got in return does not void the contract.

Consideration is something of sufficient, but not necessarily adequate, value that is exchanged between the parties.  As long as the consideration has sufficient value to the offeror then this is deemed to be sufficient consideration.

Past consideration generally is not acceptable.  This is that the consideration must take place in light of the offer and acceptance.  As with English law there is always the exception.  In cases such as a window cleaner, past consideration is necessary (a window cleaner will clean the windows first then ask for payment later in respect of the performance that has already occurred).

===The Bargaining Process===
This section deals with the essential elements of the bargaining process. There are basically two requirements: (1) Assent and (2) Definiteness. 


====Assent====
Mutual assent to be bound is an essential element of contract formation. Parties may achieve mutual assent through a bargaining process which involves an offer and an acceptance. So, identifying the offer and acceptance can be the method by which mutual assent is established.

There are three essential elements to an offer. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 24. All must exist before there can be a legally valid offer.

Once you decide that an offer has been made, next determine if the offer is revocable. An offer can become irrevocable by formation of an option contract, Res. 2d Contracts sec. 25, by beginning to perform under an offer that looks to acceptance by performance only, Res. 2d Contracts sec. 45, by detrimental reliance, Res. 2d Contracts sec. 87(2), by statute, including a firm offer under U.C.C. 2-205, and by a writing signed by the offeror which recites a purported consideration and proposes a fair exchange. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 87 (a). 

If the offer can be terminated before acceptance, you must next consider whether an offeree's power of acceptance has been terminated by revocation, rejection (including a counteroffer), lapse, or death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 36. If the offeree's power of acceptance has been terminated, no acceptance is possible. If it hasn't then consider if there has been an acceptance. A valid acceptance requires that there be a manifestation of present intent to accept, and that the acceptance be made in the manner invited or required by the offer. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 50. An offer can require that the offeree can accept only by making a promise. If it does, then no other means of acceptance is possible. Similarly, if the offer requires a performance only, then no other means is possible. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 30.
=====Objective vs. Subjective Assent=====

The cases are legion that require a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; for the formation of a valid contract. If taken literally, it would require that all of the parties to a valid contract must simultaneously intend to bind themselves to the contract. Does modern contract law require a &quot;meeting of the minds?&quot; If so, what exactly does it mean?

'''The Offer''' An offer is defined as a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain so made as to justify another person in understanding that her assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 24. A legally sufficient offer requires a manifestation of present intent. Because of the nature of this objective test of intent, modern cases require that one look not only at the words used by the purported offeror, but also at all of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the purported offeree would understand that the offeror intended to be bound. Murray p. 69. Farnsworth p. 135. Offers can be oral, written, or implied by conduct.

=====Tests to Determine if an Offer has been Made===== 
=====Auction Sales===== 
=====Termination of the Power of Acceptance=====

=====The Nature of Acceptance=====

====Definiteness====
=====Types of Indefiniteness=====

=====Agreements to Agree=====

===Legal Capacity===
Both parties to a contract must have contractual capacity. This means they must be seen as competent persons in the eyes of the law. Common qualifiers are: Being of the age of majority (18 in the United States), possessing the freedom of choice (free of outside influence such as duress, undue influence, and intoxication), and being of sound mind at the time of the contracts formation (on this topic an entire book can be written).

===Legality===
The contract's purpose must be legal, for example murder is illegal. Therefore you cannot form a contract which to be completed requires someone to murder another person as the purpose of the contract is to conduct an act which is not legal. This means that contract law will not apply. 

This is the strict sense of the legality dependant upon state, so an act legal in one state may result in a void contract if contracted elsewhere.

===Relieving Party from Promise===
====Mutual Mistake====
====Unilateral Mistake====

====Duress==== 
Restraint or danger, actually inflicted or impending, which is sufficient in severity or apprehension to deprive a person of free choice, destroy his volition, or obtain consent only in form.

Under the law, a person is not guilty of a crime if he participated only because he believed, and had good reason to believe, that he would be seriously harmed if he did not participate and had no other way of escaping serious harm. The burden is on the government to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To find someone guilty, therefore, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that when he participated in the offense, he did not have a reasonable belief that such participation was the only way he could save himself from serious harm.

An actual or a threatened violence or restraint of a man's person, contrary to law, to compel him to enter into a contract, or to discharge one.

Some divide duress into two sorts:

First. Duress of imprisonment, where a man actually loses his liberty. If a man be illegally deprived of his liberty until he sign and seal a bond, or the like, he may allege this duress, and avoid the bond. But, if a man be legally imprisoned, and either to procure his discharge, or on any other fair account, seal a bond or a deed, this is not by duress of imprisonment, and he is not at liberty to avoid it.

Second. Duress per minas, which is either for fear of loss of life, or else for fear of mayhem, or loss of limb,; and this must be upon a sufficient reason. In this case, a man way avoid his own act. Lord Coke enumerates four instances in which a man may avoid his own act by reason of menaces: 1. For fear of loss of life; 2. Of member; 3. Of mayhem; 4. Of imprisonment.

It is not every degree of violence or any hind of threats, that will invalidate a contract; they must be such as would naturally operate on a person of ordinary firmness, and inspire a just fear of great injury to person, reputation or fortune. The age, sex, state of health; temper and disposition of the party, and 0ther circumstances calculated to give greater or less effect to the violence or threats, must be taken into consideration.

A contract by violence or threats, is void, although the party in whose favor the contract is made, and not exercise the violence or make the threats, and although he were ignorant of them.

Violence or threats are cause of nullity, not only where they are exercised on the contracting party, but when the wife, the husband, the descendants or ascendants of the party are the object of them.

If the violence used be only a legal constraint, or the threats only of doing that which the party using them had a right to do, they shall not invalidate the contract A just and legal imprisonment, or threats of any measure authorized by law, and the circumstances of the case, are of this description.

But the mere forms of law to cover coercive proceedings for an unjust and illegal cause, if used or threatened in order to procure the assent to a contract, will invalidate it; an arrest without cause of action, or a demand of bail in an unreasonable sum, or threat of such proceeding, by this rule invalidate a contract made under their pressure.

All the above articles relate to cases where there may be some other motive besides the violence or threats for making the contract. When, however, there is no other cause for making the contract, any threats, even of slight injury, will invalidate it.

====Misrepresentation====
====Unconscionability====
====Statute of Frauds====
The Statute of Frauds is a collective term describing the various statutory provisions which render unenforceable certain types of contracts unless they are evidenced by a writing.

====Contract Interpretation====
=====Parol Evidence Rule=====
The nutshell version of this rule:  when drafting a contract -- write what you mean, and mean what you write.  If a judge looking at the contract can figure out what the parties' intentions were, then there is no need to have the parties give any testimony whatsoever on what they meant when they drafted the contract.  If a judge cannot reasonably understand the parties' intentions on a point of contention, then oral testimony, also called parol evidence, is allowed.  See the examples below.

It can happen that once the parties to a contract are somewhat along in their contractual relationship that a dispute will arise regarding what the contract requires one or both parties to actually do.  For instance, say Jane hires Bob to paint her house for $5,000.00 with the job to start in August, and the written contract states exactly that with no other wording regarding any sort of time requirement for getting the work done.  Jane then tells Bob that she wants the job finished by the end of August because she has family visiting from out of state on September 1st.  Bob tells Jane that he completely understands her situation.  Summertime is a very busy time for Bob, so he starts the job on August 31st to meet the deadline, but he then leaves the job to paint other houses and, as a result, he does not finish until mid-October.  Jane is infuriated and embarrassed that her visitors had to deal with looking at the partially painted house and she firmly believes that Bob knew he would not be able to get the work done in August as she asked.  So, she refuses to pay half of the agreed amount ($2,500.00). Bob files a lawsuit.

Bob tells the judge that he completely abided by the contract and did exactly as he was required to do.  Jane says that Bob knew that she wanted him to start and finish in August, despite the fact that the contract said Bob only needed to start in August.  The judge believes that both Jane and Bob are telling the complete truth, but finds that Bob is entitled to the remaining $2,500.00 due on the contract.  Here's why Jane loses: the contract did not state that Bob must finish in August; It merely stated he must begin in August.  When a judge can look at the plain language of a contract and from that can understand what the duties are for each party, the Parol Evidence Rule prevents the judge from taking into account oral evidence as to what a party or the parties actually meant.  In other words, the written word trumps the spoken.  In this case, the judge, even if he or she feels it is unfair to Jane, does not need testimony to understand that the contract only required Bob to start in August -- not complete the job in August. 

But what if the contract stated that Bob must start on August 15th, and that he must do the work quickly and in a workmanlike manner until completion.  Before signing the contract, Jane tells Bob of the reason for the &quot;quickly&quot; requirement -- that is she has visitors coming on September 1st.  Bob tells Jane that he completely understands.  Bob does start on August 15th but does not finish until September 15th, and tells Jane that he did indeed proceed quickly as she requested.  Jane withholds the $2,500.00 and, predictably, Bob files a lawsuit.

The judge, this time, would be very willing to hear the oral testimony of both parties because, while it is clear the parties contemplated some requirement for a finish date, it is unclear from the plain language of the contract what that date actually was.  Looking at the contract, it is absolutely impossible to find a solid finish date, and the parties' expectations as to what that meant under the contract can only be derived from oral testimony.  Jane's statement regarding her timetable and Bob's statement that he completely understood might be enough to convince a judge that the contract required Bob to be finished by August 31st.  

To sum up in outline fashion:
1. If the contract is specific as to the point in dispute: no oral testimony is allowed.
2. If the contract is ambiguous as to the point in dispute: oral testimony is allowed.

====Justifications for Nonperformance====
=====Impossibility=====
when an act cannot be performed due to nature, physical impediments, or unforeseen events. It can be a legitimate basis to rescind (mutually cancel) a contract

=====Impracticability=====
=====Frustration of Purpose===== 
Frustration of purpose is a term used in the law of contracts to describe a defense to an action for non-performance based on the occurrence of an unforeseen event which makes performance impossible or commercially impracticable. A common situation is that the subject matter of the contract - a house or a car for example - is unintentionally destroyed.

==Performance and Breach==
===Express Conditions===
===Constructive and Implied Conditions===

===Breach and Anticipatory Repudiation===

==Remedies==
;Expectation Damages
Give the benefit of the bargain i.e. expected gain. ''''''For the party who has suffered a loss to be put in the position as if the contract's obligations had been performed.''''''

;Reliance Damages
Restore to before contract. Repay any loss

;Restitution Damages
Action off the contract. Party receives damages for the benefit they conferred on the other party, so as not to allow unjust enrichment.  For the party who has suffered a loss to be put back in the position had the contract not been agreed at all - recovery of losses, as opposed to expectation damages, see above.

;Punitive Damages
Punish breach. 
Usually only used for tortious breach; therefore, this is not a usual type of damages in Contracts Law.
Policy: Breaching a contract can be efficient.  The law does not wish to force all promises to be adhered to. It simply wishes to put the non-breaching party in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed.

;Specific Performance
Perform as promised. Complete the bargain
Used only when damages can’t or won’t be sufficient.  Specific performance is the very last resort that the English Legal System shall generally resort to.  This is making a person carry out obligations agreed to under the terms of the contract.  This is not a good option for either parties.  The person is unlikely to perform tasks to a satisfactory standard for the Claimant and it is essentially like slavery for the Defendant whom is being made to carry out obligations.

      <comment>/* Use of Roman and Hindu-Arabic numerals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Great article; a couple of comments: i) it would be nice to compare/contrast modes to other similar concepts in the world, for example &quot;Thats&quot; in Indian music. ii) The phrase in the last sentence 'sound through time' does not make sense; is there any sound that is not through time?

== Use of Roman and Hindu-Arabic numerals ==

This is looking good.

Only critique I  would make is that Roman numerals are usually reserved for discussing chords where Hindu-Arabic numbers are used for discussing scale tones. Also when using numbers to describe musical ideas we usually prefix any #'s or b's  rather than making them a suffix&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
i.e.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{|
|-
| Ionian || 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
|-
| Dorian || 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7 8 
|-
| Phrygian || 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8 
|-
| Lydian || 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7 8 
|-
| Mixolydian || 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7 8 
|-
| Aeolian || 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8 
|-
| Locrian || 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7 8 
|}

Is how we would describe the deviations each mode has from the Ionian in terms of scale degree structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before deciding to open your hive be aware that bees dislike the smell of newly mown grass, it can make them agitated and more liable to sting you. They are also similarly affected by the type of cool heavy air that presages a thunderstorm, so again delay opening the hive. However, once you have decided that the conditions suit,start your smoker and have a heavy cool smoke issuing from your smoker, making sure that there won't be any hot coals or chunks that will be blown out. Having your veil on would be helpful as well. Blow a few puffs into the entrance of the hive and wait a minute or so, then remove the cover. Open the cover slowly and carefully using a pry tool (my bees like to build a lot of burr comb upside down on the cover) and blow a few puffs of smoke on top of the frames and underneath the cover. The bees should retreat to the comb. Lean the cover against the side of the hive, never place it flat on the ground. This will prevent trapping or crushing the bees.

When you are ready to close the hive, puff some smoke over the tops of the frames again to keep the bees below the cover. Then position one end of the cover on top of the hive and close it like a hinge. This will help prevent the bees from being crushed under the cover.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|Spices and herbs]]

'''Chinese five spice powder''' (&amp;#20116;&amp;#39321;&amp;#31881; or '''five spices powder''' or '''five-spice powder''') is a convenient seasoning for Cantonese cuisine. It incorporates the five basic flavours of Chinese cooking - sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and salty.
One common recipe includes [[Cookbook:China Tung Hing Cinnamon|China Tung Hing cinnamon]], powdered [[Cookbook:Cassia|cassia]] buds, powdered [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]] and [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] seed, [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger root]], and ground [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]s.
Another recipe for the powder consists of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], cloves, [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] seed, and star anise.  It is used in most Cantonese roasted [[Cookbook:Duck|ducks]], as well as [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] stew.

The formulae are based on the Chinese philosophy of balancing the yin and yang in food.
A pinch of the powder goes a long way.

Although this spice is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households never use it in day-to-day cooking.

A versatile seasoned salt can be easily made by stir-frying common [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] with five spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 teaspoons Szechuan peppercorns
* 8 star anise pods
* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon ground fennel

== Procedure ==
#Roast two teaspoons of Szechuan peppercorns in a dry frypan for about three minutes.
#Grind the peppercorns in a pepper grinder or coffee grinder together with 8 star anise pods.
#Strain the ground spices to remove any larger bits.
#Mix together 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds.
#Grind the completed mixture until it is a very fine powder.
#Use sparingly, as it is extremely pungent.

[[Image:StarAnise.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Star Anise]]                    

'''Star anise''' is a [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]], [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian]], and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian]] cooking. It has a flavour much like [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]], and has also been compared to [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Liquorice|liquorice]].

In many dishes, whole stars are added to the cooking, imparting their flavour as the food simmers. It is not uncommon to find star anise served in the food, to be fished out by the diner.

Star anise is also a component of the classic [[Cookbook:Five Spice Powder|Chinese five spice]] mix, used widely in Chinese cuisine.

In western cuisines, star anise has gained some use as a replacement for anise, as it is less expensive.

[[Image:DEA_mar_loose.jpg|right|thumb|loose marijuana]]
'''Marijuana''' and '''sinsemilla''' are parts of the '''cannabis''' (''Cannabis sativa L.'') plant. Serving foods that contain marijuana, without the eater's knowledge or consent, is very inappropriate and inconsiderate, due to the plant's strong effects.

Eating foods containing Marijuana can induce stronger psychoactive effects than most other methods of Cannabis consumption. These effects often do not appear for up to an hour and a half after eating (due to the time it takes to digest the food), and it is common among first-time cookers (but long-time smokers) to eat too much thinking it has not worked.

==Warnings==
* A common myth about cannabis is that it is physically addictive. While this is not true, a minority of users can come to depend on the drug’s effects — i.e., become psychologically dependent. 
* Cannabis can cause tiredness, reddening of the eyes, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and a drop in blood pressure. Appetite is increased. While the drug’s effects last, it is difficult to concentrate. Perceptions of distance and velocity can change. 
* It can impair short term memory while under the influence, and may aggravate existing disorders in people with mental health issues. Some people, particularly inexperienced users, may feel quite edgy or paranoid after using it.
* Due to cannabis's strong psychoactive effects, people under the influence should '''not''' attempt to drive or operate heavy machinery.
* Possession of marijuana is illegal in many countries. Depending on where you live, prosecution may result in fines, imprisonment, and even execution.

The Bubble Tea recipe seems to have a problem. Including the full cup of milk but no honey, I count 28 ounces. The recipe claims to produce only 16 ounces. Unless the cook is expected to heavily sample or spill, the math doesn't seem to work out. It's 35 ounces if you use Imperial units. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:42, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cells''' are the smallest units of life. The vast majority of organisms today are made up of eukaryotic cells, which contain distinct, membrane-bound organelles and which contain a membrane-bound nucleus. Earlier organisms with no membrane-bound organelles and no definite nucleus are termed prokaryotic. Each type has its own distinct anatomy.


==Organelles==
[[File:Plant cell structure svg.svg|right|350px]]
The term &quot;eukaryote&quot; comes from the Greek (eu, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;true&quot;) and κάρυον](karyon, &quot;nut&quot;).

Karyon refers to the nucleus of the cell, thus pointing out that every eukaryote must have the following characteristics:

* Contain a membrane-bound nucleus
* Be composed of membrane-bound organelles

Typically, eukaryotic cells are much larger and more complicated in comparison to prokaryotes.  Eukaryotes are believed to have evolved from early prokaryotes through endosymbiosis (see [[w:Endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiotic theory]]), roughly 1 billion years after the evolution of the first prokaryotes and archaea.  The endosymbiotic relationship between modern mitochondria and chloroplasts, and their corresponding membrane arrangements, provides some of the strongest evidence for this theory. The following is an overview of the main organelles which make up the eukaryotic cell.

===Cell Membrane===

The cell membrane is used to allow some materials to enter and block others, and vice versa.

===Cell Wall===
The '''cell wall''' is a more or less solid layer surrounding a cell. They are found in bacteria, archea, fungi, plants, and algae. Animals and most other protists have cell membranes without surrounding cell walls. When a cell wall is removed using cell wall degrading enzymes, what is left of the cell and its surrounding plasma membrane is called a protoplast.

'''Cell sap''' is a dilute fluid that is found in the large central vacuole of many plant cells. It contains water, amino acids, glucose, and salts. The sap has many functions, such as storage of useful materials, and provides mechanical support for non-woody plants; it also helps plant-cells in the process of osmosis.

===Centrioles===
A '''centriole''' in biology is a barrel shaped microtubule structure found in most animal cells, and cells of fungi and algae though not frequently in plants.  The walls of each centriole are composed of nine triplet microtubules or, in the case of ''Drosophila'', nine doublet microtubules.  The microtubules which make up the '''centriole''' are very stable and are acetylated.  
Centrioles are important in the cell division process, organizing the mitotic spindle upon which the chromosomes are pulled apart.  Some animal cells may be able to divide their chromosomes without centrioles, for instance in female meiosis. Centrioles assist the cell through the process of mitosis and in male meiosis.

===Cytoplasm===
The cytoplasm includes everything within the cell, within the cell membrane, but excludes the nucleus. Cytosol makes up the liquid part of the cytoplasm, filling the intracellular space of the cell. It functions to provide a medium in which cellular reactions take place, as well as suspending organelles, and aiding in sensory transduction and signaling.

===Chloroplasts=== 
Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and eukaryotic algae which conduct photosynthesis.  
They are similar to mitochondria but are found only in plants. Both organelles are surrounded by a double membrane with an intermembrane space; both have their own DNA and are involved in energy metabolism; and both have reticulations, or many foldings, filling their inner spaces. 
Chloroplasts convert light energy from the sun into ATP through a process called photosynthesis.

===Cytoskeleton===
The '''cytoskeleton''' is a cellular &quot;scaffolding&quot; or &quot;skeleton&quot; contained, as all other organelles, within the cytoplasm. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, enables some cell motion (using structures such as flagella and cilia), and plays important roles in both intra-cellular transport (the movement of vesicles and organelles, for example) and cellular division. The three types of cytoskeleton are microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.

===Endoplasmic Reticulum===
The '''endoplasmic reticulum''' or '''ER''' (endoplasmic means &quot;within the cytoplasm,&quot; reticulum means &quot;little net&quot;) is an organelle found in all eukaryotic cells. The ER modifies proteins, makes macromolecules, and transfers substances throughout the cell.
Prokaryotic organisms do not have membrane-bound organelles and thus do not have an ER. 
ER's base structure and composition is similar to the plasma membrane, though it is an extension of the nuclear membrane. The ER is the site of the translation, folding, and transport of proteins that are to become part of the cell membrane (e.g., transmembrane receptors and other integral membrane proteins) as well as proteins that are to be secreted or &quot;exocytosed&quot; from the cell (e.g., digestive enzymes).

===Golgi bodies===
The structure and internal function of the Golgi apparatus is quite complex and is the subject of scientific dispute. The Golgi apparatus consists, like the ER, of membranous structures. It is made up of a stack of flattened cisternae and similar vesicles. The ''cis'' face is the side facing the ER, the ''medial'' region is in the middle while the ''trans'' face is directed towards the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). The cis and trans faces have different membranous compositions.The Golgi apparatus is considered more or less the &quot;postal office&quot; of the cell. It handles all incoming lipids, proteins, etc., and controls their export as well.

===Lysosomes===
'''Lysosomes'''  contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases) to digest macromolecules. They are found in both plant and animal cells, but because animal cells also have vacuoles, animal cells contain many more lysosomes. They are built in the Golgi apparatus. At pH 4.8, the interior of the lysosomes is more acidic than the cytosol (pH 7). The lysosome single membrane stabilizes the low pH by pumping in protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the cytosol, and also protects the cytosol, and therefore the rest of the cell, from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome. The digestive enzymes need the acidic environment of the lysosome to function correctly.  For this reason, should a lysosome's acid hydrolases leak into the cytosol, their potential to damage the cell will be reduced, because they will not be at their optimum pH.  All these enzymes are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, and transported and processed through the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus produces lysosomes by budding.  Each acid hydrolase is then targeted to a lysosome. The lysosome itself is likely protected from digestion due to its unique internal 3-D structures which prevent enzymatic action{{ref|Campbell}}. 

Some important enzymes in lysosomes are:
*Lipase, which digests lipids,
*Carbohydrases, which digest carbohydrates (e.g., sugars),
*Proteases, which digest proteins,
*Nucleases, which digest nucleic acids.

===Mitochondrion===
Mitochodrion (from Greek ''mitos'' thread + ''khondrion'' granule) is an organelle found in most
eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, animals, fungi, and protists. A few cells, such as the trypanosome protozoan, have a single large mitochondrion, but usually a cell has hundreds or thousands of mitochondria. The exact number of mitochondria depends on the cell's level of metabolic activity: more activity means more mitochondria. Mitochondria can occupy up to 25% of the cell's cytosol.

Mitochondria are sometimes described as &quot;cellular power plants&quot;, because their primary function is to convert organic materials into energy in the form of ATP.

Important to note is that mitochondria are, in fact, separate cells unto themselves.  They were at one time independent prokaryotic cells living in a mutualistic prokaryotic community.  Over time, they evolved to live as ''endosymbionts'' within eukaryotic cells.  They reproduce independently of their host cells, having their own genetic material.

Mitochondrion have inner membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers.

===Nucleus===
The nucleus varies in diameter from 10 to 20 micrometres. It is enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The inner and outer membrane fuse at regular intervals, forming nuclear pores. The nuclear envelope regulates and facilitates transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, while separating the chemical reactions taking place in cytoplasm from reactions happening within the nucleus. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and may be studded with ribosomes. The space between the two membranes (called the &quot;perinuclear space&quot;) is continuous with the lumen of the RER. The nuclear face of the nuclear envelope is surrounded by a scaffold of filaments called the nuclear lamina.

===Peroxisomes===
'''Peroxisomes''' are ubiquitous organelles in eukaryotes that function to rid the cell of toxic substances. They consist of a single membrane that separates them from the cytoso] (the internal fluid of the cell). Peroxisomes were discovered by Christian de Duve in 1965. Unlike lysosomes, which are formed in the secretory pathway, peroxisomes usually self-replicate by enlarging and then dividing, although there is some indication new ones may be formed directly.  They also have membrane proteins that are critical for various functions, such as for importing proteins into their interiors and to proliferate and segregate into daughter cells.

Peroxisomes function to rid the cell of toxic substances, such as hydrogen peroxide, or other metabolites and contain enzymes concerned with oxygen utilization such as D-amino acid oxidase and urease oxidase.
The peroxisome contains the enzyme catalase which converts H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (hydrogen peroxide, a toxic byproduct of cellular metabolism) to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Ribosomes===
Organelle composed of rRNA (synthesized in the nucleolus) and ribosomal proteins. It translates mRNA into a polypeptide chain (e.g., a protein). 
It can be thought of as a factory that builds a protein from a set of genetic instructions. Ribosomes can float freely in the cytoplasm (the internal fluid of the cell) or bind to another organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum, or to the nuclear envelope. Since ribosomes are ribozym]s, it is thought that they might be remnants of the [[w:RNA world|RNA world]].

==Prokaryotic Cells==
[[File:Average prokaryote cell- en.svg|left|300px]]
The term &quot;prokaryote&quot; comes from the following combining terms:

'''&quot;pro&quot;''', meaning before
'''&quot;karyote&quot;''', meaning kernel (referring to the nucleus)

Thus, prokaryotes are cells that came before nuclei.  They have no membrane-bound organelles and lack a membrane-bound nucleus.  They are significantly simpler than eukaryotes.

==Nucleoid==
The nucleoid is the area of the cytoplasm where the single bacterial chromosome is located

[[File:Cell membrane detailed diagram 4.svg|thumb|400px|Illustration of a  Eukaryotic cell membrane]]

=Introduction=

The cell membrane is a semi-permeable membrane composed of all four types of macromolecules, with lipids and proteins being the most prevalent in dry weight.  The membrane is present in all cells and functions to regulate incoming and outgoing materials, maintain intracellular homeostasis, and participate in signal transduction.

=Models=

Various models have been created to help visualize the complex structure of the cellular membrane, the most famous being the fluid mosaic model, which describes the membrane as a two-dimensional &quot;sea&quot; of molecular units, and the liquid crystal model, which describes the membrane as a sea of crystals with liquid properties. 

==Fluid Mosaic==

The fluid mosaic model was developed in 1972 by S.J. Singer and Garth Nicolson.  In their report, they proposed that biological membranes can be considered as a two-dimensional fluid composed of a mosaic of molecules, the majority of which had hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (phospholipids).  Thus, the molecular interactions create a membrane that is not solid, but which behaves like a fluid as molecules change positions and has the ability to stretch and contract vertically.

==Liquid Crystal Model==

The liquid crystal model was developed in 1970 by Freye and Edinin&lt;!--Not sure about this--&gt;.  It proposes that the phospholipid bilayer behaves like a series of crystals moving in an fluid, yet ordered manner.

=Elements of the Membrane=

The phospholipid bilayer is composed of the following in dry weight:

*50% proteins
*30% lipids
*5% glycolipids
*15% other

Each element of the membrane performs a specific function in sensory transduction, transport, etc.

==Proteins==

[[File:Glicoprotein.svg|thumb|right|100px|Diagram of a glycoprotein.]]
'''&lt;big&gt;Glycoproteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Glycoproteins are transmembrane proteins with oligosaccharides covalently bonded to their amino acid chains.  Glycoproteins generally play an important role in sensory transduction, particularly with regard to immune system responses.

[[File:Polytopic membrane protein.png|thumb|left|250px|Schematic representation of transmembrane proteins: 
1. a single transmembrane α-helix (bitopic membrane protein)
2. a polytopic α-helical protein
3. a transmembrane β barrel &lt;br /&gt;
The membrane is represented in light brown.]]
'''&lt;big&gt;Transmembrane Proteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Transmembrane proteins are proteins that extend through the membrane, having both an exterior and an interior domain.  They are integral proteins, meaning they are permanently bonded to the PLB.  Many function as hormone/signal acceptors, ion channels, and transport proteins.  As a rule, they act as channels between the intra- and extracellular spaces.

There are two structural categories of transmembrane protein:

::#'''Alpha-helical''', those composed of repeating hydrogen bonds that make up alpha helices on the secondary level of structure
::#'''Beta barrel''', those which have repeating hydrogen bonds that form pleated sheets

Alpha-helical make up the largest group, with beta barrel proteins found primarily in mitochondrial and other prokaryotic gram-positive membranes.



'''&lt;big&gt;Peripheral Proteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Peripheral proteins are proteins that are bonded by weaker interactions to either the interior or the exterior of the membrane.  Their loose bonds allow them to detach and function as secondary messengers or extracellular messengers upon receipt of a signal from the cell.  Some prominent functions are in metabolism and in sensory transduction.

==Lipids==

'''&lt;big&gt;Phospholipids&lt;/big&gt;'''

Phospholipids are the &quot;glue&quot; that gives the membrane its distinct structure.  Their amphipathic nature and tendency to create micelles in water were likely the origin of the first cells.

'''&lt;big&gt;Glycolipids&lt;/big&gt;'''

Glycolipids are lipids with attached carbohydrates.  Their most prominent function is providing extracellular support to form tissues in multicellular organisms.

'''&lt;big&gt;Cholesterols&lt;/big&gt;'''

Cholesterol molecules are lipids distinguished by their four-ring structure.  In the membrane, they act to resist as a type of &quot;anti-freeze&quot; to prevent freezing and overheating.

=Transmembrane Transport=

==Passive==

'''&lt;big&gt;Osmosis and Diffusion&lt;/big&gt;'''


[[File:AQP-channel.png|thumb|300px|'''Schematic depiction of water movement through the narrow selectivity filter of the aquaporin channel.''']]

Okay.  I'm jumping in on this one.  I'm going to hit the character sketches first, then go to the synopsis.  One question for those of you watching this module: I could do a synopsis of just a few paragraphs, or I could hit this chapter by chapter.  Which is preferred?  I'll look at entries for other novels and see what common practice is, I guess.

At least you should update the template instantiations after changing it. But in any case I don't agree with the change given that the usual case is that the wikibook name does not match the Wikipedia article because of supages or namespaces. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:43, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
::Okay. I wasn't aware that modules were using this template as it appeared to be very broken. It ''appeared'' to be broken because the method of using it is completely different from how it is used on Wikipedia. Trying to use it on my module using the Wikipedia code method failed. These templates should be the same across sister projects so confused people like me don't screw them up with the wrong code in articles/modules. And, anyway, there ''should'' be two different templates (one for when wikibook name matches wikipedia article, one for when they don't match). [[User:Ross Uber|Ross Uber]] 00:36, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I agree with your last sentence. Go and create the version with the same title, but this one should stay as it currently stands. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:17, 17 May 2005 (UTC)
:I have restored the use of one parameter because almost all the pages using this template were broken. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:17, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}} {{Wikipedia|Dennis Brain}}
I agree that it would be less confusing if Wikipedia and Wikibooks had consistent templates. But I'm still mystified as to why there are 2 templates.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}} {{Wikipedia|Dennis Brain}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
both look identical to me. Couldn't both Wikipedia and Wikibooks each use a single template ?
Then the explaination would be much simpler.
The explanation (on the talk page) would say:
:On Wikipedia, type
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikibooks||Astronomy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:to refer to a Wikibook (or a particular page in that book).
:On Wikibooks, type
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia||Electronics}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:to refer to a Wikipedia article.
(Further down, the talk page would discuss &quot;Optional, advanced details&quot; about putting more stuff in-between the vertical lines).

Someone made it so that {{tl|wikipedia}} without a paramater performs a search. You can still do &lt;nowiki&gt;{{wikipedia|xxx}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{wikipediapar||xxx}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; like before, though the former is easier than the latter. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:17, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

Currently
[[Help:How does one edit a page]]
recommends using the &quot;Wikipediapar&quot; template.
Should I change that help page to recommend the &quot;Wikipedia&quot; template instead/in addition?

Seeing as this template didn't accept parameters, I have changed it so that up to three articles can be linked to using one box. I also changed the text to make this a bit smaller. (I forgot to log in though) [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad.Irwin]] 23:42, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

The &quot;search go&quot; variant seems to have never gone directly to the intended target if the target was multi-word.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:31, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

Here's an illustration of what it did.  All that's needed to make it work right is to convince it to replace the space in &quot;Constructed language&quot; with &quot;_&quot; instead of &quot;+&quot;...  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:21, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

You'd have no way of knowing I've spent most of my wikibooks time lately programming esoteric templates ([[Template:Navlist/Doc|yonder]]).

For anyone using the secure server your second version (the one I didn't even think to provide a mock-up of) comes out as follows.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:05, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

Here's one way I've thought of that ought to work to ''some'' extent, thought it could take some tinkering and would, I think, always be a kludge.  Modify the first version (the one using urlencode) by replacing each
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{urlencode:{{{1|{{SUBPAGENAME}}}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
with a call to #titlepart on a call to localurl.  The uncomfortable part of this is that #titlepart has to remove the correct number of slash-separated fields &amp;mdash; either you have to build the expected number of slashes into the template, or you have to test for it and you can still only build in a finite number of possible numbers of slashes.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:57, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

:I see so its the secure server that is giving you trouble. How about this than:

'''''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:w:Special:Search/Constructed language|go=Go}} Constructed language]&lt;/span&gt;'''''

== Why search? ==

Why is the search in the link. Wikipedia will automatically search if it's not found. Perhaps Wikipedia did not used to? Would seem that the seem in this template could now be removed. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 14:38, 14 February 2009 (UTC)

: Wikipedia doesn't automatically do a search if the page is not found when following a link (for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobiz or [[w:Foobiz]]). I see a message saying &quot;'''Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name'''&quot;, if you see otherwise perhaps you are using a Gadget? Wikipedia will only automatically search if the page is not found when clicking go from the search toolbar or when using the search special page, which is what this template does. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:01, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

== Layout trouble ==

I've created a layout workaround for the template in [[OpenOffice.org#References and external links]], because the template appears to adversely affect the layout of the first item in an unordered list. See the example from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=OpenOffice.org&amp;oldid=1536903#References_and_external_links article history]. -[[Special:Contributions/82.147.166.212|82.147.166.212]] ([[User talk:82.147.166.212|talk]]) 01:29, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

== What happened to the border? ==

Weird issue where has border on Mac Safari and missing border on IE7. It blends in with the text of the book too much.  --[[User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] ([[User talk:MarsRover|talk]]) 08:11, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}}
Dennis Brain was born into an already-famous horn-playing family in 1921. His father, Aubrey, his uncle, Alfred Jr., and his grandfather, Alfred Sr. all played professionally. Brain began his career by playing second to his father. For a time after WWII, Brain led the horn sections in the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic. Brain made several solo recordings, including the Strauss and Mozart horn concertos.

Brain died in a car accident while returning to London from the Edinburgh Festival. It is unfortunate that the world lost a great horn player at such a young age. [http://hornsociety.org/RESOURCES/famous/D-Brain.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Здравствуйте! 

Меня зовут Александр Лозовюк, я присоединился к сообществу Wikipedia недавно, 13.05.2005, хотя активно слежу за развитием проекта. 

Хочу пока представить на суд общественности некоторые свои работы, в частности книгу, которую я начал писать, но, к сожалению, в настоящее время не уверен, что смогу закончить ее. Поэтому было решено пока выложить ее в свободном виде.</text>

There is nothing like a =~ operator. Use either the regex module (cf. http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/), or a string function. Often, the string's .find() method will do.

===No need to make sweeping commitments===
Uh, pals, there's no need to make huge promises if you're not going to fulfill them. Just do the work you can. There's no pressure here. If you can't do it all, do some and leave the rest to the future. --[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 03:14, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

===Labs===
If it's alright, I'll do all the labs around the end of April. Someone should probably check over them briefly, but I should get it mostly correct. After all, I'll be writing these to make sure I know it all for the AP exam!&lt;br&gt;[[User:Rroepke|Rroepke]] 6 January 2006

I've created the framework, and I hope to write 1 article per month, complete with graphics.  Along the way, I'll be updating the [[Biology]] wikibook.  Please feel free to add!&lt;br&gt;[[User:Cnelson|Cnelson]] 19:39, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

=Structure=

Each article of the Study Guide should include a &quot;Keywords&quot; section, preferably at the top of the page. Once one article is 100%, we'll decide upon a more parmanent standard structure and style.  Suggestions for an additional articles should be run through this talk page first, and any major structural changes should receive a couple days of warning.  The current structure looks something like this:

== Proposed rename ==

I'd like to rename all the pages in this book so they begin with &quot;AP Biology/&quot; as opposed to &quot;AP Biology:&quot;. This would make this book consistent with the naming policy for new books and with the naming convention used for other books. I trust this change would be non-controversial, but I note this proposal here in advance of any move so that if anyone wishes to make a comment, they can, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:28, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== Let's try... ==

You can import some of these chapters from General Biology and then edit them, right? [[User:68.4.3.164|68.4.3.164]] 21:25, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

== Forgotten? ==

Is anyone else working on adding content to this book?  We need attention from an expert- I've noticed many errors and have done my best to correct them. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Bradfordw|Bradfordw]] ([[User talk:Bradfordw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bradfordw|contribs]]) 18:15, 25 July 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:[[User:cnelson|cnelson]] - Haha... I'm the first contributor.  I started this out of a desire to learn biology, but not wanting to go out and buy a review book, as I felt it was inadequate for the price.  I have since taken the AP Biology test, and must say I was well prepared.  Waiting for my score now.

:[[User:rroepke|rroepke]] - I found this page while looking for study guides to AP Bio. I have written some of the things in here. I am currently taking AP Bio, and taking the exam in May.

:[[User:ccny930|ccny930]] - Well, I'm not taking AP Biology anytime soon, but I've decided to contribute what little I know. That amounts to spelling corrections and adding definitions. Still, I hope this project expands so that I can learn more about biology at a college level.

== Addition of Matrices ==
Two matrices can be added together only if they have the same dimensions (the same number of rows and columns).  The resultant matrix is simply the matrix whose elements are the sum of the elements in the two matrices that were added together.  If a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is added to a matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and the resultant matrix is &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  5 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 \\
  3 &amp; 9 &amp; 4 \\
  0 &amp; -2 &amp; 6
\end{pmatrix}
 +
\begin{pmatrix}
  3 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\
  7 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
\end{pmatrix}
 =
\begin{pmatrix}
  8 &amp; 3 &amp; 11 \\
  10 &amp; 10 &amp; 1 \\
  4 &amp; 3 &amp; 12
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplication of Matrices ==
[[Image:Matrix multiplication diagram.PNG|left]]
Two matrices may be multiplied together only if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the rows in the second matrix.  That is, if the first matrix is &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt;, then the second matrix must be &lt;math&gt;m \times p&lt;/math&gt;.  The resulting matrix will have a dimension of &lt;math&gt;n \times p&lt;/math&gt;, where each element is the sum of the products of the entries in a row of the first matrix with the entries of the corresponding column in the second matrix.  If &lt;math&gt;C=AB&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^na_{ik}b_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;.

Although matrix multiplication is not commutative, it is associative, which means that ('''AB''')'''C'''='''A'''('''BC'''). Since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the order of the factors must be specified. '''AB''' would be read as &quot;'''A''' post-multiplied by '''B'''&quot; or &quot;'''B''' premultiplied by '''A'''.&quot; Matrix multiplication obeys the distributive property, so '''A'''('''B'''+'''C''')='''AB'''+'''AC'''. Also, two nonzero matrices do not necessarily have a nonzero product.

There is no such thing as &quot;Matrix Division&quot;. To divide out a matrix, you need first to obtain the '''inverse''' of the matrix, and then multiply by the inverse. We discuss inverses below.

== Transpose ==

To obtain the '''transpose''' of a matrix, we swap the rows and the columns of that matrix. If we have a matrix X, the transpose is denoted X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^T = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 \\ 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\ 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Determinant ==

The determinant of a matrix, X is denoted by |X|. 

== Inverse Matrix ==

If the matrix has a non-zero determinant, the matrix is said to be '''invertable'''. Inverse matrices follow the given formula:

:&lt;math&gt;XX^{-1} = X^{-1}X = I&lt;/math&gt;

Where I is the identity matrix.</text>

----

The pluperfect (''el pluscuamperfecto de indicativo'') is similar to the present perfect, but implies that an action had already occurred at a given time. For example:

:I had already bought a newspaper. ''Yo ya había comprado un periódico.''

It is formed, similar to the present perfect, using the imperfect form of [[../Haber/]] with a [[../Past Participle/|past participle]] of the action verb. ''Había'' is the first-person imperfect form of '''Haber''' and ''comprado'' is the past participle of '''Comprar'''. It is often used with the adverb ''ya'' which means &quot;already,&quot; indicating that the condition occurred in the past.

Examples:

:Tú ya habías mirado la película. ''You had already seen the movie.''
:Ella ya había hecho las galletes. ''She had already made the cookies.''
:Nosotros habíamos viajado a España. ''We had traveled to Spain.''
:Vosotros habíais sacado fotos. ''You (plural, familiar) had taken picture.''
:Ellos ya habían perdido el libro. ''They had already lost the book.''

==Para cuando==

The '''pluperfect''' is often used with clauses beginning in ''para cuando'' which means &quot;by the time that.&quot;  The verb following ''para cuando'' is conjugated in the [[../Present Subjunctive|present subjunctive form]]. For example:

:Ud. se había comido la merienda para cuando llegó al cine.
::''You (singular, formal) had eaten the snack by the time that you arrived at the theatre.''
:¿Habías terminado la tarea para cuando tu amigo te llamó?
::''Had you finished your homework by the time that your friend called you?''

      <comment>/* Charge Conservation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}


== Introduction ==

Many objects in this universe are conservative, the charge of the universe for instance always remains constant. This is called ''Global Conservation of Charge''. But also, if you take a defined area, then the charge in that also remains constant unless some is leaving through its boundary. And if some charge is moving through the boundary, then it must be equal to the change in charge in the volume. Just like if you and your friends are in a room, you cannot just not be in the room, you must go out the door.

This is called ''Local Conservation of Charge''.

== Charge Conservation ==

Let's look at the total charge enclosed by a volume V:

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{enc}(t) = \int_V \rho (\mathbf{r}) dV &lt;/math&gt;

We'll say that the charge inside V changes according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = \int_V \frac{\partial \rho (\mathbf{r})}{\partial t} dV &lt;/math&gt;

We could consider a current through a closed service, the boundary of V ( &lt;math&gt; \partial V &lt;/math&gt; ) for example, which would be

:&lt;math&gt; I = \int_{ \partial V } \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} dS &lt;/math&gt;

We can now bring in the equation &lt;math&gt; I = \frac{dQ}{dt} &lt;/math&gt; and relate it to the enclosed charge. We see that the corresponding equation is

:&lt;math&gt; - \frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = \int_{ \partial V } \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} dS &lt;/math&gt;

Because there positive flux of the current density (charge leaving V) when the enclosed charge is decreasing.

We see that

:&lt;math&gt; - \int_V \frac{\partial \rho (\mathbf{r})}{\partial t} dV = \int_{ \partial V } \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} dS &lt;/math&gt;

Then by using the divergence theorem on the right hand side, we get the law of '''local conservation of charge''' or the '''continuity equation'''.

{{eqn|Law of Local Conservation of Charge}}
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\rho}{dt} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

== Conservation of Energy ==

{{eqn|Law of Conservation of Energy}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (u_{mechanical} + u_{electro magnetic}) = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf S&lt;/math&gt;

Where 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt;</text>

&quot;Second person plural&quot; means &quot;second person ''plural''.&quot; In Swedish there has been a marked difference between usage in Finland-Swedish compared to in Sweden. While the form Ni (noted as formal above) has remained the common respectful address in Finland-Swedish, it was until the 1960s considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude in Sweden, where addressing in 3rd person with repetition of name and title was considered proper and respectful. After that the usage swiftly changed in Sweden, and the 2nd person du (noted as informal above) came to dominate totally, until recently when in the late 1990s a usage resembling that in German, Finnish or Finland-Swedish has become popular among the youngest adults as a kind of false archaism. It is also now common to see Du capitalized in places where the formal Ni would have been used before, such as in printed instructions or on signs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page details some brief strategies for securing a wireless network
== SSID Broadcast ==
By default, most access points will automatically broadcast their [[w:Service set identifier|SSID]] so that the network can be more easily detected and configured.  For example the default SSID for many Linksys products is ''linksys''.
*One of the first things that you should do when setting up your wireless network is to change the default SSID from whatever the manufacturer set to something that is easy to understand and easy to identify as yours (e.g., your street address).
*Disabling SSID broadcast (as recommended in some articles) won't stop an experienced [[../Wardriving|wardriver]], and is ''not'' a significant contribution to security. Worse, it can make it harder to manage the network. Instead, focus on [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]].

== MAC Address Filtering ==
Another security feature commonly included with modern routers is the idea of MAC Address filtering.  The basic concept being that the administrator explicitly lists all of MAC addresses allowed to connect to the wireless LAN.  A great idea in theory: because all MAC addresses are, by standard, supposed to be globally unique.  One would have to go through a bit of trouble finding all of these addresses, but once in place, it is a system that needs very little attention.  Unfortunately, there are a number of problems with a network that is only MAC filtered.

The primary problem is that network traffic remains completely unencrypted.  Any passwords, e-mails, or other sensitive information is sent completely in the clear, thus leaving it highly vulnerable to the most cursory of snoops.  Also, it is very easy to modify the MAC address of a network adaptor through simple system registry changes (At least, in Windows XP.)

The real kicker is, any packet on the network that isn't a broadcast from the router contains the MAC address of a computer that can communicate to it!  Again, with a very cursory sniffing, it is easily possible for an attacker to build a list of MAC addresses that can communicate to the router, then simply change his adapter's address to match one not currently in use.

MAC address filtering is ''not'' a significant contribution to security. Instead, focus on [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]].

== Encryption ==
There are two main standards for encryption of wifi networks: WEP and WPA.

=== WEP ===
WEP stands for Wired Equivalant Privacy.

WEP is the most commonly used encryption standard.  It supports key lengths of 40 bits and 104 bits.

WEP has some major security flaws:
*It uses the RC4 cipher
*A wifi network that uses WEP can be passively cracked
WEP should be avoided unless it is the only available option.  It provides insufficient protection against crackers, and provides only a false sense of security.

When using WEP, the network key should be changed on a regular basis.

=== [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] ===

WPA was created by [[w:The Wi-Fi Alliance|The Wi-Fi Alliance]], an industry trade group, to address the serious weaknesses of WEP.

==== WPA-Enterprise ====

WPA-Enterprise uses an authentication server to distribute keys to each wireless user.  It can be expensive to implement and may not be necessary for homes or small offices.

==== WPA-Personal (WPA-PSK) ====

WPA-PSK stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access - Preshared Key.  It is a simplified version of the more complicated and expensive WPA-Enterprise protocol.

WPA-PSK allows for a passphrase of up to 63 characters to be specifed, that a user must provide before connecting to a network.  The passphrase should be a minimum of 14 random characters, or more than 20 non-random characters.  It provides several major improvements over WEP.

It uses a system called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to distribute keys based on the passphrase to each user, and these keys are automatically updated at a specific interval.

=== WPA2 ===

An improved and more robust version of WPA.  This form of encryption is based on the AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) form of encryption.  It is even harder to break than the original WPA encryption method. Again it is available in Enterprise and PreShared Key versions

==Selecting a Good Password==
WPA and WPA2 depend on a &quot;passphrase&quot; (also known as a Pre Shared Key or PSK). Like any other, its strength depends almost solely on its complexity. Good WPA passphrases should be long compared to other passwords, and extremely confusing. The more nonsensical your passphrase, the better.  Actual words are not recommended, unless in a very long sentence.  For examples,

 f7S9^jeiF9ratt4-esttM8,25.4nZ8s

is more secure than the passphrase

 fff4526----354

which is better than

 4352354frewch

which is better than

 sdfnvuihgwkjsgdf

which is better then

 toaster

etc.

Finally, remember you will probably only need to enter this once (When you first set up your network and computers), so you can make it really strong and write it down rather then try and remember it. Just make sure you don't lose the paper, but keep it safe somewhere.

Note: ''Ett'' is neuter, ''en'' is uter; &quot;the digit 1&quot; is &quot;siffran ett&quot; in Swedish. Especially when counting, four is often pronounced as ''fyr''. ''Nio'' and ''tio'' are commonly pronounced as ''nie'', ''tie'', respectively. ''Tjugo'' is usually spelled ''tjugi'', and so on with the following multiples of ten (''tretti'' instead of ''trettio'', ''förti'' instead of ''fyrtio'' , etc.). Fourty is never pronounced the way it is spelled (fyrtio), it becomes ''förti(o)''.

Note: To make numbers between these, you add a number 1-9 ''not'' in parenthesis, e.g. 55 is ''femtiofem'', 73rd is ''sjuttiotredje''. However, ''tjugo '' is in this case commonly pronounced as ''tju'', e.g. ''tjuåtta'' for 28. The -''tio'' ending is commonly pronounced as -''ti'' but ''not'' in the parenthesis case. ''Fyrtio'' is pronounced as ''förti'' and sometimes written as ''förtio''. One commonly only say ''etthundra'' to distinguish it from e.g. ''tvåhundra''. As you might have guessed, Swedish uses the same system for large numbers as e.g. the UK, ''not'' the system used in the US.

(*) ''These are nouns but &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; adjectives, one commonly add -färgad or -färgat to make an adjective/adverb out of them.

Adding ''ljus''- or ''mörk''- to the color means &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;, respectively, e.g. ''ljusgrön'' (light green) or ''mörkblå'' (dark blue). It is common to combine colors, e.g. ''rödbrun'' or ''gröngul''. The first color is commonly the one thought to be most dominant. The same system is used to make colors similar to that of some well known element, e.g. ''sandgul'' (sand yellow) or ''havsblå'' (ocean blue or navy blue).

== Early American Peoples ==

One of the most interesting and difficult topics in American History is who arrived here and when. For example, the role of the Mousterian culture in the advent of Folsom points, the very early archaeological finds now being made, differentiating Athabascan arrivals from initial Asian origins. There ought to be a subject item covering those issues.


**

Just a suggestion, divide up the more significant segments of this section into their own respective articles (rather than having one Americas superarticle), in the same line as china and such were split. The Inka and their predecessors were very isolated. The entirety of the Amazon basin can be sorted into its own group as well. Going further north, the major section really were middle america and the american southeast (Missippians, &amp; their successors).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adverbs are generally made by putting an ending -''t'' to an adjective. If the adjective ends with a ''d'', then the ''d'' is changed to a ''t'', except when the vowel has a shorter length, then it becomes -''tt''. Historically, it would have become -''dt'' no matter what, this is still the case in Danish. If the adjective ends with a ''t'', one adds a new ''t'' and shorten the length of the vowel.  If the ending is -''n'', then the ''n'' is changed into a ''t''.

Note however, that also adjectives acquires the same ending if the noun is neuter instead of uter. The comparative and superlative forms are the same as for an adjective.

===Examples===
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; spacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
:'''Svenska'''
* Skyskrapan är hög. Jag hoppar högt.
* Bilen är snabb. Jag springer snabbt.
* Sångerskan är sorgsen, därför sjunger hon sorgset.
* Blommorna är vackra. I gryningen är de särskilt vackra.
* Tack, det var snällt. Det vill säga, det var snällt sagt.
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
:'''English'''
* The skyscraper is high. I jump high.
* The car is fast. I run fast.
* The (female) singer is sorrowful, therefore she sings sorrowfully.
* The flowers are beautiful. At dawn they are especially beautiful.
* Thank you, that was kind. That is (to say), it was kindly said.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Note that ''därför'' is not a formal word in Swedish, and would probably be translated as &quot;that's why&quot; in the sentence above.

A '''bundt cake pan''' gives a tall round cake with a hole in the middle. Without the hole, the outside of the cake would burn before the inside of the cake cooks.

While bundt pans were originally Bavarian (German), Nordic Ware (US) made them popular in the 1950s. There are 35 (or more) patterns of bundt pans in existence.</text>

The rule for comparison of adjectives is: -''are'' for comparative and -''ast'' for superlative.

'''ful, fulare, fulast''' (ugly, uglier, ugliest)

'''rolig, roligare, roligast''' (funny, funnier, funniest)

'''röd, rödare, rödast''' (red, more red, most red)



Many adjectives are on the form: [noun]ig or [noun]sk or [noun]isk. This is akin to English [noun]y or [noun]ic or [noun]ish [noun]ean. The -''g'' is silent in everyday speech, thus: &quot;Ja blir toki, nä tokiast!&quot; (I'm going crazy, no craziest!). As in English, long words are often compared by means of ''mer'' (more) and ''mest'' (most).

For example: Snabb (fast), snabbare (faster), snabbast (fastest); tokig (crazy), tokigare (crazier), tokigast (craziest); excentrisk (eccentric), mer excentrisk, mest excentrisk.

A famous Swedish tongue-twisters is the neuter adjective or adverb ''västkustskt''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Sv-v%C3%A4stkustskt.ogg].
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The adjectives are affected by the [[Swedish/Nouns|nouns]] they describe, both depending on singular/plural and gender. For example:

'''ful''' (ugly)&lt;br/&gt;
ful [singular uter noun] (''en ful get'' -- an ugly goat)&lt;br/&gt;
fult [singular neuter noun] (''ett fult får'' -- an ugly sheep)&lt;br/&gt;
fula [plural noun] (''några fula getter och fula får'' -- some ugly goats and ugly sheep)&lt;br/&gt;

'''rolig''' (funny)&lt;br/&gt;
rolig [singular uter noun] (''en rolig lek'' -- a fun[ny] (children's) play)&lt;br/&gt;
roligt [singular neuter noun] (''ett roligt spel'' -- a fun[ny] game)&lt;br/&gt;
roliga [plural noun] (''många roliga spel och lekar'' -- many funny games and plays) &lt;br/&gt;

'''röd''' (red)&lt;br/&gt;
röd [singular uter noun] (''en röd stuga'' -- a red cabin)&lt;br/&gt;
rött [singular neuter noun] (''ett rött hus'' -- a red house)&lt;br/&gt;
röda [plural noun] (''en massa röda hus och stugor'' -- a lot of red houses and cabins)&lt;br/&gt;

Adverbs(usually ending in -ly in English) are formed by using the singular neuter form of the adjective. Example: ''Tåget går väldigt långsamt'' (the train is going very slowly).



'''Some irregular (''oregelbundna'') Swedish adjectives:'''
* Liten '''or''' små, mindre, minst. (Little or small)
* Stor, större, störst. (Big or large)
* Långsam, långsammare, långsammast. (Slow)
* Dålig, sämre, sämst. (Bad)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Developed to reduce the mite population of that hive. It is placed on the  bottom of the hive box. Sticky paper can be placed underneath the box to observe the number of mites that fall through the screen. If a plain floor is used below the SBB, a gap of around 2&quot; (5cm) will prevent any mites returning to the hive.

[[/Introduction|Välkommen!]] ''Welcome!''

Swedish ({{Audio|Sv-svenska.ogg|''svenska''}}) is a ''North Germanic language'' spoken predominantly in ''Sweden'', part of ''Finland'', and on the autonomous island ''Åland'', by a total of over 10 million speakers.

Standard Swedish is the national language, which has evolved from the Central Swedish dialects from the 19th century and was well-established by the first decades of the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties still exist, influenced by the older dialects, both the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized. Some of the genuine dialects differ considerably from the standard language in grammar and vocabulary and are not always mutually intelligible with Standard Swedish. They are mostly confined to individual communities and have been in decline during the past century. Though not facing imminent extinction, and often encouraged by local authorities, they are usually confined to rural areas in population of low education and social mobility.

Swedish is distinguished by its prosody, which varies considerably between the various varieties and includes both lexical stress and some tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory, with a total of 9 separate vowels that are distinguished by quantity and to some degree quality, making up a total of 17 vowel phonemes. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, [ɧ], found in most varieties, but has not been found in any other language.

Swedish is closely related to, and usually mutually intelligible with, [[Danish]] and [[Norwegian]], and to some degree with ''Faroese''; all of which evolved from ''Old Norse'' about a millennium ago. It is also closely related to ''Icelandic'', though the two are not mutually intelligible. Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian ''Bokmål'', which are all considered ''East Scandinavian languages'', have been strongly influenced by ''Low German''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the sje sound (''sje-ljudet'') in {{Audio|sv-sjok.ogg|''sjok''}}, /ɧu:k/, &quot;batch&quot;

And this is the tje sound (''tje-ljudet'') in {{Audio|sv-kjol.ogg|''kjol''}}, /ɕu:l/, &quot;skirt&quot;

Now, what you ''really'' should hold in mind when it comes to ''sje'' is that it is not ''tje''; and what you ''really'' should think about when it comes to ''tje'' is that it is not ''sje''. As long as you use some 'darker' sound for ''sje'' and some brighter sound for ''tje'', that's fine. For example, use a German ''ach-Laut'', the voiced postalveolar fricative found in ''mea&lt;u&gt;'''s'''&lt;/u&gt;ure'' or the dark ''sh'' in ''shoe'' for ''sje'', and a German ''ich-laut'' or the bright ''sh'' in ''shimmering'' for ''tje''. Some Swedish dialects come ''very'' close to these sounds for their ''sje''’s and ''tje''’s.

I disagree with your dates of the Romantic Era as being 1825-1945. While it is true that several composers during the first 45 years of the 20th century composed in a distinctly Romantic style (e.g. Rachmanioff), these composers are generally considered to be &quot;neo-romantics,&quot; not &quot;late romantics.&quot; The techniques they use contain clear contemporary influences. Additionally, while several composers continued in this style, the general trend moved to the more atonal contemporary era. I did, however, modify my original endpoint of 1900 to 1905 to conform with the dates given by wikipedia.

== Possible Consolidation ==

Hi there, please have a look at the work I have just completed on [[Western Music History]]. Unfortunatly I did not know that this book was in existance when I started work on [[Western Music History]]. Perhaps we could consolidate our work. However, the writing is very rough at the moment. But still have a look and see what you think.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

* 250g of [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]] (12-15 large)
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1.5 cups of [[Cookbook:Chicken Stock|chicken stock]]
* 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]
* 1 cup tightly packed [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] ([[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]])
* 500g [[Cookbook:Fusilli|fusilli]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Parmigiano Reggiano|parmigiano reggiano]]

==Procedure==

# Place pancetta in a large sauté pan and cook over medium-low heat stirring occasionally until crisp about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Set aside. Pour off all but 1 T of the fat.
# Add butter to the fat in the pan. Add garlic, shallots and sugar and season lightly with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cook covered until shallots are soft and transparent about 15 minutes. Remove lid raise heat to medium high and cook stirring constantly until they have a deep golden-brown coating about 10 minutes. Do not allow to burn.
# Add the stock and simmer until reduced by one-third stirring to loosen brown bits from bottom of pan about 7 minutes. The sauce can be prepared up to this point several hours ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator. 
# Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Reheat the shallot mixture if it was prepared in advance. If using add cream to shallots and simmer for 2 minutes over high heat until sauce thickens slightly. Keep warm. Coarsely chop all but a small handful of herbs.
# Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and return to pot. Add chopped herbs to sauce and cook for another minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add pasta to sauce and toss together over low heat for 1 minute. As pasta and sauce heat, sauté remaining herbs in 1/2 t olive oil until crisp for garnish. Stir in pancetta and 1/2 C of the grated cheese. Divide the pasta among 4 bowls. Garnish with sautéed herbs. Serve remaining cheese on the side.

This makes 4-6 servings.

==Variations and Additions==

Given the strong and flavorful nature of this dish, when choosing a meat or other food to go along with this you must keep in mind that the two must not overpower each other. Grilling a small medallion of sirloin steak with garlic and red wine would go along perfectly with this, or perhaps a seared pork tenderloin medallion with white wine and ground pepper.

The Foundation Kit is one of two frameworks or large collections of classes that comprise Cocoa. It provides classes for dealing with strings, collections, memory management, communication, threading, et cetera. Most of the functionality  in a Cocoa application that is independent of the application's interface can be attributed to classes residing in the Foundation framework.

== Foundation Locks ==
An NSLock object is provided as a less-portable alternative to using POSIX locks in the Cocoa Foundation Kit. A simpler alternative is to used the @synchronized Objective-C directive.

I've never heard &quot;punctuations&quot; as the plural of &quot;punctuation&quot;, only &quot;punctuation&quot;.  Same with &quot;casing&quot;. It'd be like writing &quot;informations&quot;. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:03, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

: Referring to more than one at a time might be a rarity, which could be why [[wikt:punctuations|punctuations]] and [[wikt:casings|casings]] is rarely seen. [[wikt:informations|informations]] is also a word, but I think that might be used more often in British English. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:31, 8 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Swedish, only the name of the country is considered a name, and thus capitalized. Nationalities and languages are written with lower case initials. The same word as that of the language are generally also used when referring to female nationals.

The general rule here is [Root]ien (country), [root] or [root]ier (nationality) and [root]iska (language). For example: ''Bulgarien'', ''bulgar'', ''bulgariska''. Smaller countries outside of Europe often have in Swedish the same name as in English, e.g. ''Botswana'', ''Costa Rica'' or ''Afghanistan''. Names ending with -stan are usually the same, although the different way to Latinize Cyrillic letters (''kyrilliska bokstäver'') to Swedish, alters some of them slightly, e.g. ''Tadzjikistan''.

'''Notes:'''
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) For reasons of political correctness, ''amerikansk'' is at times switched to a prefix ''USA-'', e.g. &quot;den amerikanska industrin&quot; becomes &quot;USA-industrin&quot;.
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ''franska'' refers only to the language, a French woman is called ''en fransyska''.
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) ''spanska'' refers only to the language, a Spanish woman is called ''en spanjorska''.
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) ''finländare'' refers to all citizens of Finland, those whose native language is Finnish are called ''finnar'' (sing. ''finne''), those whose native language is Swedish are called finlandssvenskar. ''Finska'' refers to the Finnish language and to a female ''finne'', female ''finländare'' are ''finländskor''.
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) ''Japan'' the country is pronounced with stress on the first syllable: [ja:pan], ''japan'' the nationality is pronounced with stress on the last syllable: [japa:n].

= SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol =
Normally attributed to the TCP/IP port 25 the SMTP is the result of boiling down the following RFCs

* RFC 821 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (Standard)
* RFC 1870 - SMTP Service Extension for Message Size Declaration (Standard)
* RFC 2821 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (Proposed)
* RFC 2822 - Internet Message Format (Proposed)
* RFC 2920 - SMTP Service Extension for Command Pipelining (Standard)
* RFC 3030 - SMTP Service Extensions for Transmission of Large and Binary MIME Messages (Proposed)
* RFC 2487 - SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS (Proposed?)

Technically, some of these make up ESTMP, but I tend to lump them all together. Where I deal with emails, there doesn't seem to be much difference (or I don't know any better).

NB: I'm going to rant a little in this. 

Even though I do provide links to the above RFCs, I haven't taken the time to go read them. That's the job of someone who writes the MTA ;) I just find bugs, fix them if I can, and try to kill off any much junk from getting to my users as humanly, and computationally, possible. My use of should in the following areas is based on personal opinion and experience, not the RFCs. Although they do generally match, I'm a lot more strict on what is acceptable.

You may also notice that I say to reject the mail at certain points in the SMTP conversation. Why not? If the other end is a mail server then it's quite capable of making a bounce message and sending it back to whom ever wrote the email, AND it will be in a format that the local system administrator will know and can deal with. If it's a spam engine or a virus, then your bounce message becomes a spam itself - if you reject before accepting the message, there's no bounce message made.

== HELO/EHLO ==
Allowed - valid hostnames &amp; IP's&lt;br&gt;
[x.x.x.x] - Not likely to find a mail server that does this any more, but I still accept it.&lt;br&gt;
mail.example.com - perfect.

Dis-allowed - The rest!&lt;br&gt;
x.x.x.x   - missing the square brackets&lt;br&gt;
ms_server.example.com - underline is an illegal character! (MS$ puts it in place of spaces - oops)&lt;br&gt;

The hostname provided at HELO time should resolve to IP address of the host connecting. The reverse IP could match the forward, but with the increase in small business on ADSL (and other BB links), many servers don't have access to their rdns records.

== MAIL FROM: ==
Supposed to be the email address to send all bounce messages and any status update messages to. Usually the person sending the email, a script that handles bounces, or something else you can think up. Spam senders make up fake ones (for now) so this is a good way to kill off a lot of it. Verify it with a callout, or whatever your favorite MTA provides. Long live [[http://www.exim.org Exim]]

Email addresses should be in the form &quot;Real Name&quot; &lt;email@domain.com&gt;

== RCPT TO: ==
To whom are you sending your email?&lt;br&gt;
The final recipient of the message. This should be validated at this time with possible dictionary attack prevention. This is a minor mung of the Standards (so I've been told), but has reduced the amount of traffic by at least 50% at some sites. It also stops spammers using your MTA as a host for bounce spamming (Many servers accept bounce emails with a lot less restrictions that normal emails).

See MAIL FROM: for format.

== DATA ==
The meat of the message. Should filter this for spam and viruses and reject here if there's something wrong. Save the world from useless bounce messages.

Format is Headers followed by an empty line, the message body, and then CRLF.CRLF (full stop on a line of its own).&lt;br&gt;
Headers a single line things - Header: content&lt;br&gt;
If wrapping is required, the second and further lines must start with a white space.

Body can be pretty much any 7bit [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] character.

I'm sure there's a million other things to add to this, however, that's why this is a wiki! Contribute away.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Ben, I think this is great!

I'm glad I'm not the only one with these crazy ideas :-).

It would be great if, besides the ambition to translate the Shulhan Arukh, you also could contribute a [[Mishnah]] now and then!

In terms of setting up a project like this, there is probably a lot of background material you could borrow from the [[Mishnah]] project.

Also: you might want to decide if you are doing a ''translation'', or if you also want to include study aids. If the letter, then you are in the right place: Wikibooks. If the former (just a translation), then this probably belongs at Wikisource.

I am joining [[User:Paris Lovett|Paris Lovett]] in development of the [[Emergency Medicine]] Wikibook OCTEM, the Open Source Textbook of Emergency Medicine as it gets off the ground in May 2005.

I am a practicing emergency physician in Houston, Texas and long-time health informatician - fascinated with the develoment of tools to assist in the practice of medicine and emergency medicine specifically.

I am a Rice Electrical Engineer (1970) who went to medical school to find something interesting to do with computers. I love programming these machines to do interesting things. Most recently I am finishing another masters degree in health informatics at the School of Health Information Sciences (SHIS)

I can be reached at kirt at hal-  pc.org. (remove white space)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Health Informatics (HI) is the academic field or profession of 1) applying computers to medicine and 2) studying and developing theories of information, knowledge and thought processes of the practitioner-users, that is the cognitive science and cognitive engineering of physicians, nurses and all users of these information devices.

HI is deeply rooted in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_science translational science], a cross-disciplinary practice of analyzing datasets derived from clinic records and clinical research data and translating the results into future decision-making in many health-related disciplines, including clinical practice, clinical research, computer science and engineering, human-computer interaction (HCI), cognitive science, psychology and others.

HI covers a spectrum from applications (getting something to work) to theory (studying how it works or why it doesn't).

There are many special interests within HI which match up with the many particular specialties in medicine, such as nursing, radiology, imaging, laboratory medicine (pathology) as well as emergency medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">La voz pasiva (the passive voice) is formed in Spanish with '''ser''' + '''participio pasado'''.
:''El soldado en la pintura &quot;Guernica&quot; fue mutilado por las bombas.''
:The soldier in the painting &quot;Guernica&quot; was mutilated by the bombs.

It is used when the agent of the verb is unknown, but can also be used (as in this example) to put more emphasis on the person or thing which receives the action as opposed to the subject.

'''Marsala Chicken Scallopini''' is a meal in the style of Italian cuisine, with mouthwatering flavors gotten from the fortified Marsala wine.

==Ingredients==
*2 boneless skinless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 3 tsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dry [[Cookbook:Marsala Wine|marsala wine]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]/chicken [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] of fresh [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]
* [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]

==Procedure==
# Put each chicken breast in a plastic bag and flatten with a meat tenderizer. Coarsely [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] the basil, and then throw it in a deep baking pan along with some flour, oregano, and toss the chicken with it.
# Melt 2 tsp of butter in a medium fry pan on low-medium heat. When the butter stops bubbling, add the chicken and brown each section approximately 3 minutes for each side. Once this is done, cover and set aside on a separate plate.
# Drain off most of the liquid from the pan, and raise the heat. Pour a dollop of olive oil in, and sear the asparagus quickly. Remove this and set aside.
# Keep at high heat, add the marsala and 1/4 of the stock. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boil]] off for a few minutes. Lower the heat, and return the asparagus to the pan. Add the remaining stock and boil off to reduce. Add a tsp of butter, and cover chicken with sauce.
# Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

At various points during this, you may want to grind some fresh pepper and sprinkle salt over top of the sauce or chicken,;do so according to your tastes.

This serves 4-6, depending on serving size.

'''Crabs''' are crustaceans related to [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], [[Cookbook:Lobster|lobster]], and [[wikipedia:Krill|krill]].

Crabs are usually [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] whole. Often, just the legs are served along with the portion attached to the leg and the claws. In most areas away from the coasts the only way to obtain crab is either preserved such as in a can or jar or frozen.  Frozen Snow, King, Or Jumbo crab generally retains it's flavor very well, as it is often frozen immediately after it is caught and cooked, then it is shipped frozen. To serve it only has to be reheated so it can either be steamed or baked. If a sufficiently large steaming basket is available, place the crab inside and steam for about 10 minutes until heated through. It is commonly served with melted butter which can be clarified first and with lemon optional.

== Dairy ==
=== Cow's milk ===
[[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] in cooking provides flavor, moisture, and thickness. It is important to consider the different qualities of the vast array of plant-based milk options in order to decide which will best suit the particular recipe. When using plant-based milk instead of cow's milk, you may want to cut down on any other sugars in the recipe. There is no recipe that can not be made just as well using a cow's milk substitute, it all depends on selecting the right one for the job.  

;Water
:Replacing cow's milk with water can serve to add the needed moisture but frequently the results in less rich foods; there, the alternative is to use plant milk.
;Soy Milk
:[[Cookbook:Soy Milk|Soy milk]] can generally be substituted directly for cow's milk in any recipe, though it does not curdle in the same way cow's milk does when heated.

:There are a massive variety of soy milks available. Soy milk also comes in an unsweetened variety.  There are also refrigerated brands.

;Coconut milk
:[[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|Coconut milk]] is a wonderful substitute for cow's milk and cow's cream in many recipes. It has a thick, rich and sweet taste, which suits some vegan cream sauces and cream soups well. It also doesn't become grainy like soy milk. However, it is one of the few plants that has saturated fat in it.  The fat is, however in the form of MCFA's (medium chain fatty acids) that are easily and efficiently processed into energy and are considered to be beneficial to heart health.
;Rice milk
:[[Cookbook:Rice Milk|Rice milk]] is relatively watery and grainy. 
;Oat milk
:[[Cookbook:Oat Milk|Oat milk]] can be very thick and creamy.
;Almond milk
:[[Cookbook:Almond Milk|Almond milk]] is also somewhat watery, but has a rich flavor. Almond milk also comes in an unsweetened variety.

=== Buttermilk ===
Add one [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] to one [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] or rice milk. Stir, and let stand for 30 minutes.

=== Butter ===

;Margarine
Most  are made with oils, which are generally considered to be bad for human health, as they raise bad cholesterol levels. Margarine is also made by emulsing stabilizers such as protein powder, starches, or gums with oil. This technique may be better for human health, but is not widely adopted. 

It is worth noting especially that many margarines may contain some sort of milk by-product to make them taste more like butter (e.g.; Whey, Lactose, Sodium Lactate, Casein - a milk protein, etc.) so a good rule of thumb is to read the labels and do your research. If you don't know what something is, write it down and do a search for the ingredient later.

Under most conditions, vegetable oil may simply be used as a replacement for butter or margarine for cooking and baking, using the measurement of 1 cup butter/margarine = 3/4 cup oil. Adding a tablespoon of a good vegetable or nut milk will provide more of a creamy/dairy-type taste if desired.

In some recipes, butter is a major ingredient, as in [[Cookbook:Icing|icing]], and margarines often leave a greasy feeling in your mouth if used as a substitute; this is because the melting point of margarine (33-43 °C, depending upon formulation) is often higher than the temperature of the human body (37 °C), while the melting point of butter is below it (32-35 °C). In these situations [[Cookbook:Cocoa Butter|cocoa butter]] can be used, since it has a melting point closer to that of butter (34-38 °C).

;Vegetable or canola oil
If a recipe calls for one stick of butter (1/2 cup), use 1/3 cup of oil. 

;Flax oil
Use it as a topping for potatoes, rice, popcorn, etc.  Used in eggplant or tempeh dishes, some people think that it can create a &quot;fishy&quot; taste for appropriate dishes, but this is not the opinion of everyone.  Not generally heated or used for cooking.

;Nut butter
Nut butter can be made from almonds, cashews, or other nuts. Peanut butter, though technically made from a legume, is also considered part of this category. When replacing butter with a nut butter, use the same amount as listed in the recipe.

;Coconut oil
Raw coconut oil is becoming increasingly available and can be used to substitute for butter. Note that while solid at room temperature, it melts at a lower temperature than butter and is unsuited for making pastry (unless you can chill the room significantly). Raw coconut oil is great spread on baked goods and can also be used in cooking. Note that processed coconut oil is not the same product as cold-pressed raw coconut oil and has been shown to be detrimental to human health.

;Applesauce
Use for sweet baking only. Use the same amount you would for butter. Especially yummy in brownies! For muffins, etc., replace up to 3/4 of the butter with applesauce, using vegan butter for the rest.

;Prune puree
Use in the same way as applesauce: Puree 1/2 cup of pitted prunes with 1/4 cup of water. You will want to reduce the amount used, or the final product may be too moist. If the recipe calls for a half cup use 1/3 cup instead. You may also want to add a little oil, maybe a tablespoon per cup of fat needed, because a little fat goes a long way in taste and texture.

=== Cheese ===
Most substitute cheese is made of soy, though there are also nut varieties. Beware: some soy cheeses contain casein / caseinate, a milk derivative.

Replace cottage cheese or ricotta cheese with crumbled tofu in lasagna and other dishes.  Adding a little [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]] can give a &quot;blue cheese&quot; flavor.

Products marketed as vegan cheese have a cheese-like taste and melt well (including on pizza) and are available in Mozzarella, Monterrey Jack, Cheddar, and other flavors.  Some are allergen-free, cholesterol free, and trans fat free.

Cashew cheese or [[w:nutritional yeast|nutritional yeast]] &quot;cheese&quot; sauce may also be appropriate for some dishes.

Vegan cream cheese is available in various flavors and without hydrogenated oils.

=== Cream ===
Vegan cream substitute has a very similar texture to real cream and tastes quite similar.  Rice-based creams are good for those who don't want or can't have soy, but are allergic to nuts and so cannot have oat-based creams.

Coconut milk also is a great substitute for cream in many baking recipes. One part raw cashews with one part water, blended till smooth, also functions well as a cream substitute - especially because cashews are naturally a little sweet.

=== Yogurt ===
There are a variety of soy yogurts (&quot;cultured soy&quot;) available that can be used in place of dairy yogurt. Coconut yogurt is also available.
Oats can also be fermented to make a delightful and cheap yogurt.

=== Mayonnaise ===
Vegan mayonnaise is available in canola oil (&quot;original&quot;), expeller-pressed canola oil, grapeseed oil, and organic expeller-pressed soybean varieties.

== Eggs ==
Eggs have a varied role in cooking; as a wash they provide a glossy texture to breads, when the whites are whipped they provide volume, sometimes (as in pancakes) they are simply traditional and play no structural role, other times they are used to make mixtures stick together.

Vegan egg replacements are generally not good for washes or where they are a major component, as in [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]].

==== Baking ====
The following amounts are intended to replace 1 egg.

1 1/2 tsp. vegan egg substitute + 2 tbsp. warm water (multipurpose baking)

1/4 cup tofu, add to blender with enough water/ soya milk to blend smoothly

1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Applesauce|Applesauce]] (muffins, brownies, and cake)

1/4 cup Soy Yogurt (Quick breads, muffins, cakes)

1/3 cup [[w:Pumpkin|Pumpkin]] Puree (for pies and baking)

1/2 small mashed [[w:Banana|Banana]] (for quick breads, muffins, cakes, and pancakes)--helps browning

1 heaping Tbsp. Soy flour plus 1 Tbsp. Water (muffins, cookies and cakes)

1 Tbsp. ground flax plus 2 Tbsp. Water; mix well before using

(Note that the strong flavors of some substitutions such as banana or pumpkin will come through in the finished dish.)

==== For Binding ====

To bind things like burgers, use mashed potatoes, bread crumbs (blended), blended tofu, cooked rice/oatmeal, nutritional yeast, flaxmeal, or tomato paste.

For the firmest binding, and if you are not actively avoiding gluten, use &quot;gluten flour&quot; (also sometimes marketed as &quot;vital wheat gluten&quot;).

==== Other ====

The following can be used well in certain recipes, to replace 1 egg:

*'''Tofu''': 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]] blended. For dense cakes, brownies and the like, use only 1/2 cup to replace 3 eggs for lighter/fluffier baked goods, and add a teaspoon of arrowroot or cornstarch for cookies to keep the right texture. Bad for pancakes. Leaves no taste.

*'''Flax Seed &quot;Gloop&quot;''': 1 tablespoon flaxseed, finely ground in blender or coffee grinder or 2.5 tablespoons pre-ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water (for pancakes, breads, and other baking)&amp;mdash; distinct earthy granola taste great for things like pancakes, and whole grain items, such as bran muffins and corn muffins. It is perfect for oatmeal cookies, and the texture works for cookies in general, although the taste may be too pronounced for some. Chocolate cake-y recipes have mixed results, I would recommend only using one portion flax-egg in those, because the taste can be overpowering. Seed quality was investigated by means of a grain moisture meter. Measurement of moisture in the soil is an important indicator for the growing of grain.

*'''Arrowroot powder'''
*'''Agar powder''': Use with recipes that call for egg whites. For each egg white, dissolve 1 tbsp plain agar powder in 1 tbsp water. Whip, chill and whip again.
*'''Vegan egg substitute''': A versatile, commercially available egg replacer made from potato starch, tapioca flour, and vegan leaveners. You can find it at natural/health food stores. One whole egg = 1 tsp vegan egg substitute powder + 2 tbsp water. Tastes chalky.
*:To make something similar to commercial egg replacers:
*:*Mix together 1 tsp Baking Powder, 1/2 tsp Baking Soda, 2 Tbsp Flour,  3 Tbsp Water.
*:*A heaping tablespoon of soy flour or bean flour mixed with a tablespoon of water. 
*:*2 tablespoons of cornstarch beaten with 2 tablespoons of water.
*'''Baking powder mixture''': 1 tsp baking powder, 1 Tbsp water, 1 Tbsp vinegar; or 1 1/2 Tbsp water, 1 1/2 Tbsp oil, 1 tsp baking powder
*'''Yeast mixture''': 1 tsp yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water
*'''Apricot puree''': 1 Tbsp

== Honey ==
Honey comes from an animal source. Some good substitutes include:

*[[Cookbook:Agave Syrup|Agave syrup]]: a general-purpose liquid sweetener derived from the agave plant. (additional note: agave syrup has a low glycemic index and is appropriate for low-carb diets)
*[[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|Maple syrup]]: a syrup produced by the Maple tree.
*[[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|Golden syrup]]
*[[Wikipedia:Date syrup|Date syrup]]

== Meat ==
Meat can be replaced with varying degrees of success by tofu, [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]], [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]], [[Cookbook:TVP|textured vegetable protein]], vegetable or nut mixtures, or a commercially available meat substitute.

Many Asian foods stores have false meat available. False [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]] is especially realistic, but there is also false [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]], and [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]. These are usually made from [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]], but often also have [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]] ingredients.

== Miscellaneous ==
=== Fish Sauce ===
Fish sauce is made of fish. This cookbook has a recipe for [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce (Vegan)|vegan fish sauce]].

=== Worcestershire Sauce ===
Worcestershire sauce is traditionally made with anchovies. There are many vegan Worcestershire sauces. Some grocery store brands of Worcestershire sauce are also vegan.

=== Broth &amp; Bouillon ===
Chicken or beef broth can be replaced by a vegetable broth or by vegetable bouillon cubes.

      <comment>/* Black pudding is not Irish */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Being vegetarian, it's hard to come across good examples of local specialities that I can eat on my travels, since most local specialities seem to involve pigs in some way or another. However, when on a trip to Bath, in a lovely café, a very nice chap made me a plate of mashed potatoes with spring onions chopped up on it, which he said hailed from Ireland. It was the best plate of mash I've ever had. Doesn't sound much, but the quality of the potatoes, spring onions, and the massive pools of butter in which it seemed to be drowning all came together to provide something that was almost Italian in its quality and simplicity, and which went down beautifully with a good beer. The best simple lunch I've ever had; am not going to attempt its recreation, to avoid dissapointment. 

My Girlfriend wouldn't kiss me for the rest of the holiday, because she said my breath stank of onions.

Mashed potato with scallion (spring onions) and butter is know as 'champ', and is, as far as I know, particular to the North of Ireland. 



== Black pudding is not Irish ==

I'm from Northern Ireland, and here black pudding is just short of being dispised. It's very much a British thing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipesummary|Pastry recipes|1-2|prep: 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;baking: 1 hour|3|[[Image:23-pies finished.jpg|300px]]}}

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian cuisine]]

This recipe makes enough dough for one 23 cm (9 inch) covered pie. If your pie only requires a bottom crust, use half this recipe. Note: for best results, make the full recipe.  If only a single crust is required, make the full recipe and freeze half for later.

In contrast to [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]]. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible, to minimize toughness in the finished crust.

== Ingredients ==
* 310 grams (2 1/2 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 6 grams (1 teaspoon) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 4 grams (1 teaspoon) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (optional)
* 225 grams (1 cup cold) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 95 ml (1/3 cup plus 1 Tablespoon) cold water

== Procedure ==
# Whisk flour, salt and sugar together in a deep bowl.
# Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture.
# Using a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] or two butter knives, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is in small pea-sized pieces.
# Add cold water; cut the water into the flour-butter mixture with the edge of a rubber [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] until it is evenly moistened and will hold together when pressed.
# Form the dough into a ball with your hands, kneading in any loose flour. This should be done as quickly as possible to avoid melting the butter in the dough.
# Chill the dough for 10-20 minutes.
# Cut the dough evenly in half.
# On a lightly floured board, roll each half out until it will cover a 20 cm (9 inch) pie dish, with about 2 cm (3/4&quot; inch) overhang.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== To Form a Covered Pie ==
# Lay the bottom crust in the pie dish, ensuring that there are no gaps between the crust and the bottom of the dish.
# Fill the crust with the pie filling.
# Place the top crust on top, leaving equal overhang on all sides.
# Cut the overhang to about 2 cm (3/4&quot; inch) all around the pie.
# Working around the pie, hold the bottom and top crust overhangs together and tuck the combined overhang into the pie dish behind the bottom crust.
# With the forefinger and thumb of each hand, pinch the ridge formed by the tuck into a decorative edge, or press this ridge with a fork.
# Brush the top of the pie with milk, and sprinkle with sugar.
# Cut vents in the top crust so that steam can escape.
# For a fruit pie, bake on the lower-middle rack of an oven at 220 °C (425 degress Fahrenheit) for 30 minutes to set the crust, then at 180 °C (350 degreess Fahrenheit) for 30 minutes to cook the filling. 

Note: When baking two pies at once, rotate the pies 180 degrees at 15 minutes and 45 minutes to ensure the crust does not burn due to its proximity to the oven walls.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
;Vegan: Use a [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions|hard vegan fat]], such as [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] in place of the butter. (used for the images shown above)
;Traditional: Use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], which is less saturated than butter and produces the flakiest crusts.
;Top Crust Colouring: Brush on lightly beaten egg white to colour crust instead of milk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motion in One Dimension ==
As physics, at its essence, is the study of motion, we will begin our book with the study of motion, in one dimension.  

To simplify our discussion, we will want to create a model of the real objects we will be discussing.  Thus, we create the concept of a &quot;particle&quot;.  A particle, simply, is a very small object, one whose length, width, and height are negligible.  With this concept of a particle,  we can unambiguously define the distance from it to the origin, without having to worry about from what point we measure the object.



=== '''Position''' ===
[[Image:Particle.png|right|thumbnail|Position, when restricted to the ''x''-axis, can be described as a single number ''x'']]
Consider a particle restricted to movement along a single line.  Its position can be described with a single number, ''x''.  This number can be thought of as the particle's distance from the origin, or the magnitude of the vector pointing from the origin to the particle.  The actual displacement of the particle is actually a vector with one entry (because we are working in one dimensional space), but because the direction is known it can be specified unambiguously by the magnitude alone.

The value ''x'' is measured in meters, and in order to interpret it, a particle and a ''reference frame,'' or coordinate system, must be implied.  If the particle does not remain in the same place at different times, then the value of ''x'' will change in time, and thus we can define a function ''x''(''t'') which returns the position of the particle at a point in time ''t''.    
   
For example, say we have a particle with position function ''x''(''t'')= 2''t''.  Its position at ''t'' = 3 is ''x''(3) = 2(3) = 6 m along the ''x''-axis.   
 
For a particle with position function ''x''(''t'')= ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5, its position at ''t'' = 7 s is ''x''(7) = 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5 = 54 m along the ''x''-axis.

=== '''Velocity'''  ===
[[File:Position Function Graph.png|right|thumbnail|The graph of a position function.]]
Consider the graph of a position function.  Under any known physical conditions, this function must be continuous &amp;mdash; if it were discontinuous, that would allow the possibility that objects could spontaneously jump from place to place.  Furthermore, as we shall see at the end of this section, the position function is also twice differentiable.  Under these conditions, we are able to see that the function has a well defined rate of change everywhere.

Velocity, in one dimension, is the measure of the rate of change position per unit time, and is measured in meters per second.   The simplest way to measure velocity is to measure the time position of a particle at two different times, and divide the change in position (displacement) by the change in time.  As a formula:

&lt;math&gt;\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}&lt;/math&gt;   
 
where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and inital distances respectively and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial times. 

Notice that since the numerator has units of length and the denominator has units of time, the quotient has units of length divided by time.  In SI, the units of velocity are the derived units of meters per second.  Common non-SI units of velocity include [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_hour miles per hour] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_%28speed%29 knots].
  
'''Example 1:'''  A particle starting at the origin has moved 27 m in 9 s. Find &lt;math&gt;\bar{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\bar{v} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}   

= \frac{27\ \mathrm{m} - 0\ \mathrm{m}}{9\ \mathrm{s}-0\ \mathrm{s}}   

= 3\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;   

'''Example 2:'''  A particle starting 23 m from the origin has moved to 43 m in 5 s. Find &lt;math&gt;\bar{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\bar {v} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}   

= \frac{43\ \mathrm{m}-23\ \mathrm{m}}{5\ \mathrm{s} - 0\ \mathrm{s}}   

= \frac{20\ \mathrm{m}}{5\ \mathrm{s}}   

= 4\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s} &lt;/math&gt;   


There is a limit, however, to what average velocity can tell us. For example, it's entirely possible that the speed of a particle varies with respect to ''t'', and we want to determine the velocity of the particle at a certain instant in time.  To do this, we take the average velocity over a smaller and smaller time interval, that is, 

&lt;math&gt;\ v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;   

Expanding this, we get

&lt;math&gt; v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{x(t_f) - x(t_i)}{t_f - t_i}&lt;/math&gt;

And rewriting &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; as t and t+&lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, we get

&lt;math&gt; v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the definition of the derivative.  Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;\ v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;   


'''Example 1:'''  A particle's motion is described by the equation &lt;math&gt;\ x(t) = 3t^2 + 5t + 2&lt;/math&gt;. Find a) the particle's velocity function, and b) its instantaneous velocity at ''t'' = 4 s.   

a) &lt;math&gt;   

v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}   

= \frac{d}{dt} (3t^2 + 5t + 2)   

= 6t + 5&lt;/math&gt;   

b) &lt;math&gt;   

\ v(4) = 6(4\ \mathrm{s}) + 5   

= 29\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}   
&lt;/math&gt;

==='''Acceleration'''===
Just as the time derivative of a particle's position function has a significant meaning, that is, its velocity, so too does the time derivative of the velocity function. In this case, it is known as the ''acceleration'' of the particle.  You may have heard of acceleration previously, such as when referring to cars or other vehicles.  Acceleration is measured in meters per second per second, or m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, read 'meters per second squared.'  Some old texts use the equivalent phrase 'meters per second per second.'

Average acceleration, or &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}_x&lt;/math&gt; is similar to average velocity in that it is independent of the path taken by the particle; it is simply the change in velocity divided by the change in time:   
 
&lt;math&gt; \bar{a} = \frac{v_{xf} - v_{xi}}{t_f - t_i} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;   

And again, through a similar derivation, we arrive at the definition of instantaneous acceleration:

&lt;math&gt;a(t) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;   

Since the velocity is a derivative of the original position function, we can also say that the instantaneous acceleration is the ''second derivative'' of the position function, which would be written as follows:   

&lt;math&gt;a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercises ===
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a particle moving in one dimension with position function ''x''(''t'') = 5''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; 8''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 20:
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine the velocity ''v'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the acceleration ''a'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At what time(s) will the particle come to a momentary stop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At what time(s) will the particle's acceleration be zero?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particle in simple harmonic motion has a position defined by the function ''x''(''t'') = (80 cm) sin [(20 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)''t''].
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine the velocity ''v'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the acceleration ''a'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the period of the particle's motion?  (That is, how long does it take for the particle to return to the position and velocity at which it started?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excluding the effects of air resistance, an apple falls from a tree with a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the apple's velocity ''v''(''t'')?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the apple's velocity after one second of freefall?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the position ''x''(''t'')?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the position after one second of freefall?  Two seconds?  Three seconds?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Motion in Two or Three Dimensions ==

Describing the motion of a particle in two or more dimensions can be more complex than in one dimension, because, instead of having only two directions in which to move (back and forth along the ''x''-axis) there are an infinite number of paths a particle can take.  In order to properly describe the motion of a particle, we must use vectors.

=== '''Position''' ===

When dealing with motion in one dimension, we could describe an object's position with a single variable, its location along the ''x''-axis. Now that we have two or more axes, we need one variable ''per axis'' to describe a particle's location. We can use a position vector, denoted '''r''', to describe the location of this particle. In the two-dimensional case, the position vector is drawn from the origin to the location of the particle in the Cartesian plane and has two coordinates, the ''x''-position of the particle, and the ''y''-position of the particle. 

'''Example 1''': The position of a particle at (4, 5) on a Cartesian plane can be described as 4 units along the ''x''-axis, and 5 units along the ''y''-axis, or as the position vector '''r''' = &lt;4, 5&gt; = 4'''i''' + 5'''j''', where '''i''' and '''j''' are the unit vectors in the x and y direction, respectively.

From this example, we can see that a position vector takes the form &lt;''x'', ''y''&gt;, where ''x'' is the distance moved along the ''x''-axis and ''y'' is the distance moved along the ''y''-axis.

'''Example 2''': A carbon atom sits 7.0 nm east, 0.5 nm north, and 3.0 nm below the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope.  Its position vector '''r''' = &lt;7.0 nm, 0.5 nm, &amp;ndash;3.0 nm&gt;.  Taking '''i''' to be east, '''j''' to be north, and '''k''' to be up, '''r''' = (7.0 nm)'''i''' + (0.5 nm)'''j''' + (&amp;ndash;3.0 nm)'''k'''.

=== '''Displacement''' ===

Recall that the displacement of a particle is the difference between its initial and final positions. In two dimensional motion, we denote the displacement vector as &amp;Delta;'''r'''. The displacement vector is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_f - \mathbf{r}_i &lt;/math&gt;

The direction of the displacement vector is the straight line between the starting point and the termination point of a particle's path.

=== '''Velocity''' ===

As with motion in one dimension, we still retain the concepts of average and instantaneous velocity; the only difference is that we now must treat the change in position as a change in the position vector. Thus, the average velocity in two dimensions is

&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{r}}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

Since, like displacement, &lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt; is independent of path, the direction of &lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt; is along &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

Like its one-dimensional analog, the instantaneous velocity '''v''' is calculated by finding the time derivative of the vector displacement '''r''':

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

=== '''Acceleration''' ===

Just as with the one-dimensional case, the average and instantaneous accelerations can be calculated using derivatives and limits.

The average acceleration is given by:
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{a}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}_f - \mathbf{v}_i}{t_f - t_i} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous acceleration is given by:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>[[Talk:Programming:Cocoa]] moved to [[Talk:Cocoa Programming]]: for clarity</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Initial Comments ==
As Cocoa is not only the name for a set of frameworks/APIs (primarily Foundation and AppKit but including many more) but also the name for an application environment within Mac OS X this topic will need a clear introduction and careful use of terminology.

I will wait for interested parties to discuss the direction of this book before making wholesale changes but I propose that this book head in the following direction:
=== Book Outline ===
==== Overview ====
* The Cocoa Application environment
* Cocoa Applications
* Cocoa Frameworks
** Foundation Framework
** Application Kit Framework
* Possible Languages
** Objective-C
** Java
** AppleScript
** Others (Python, Ruby, Shell Scripting, Tcl, etc)

==== Beginning Cocoa Programming ====
Creating an example (AppleScript?) program from installation through to compilation to show readers the basic tasks involved in writing an application.
* Developer Tools
** Installing Developer Tools
** The Development Environment
* Starting the Project
* Building the Interface
* Writing the Code
* Running the Application

==== Cocoa Principles ====
Start building an example Objective-C program (refer readers to [[Programming:Objective-C]] if necessary?) to teach Cocoa programming principles and basic features.
* Objects
** Root class (NSObject)
** Basic Cocoa objects
* MVC
** Model
** View
** Controller
* Object Modelling
** Entities
** Properties
* Creating a Graphical User Interface
** Windows
** Views
*** Controls
*** Menus
*** Text Views
** Connections

==== Common Cocoa Features ====
Add some additional features to the program that introduce intermediate features.

==== Completing a Cocoa Application ====
Complete the program and incorporate advanced Cocoa features.

=== Other Comments ===
As this is a Programming Cocoa book (not a programming OpenStep or GNUstep book) I think that in general it should focus on Cocoa. A chapter or part devoted to how the book relates to GNUstep would be helpful for those who are interested but I think trying to make the entire book relevant to both Cocoa and GNUstep programmers is going to add unneccessary complexity and end up confusing both.

Additional topics obviously need to be added to Parts 3 &amp; 4. Splitting features into &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; can be somewhat arbitrary but should help divide the book into more manageable chunks.</text>

[[File:Pupusas.jpg|275px|thumb|Pupusas]]

A '''pupusa''' is a stuffed [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn-tortilla]], usually served with a spicy [[Cookbook:Coleslaw|coleslaw]] called '''curtido'''. This recipe makes both. Pupusas originated in El Salvador, but imigrants have taken the dish to other Central American countries and beyond. ''Pupuserías'', places where pupusas are sold and/or eaten. 

Pupusas are hand-made and thick. Like all corn tortillas, they are made using [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]]. They are stuffed with one or more of the following:
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] ''(queso)'' (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese called Quesillo)
*[[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] pork rind ''(chicharrones)''
*[[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] ''(pollo)''
*[[Cookbook:Refried Beans|refried beans]] ''(frijoles refritos)''
*''queso y Loroco'' (loroco is a shrub flower bud from Central America)
There is also the ''pupusa revueltas'' (with mixed ingredients of cheese, pork, and [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]]).  Pupusas are usually served with curtido and [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]. They are eaten with the fingers.

==Preparing the dough==
There are different brands of corn masa to make the dough. MASECA, which can be found in most large American supermarkets in the international section, is one of them but there are others. Follow the instructions on the bag for making tortilla dough, and make as much dough as needed. (One pupusa uses about as much dough as two tortillas.) Once the dough has been prepared, set it aside while you prepare the filling.

==Three Fillings==
===Cheese===
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (use hard and cream cheese mixed together; you can mix frying cheese, [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]] and ricotta
*3 or 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]
*1/2 to 1 cup of Loroco (this will be hard to find in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|U.S.]] So you can use very finely chopped [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]] or [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]] instead)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
**Or to avoid all these complications, try find a specialty store and buy queso con loroco( you won't get the authentic flavor from a pupusa if you use American ingredients)

Make a paste with these ingredients. To avoid the paste leaking, it should not be too soft.

===Chicharron (Pork Rind Filling)===
*1 cup cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (cooked with [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], see below).
*4 - 5 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green pepper]]
*Salt to add taste.

Cook bacon with some garlic (optional). Set [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] aside but do not discard. Once cooked, grind bacon with the tomatoes, 1 green pepper, and salt to taste. Mix with some of the bacon fat until it has a soft consistency

===Revueltas===
Ground and [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] beans (they can be canned or prepared from your favorite recipe).

When filling the pupusas add beans, chicharrón and cheese (or combine two of the three).

==Making the pupusas==
With two tablespoons of dough make a ball using your hands and later clap your hands until you make a round, thin ([[Cookbook:Inch|1/8 of an inch]] thick) tortilla. Continue making more tortillas this way. Put filling over one tortilla, cover with another and push down the sides to close them. This is the &quot;beginners&quot; method.

People who have experience do it this way: make a ball with the dough. Insert your thumb in the ball and make a hole in the center. Fill that hole with the filling, close the hole by pushing the dough on the sides up. Clap your hands carefully so that the filling doesn't come out and flatten the ball.

Cook on a slightly greased [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]], [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|pan]] or electric pancake griddler and cook over low-medium heat ([[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|325-350°F]]) first one side, then the other until they are cooked. Each side will be ready when it no longer sticks to the pan (depending on the thickness of the tortillas, this might take 4 minutes or more per side).

Pupusas are topped with pickled cabbage and tomato sauce. 

==Curtido (pickled colesaw)==
*chopped [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] that has been quickly passed through [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] water
*medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], finely shredded
*cooked [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], not too soft (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Beet|beets]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]] (optional).
*[[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]], finely chopped (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or [[cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice
*water
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

In a glass or plastic jar with wide opening mix all the ingredients. Add vinegar and water to taste. Mix with a [[Cookbook:Wooden Spoon|wooden spoon]] (never metal). Put the mix in the refrigerator and let it rest for a week so that the ingredients [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickle]].

{{recipe}}

Oddly enough, '''refried beans''' ''(frijoles refritos)'' are only [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] once. The prefix &quot;re&quot; is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] prefix meaning &quot;very&quot; or &quot;well&quot;, inappropriately tacked onto a non-Spanish word.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]], especially pinto beans or [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or home-rendered [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]

==Procedure==
#If using dried beans, wash them and examine them for any rocks, or small dirt clods, then cover with water in a medium pot and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] until they are very soft. You'll need to cook the beans a long time on very low heat. You may add salt to the water. You may add onion halves or a [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] bone, which you can remove at the end. You may wish to soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator before cooking them. Expect the cooking to take at least 3 hours, if not 6 or more. 

Pinto beans soaked overnight take about 1.5 hours to cook when cooked at a slow, roiling boil. Cook pinto beans with a lid on the pot. Be certain to pour the soak water off and add fresh water for cooking. The soak water contains most of the ingredients that can cause flatulence. A faster alternative to soaking overnight is to bring a pot of pinto beans to a boil then take them off the fire and let them soak for about an hour, until the outer skin is wrinkled. Pour off this soak water to help with the flatulence issue, add fresh water and cook with slow roiling boil for about 1-1.5 hours. Of course, cooking pinto beans in a pressure cooker takes even less time. Finally, you can cook your soaked pinto beans slowly in a crock pot.    

#If using canned beans, rinse them. Try to make sure they are not slimy or too salty.
#Get a large wide pot or tall-sided [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]].
#Smash the beans, perhaps with a potato masher.
#Add home-rendered lard or butter, totaling up to 20% of the total. (25% of the amount prior to adding)
#Fry the beans, stirring and turning them until they thicken as desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible to make your own truing jib. Start by getting an old bicycle fork and finding a way of supporting it. The easiest way is to find a sturdy box, and drilling a hole big enough to accommodate the fork neck. The hole should be tight enough to firmly hold the fork and the wheel which will be supported. The fork is now upside down. It is possible to fashion some kind of true indicator or caliper using a nail or pencil attached on one leg of the fork. A metal strap that can be attached with a screw as a pencil or nail holder works best. I try to avoid using tape, string or rubber band since they have a tendency to move which could affect an accurate reading of the wheel's straightness. Straight wheels tend to turn smoothly without deviation when viewed from the front. I start by bringing the nail as closely as possible to the wheel rim. Turning the wheel by hand, warped wheels will occasionally touch the rim or show a large gap. Wheel spokes work by providing enough pull or release on both sides of the rim so that the rim remains straight. By loosening one spoke, the tension is strengthened on the other side and vice-versa. Ideally the spokes on both sides should be even to maintain optimum rim straightness. A sequence of tightening and loosening both sides of the spokes where necessary is the key to rim straightness.</text>

A '''peeler''' (sometimes '''potato peeler''' or '''vegetable peeler''') is a kitchen utensil used to remove vegetable peels, particularly from potatoes. Often it will have a semi-sharp point that can be used to gouge out bad spots; the pictured model lacks this feature.</text>

Does anybody remember what the Japanese word for ''counters'' is?  That might be a useful one to add.

I think there are certain terms here that need to be in different sections. I guess as the list grows, it will probably separate into phonetics/phonology, morphology, syntax etc.</text>

Do you go to Bar-Ilan university? If so, maybe you could talk to the staff there about this guy.  I know that (s)he used the IP address &quot;132.70.50.117&quot; on 8 May 2005 at 06:53 [[w:UTC|UTC]].  The same IP was also used on 26 May 2005 at 17:06 and 17:29, unless it's somebody acting like the same person.

That information should be enough to find out who he is, that is of course, if they keep logs.

Warm regards,

[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 21:50, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

:By the way, does blocking that one IP actually cause the entire university to be blocked? RIPE seems to show that Bar-Ilan owns from 132.70.0.0 - 132.70.255.255 (I think...). -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 23:57, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

::Yes. I've tried on several computers (some are Windows, others are Linux etc.), and they all say the same thing. Yes, I know that the entire 132.70.*.* block is used by the university, and that they also own 132.71.*.* (this block is one they didn't need to start using). In addition, I know that 132.70.1.6 is a particular Solaris Unix computer (its name is Sunshine), and when I log on to that computer and try to edit I get the same message. 

::For your information, the exact name of the computer &quot;132.70.50.117&quot; is &quot;proxy1.cc.biu.ac.il&quot;.

::By the way, about &quot;if they keep logs&quot;, some of the computers are ones which no one needs to log on to - and if no one sees who's working there and nothing personal is loaded, no one knows who it is. This includes library catalog computers in the libraries here (many departments have their own), all of which are connected to the internet; 4 computers in the student union building for use of the students; a computer room intended for students to use. (I'm a student in the computer department, so I usually use the computers for the students of the department.)

Hi there,

Hopefully you remember me, it's been a while...how are you?

At Wikipedia, there are still issues with whoever is trying to get Bar-Ilan blocked.  Do you still go there? Recently, an IP used by the university (may be the entire university's proxy IP, not sure) was blocked indefinitely.  Could you do me a favour and find out what can be done? Maybe if they took a few minutes to look over their logs they can find out who it is and restrict their access.

Anyhow, this has gone on for way too long, so I don't disagree with a more long-term block at this point in an attempt to get your University's attention.  Hopefully this can get resolved as soon as possible.  If you can get someone at your university to listen, they can email me at wiki [a t] frazzydee [d O T] ca, or they can email the blocking admin [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Hall_Monitor here].

Sorry about this- I want a long-term block as little as you do, but it's a little hard for me to argue against it when it's gone on so long and nobody from Bar-Ilan has responded to me.

Kind regards,

Hi User142,

Are you still around? I was going through the templates and there was one ([[Template:PoisonType]]) that I'm not sure what it was used for (it doesn't link anywhere, but that doesn't mean it wasn't used with subst).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;
[[Organic chemistry]] &gt; [[Organic Chemistry/Dienes|Dienes]] &gt; Kinds of dienes

[[Organic Chemistry/Dienes|&lt;&lt; Dienes]] | [[Organic Chemistry/Dienes/Conjugation|Conjugation &gt;&gt;]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Dienes have two or more carbon-carbon double bonds which may be either ''isolated'' (R'-C=C-R-C=C-R'), ''cumulated'' (R-C=C=C-R), or ''conjugated'' (R-C=C-C=C-R).  Each state represents a different stability due to electron delocalization, and the conjugated form is generally favored in organic molecules.

===Isolated Dienes===
Isolated dienes typically show no &quot;special&quot; stability.  Their two &amp;pi;-bonds interact independent of one another and they compete as intermolecular reaction sites depending on steric, kinetic, and thermodynamic factors.  Often, these types of dienes can be treated merely as larger, more complex alkenes, because the two bonds cannot be said to have &quot;communication&quot; (proximal electron delocalization due to location).

Isolated dienes are not considered to be especially useful in common synthesis reactions, although intermediates may often take the form of an isolated diene.bb

===Cumulated Dienes===
Cumulated dienes are typically less stable than other alkenes.  The main reason for the instability is the fact that this sort of diene is a probable transition state for an alkyne's triple bond to move down the carbon chain towards the most stable position.  As you may recall, rotation does not occur around any &amp;pi;-bond, which means that cumulated double bonds can lead to a less stable, higher energy compound being formed.  

Typically, cumulated dienes are discussed only in advanced courses in organic chemistry, and so they will not be discussed in detail here.  Beginning organic chemistry students should merely remember that cumulated dienes are 1) high energy and 2) most likely found as transition states.


===Conjugated Dienes===
Conjugated dienes are dienes which have at least two double bonds separated by a single carbon-carbon bond, and for this reason conjugated dienes are observed to have a special stability due to the overlap of electron orbitals.  The areas of concentration of negative charge (electron density) overlap across the three bonds (two double bonds and one single bond) forming what behaves essentially as a single, continuous &amp;pi;-bond across three carbon atoms.  This delocalization of electron density stabilizes the molecule, resulting in the arrangement of lowest energy.  

Atoms other than carbon which are capable of multiple bonds may also participate in conjugation.  The heteroatoms most often associated with conjugation in dienes and other molecules are nitrogen and oxygen, but theoretically the majority of atoms in the Periodic Table of Elements could participate in conjugation chemistry.  Most often, in organic molecules, heteroatoms participating in conjugation will be nitrogen atoms within a ring structure or a double-bonded oxygen attached to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Conjugation of double bonds is the largest part of what makes aromaticity relevant in organic chemistry, and conjugated double bonds have many other significant impacts on other types of dienes as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the rise of digital cameras, film is not always needed. 
=Types of Film stock=
==8mm==
Amateur film gauge introduced by Eastman Kodak. In the camera, it was the same size with standard 16mm film but with double perforations. At the picture area of a typical 16mm film, four frames of 8mm were recorded, two in the first run and two when turning the film cassette to the other side to expose the other half width, much like audio cassettes are used. When processed, it was slit lengthwise to produce a double length (usually 50ft) Regular 8mm film for projection. A better variant, Super 8mm was introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1965. This had smaller perforations which allowed for 50% increase of the image size and hence more detail could be recorded. The larger frame also allowed for larger projection sizes than were possible with standard 8mm (called Regular 8mm) film. See also respective sections in Wikipedia and Kodak's web site.

==16mm==

==Super 16mm==
Super 16mm film is physically 16mm wide, however, when compared to standard 16mm film one will notice that 16mm has perforations on both edges of the film, whereas super 16mm only has perforations on one side. This allows for a wider frame on the film and provides greater resolution to that achievable with standard 16mm film stock.

==35mm==
35mm Film Stock is regarded as the industry standard when it comes to professional productions. There are a few different types of 35mm film, including:

* Two perf
* Three perf
* Four perf
* Super 35mm

==65/70mm==
This type of film stock is the largest format made, it is generally used for IMAX productions. It is the highest quality film available.

==Buying Film stock==
===Kodak===
You can purchase Filmstock directly from Kodak by calling them. Information is at http://www.kodak.com

===Fuji===
* Consider using cheaper [[Wikipedia:Short end|Short end]] and [[Wikipedia:Re-can|Re-can]] stocks.

==Storing Filmstock==

I think you cooked the [[Cookbook:French Fries]] recipe. If so, you might want to make a note of that on the [[:Image:FrenchFries1.jpg|FrenchFries1.jpg]] page and on the image caption. Some people have used generic pictures in the past, not exactly matching up with the recipe.

BTW, nice cookie pictures. (same thing about [[:Image:ChewyGingerCookies.jpg|ChewyGingerCookies.jpg]] and [[:Image:CrispyGingerbreadCookies.jpg|CrispyGingerbreadCookies.jpg]] too of course &amp;mdash; a note on the image page would be informative)

Never mind my earlier comment (see history if you care) about copyright tags; that isn't required for wikibooks. I'm more used to uploading at the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/ Commons], where the image would soon get deleted if it was without copyright tags.

So... how were the cookies? Which recipe makes better cookies? Since these recipes are now among the dozen or so with pictures ('''thank you'''), they are likely to end up as featured recipes. Probably the recipe talk pages are a good place to note how things turned out. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:07, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== Cookbook:Grammy's Potato Salad ==

Hi! Your recipe for [[Cookbook:Grammy's Potato Salad|Grammy's Potato Salad]] has been tagged as needing work for about 5 years now, and all that's missing is a quantity. You list:

*1/4 sweet pickle juice (from jar of pickles)

but you fail to specify 1/4 ''what''. (Cup?)

Can you edit your recipe to correct this, please? Thanks!&amp;mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&amp;nbsp;1]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|&lt;sup&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:29, 29 August 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Verbs/]] | [[../Verb Tenses/]]

Gramatically, the subjunctive is called a &quot;mood&quot;. This is differentiated from a &quot;tense&quot; in that it does not express time per se (which is what &quot;tense&quot; really means). Along with the name of the mood also goes a tense. For the subjunctive mood, the tense may be present, imperfect, present perfect, or past perfect (or pluperfect). This article only discusses the present tense.

The present tense of the subjunctive mood, as with the other subjunctive tenses, is used for a variety of situations. This variety can make the subjunctive difficult to understand for English-speakers, and make students of Spanish dread the mood. 

One common situation is to indicate actions which the speaker wishes will happen or wants to happen. It follows phrases such as &quot;Espero que&quot; (I hope that) and &quot;Quiero que&quot; (I want), and always &quot;Ojalá que&quot; (God willing/Hopefully). Similarly, another situation is where the speaker fears or doubts the action will happen. Phrases such as &quot;Temo que&quot; (I fear that), &quot;No creo que&quot; (I don't think that), &quot;Dudo que&quot; (I doubt that). Yet another situation is where the speaker is expressing possibilities or expressing beliefs that are impersonal yet still subjective. Examples here are &quot;Es posible que&quot; (It's possible that), &quot;Es mejor que&quot; (It's best that), &quot;Podría ser que&quot; (It could be that).

Note that the common thread in all these cases is that the action in the subordinate clause is not a factual statement, but something only from the realm of possibility. In some cases you are hoping it is true, in others you are doubting, denying, or speculating about its reality; but in all cases, you are essentially mooting the statement, bringing its reality up for discussion. This mooting is the essence of the subjunctive. You put the action that you are mooting in a subordinate clause, almost always joined to the main clause by &quot;que.&quot; (In fact, this is where the name &quot;subjunctive&quot; came from: you are joining another idea or clause in a subordinate relationship to the main clause.)

There are some other uses of the subjunctive.

In order for the subjunctive to be used, you must have both:
*Expression of desire, doubt, hope, fear, or one of the other situations above, and
*Change of subject between independent clause and dependent clause (''Yo'' quiero que ''Ud.'' me ayude-- ''I'' want ''you'' to help me.)

===Conjugations===

'''Rule''': The subjunctive begins with the '''yo'''-form of the present indicative. Then remove the '''-o''' and append the &quot;opposite&quot; endings.

'''Hablar'''
hablo -&gt; habl-

:Yo '''hable'''
:Tú '''hables'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''hable'''
:Nosotros '''hablemos'''
:Vosotros '''habléis'''
:Ellos/Uds. '''hablen'''

'''Comer'''
como -&gt; com-

:Yo '''coma'''
:Tú '''comas'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''coma'''
:Nosotros '''comamos'''
:Vosotros '''comáis'''
:Ellos/Uds. '''coman'''

'''Vivir'''
vivo -&gt; viv-

:Yo '''viva'''
:Tú '''vivas'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''viva'''
:Nosotros '''vivamos'''
:Vosotros '''viváis'''
:Ellos/Uds. '''vivan'''

It is important to note that the present subjunctive is taken from the first-person singular rather than other stems because of the many verbs that are irregular in the first-person singular.

:Yo '''tengo''' -&gt; '''tenga'''
:Yo '''pongo''' -&gt; '''ponga'''
:Yo '''caigo''' -&gt; '''caiga'''
:Yo '''conozco''' -&gt; '''conozca'''
:Yo '''permanezco''' -&gt; '''permanezca'''

'''Seeming Exceptions'''

1. Even though the present subjunctive takes its form from the first-person singular, you still need to watch out for vowel changes due to stress shifting in the stem. Thus,

:Yo '''pueda'''
:Tú '''puedas'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''pueda'''
:Nosotros '''podamos''' (not ''puedamos'')
:Vosotros '''podáis''' (not ''puedáis'')
:Ellos/Uds. '''puedan'''

2. Since Spanish always tries to keep the spelling accurate to the pronunciation, in some cases the ending needs to change because the stem ends in a 'c', 'z', 'g', etc. This change normally happens in the first-person singular of '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs also, but it is still something to be aware of because in speaking or writing you're not always explicitly conscious of grammatical forms other than what you're using.

:Yo '''juego''' -&gt; '''juegue'''
:Yo '''toco''' -&gt; '''toque'''
:Yo '''recojo''' -&gt; '''recoja'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure I agree with the characterizations of pastry crusts as &quot;old style&quot; or as &quot;bland&quot; or &quot;somewhat greasy,&quot; though this could be the case for specific crusts. The crust I usually make is not greasy, and a greasy crust is a sign of poor worksmanship (usually due to combining fat into the flour). Bland has multiple meanings (&quot;pleasant&quot; for example), but it's generally used as a pejorative; I usually like my crusts. =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:28, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:Bland can be good or bad, depending on what you want. A crumb crust made from chocolate cookie crumbs is very much '''not bland''', and completely unsuitable for a chicken pot pie. (well, maybe a pregnant woman would crave such a thing, probably with green olives on top) When you consider how flavorful many of the crumb crusts are, the normal pastry crusts are definitely bland. You could add some herbs and spices to change that of course, but people don't normally do that. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:44, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:I think &quot;somewhat greasy&quot; is accurate. A really greasy pie crust is defective of course. If you rub the bottom of a normal pie, you can feel the grease. A good pastry pie crust does a fairly decent job of hiding this, but the crumb crusts are usually a bit better. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:44, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:Since all the really old pie crust recipes are pastry, I'm fairly certain that &quot;old style&quot; is also accurate. Let me know if you find a crumb crust recipe that is over a century old. Probably I can find pastry crust recipes that go back several centuries. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:44, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Fair enough. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:46, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

: I will also dispute the description of a pastry crust as &quot;bland, flakey, and somewhat greasy&quot;.  It is impossible to read this as a positive statement, particularly when followed immediately by fulsome praise for crumb crusts.
: I will also dispute the claim that &quot;many pies&quot; are made with crumb crusts, because I have consumed very, very many pies in my life, and I have never encountered a crumb crust once outside American cookbooks.
: It may be the case that &quot;in the USA, many sweet pies&quot; are made with crumb crusts.  But this page, as it stands, is far too negative about traditional crusts, and far too biased in favour of sweet pies.  It is totally non-representative of pie crusts in my experience.

[[Image:GrammysPotatoSalad.jpg|thumb|Grammy's Potato Salad]] 
This is a classic [[Cookbook:New England cuisine|New England]] potato salad. Chopping the potatoes into small pieces allows more surface to be coated and improves the flavor.

Makes about 10 servings.

== Ingredients ==

*3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] long white [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] 
*3 hard boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:Mince|minced]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
*1/4 cup sweet pickle juice (from jar of [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]]) 
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Celery Seed|celery seed]]
*3/4 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]

== Procedure ==

#Cut unpeeled potatoes in half and cook until they are tender when tested with a knife. Do not overcook. 
#Peel the potatoes by scraping them lightly with a knife and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes.
#Place potatoes in a large bowl and let them come to room temperature. 
#In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, pickle juice and sugar and stir until smooth. 
#Add the mayonnaise mixture, minced onion, parsley, celery seed and chopped eggs to the potatoes. 
#Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir lightly to combine. 
#Place in large serving bowl and sprinkle with paprika. 
#Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

{{recipesummary|Cheesecake recipes|8|3 and half hours|4|Image=[[File:New york cheesecake with strawberries.jpg|300px]]}}
Arnold Reuben, owner of Turf Restaurant at 49th and Broadway in New York City, developed the recipe for New York cheesecake in 1929 after eating a slice of cheese pie at a friend's home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/Cheesecake.htm Info on the history of cheesecake]&lt;/ref&gt;

He altered his hostess’ recipe and eventually developed his own version of cheesecake which relies on cream cheese rather than cottage cheese as most other bakeries did at the time. Reuben then served his new creation in his restaurant which became a hit in no time. 

The below recipe makes a firm and heavy cheesecake, nicely flavored with [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. It is very important to avoid over beating the ingredients in order to avoid cracks.

==Ingredients==
For Cake:

*2 ½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] softened [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] 
*1 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] 
*5 large whole [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 large egg yolks
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]

For Crust:

*5 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] Barnham and Bailey Animal Crackers,or, Sweet Digestive Biscuits,(but no extra sugar with these).
*3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*4 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
For Crust:

#Butter bottom and sides of [[Cookbook:Inch|10 inch]] [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]]. 
#Crush Animal Crackers into a fine powder. Mix with 3 tablespoons of sugar. 
#Add to melted butter and mix with a fork until blended. 
#Press mixture into the bottom and up about one third of the sides of the pan. 
#Refrigerate 1 hour.

For Cake:

#Have all ingredients at room temperature. 
#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|475°F]]. 
#Mix sugar, flour and corn starch together. 
#Using a wooden spoon, beat cream cheese with sugar mix, zest and vanilla until it is smooth. Do not overbeat. You may substitute lemon juice for vanilla.
#Add the whole eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating lightly with wooden spoon after each addition. Do not overbeat as this causes the cheesecake to crack. 
#Gently stir in cream. 
#Pour mixture into the pan. Place pan on [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] to avoid leakage. 
#Bake at 475°F for 15 minutes 
#Lower heat to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|225°F]] and bake for 1 hour 
#Raise heat to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|250°F]] and bake for about 15 more minutes 
#Refrigerate immediately for at least one hour, keep covered with a cloth and [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] (cloth on bottom) until condensation stops forming. Condensation will drip onto the cake if you cover it right away with Saran wrap.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]]

This is a very quick, easy Pineapple Teriyaki entrée, to be served over rice.  It is listed as both meat and vegetarian because it works around the pineapple, veggies, and teriyaki, not the protein.  Put the rice on to cook first, and the rest will probably be finished by the time the rice is ready.  

A [[Cookbook:Teriyaki|Teriyaki recipe]] is available
for those who cannot or do not wish to purchase prepared teriyaki sauce.

==Ingredients==
===For the rice===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (your choice, but a short-grain white rice is most traditional)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
Bring all to a boil in a pot or rice cooker.  In a pot, cover, turn the heat down when it boils.  Simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on, then turn off the heat, fluff with a fork, and let stand for a few minutes.

===For on top of the rice===
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] vegetable or olive [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*2 c cubed [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] '''or''' *2 c cubed [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] or vegetarian &quot;chicken&quot; (usually flavored, pressed [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]])
*1 yellow or white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], whatever color(s) you prefer. Red and green stand out nicely against yellow pineapple.
*1 14-16 oz. can of cubed [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], drained (Pineapple is often canned in juice, so you may wish to save what you drain.)
* 1/4 c (approx.) prepared [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki sauce]].  Soy Vay! Veri Veri Teriyaki is excellent, if available.
===Optional===
If you’d like more or thicker sauce, mix 
* 1/4 c of water or reserved pineapple juice 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] 

You might also like to toss in 
*some sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] 
*1-2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]], depending upon your teriyaki sauce

==Method==

#Put rice on to cook, as outlined above.
#Cut up the chicken/tofu, onion, and bell pepper(s) into bite-sized chunks.  Cut up everything before turning on the stove.
#Heat a deep 12&quot; pan or wok over high heat. 
#Add the oil.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] everything in the oil, adding ingredients in the following order, so as to cook heavier items longer:
#*Chicken
#*Onion/garlic
#*Bell peppers
#*Mushrooms 
#*Pineapple
#*Tofu
#Add the teriyaki sauce and the cornstarch mixture.  If using cornstarch, heat to boiling to thicken and correct with extra water or juice as necessary.
#Serve over rice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Someone wrote:

 Declaring an array variable without a size is equivalent to declaring a pointer

followed by a bogus example.  This statement is completely untrue.  One declares an incomplete array that, unless later completed, is completed at the end of the translation unit with 1 element.  It takes up the space of the element.  The other declares a pointer, and takes up the space of a pointer.  You really should understand this stuff before trying to teach it...

[[User:207.17.47.140]]

It's a syntax that comes from C's predecessor B. It's still an accepted syntax for function parameters. Look:

 int fn(int a[]){
   a++;
   return *a;
 }

To really understand all this, I think it is good to describe how C evolved out of B. Without that background, lots of stuff just doesn't make sense. C sometimes gives you a &quot;free&quot; unary &amp; operator when you use an array as a pointer; I'm sure that this is a major cause of beginner confusion. It makes sense once you know that arrays in B were really pointers to arrays. The arrays lost this when the language gained structs, because prior to the C++ invention of constructors there would be no way for the pointer to get initialized to point at the data. Thus we get the weird array-as-a-pointer feature that confuses people.

I think that teaching this should involve:

#generic language-neutral concepts of arrays, pointers, and strings (no code examples)
#how B did things
#the big language change
#review
#strings now const. New C99 variable-size array stuff

All through it, the oddities of pointer arithmetic will require frequent reminders.
(the whole 42[array] thing, *array, and so on)

----

Removed the casting of void* to an object pointer type.  void* was introduced specifically as a generic pointer type that does not need casting; such casts are a relic from pre-ANSI C when char* was abused as the generic type.  Also, removed text that stated that such a cast is necessary.  While casting may seem harmless, it can mask the serious problem of forgetting prototypes for allocation functions.  In addition, it simply clutters up code.  One rarely sees code like &quot;char x = (char)'x';&quot; even though 'x' is an int, for example.  The same principle should apply to pointers. -- [[User:67.170.85.37|67.170.85.37]] 04:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)


-----

Could anybody explain me that:

 typedef  int (*MyFunctionType)( int, void *);

I thought typedef is used like that: typedef long int* abc; abc variable1; thx

:MyFunctionType typedef'ed to be a pointer to a function that takes two arguments (int, void *) and returns an int.  Read about the syntax for declaring function pointers in C. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 07:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

== article style ==

I gotta tell you, this article is really unclear...the problem is changing the way of thinking of someone, especially if they have to wrap their minds around pointers and arrays in quick succession as the article flows.  It's especially hard because my background is Java and Perl...

--[[User:168.105.118.205|168.105.118.205]] 11:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

:I agree. What is this supposed to mean? ''When returning a pointer from a function, do not to return a pointer that points to a value that is local to the function or that is a pointer to a function argument.'' WTF? Also, the nonsense examples are distracting. MEANINGFUL examples would be more helpful, even if they're slightly longer. [[User:128.250.37.103|128.250.37.103]] 10:14, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

::It means that, since local variables are deallocated when the function returns, don't return a pointer to any of those variables, or it will be a dangling pointer. Care to rephrase it? --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 02:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

Just as a note, the current external link to a 'pointer cheat sheet' actually goes to a quiz, which I wouldn't describe as a cheat sheet.

Another possibly unclear one: &quot;First one declares a structure having as elements function pointers for the various operations to that can be specified polymorphically.&quot; (In #Pointers to Functions.) I assume it means &quot;First one declares a structure [which has elements which are] function pointers for the various operations...&quot; but then it says &quot;... to that can be specified polymorphically.&quot; I can't make sense of it unless I assume the &quot;to&quot; was there by mistake, in the sense of &quot;various operations ''that are to be'' specified&quot;, but I don't know if this is right. 21:23, 12 January 2010 (UTC)~~

== merge ==

I suggest merging our discussion about pointers into this module [[C Programming/Pointers and arrays]],
rather than talk about them here and again in a section of another module [[C_Programming/Complex_types#Pointers]].

== Questions from the module-page ==
Can someone tell me why napoleon kept one hand in his tunic in almost every photo?

It has been rumored that Napoleon had a tumor in his abdominal area and would constantly touch it. It would be interesting to see if this rumor proves to be valid.

*It has been said that Napoleon held his hand on his abdominal area, because he had stomache issues. The rumor says it made him uncomfortable.

** '''ESC.'''
** This key always cancels Blender functions without changes.
** ''or'': FileWindow, DataView and ImageSelect: back to the previous window type.
**  ''or'': the RenderWindow is pushed to the background (or closed, that depends on the operating system).
: '''SPACE.''' Open the Toolbox.

== Object Mode HotKeys ==

These hotkeys are mainly bound to the 3D Viewport Window, but many work on Objects in most other windows, like IPOs and so on, hence they are summarized here.
: '''HOME'''. All Objects in the visible layer are displayed completely, centered in the window.
: '''PAGEUP'''. Select the next Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEUP'''. Adds to selection the next Object Key.
: '''PAGEDOWN.''' Select the previous Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEDOWN.''' Adds to selection the previous Object Key.
: '''ACCENT.''' (To the left of the '''1KEY''' in US keyboard) Select all layers.
:: (N.B. '''SINGLE-QUOTE-KEY''' on UK, '''ÖKEY''' on DE &amp;amp; SE, '''&amp;AElig;KEY''' on DK, '''&amp;Oslash;KEY''' on NO, '''&amp;Ograve;KEY''' on IT and '''&amp;Ugrave;KEY''' on AZERTY keyboard)
: '''SHIFT-ACCENT.''' Revert to the previous layer setting.
:: (N.B. '''SHIFT-SINGLE-QUOTE-KEY''' on UK, '''SHIFT-ÖKEY''' on DE &amp;amp; SE, '''SHIFT-&amp;AElig;KEY''' on DK, '''SHIFT-&amp;Oslash;KEY''' on NO, '''SHIFT-&amp;Ograve;KEY''' on IT and '''SHIFT-&amp;Ugrave;KEY''' on AZERTY keyboard)
: '''TAB.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''ALT-E.'''
: '''AKEY.''' Selects/deselects all.
: '''CTRL-A.''' Apply size and rotation. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are assigned to the ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.). At first glance, it appears as if nothing has changed, but this can have considerable consequences for animations or texture mapping. This is best illustrated by also having the axis of a Mesh Object be drawn (EditButtons-&gt;Axis). Rotate the Object and activate Apply. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are 'erased'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-A.''' If the active Object is automatically duplicated (see AnimButtons-&gt;DupliFrames or AnimButtons- &gt;Dupliverts), a menu asks Make duplis real?. This option actually creates the Objects. If the active Mesh Object is deformed by a Lattice, a menu asks Apply Lattice deform?. Now the deformation of the Lattice is assigned to the vertices of the Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-A.''' This is the AddMenu. In fact, it is the ToolBox that starts with the `ADD' option. When Objects are added, Blender starts EditMode immediately if possible.
: '''BKEY.''' Border Select. Draw a rectangle with the LeftMouse; all Objects within this area are selected, but not made active. Draw a rectangle with the MiddleMouse to deselect Objects. In orthonormal ViewMode, the dimensions of the rectangle are displayed, expressed as global coordinates, as an extra feature in the lower left corner. In Camera ViewMode, the dimensions that are to be rendered according to the DisplayButtons are displayed in pixel units.
: '''SHIFT-B.''' Render Border. This only works in Camera ViewMode. Draw a rectangle to render a smaller cut-out of the standard window frame. If the option DisplayButtons-&gt;Border is ON, a box is drawn with red and black lines.
: '''CKEY'''. Centre View. The position of the 3DCursor becomes the new centre of the 3DWindow.
** '''ALT-C.''' Convert Menu. Depending on the active Object, a PopupMenu is displayed. This enables you to convert certain types of ObData. It only converts in one direction, everything ultimately degrades to a Mesh! The options are:
*** Font -&gt; Curve
*** MetaBall -&gt; Mesh The original MetaBall remains unchanged.
*** Curve -&gt; Mesh
*** Surface -&gt; Mesh

**'''CTRL-C.''' Copy Menu. This menu copies information from the active Object to (other) selected Objects.
*** ''Fixed components are:''
**** Copy Loc: the X,Y,Z location of the Object. If a Child is involved, this location is the relative position in relation to the Parent.
**** Copy Rot: the X,Y,Z rotation of the Object.
**** Copy Size: the X,Y,Z dimension of the Object.
**** DrawType: copies Object Drawtype.
**** TimeOffs: copies Object time offset.
**** Dupli: all Duplicator data (Dupliframes, Dupliverts and so on)
**** Mass: Real time stuff.
**** Damping: Real time stuff.
**** Properties: Real time stuff.
**** Logic Bricks: Real time stuff.
**** Constraints: copies Object constraints.
*** ''If applicable:''
**** Copy TexSpace: The texture space.
**** Copy Particle Settings: the complete particle system from the AnimButtons.
*** ''For Curve Objects:''
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Font Objects:''
**** Copy Font Settings: font type, dimensions, spacing.
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Camera Objects:''
**** Copy Lens: the lens value.
: '''SHIFT-C.''' CentreZero View. The 3DCursor is set to zero (0,0,0) and the view is changed so that all Objects, including the 3Dcursor, can be displayed. This is an alternative for '''HOME.'''
: '''DKEY.''' Draw mode menu. Allows to select draw modes exactly as the corresponding menu in the 3D viewport header does.
: '''SHIFT-D.''' Add Duplicate. The selected Objects are duplicated. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''ALT-D.''' Add Linked Duplicate. Of the selected Objects linked duplicates are created. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''CTRL-D.''' Draw the (texture) Image as wire. This option has a limited function. It can only be used for 2D compositing.
: '''ALT-E.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''TAB.'''
: '''FKEY.''' If selected Object is a mesh Toggles Face selectMode on and off.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Sort Faces. The faces of the active Mesh Object are sorted, based on the current view in the 3DWindow. The leftmost face first, the rightmost last. The sequence of faces is important for the Build Effect (AnimButtons).
** '''GKEY'''. Grab Mode. Or: the translation mode. This works on selected Objects and vertices. Blender calculates the quantity and direction of the translation, so that they correspond exactly with the mouse movements, regardless of the ViewMode or view direction of the 3DWindow. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a straight line.
** The following options are available in translation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL:''' in increments of 1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT:''' fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL:''' in increments of 0.1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Moving along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Moving along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Moving along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current translation to the X,Y or Z axis. Blender calculates which axis to use, depending on the already initiated mouse movement. Click MiddleMouse again to return to unlimited translation.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric
*** key directly. '''TAB''' will switch between values, '''ENTER '''finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS:''' These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Grabber can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER:''' move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC:''' everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY:''' starts Grab mode again.
**** '''SKEY:''' switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY:''' switches to Rotate mode.
: '''ALT-G.''' Clears translations, given in Grab mode. The X,Y,Z locations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-G.''' Translation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SHIFT-G.''' Group Selection
*** ''Children:'' Selects all selected Object's Children.
*** ''Immediate Children:'' Selects all selected Object's first level Children.
*** ''Parent:'' Selects selected Object's Parent.
*** ''Shared Layers:'' Selects all Object on the same Layer of active Object

** '''IKEY.''' Insert Object Key. A keyposition is inserted in the current frame of all selected Objects. A PopupMenu asks what key position(s) must be added to the IpoCurves.
*** ''Loc:'' The XYZ location of the Object.
*** ''Rot:'' The XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''Size:'' The XYZ dimensions of the Object
*** ''LocRot:'' The XYZ location and XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''LocRotSize:'' The XYZ location, XYZ rotation and XYZ dimensions of the Object.
*** ''Layer:'' The layer of the Object.
*** ''Avail:'' A position is only added to all the current IpoCurves, that is curves which already exists.
*** Mesh, Lattice, Curve or Surface: depending on the type of Object, a VertexKey can be added
: '''CTRL-J.''' Join Objects. All selected Objects of the same type are added to the active Object. What actually happens here is that the ObData blocks are combined and all the selected Objects (except for the active one) are deleted. This is a rather complex operation, which can lead to confusing results, particularly when working with a lot of linked data, animation curves and hierarchies.
: '''KKEY.''' Show Keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects. If all of them were already ON, they are all turned OFF.
: '''SHIFT-K.''' A PopupMenu asks: OK? Show and select all keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects, and all Object-keys are selected. This function is used to enable transformation of the entire animation system.
: '''LKEY.''' Makes selected Object local. Makes library linked objects local for the current scene.
** '''CTRL-L.''' Link selected. Links some of the Active Object data to all selected Objects, the following menu entry appears only if applicable.
*** ''To Scene:'' Creates a link of the Object to a scene.
*** ''Object IPOs:'' Links Active Object IPOs to selected ones.
*** ''Mesh data:'' Links Active Object Mesh data selected ones.
*** ''Lamp Data:'' Links Active Object Lamp data to selected ones.
*** ''Surf Data:'' Links Active Object Surf data selected ones.
*** ''Material:'' Links Active Object Material to selected ones.

** '''SHIFT-L.''' Select Linked. Selects all Objects somehow linked to active Object.
*** ''Object IPO:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's IPOs.
*** ''Object Data:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active  Object's ObData.
*** ''Current Material:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's current Material.
*** ''Current Texture:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing  active Object's current Texture.
: '''MKEY.''' Moves selected Object(s) to another layer, a pop-up appers. Use '''LMB''' to move, use '''SHIFT-LMB''' to make the object belong to multiple layers. If the selected Objects have different layers, this is ORed in the menu display. Use ESC to exit the menu. Press the &quot;OK&quot; button or '''ENTER''' to change the layer seting. The hotkeys ('''ALT'''-)('''1KEY, 2KEY''', ... - '''0KEY''') work here as well (see 3DHeader).
: '''CTRL-M.''' Mirror Menu. It is possible to mirror an Object along the X, Y or Z axis.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. The location, rotation and scaling of the active Object are displayed and can be modified.
: '''ALT-O.''' Clear Origin. The `Origin' is erased for all Child Objects, which causes the Child Objects to move to the exact location of the Parent Objects.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' If the selected Object is a Mesh toggles SubSurf on/ off. '''CTRL-1''' to '''CTRL-4''' switches to the relative SubSurf level for display purpouses. Rendering SUbSurf level has no HotKey.
** '''CTRL-P.''' Make selected Object(s) the child(ren) of the active Object. If the Parent is a Curve then a popup offers two choices:
*** ''Normal Parent:'' Make a normal parent, the curve can be made a path later on.
*** ''Follow Path:'' Automatically creates a Follow Path constraint with the curve as target. If the Parent is an Armature, a popup offers three options:
*** ''Use Bone:'' One of the Bones becomes the parent. The Object will not be deformed. A popup permits to select the bone. This is the option if you are modeling a robot or machinery
*** ''Use Armature:'' The whole armature is used as parent for deformations. This is the choiche for organic beings.
*** ''Use Object:'' Standard parenting. In the second case further options asks if Vertex groups should not be created, should be created empty or created and populated.
** '''ALT-P.''' Clears Parent relation, user is asked if he wishes to keep or clear parent-induced transforms.
*** ''Clear Parent:'' the selected Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent. since the transformation of the Parent disappears, this can appear as if the former Children themselves are transformed.
*** ''... and keep transform:'' the Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent, and an attempt is made to assign the current transformation, which was determined in part by the Parent, to the (former Child) Objects.
*** ''Clear Parent inverse:'' The inverse matrix of the Parent of the selected Objects is erased. The Child Objects remain linked to the Objects. This gives the user complete control over the hierarchy.
: '''SHIFT-P.''' Push/Pull Transformations. It is a bit like scaling, except that every element is moved the same distance toward or away from the center. The distance they move is controlled by moving the mouse toward you (pull away from center) or away from you (push toward center). &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''RKEY.''' Rotate mode. Works on selected Object(s). In Blender, a rotation is by default a rotation perpendicular to the screen, regardless of the view direction or ViewMode. The degree of rotation is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try moving around the rotation midpoint with the mouse. The rotation pivot point is determined by the state of the 3DWiewport Header buttons. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a C-shaped curve.
** The following options are available in rotation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 5 degrees.
**** '''SHIFT''': fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL''': in increments of 1 degree.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Rotating along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Rotating along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Rotating along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current rotation to the horizontal or vertical view axis.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''': These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Rotation can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY''': starts Rotate mode again.
: '''ALT-R.''' Clears Rotation. The X,Y,Z rotations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-R.''' Rotation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SKEY.''' Size mode or scaling mode. Works on selected Object(s). The degree of scaling is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try to move from the (rotation) midpoint with the mouse. The pivot point is determined by the settings of the 3D Viewport header pivot Menu. Alternatives for starting scaling mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a V-shaped line.
** The following options are available in scaling mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 0.1.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL''': in increments of 0.01.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Scaling along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Scaling along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Scaling along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the scaling to X, Y or Z axis. Blender calculates the appropriate axis based on the already initiated mouse movement. Click '''MMB''' again to return to free scaling.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains scaling to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''':These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** Scaling can be terminated with:
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old dimension.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': starts Size mode again.
**** '''RKEY''': switches to Rotation.
: '''ALT-S.''' Clears Size. The X,Y,Z dimensions of selected Objects are set to 1.0.
: '''CTRL-ALT-S.''' Scale Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''CTRL-SHIFT-S.''' To Sphere Transformations. An interactive version of the To Sphere tool, working both in Edit Mode (on all data types) and in Object Mode. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''SHIFT-S.''' SnapMenu:
*** Sel-&gt;Grid: Moves Object to nearest grid point.
*** Sel-&gt;Curs: Moves Object to cursor.
*** Curs-&gt;Grid: Moves cursor to nearest grid point.
*** Curs-&gt;Sel: Moves cursor to selected Object(s).
*** Sel-&gt;Center: Moves Objects to their barycentrum.
: '''TKEY.''' Texture space mode. The position and dimensions of the texture space for the selected Objects can be changed in the same manner as described above for Grab and Size mode. To make this visible, the drawingflag EditButtons-&gt;TexSpace is set ON. A PopupMenu asks you to select: &quot;Grabber&quot; or &quot;Size&quot;.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Makes selected Object(s) track the Active Object. Old track method was Blender default tracking before version 2.30. The new method is the Constrain Track, this creates a fully editable constraint on the selected object targeting the active Object.
: '''ALT-T.''' Clears old style Track. Constraint track is removed as all constrains are.
: '''UKEY.''' Makes Object Single User, the inverse operation of Link
** ('''CTRL-L''') a pop-up appears with choices.
*** ''Object:'' if other Scenes also have a link to this Object, the link is deleted and the Object is copied. The Object now only exists in the current Scene. The links from the Object remain unchanged.
*** ''Object &amp; ObData:'' Similar to the previous command, but now the ObData blocks with multiple links are copied as well. All selected Objects are now present in the current Scene only, and each has a unique ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.).
*** ''Object &amp; ObData &amp; Materials+Tex:'' Similar to the previous command, but now Materials and Textures with multiple links are also copied. All selected Objects are now unique. They have unique ObData and each has a unique Material and Texture block. 
*** ''Materials+Tex:'' Only the Materials and Textures with multiple links are copied.
: '''VKEY.''' Switches in/out of Vertex Paint Mode.
: '''ALT-V.''' Object-Image Aspect. This hotkey sets the X and Y dimensions of the selected Objects in relation to the dimensions of the Image Texture they have. Use this hotkey when making 2D Image compositions and multi-plane designs to quickly place the Objects in the appropriate relationship with one another.
: '''WKEY.''' Opens Object Booleans Menu.
: '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected? Deletes selected objects.
: '''ZKEY.''' Toggles Solid Mode on/off.
: '''SHIFT-Z.''' Toggles Shaded Mode on/off.
: '''ALT-Z.''' Toggles Textured Mode on/off.
: '''PAD-/.''' Toggles layer buttons on/off.

== Edit Mode - General==

Again, Most of these hotkeys are useful in the 3D Viewport when in Edit Mode, but many works on other Blender Object, so they are summarized here. Many Object Mode keys works in Edit mode too, but on the selected vertices or control points; among these Grab, Rotate, Scale and so on. These hotkeys are not repeated here.
: '''TAB''' or '''ALT-E.''' This button starts and stops Edit Mode.
: '''CTRL-TAB.''' Switches between Vertex Select, Edge Select, and Face Select modes. Holding SHIFT while clicking on a mode will allow you to combine modes.
: '''AKEY.''' Select/Unselect all.
: '''BKEY-BKEY'''. Circle Select. If you press BKEY a second time after starting Border Select, Circle Select is invoked. It works as described above. Use NUM+ or NUM- or MW to adjust the circle size. Leave Circle Select with '''RMB''' or '''ESC'''.
: '''CTRL-H.''' With vertices selected, this creates a &quot;Hook&quot; object. Once a hook is selected, CTRL-H brings up an options menu for it.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. Simpler than the Object Mode one, in Edit Mode works for Mesh, Curve, Surface: The location of the active vertex is displayed.
: '''OKEY.''' Switch in/out of Proportional Editing.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' Toggles between Smooth and Sharp Proportional Editing.
: '''PKEY.''' SeParate. You can choose to make a new object with all selected vertices, edges, faces and curves or create a new object from each separate group of interconnected vertices from a popup. Note that for curves you cannot separate connected control vertices. This operation is the opposite of Join ('''CTRL-J''').
: '''CTRL-P.''' Make Vertex Parent. If one object (or more than one) is/are selected and the active Object is in Edit Mode with 1 or 3 vertices selected then the Object in Edit Mode becomes the Vertex Parent of the selected Object(s). If only 1 vertex is selected, only the location of this vertex determines the Parent transformation; the rotation and dimensions of the Parent do not play a role here. If three vertices are selected, it is a `normal' Parent relationship in which the 3 vertices determine the rotation and location of the Child together. This method produces interesting effects with Vertex Keys. In EditMode, other Objects can be selected with CTRL-RMB.
: '''CTRL-S.''' Shear. In EditMode this operation enables you to make selected forms `slant'. This always works via the horizontal screen axis.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and can be returned to via UKEY. Mesh Objects have better Undo, see next section.
: '''WKEY.''' Specials PopupMenu. A number of tools are included in this PopupMenu as an alternative to the Edit Buttons. This makes the buttons accessible as shortcuts, e.g. EditButtons-&gt; Subdivide is also `WKEY, 1KEY'.
: '''SHIFT-W.''' Warp. Selected vertices can be bent into curves with this option. It can be used to convert a plane into a tube or even a sphere. The centre of the circle is the 3DCursor. The mid-line of the circle is determined by the horizontal dimensions of the selected vertices. When you start, everything is already bent 90 degrees. Moving the mouse up or down increases or decreases the extent to which warping is done. By zooming in/out of the 3Dwindow, you can specify the maximum degree of warping. The CTRL limiter increments warping in steps of 5 degrees.

== EditMode - Mesh ==

This section and the following highlight peculiar EditMode Hotkeys.
: '''ALT-B.''' Select portion of viewing area to only be visible.
: '''CTRL-NUM+.''' Adds to selection all vertices connected by an edge to an already selected vertex.
: '''CTRL-NUM-.''' Removes from selection all vertices of the outer ring of selected vertices.
: '''ALT-CTRL-RMB.''' Edge select.
: '''CKEY.''' If using curve deformations, this toggles the curve Cyclic mode on/off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. &quot;Extrude&quot; in EditMode transforms all the selected edges to faces. If possible, the selected faces are also duplicated. Grab mode is started directly after this command is executed.
: '''SHIFT-EKEY.''' Crease Subsurf edge. With &quot;Draw Creases&quot; enabled, pressing this key will allow you to set the crease weight. Black edges have no weight, edge-select color have full weight.
: '''CTRL-EKEY.''' Mark LSCM Seam. Marks a selected edge as a &quot;seam&quot; for unwrapping using the LSCM mode.
: '''FKEY.''' Make Edge/Face. If 2 vertices are selected, an edge is created. If 3 or 4 vertices are selected, a face is created.
: '''SHIFT-F.''' Fill selected. All selected vertices that are bound by edges and form a closed polygon are filled with triangular faces. Holes are automatically taken into account. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession.
: '''ALT-F.''' Beauty Fill. The edges of all the selected triangular faces are switched in such a way that equally sized faces are formed. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession. The Beauty Fill can be performed immediately after a Fill.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Flip faces, selected triangular faces are paired and common edge of each pair swapped.
: '''HKEY.''' Hide Selected. All selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Hide Not Selected: All non-selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''ALT-H.''' Reveal. All temporarily hidden vertices and faces are drawn again.
: '''ALT-J.''' Join faces, selected triangular faces are joined in pairs and transformed to quads
** '''KKEY.''' Knife tool Menu.
*** ''Face Loop Select:'' ('''SHIFT-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Face Loop Cut:'' ('''CTRL-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (exact):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges are cut at intersections with mouse line. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (midpoints):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges intersecting with mouse line are cut in middle regardless of true intersection point. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an unselected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''CTRL-L.''' Select Linked Selected. Starting with all selected vertices, all vertices connected to them are selected too.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Opens a popup asking for the axis to mirror. 3 possible axis group are available, each of which contains three axes, for a total of nine choices. Axes can be Global (Blender Global Reference); Local (Current Object Local Reference) or View (Current View reference). Remember that mirroring, like scaling, happens with respect to the current pivot point.
: '''ALT-M.''' Merges selected vertices at barycentrum or at cursor depending on selection made on pop-up.
: '''SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+MKEY''' Selects unclosed edges / holes in the mesh (Edge select mode only). 
: '''CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Outside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `outward'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Inside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `inward'.
: '''ALT-S.''' Whereas '''SHIFT-S''' scales in Edit Mode as it does in Object Mode, for Edit Mode a further option exists, '''ALT-S''' moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, hence effectively shrinking/fattening the mesh.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Make Triangles. All selected faces are converted to triangles.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and all subsequent changes are saved on a stack. This option enables you to restore the previous situation, one after the other.
: '''SHIFT-U.''' Redo. This let you re-apply any undone changes up to the moment in which Edit Mode was entered
: '''ALT-U.''' Undo Menu. This let you choose the exact point to which you want to undo changes.
** '''WKEY.''' Special Menu. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Subdivide:'' all selected edges are split in two.
*** ''Subdivide Fractal:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced randomly.
*** ''Subdivide Smooth:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced along the normal.
*** ''Merge:'' as '''ALT-M.'''
*** ''Remove Doubles:'' All selected vertices closer to each other than a given threshold (See EditMode Button Window) are merged '''ALT-M.'''
*** ''Hide:'' as '''HKEY.'''
*** ''Reveal:'' as '''ALT-H.'''
*** ''Select Swap:'' Selected vertices become unselected and vice versa.
*** ''Flip Normals:'' Normals of selected faces are flipped.
*** ''Smooth:'' Vertices are moved closer one to each other, getting a smoother object.
*** ''Bevel:'' Faces are reduced in size and the space between edges is filled with a smoothly curving bevel of the desired order.

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Vertices:'' all vertices are deleted. This includes the edges and faces they form.
*** ''Edges:'' all edges with both vertices selected are deleted. If this `releases' certain vertices, they are deleted as well. Faces that can no longer exist as a result of this action are also deleted.
*** ''Faces:'' all faces with all their vertices selected are deleted. If any vertices are `released' as a result of this action, they are deleted.
*** ''All:'' everything is deleted.
*** ''Edges and Faces:'' all selected edges and faces are deleted, but the vertices remain.
*** ''Only Faces:'' all selected faces are deleted, but the edges and vertices remain.
: '''YKEY.''' Split. This command splits the selected part of a Mesh without deleting faces. The split parts are no longer bound by edges. Use this command to control smoothing. Since the split parts have vertices at the same position, selection with '''LKEY''' is recommended.

== EditMode - Curve ==

: '''CKEY.''' Set the selected curves to cyclic or turn cyclic off. An individual curve is selected if at least one of the vertices is selected.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Curve. A vertex is added to the selected end of the curves. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is executed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the end of two curves. These two curves are combined into one curve.
: '''HKEY.''' Toggle Handle align/free. Toggles the selected Bezier handles between free or aligned.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Set Handle auto. The selected Bezier handles are converted to auto type.
: '''CTRL-H.''' Calculate Handles. The selected Bezier curves are calculated and all handles are assigned a type.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve.

: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''TKEY.''' Tilt mode. Specify an extra axis rotation, i.e. the tilt, for each vertex in a 3D curve.
: '''ALT-T.''' Clear Tilt. Set all axis rotations of the selected vertices to zero.
: '''VKEY.''' Vector Handle. The selected Bezier handles are converted to vector type.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for curves appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices.
*** Switch direction. The direction of the selected curves is reversed. This is mainly for Curves that are used as paths!

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''Segment:'' a curve segment is deleted. This only works for single segments. Curves can be split in two using this option. Or use this option to specify the cyclic position within a cyclic curve.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== EditMode - Metaball ==

: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.

== EditMode - Surface ==

: '''CKEY.''' Toggle Cyclic menu. A PopupMenu asks if selected surfaces in the `U' or the `V' direction must be cyclic. If they were already cyclic, this mode is turned off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. This makes surfaces of all the selected curves, if possible. Only the edges of surfaces or loose curves are candidates for this operation. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is completed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the ends of two curves. These two curves are combined into 1 curve.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected together with all vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-R.''' Select Row. Starting with the last selected vertex, a complete row of vertices is selected in the `U' or `V' direction. Selecting ''Select Row'' a second time with the same vertex switches the `U' or `V' selection.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for surfaces appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices
*** Switch direction. This will switch the normals of the selected parts.
***'''ALT + MKEY.''' Mirror. Asks for axis (X,Y or Z) then mirrors the selected vertices

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following choices:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== VertexPaint Hotkeys ==

: '''SHIFT-K.''' All vertex colours are erased; they are changed to the current drawing colour.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. This undo is `real'. Pressing Undo twice redoes the undone.
: '''WKEY.''' Shared Vertexcol: The colours of all faces that share vertices are blended.

== EditMode - Font ==

== UV Editor Hotkeys ==

: '''EKEY.''' LSCM Unwrapping. Launches LSCM unwrapping on the faces visible in the UV editor.
: '''PKEY.''' Pin selected vertices. Pinned vertices will stay in place on the UV editor when executing an LSCM unwrap.
: '''ALT-PKEY.''' Un-Pin selected vertices. Pinned vertices will stay in place on the UV editor when executing an LSCM unwrap.

== EdgeSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT-CLICK.''' Selects an Edge Loop.

== FaceSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT-CLICK.''' Selects a Face Loop.
: '''TAB.''' Switches to EditMode, selections made here will show up when switching back to FaceSelectMode with TAB.
: '''FKEY.''' With multiple, co-planar faces selected, this key will merge them into one &quot;FGon&quot; so long as they remain co-planar (flat to each other).
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked UVs. To ease selection of face groups, Select Linked in UV Face Select Mode will now select all linked faces, if no seam divides them.
: '''RKEY.''' Calls a menu allowing to rotate the UV coordinates or the VertexCol.
** '''UKEY.''' Calls the UV Calculation menu. The following modes can the applied to the selected faces:

nice to meet you

The translation Poesje -&gt; Pussy is very dangerous because pussy is a reference to the female genitals.

The comment above is true, but the English delight in using nursery diminutives as euphamisms. Take the nursery rhyme 'Ding, dong bell- ' which also refers to a young feline, innocent to a child but goodness knows what the Police would make of it! Ignore. 

This section could benefit from sound files, as could all the earlier lessons. Nederlands is easy to pronounce until you read a description of how to do it, which always over emphasises the differences and plays down the similarities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ANSWERS
Q1) Use you knowledge of insulators and conductors to explain

Why the wires are insulated.
So that they do not make contact with each other.

Why the sheaths are made of plastic.
So that the user does not get an electric shock.

----
Q2) Why are the pins made of brass and why is the case plastic?

Brass is a good conductor and is cheap. Brass is also softer than copper so reduces the chance of a poor contact.

----
Q4) A table lamp usually carries a current of 0.5A. What fuse should be put in the plug: 3A, 5A, or 13A?

3A
----

Q5) An iron usually carries a current of 5.2A. What fuse should be put in the plug: 3A, 5A, or 13A?

13A
----

Q6) A kettle is protected by an earth wire and a 13A fuse. The live wire comes loose and touches the side of the kettle. The fuse blows. Explain why.
The Earth completes the circuit with very low resistance. Therefore the current becomes very large (much bigger than the opperational current) and the fuse blows.

----


Q7) Explain why the fuse is always located on the live wire and not the neutral wire?

The live wire has the voltage. If the live wire is damaged inside the appliance and a large current is created then the fuse needs to be in this part of the circuit so that it can blow. If the fuse was on the neutral wire then if a fault occured on the live then the fuse would not be in the circuit and would therefore not be able to blow.

Q8) Describe and Explain what happens in the following scenarios:

       a) The earth and live wire switch terminals on the plug
       b) The Live and neutral wire switch terminals on the plug
       c) The neutral and earth wire switch terminals on the plug
       d) When the earth wire is removed

&lt;big&gt;
'''Addressing Parents-in-Law:'''&lt;/big&gt; 

As in English-speaking relationships, how one addresses one's Father-in-law and Mother-in-law varies greatly on how friendly the relationship is, as well as the customs and dialect of the geographic region, etc. Before marriage, it is common for one to call his/her girlfriend/boyfriend's parents 아버지 or 아버지님 and 어머니 or 어머님. 

After marriage, the wife may address her new parents-in-law in the same way, however, a husband would call his mother-in-law 장모님, and his father-in-law 장인어른. Note that after marriage, how one speaks to one's parents-in-law becomes more formal, adding the honorific -님 suffix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is the flatulance comment realy necsessary?
I found it rather unapatising.

:Farting is the primary reason most people avoid beans, so it needs to be addressed. The overnight soaking and multi-hour simmering with water changes would be a rather mysterious procedure if it wasn't explained. People should know what happens if they cut the procudure short - this knowledge will save people both ways, because the procedure is rather annoying. If you live alone and have a stuffed up nose, you can stop when the beans are soft. If otherwise, you'll know that merely softening the beans is not enough and you can't cut corners.

==Optional ingredients==

I've moved everything besides the tortilla and the &quot;beans and/or meat&quot; to the optional section.  Those are really the only two neccessary ingredients to make a burrito - the rest is all up to preference - various herbs and spices are obviously optional, tomatoes I think are nice, but I've made lots of burritos without them, and lots of vegans make burritos, so the cheese is certainly optional, etc.  --[[w:User:Blackcats]]

:That would be a [[Vegan Burrito]] or [[Burrito (Vegan)]] then. We do this for many other recipes. A vegan &quot;burrito&quot; is only distantly related to a burrito. It's not normal to shove everything into the &quot;optional&quot; section. Advanced cooks are expected to know that they can eliminate ingredients as desired. Beginners need decent advice, which means that leaving out the normal major ingredients is not OK. Besides, even for the advanced cooks, it's better to see at a glance which ingredients are important. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)


----

Having grown up in Texas, I never had a burrito until the 1980's when I didn't live in Texas anymore!!  My guess is that burritos are from California.  The primary issue is the flour tortilla.  I never even heard of flour tortillas growing up.  Furthermore, having traveled extensively in Mexico during the 1960's, we NEVER saw a flour tortilla.  We always had CORN tortillas.  I don't think wheat is something that is grown very often in Mexico.

All this said to emphasize that burritos ARE NOT classic Tex-Mex cuisine.</text>

== Merging with European History/A Brief Outline of European History ==

I proposed the merge because this page is certainly not a complete text - rather, it is lengthy, bounces all over the place in its ideas, and is in my opinion redundant because there is already a comprehensive text that covers this material far more thoroughly.  Instead, I believe this page should redirect to European History/A Brief Outline of European History, as this outline explores virtually every major theme in European History that could possibly be covered.  In this sense, it seems to make far more sense to use that complete, comprehensive text as a considerably more useful and thorough study guide.


* I agree with your view from the standpoint of efficiency.  However, there is nothing wrong with a refined text that approaches identical topics from alternate viewpoints - think what would have happened had the library in Alexandria not held various historical tomes mirroring one another.  Trade secrets and intellectual property become rather moot in that circumstance.  Given that the Internet is, by nature, an impermanent medium - subject to changes and even partial outages - what would happen if part of the WikiMedia servers were to spontaneously die (unlikely, but not impossible)?  I cannot agree with any standpoint that eschews redundancy to the benefit of &quot;efficiency&quot; however &quot;reasonable&quot; it may seem on the surface - and I'd question your stake in it if I didn't believe you worked every bit as hard as the editors here on your preferred text.  On the other hand, I can certainly see where this text could use improvement, and wholly intend to contribute to it whenever the time feels right.  Nobody should take this as a given, though, and it might behoove the community to encourage users to contribute to this book - no author is perfect, no plan is foolproof, and no one viewpoint can completely cover the facts.  That warning at the top is awfully influential against modifications to the text, destructive and constructive alike.

'''Mititei''' (grilled meatballs) is a typical Romanian dish. Usually in Romania you could find the prepared meat in most of the food shops, and you only have to cook them.

==Ingredients==
*minced [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] meat ([[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or beef-pork combination would do too)
*minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]

==Procedure==
#All the ingredients are mixed together, forming a paste; the ingredients are not optional, and the quantities of condiments varies, according to the individual tastes.
#The meat paste is then shaped by hand, into [[Cookbook:cm|7-8 cm]] (3 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]]) by 2-2.5 cm (1 inch) cylinders (about 50 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] each).
#It is best to [[Cookbook:Barbecuing|barbecue]](Grill) them rather to &lt;!--  --&gt;[[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] them, because they get additional flavour if a little smoked, but a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] is ok. DO NOT use [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. It will only ruin the flavour. Try a spoon of [[Cookbook:Lard|pork fat]], or fry them in their own juice. It is best to not let them dry to much, they are better if they are juicy.
#You can eat them with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], and of course, [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] is necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Delphi is both an object oriented programming language (OOP) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Published by the Embarcadero company (formerly CodeGear and more formerly Borland), it's an alternative to language such as Visual Basic offering a development with both rapidity and good quality. However, nowadays, Delphi becomes old and most of companies prefer modern language such as [[Java Programming|Java]] or [[C Sharp Programming|C#]].

It originated from the Pascal language, which then became Object Pascal (pascal with objects support). Delphi is Object Pascal running on Windows and Kylix is Object Pascal running on Linux.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Verbs/]] | [[../Verb Tenses/]]

The Imperfect Subjunctive is related to the [[../Preterite/|pretérito]] and [[../Imperfect/|imperfecto de indicativo]] as the [[../Present Subjunctive|presente de subjuntivo]] is related to the [[../Present|presente de indicativo]]. That is, when the verb of the independent clause is in the present, the present subjunctive is used in the dependent clause, and when the verb of the independent clause is in the preterite or imperfect, the imperfect subjunctive is used.
:''No quiero que rompas la lámpara.'' —I don't want you to break the lamp.
:''No quería que rompieras la lámpara.'' —I didn't want you to break the lamp.

===Conjugations===
Similar to the [[../Present Subjunctive|presente de subjuntivo]], begin with the third-person plural-form of the [[../Preterite|pretérito]] ('''ellos, ellas, and Usteds'''). Then, remove the '''-ron''' and add the following endings.

'''Hablar'''
hablaron -&gt; habla-

 Hablara     Hablarémos
 Hablaras    Hablaráis
 Hablara     Hablaran

'''Comer'''
comieron -&gt; comie-

 Comiera     Comiéramos
 Comieras    Comieráis
 Comiera     Comieran

'''Vivir'''
vivieron -&gt; vivie-

 Viviera     Viviéramos
 Vivieras    Vivieráis
 Viviera     Vivieran

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I noticed you've decided to [[Special:Contributions/Ivyboy|add a walkthrough for Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire]].  However, it seems that you may have obtained the walkthrough from the web, without the authors' permission to put it on Wikibooks, which would be ''illegal''.  You've also removed the notices saying it seems to be a copyright violation, without posting a rebuttal, which is suspicious and also not a good editing practice.  If you DO have permission from the authors (make sure they know what it would involve, as ''anyone'' would be able to edit their walkthrough), please give us proof.

Also, mind if I ask why you chose your username?  It seems awfully similar to mine. - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 20:38, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

==Removing VFDs, copyvio notices, and moving user pages==
Hello there.  I noticed that you removed a few VFDs and removed copyright violation notices.  Please refrain from doing so.  If there is a significant problem with a VFD, then please participate in the discussion by voicing your opinions rather than unilaterally removing the nomination.  Similarly, you should note in the edit description or the talk page why you are removing a copyright violation.

Finally, it is considered to be '''extremely''' rude to move somebody's user page.  Many people get testy even if you edit it.  Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.

Please refrain from repeating these actions, or I will be forced to block you.  If you have questions about anything at all, please feel free to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frazzydee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new leave me a message] -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 05:00, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

:You have been '''''blocked''''' for 24 hours as a result of removing another VfD and redirecting [[User:Bulbaboy]] to your own user page.  Please use this time to reflect upon your actions.  You may [[Special:Emailuser/Frazzydee|email me]] to discuss this block.  Please add to VfD discussions if you feel that the book's deletion is not warranted; simply removing the notice is both feckless and disruptive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes you won't be able to find an exact answer, but only an estimate of where the answer lies. This answer, along with suitable '''error bounds''', are perfectly acceptable and are often used for experimental data when a high degree of accuracy isn't always justifiable.

==Errors==

If you were told that a certain door was 2 metres tall, you could assume that the door could be anywhere between 1.5 and 2.5 metres, represented by the [[#Inequalities|inequality]] &lt;math&gt;1.5 \le x &lt; \; 2.5&lt;/math&gt;, and was actually rounded to 2 metres. If you were told that the same door is 2.0 metres, then you could assume more accuracy, and say the door was anywhere between 1.95 and 2.05 metres, represented by the inequality &lt;math&gt;1.95 \le x &lt; \; 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. Here you would say that the height of the door is 2 metres with '''error bounds''' of &lt;math&gt;\pm 0.05&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the actual value is within the range of 0.05m greater or less than the stated value. If you are not given error bounds of a measurement, you should assume that the last digit was rounded, and take all of the other digits as accurate.

The minimum and maximum value for the actual height of the door are called the '''lower''' and '''upper bounds''', and are used to determine the accuracy of measurements.

===Absolute error===

The '''absolute error''' is the difference between the value that is obtained and the true value. The absolute error of a measurement can be found by using the following formula:


&lt;math&gt;Absolute\ error = value\ obtained - true\ value&lt;/math&gt;


===Relative error===

The '''relative error''' is the absolute error as a proportion of the true value. The relative error of a measurement can be found by using the following formula:


&lt;math&gt;Relative\ error = \frac{absolute\ error}{true\ value}&lt;/math&gt;


===Percentage error===

The '''percentage error''' is the absolute error as a percentage of the true value. The percentage error of a measurement can be found by using the following formula:


&lt;math&gt;Percentage\ error = relative\ error \times 100&lt;/math&gt;


For example, if the true value of the 2 metre door was 1.95 metres, the absolute error is &lt;math&gt;2 - 1.95 = 0.05&lt;/math&gt;, the relative error is &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.05}{1.95} = 0.0256&lt;/math&gt;, and the percentage error is &lt;math&gt;0.0256 \times 100 = 2.56\%&lt;/math&gt;.

==Inequalities==

An inequality is an expression which compares the relative sizes of points, lines, or curves. Unlike an [[../Equations|equation]], where both sides of the equals sign are always equal, inequalities can have one side greater than or equal to the other side.

===The four signs of inequalities===

There are four main basic signs:

* &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; less than,
* &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt; greater than,
* &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; less than or equal to, and
* &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; greater than or equal to.

For example, &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than 4, &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 4, &lt;math&gt;x\le 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is four or any number less than this, and &lt;math&gt;x\ge 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is four or any number higher than this. 

Note that &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt; are both essentially the same statement.

If you become confused with which sign means less than and greater than, it is useful to remember that the inequality signs always point to the smaller number. One basic rule to remember is that if you divide or multiply by a negative quantity the inequality sign reverses. For example &lt;math&gt;-x\ge7&lt;/math&gt; will become &lt;math&gt;x\le-7&lt;/math&gt;. This makes sense because -4 is greater than -5 and 5 is greater than 4.

===Combining inequalities===

There are some cases where two inequalities can be combined into one. For example, the height of the door was said to be between &lt;math&gt;x \ge 1.95&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \le 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. The usual way of writing these is &lt;math&gt;1.95 \le x &lt; 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the inequality signs are in the same direction. &lt;math&gt;2.05 \ge x &gt; 1.95&lt;/math&gt; is perfectly acceptable, but it is incorrect to combine opposite facing inequalities and they must be left as two separate inequalities.

===Solving Linear Inequalities===
In order to solve a linear inequality simply isolate x. For example: &lt;math&gt;-2x-5 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-2x \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x \le \frac{-5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the sign change.

===Solving Quadratic Inequalities===
In order to solve a quadratic inequalities we need to:
1)Set the inequality to zero.&lt;p&gt;
2)Factor the equation and find the zero(s).&lt;p&gt;
3)Make a number line with the zero(s) of the equation as the only points. Make intervals between these points.&lt;p&gt;
4)Find the sign of the factors. Then find the sign of the equation on the interval.&lt;p&gt;
5)The interval(s) that satisfy the  inequality is your answer set.&lt;p&gt;
For example: Find the intervals that satisfy the relationship&lt;math&gt;x^2 -4x \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Step 1:&lt;math&gt;x^2 -4x -5 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step2:&lt;math&gt;\left(x + 1\right)\left(x-5\right)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; so the zeros will be -1 and 5&lt;p&gt;
Step 3:
[[File:AlevelC1Step3.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 4:[[File:AlevelC1Step4.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 5: The intervals that satisfy the relationship are &lt;math&gt;-1 \ge x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;.This is the solution set.

===Solving Inequalities involving Fractions===
Solving an equation involving a fraction is very similar to solving a quadratic inequalities. When you solve an inequality involving fractions you cannot cross multiply (because you could be multiplying by a negative number which would reverse the sign of the inequality). This will lead to an erroneous answer. Also remember that you can never have a zero in the denominator.&lt;p&gt;
For example: Find the intervals that satisfy the relationship&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+1}\le\frac{6-x}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Step 1:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{6-x}{x+1}\le 0&lt;/math&gt; then simplified it becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-5}{x+1}\le0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Step 2: It is already factored so the zeros are -1 and 5.&lt;p&gt;
Step 3:[[File:AlevelC1Step3.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 4:[[File:AlevelC1Step4.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 5: The intervals that satisfy the relationship are &lt;math&gt;x &gt; -1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \le 5&lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;-1 &lt; x \le 5&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;x &gt; -1\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than because x cannot equal -1 or else there will be a zero in the denominator.

===Interval Notation===
Interval notation is another way to write the interval of the solution to an inequality problem. You should give your answer in interval notation because it is easier to comprehend. In interval notation the solution set is given in brackets. There are two types of brackets that are used:&lt;p&gt;
( ) This kind of bracket means that the endpoint is not included in the solution set.&lt;math&gt;&lt;\,&lt;/math&gt;  And &lt;math&gt;&gt;,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[ ] This kind on bracket means that the endpoint is  included in the solution set.&lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; And
&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also you can use various combinations of these brackets. If you have multiple intervals you will need to use the mathematical union sign &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;. Also if you have an interval that goes to  &lt;math&gt;\pm \infty&lt;/math&gt; you need to use the round bracket ), because &lt;math&gt;\pm \infty&lt;/math&gt; is a concept and not a number.&lt;p&gt;
For example convert &lt;math&gt;x&lt;-4\ -3\le x &lt; 7\ 8&lt; x \le 9\ 12 \le x&lt;/math&gt; to interval notation:&lt;p&gt;
In interval notation the solution set becomes &lt;math&gt;\left(-\infty,-4\right)\cup\left[-3,7\right)\cup\left(8,9\right]\cup\left[12,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; , as you can see this is easier to comprehend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An equation consists of two expressions joined by the equals sign (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;). Everything on the left-hand side is equal to everything on the right-hand side, for example &lt;math&gt;2+3=4+1&lt;/math&gt;. Some equations contain a '''variable''', usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; , though any symbol can be used.
==Manipulating expressions==

Sometimes, expressions will be messier than they need to be, and they can be represented in an easier to understand form. The skills here are essential to the rest of the A-level course, although it is very likely that you have already covered them at GCSE.

===Collecting like terms===

When collecting like terms, you simply add all the terms in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; together, all the terms in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; together, and all the terms in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; together. The same applies for any other letter that represents a variable.

For example, &lt;math&gt;2x+4y+8z-3x-7y-2z+4x&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

&lt;math&gt;2x-3x+4x = 3x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4y-7y = -3y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;8z-2z = 6z&lt;/math&gt;

So, by adding all the answers, &lt;math&gt;2x+4y+8z-3x-7y-2z+4x&lt;/math&gt; simplified is &lt;math&gt;3x-3y+6z&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiplication===

Multiplication of different variables such as &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;. Single variables become [[../Indices_and_Surds|indices]], so &lt;math&gt; x \times x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Like addition and subtraction, you keep like terms together. So, for example:

&lt;math&gt;2x^2z \times 3yz^2 \times 4xy^3&lt;/math&gt; becomes: &lt;math&gt;24{x^3}{y^4}{z^3}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractions===
It is quite often that fractions are encountered. Therefore we need to learn how to handle them properly. When working with fractions, the rule is to make all of the denominators equal, and then write the expression as one fraction. You need to multiply both the top and bottom by the same amount to keep the meaning of the fraction the same.
	
For example, for &lt;math&gt;\frac {3x}{2} + \frac {2y}{5} - \frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, the common denomimator is &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiply both parts by &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
	
Multiply both parts by &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac {4y}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
	
Leave this as it is: &lt;math&gt;\frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
	
You now have &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x}{10} + \frac{ 4y}{10} - \frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, which becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x+4y-z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Solving equations==

Often, to solve an equation you must rearrange it so that the unknown term is on its own side of the equals sign. By rearranging &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x = 5 - 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has been made the '''subject''' of the equation. Now by simplifying the equation, you can find that the solution is &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;An equation with a variable will only hold true for certain values of that variable. For example &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt; is only true for &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;. The values that the variables have when the equation is true are called the '''solutions''' of the equation. Therefore &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

===Changing the subject of an equation===

You will usually be given equations that are more complex than the example above. To move a term from one side of the equals sign to the other, you have to do the same thing on both sides of the equals sign. For example, to make &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the subject of &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{4 a (x^2 +b)}{3}&lt;/math&gt;:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|Multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;3y = 4 a (x^2 + b)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;4a&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y}{4a} = x^2 + b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Subtract &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from both sides
|&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y}{4a} -b = x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Square root both sides
|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac {3y}{4a} -b } = x &lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;- \sqrt{\frac {3y}{4a}-b } = x&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

===Solving quadratic equations===

Quadratic equations are equations where the variable is raised to the power of 2 and, unlike linear equations, there are a maximum of two '''roots'''. A root is one value of the variable where the equation is true, and to fully solve an equation, you must find all of the roots. For a quadratic equation you can factorise it and then easily find which values make the equation valid. The example above is quite a simple case. You will usually be given a more complicated equation such as &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If the equation isn't already in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, rearrange it so that it is. The steps needed to factorise &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; are:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| Multiply &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; (coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the constant term)
| &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find two numbers that add to give &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; (coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) and multiply to give &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; (answer from previous step)
| &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2 + 3 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Split &lt;math&gt;5x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2x + 3x&lt;/math&gt; (from the results of the previous step)
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 2x + 3x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify
| &lt;math&gt;2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify further
| &lt;math&gt;(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

So &lt;math&gt;(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; in factorised form. You can now use the fact that any number multiplied by &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to find the roots of the equation. The numbers that make one bracket equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the equation. In the example, the roots are &lt;math&gt;-1.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to solve a quadratic equation using the [[../Polynomials#The_quadratic_formula|quadratic formula]] or by [[../Polynomials#Completing_the_square|completing the square]].

==Simultaneous equations==

Simultaneous equations are useful in solving two or more variables at once. Basic simultaneous equations consist of two linear expressions and can be solved by three different methods: elimination, substitution or by plotting the graph.

===Elimination method===

The basic principle of the elimination method is to manipulate one or more of the expressions in order to cancel out one of the variables, and then solve for the correct solution.

An example of this:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

From this, we can see that by multiplying equation (1) by a factor of 2 and then subtracting this new equation from (2), the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-variable will be eliminated.

(1) &lt;math&gt;\times 2 \rightarrow 4x + 6y = 20&lt;/math&gt; (1a) (Assigning the number (1a) to this equation)

Now subtracting (2) from (1a):

{|
|align=&quot;right&quot;|
|&lt;math&gt;4x + 6y = 20&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1a)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 0y = 14&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|
|}

Now that we have &lt;math&gt;2x = 14&lt;/math&gt;, we can solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which in this case is &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x = 7&lt;/math&gt;.

Substitute the newly found &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; into (1):

&lt;math&gt;2 \times 7 + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;14 + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

And we find that &lt;math&gt;y = - 4/3&lt;/math&gt;

So, the solution to the two equations (1) and (2) are:

&lt;math&gt;x = 7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -4/3&lt;/math&gt;

===Substitution method===

The substitution method relies on being able to rearrange the expressions to isolate a single variable, in the form variable = expression. From this result this new expression can then be substituted for the variable itself, and the solutions evaluated.

An example of this:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x + y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

From this expression, it is possible to see that (2) is the most simplistic expression, and thus will be the better choice to rearrange.

Taking (2), and rearranging this into &lt;math&gt;x = 6 - y&lt;/math&gt;. (2a)

Subbing (2a) into (1) we get

&lt;math&gt;2(6 - y) + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this, we get that &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Again we can sub this result into one of the original equations to solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this case &lt;math&gt;x = 6&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that for situations in which one of the equations is non-linear, you must isolate one variable in the linear equation and substitute it into the non-linear one. Then you can solve the quadratic equation with one of the methods above.

Another form of substitution is if you've got a similar expression in both equations, like in this case:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

Here, &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; is found in both equations, so:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x = 10 - 3y&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x = 6 - 6y&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|}

And since &lt;math&gt;2x = 2x&lt;/math&gt;, you could do:

&lt;math&gt;10 - 3y = 6 - 6y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;6y - 3y = 6 - 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3y = -4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -4/3&lt;/math&gt;

Now you've got &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and finding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be the same as above.

Graph by first solving for y.  2x+3y=12

===Solving problems with simultaneous equations===

Often, you will be given problems which you must be able to write out as a pair of simultaneous equations. You will need to recognise such problems, and write them out correctly before solving them. Most problems will be similar to these examples with some differences.

'''Example'''

''At a record store, 2 albums and 1 single costs £10. 1 album and 2 singles cost £8. Find the cost of an album and the cost of a single.''

Taking an album as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a single as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;2a+s=10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a+2s=8&lt;/math&gt;

does that mean clothes should be removed immediately or
does it mean do not pause to remove clothes, apply cold water immediately.

== from previous article ==

We could incorporate the following...

''' Burns '''

First cool the burn with large quantities of water.  Do not use ice.  Then cover the burn with sterile or clean dressings.  Then seek help for serious burns or burns that impair breathing, cause shock, or are caused by unusual means (radiation, chemicals, electricity).

Do ''not'' lance burn blisters.

== Template ==
I moved this content into a template so that I could use it in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  There are several honors there which require first aid knowledge, and rather than duplicate the material every time it's needed, I though templates might be the way to go.

This is the first edition new Wikibooks periodical newsletter. It’s goal is to give general information about current Wikibooks developments. This first issue will mention several things from the relatively recent past on Wikibooks ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page )

== New Developments ==
The Free High School Science Text group from South Africa has started a couple of new books, [[FHSST Biology]], [[FHSST Physics]], and [[FHSST Computer Literacy]], and they have more planned. The project has the goal of providing free science textbooks to all of South Africa. Of course, we know that eventually the books they create will be used in other places as well. The FHSST ( http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/index.html ) has a large group of contributors organized and already working. They were doing primary development offline and then uploading the information, but leader Mark H ( http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/4_team.html ) has decided to try out the Wikibooks development tools for their Biology book, developing it online from the very start. 

The FHSST folks are also working with two other organizations to develop lesson plans related to the textbooks.

:http://www.tuxlabs.org.za/
:http://moodle.hmo.ac.za/

We hope that the FHSST books and related materials will set the stage for other adventuresome educators to begin organized efforts to develop educational materials on Wikibooks.

Wikibooks is now experimenting with a method of focusing effort called the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Collaboration_of_the_Month ). The idea is to identify a certain book each month for the community to rally around and work on together.

Wikistats ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm ) This page gives statistics about Wikibooks.

Book organization software enabled – Developers enabled wiki software that automatically creates links from daughter pages to parent pages. It also allows easy link-making from parent pages to daughter pages. Format links from parent pages to daughter pages like this: [[/Daughter page]] To take advantage of this feature, place subpages after slashes in the page titling scheme. For example, a chapter on trees in the Plants section of a general biology book: /General_Biology/Plants/Trees On the Trees page, the site automatically creates back links to the Plants page as well as the General_Biology page. Is that cool or what?

Wiki Junior – Wikibooks is developing a series of nonfiction children’s books called Wiki Junior ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior ). The currently under development are:
* Big Cats ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_Big_Cats ), 
* South America ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_South_America ), and the 
* Solar System ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_Solar_System ).

The Wikibooks Newsletter – this is an experiment in communication and rallying of the troops, inspired by Linspire founder Michael Robertson’s “Michael’s Minute” weekly newsletter.

== New Books of Note ==

== Wikibooks in the News ==
*'''Jimmy Wales on Slashdot''' – When Jimmy was interviewed on Slashdot recently ( http://interviews.slashdot.org/interviews/04/07/28/1351230.shtml?tid=146&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=11 ), he expressed that one of the things that he is most excited about within the world of Wiki is changing the world of education in the developing world with the creation of free educational materials on Wikibooks.
*[http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php?channel=27&amp;id=93976 Panel on Open Source]

== Think Tank &amp; Issues of Debate ==
'''How should the textbook hierarchy be organized?''' With slashes, colons, dashes … “Wikibooks founder” Karl Wick suggests slashes, as the site automatically recognizes slashes as indicators of page structure, and now has software enabled that creates automatic links on daughter pages to parent pages (see New Developments). 

'''How can Wikibooks involve more educators?''' If you are an educator, please give us feedback as to what would help you to use Wikibooks in the classroom or as a development tool, or give examples of how you have used Wikibooks materials in your classroom.</text>

'''Pancetta''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] form of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]].  It is pork belly that has been salt cured and spiced, and dried for about three months (but usually not smoked). There are many varieties and each part of Italy produces its own type.  In Corsica, it is considered a regional flavour.

Pancetta can be rolled, the most common type (as in the photograph), or straight (with all the fat on one side).

When served on its own, the rolled pancetta is presented in very thin slices.  More often it is used to flavour other dishes, especially [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] sauces.  Recipes which include pancetta are described as ''all’amatriciana'', for the town of Amatrice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think it would be helpful to add comments to the #include directives, as to why they have to be included (i.e. for what function calls / constants etc.)

== more examples ==

the functions gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() still elude my mental grasp. I would love to see these two functions used in an example (or two)  so i can figure out how precisely they are used.

== example _error_ ==

The server example has a while(1) loop which throws it into an infinite loop. The example should be fixed to not do that.</text>

no errors, i'm russian ;)

== Как и  Каким образом ==
Приьет, I'm learning Russian and I would like to know what is the difference between ''Как'' and ''Каким образом''. It seems they can be translate in English by ''How'' but I suppose there is a grammatical difference between them which in English we don't distinguish.

The one who wrote Russian examples! There are too many mistakes. You are just confusing the people who read this.</text>

      <comment>/* Quivers and Path Algebras */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we will talk about structures with three operations. These are called algebras. We will start by defining an algebra over a field, which is a vector space with a bilinear vector product. After giving some examples, we will then move to a discussion of quivers and their path algebras.

== Algebras over a Field ==

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field, and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-vector space on which we define the vector product &lt;math&gt;\cdot\,:\,A\times A\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''algebra over'' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;(A,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a ring, where &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; is the vector space addition, and if for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in F&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;a(bc)=(ab)c&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;a(b+c)=ab+ac&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a+b)c=ac+bc&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;\alpha(ab)=(\alpha a)b=a(\alpha b)&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''dimension'' of an algebra is the dimension of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as a vector space.


'''Remark 2:''' The appropriate definition of a ''subalgebra'' is clear from Definition 1. We leave its formal statement to the reader.


'''Definition 2:''' If &lt;math&gt;(A,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''commutative algebra''. If it is a division ring, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''division algebra''. We reserve the terms ''real'' and ''complex algebra'' for algebras over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.


The reader is invited to check that the following examples really are examples of algebras.


'''Example 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field. The vector space &lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt; forms a commutative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra under componentwise multiplication.


'''Example 4:''' The quaternions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-dimensional real algebra. We leave it to the reader to show that it is ''not'' a 2-dimensional complex algebra.


'''Example 5:''' Given a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, the vector space of polynomials &lt;math&gt;F[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra in a natural way.


'''Example 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field. Then any matrix ring over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, for example &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{cc} F &amp; 0 \\ F &amp; F\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, gives rise to an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra in a natural way.

== Quivers and Path Algebras ==

Naively, a quiver can be understood as a directed graph where we allow loops and parallell edges. Formally, we have the following.

'''Definition 7:''' A ''quiver'' is a collection of four pieces of data, &lt;math&gt;Q=(Q_0,Q_1,s,t)&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''vertices'' of the quiver,
# &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''edges'', and
# &lt;math&gt;s,t\,:\, Q_1\rightarrow Q_0&lt;/math&gt; are functions associating with each edge a ''source vertex'' and a ''target vertex'', respectively.
We will always assume that &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty and that &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt; are finite sets.


'''Example 8:''' The following are the simplest examples of quivers:
# The quiver with one point and no edges, represented by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
# The quiver with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; point and no edges, &lt;math&gt;1\quad 2\quad ... \quad n&lt;/math&gt;.
# The linear quiver with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points, &lt;math&gt;1\,\stackrel{a_1}{\longrightarrow}\, 2\,\stackrel{a_2}{\longrightarrow} \,...\,\xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} \,n&lt;/math&gt;.
# The simplest quiver with a nontrivial loop, &lt;math&gt;1\underset{a}\stackrel{b}{\leftrightarrows} 2&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 9:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver. A ''path'' in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of edges &lt;math&gt;a=a_ma_{m-1}...a_1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s(a_i)=t(a_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i=2,...,m&lt;/math&gt;. We extend the domains of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;s(a)\equiv s(a_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t(a)\equiv t(a_m)&lt;/math&gt;. We define the ''length'' of the path to be the number of edges it contains and write &lt;math&gt;l(a)=m&lt;/math&gt;. With each vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of a quiver we associate the ''trivial path'' &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s(e_i)=t(e_i)=i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l(e_i)=0&lt;/math&gt;. A nontrivial path &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s(a)=t(a)=i&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''oriented loop'' at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.


The reason quivers are interesting for us is that they provide a concrete way of constructing a certain family of algebras, called ''path algebras''.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field. Let &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; denote the free vector space generated by all the paths of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. On this vector space, we define a vector porduct in the obvious way: if &lt;math&gt;u=u_m...u_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=v_n...v_1&lt;/math&gt; are paths with &lt;math&gt;s(v)=t(u)&lt;/math&gt;, define their product &lt;math&gt;vu&lt;/math&gt; by concatenation: &lt;math&gt;vu=v_n...v_1u_m...u_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;s(v)\neq t(u)&lt;/math&gt;, define their product to be &lt;math&gt;vu=0&lt;/math&gt;. This product turns &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; into an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra, called the ''path algebra of'' &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; field. If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; contains a path of length &lt;math&gt;|Q_0|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.

''Proof:'' By a counting argument such a path must contain an oriented loop, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, say. Evidently &lt;math&gt;\{ a^n \}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is a linearly independent set, such that &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.


'''Lemma 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field. Then &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional if and only if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; contains an oriented loop.

''Proof:'' Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be an oriented loop in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional by the above argument. Conversely, assume &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; has no loops. Then the vertices of the quiver can be ordered such that edges always go from a lower to a higher vertex, and since the length of any given path is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;|Q_0|-1&lt;/math&gt;, there dimension of &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dim}\,FQ\leq |Q_0|^2-|Q_0|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field. Then the trivial edges &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; form an orthogonal idempotent set.

''Proof:'' This is immediate from the definitions: &lt;math&gt;e_ie_j=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_i^2=e_i&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Corollary 14:''' The element &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element in &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:'' It sufficed to show this on the generators of &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be a path in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s(a)=j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t(a)=k&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_i\right)a=\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_ia=e_ja=a&lt;/math&gt;. Similarily, &lt;math&gt;a\left(\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_i\right)=a&lt;/math&gt;.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.67}}

Python is a powerful, high-level, dynamic language. The version of Python used in Blender 2.67 is 3.3. If you are unfamiliar with Python, start with the [[Python|Python book]]. If you are familiar with older (2.''x'') versions of Python, [http://docs.python.org/py3k/whatsnew/3.0.html this page] summarizes what’s new in 3.''x''.

If you are familiar with Python scripting in older versions of Blender, be aware that 2.5''x''/2.6''x'' is completely different; the old &lt;code&gt;Blender&lt;/code&gt; module is gone. Much of the functionality is now available through the &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt; module, but don’t expect an exact 1:1 correspondence.

== First Steps In Blender Scripting ==

Open a new, default Blender document. If you haven’t customized your settings, there will be a Timeline [[File:Blender269TimelineIcon.png]] window along the bottom; change this to a Python Console [[File:Blender269PythonConsoleIcon.png]]. Perhaps increase its height to let you see more lines at once.

To start with, let’s find out what objects are present in the document. At the “&gt;&gt;&gt;” prompt, type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
bpy.data.objects
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the response
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;bpy_collection[3], BlendDataObjects&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
which isn’t actually all that informative. In fact what you have here is an ''iterator''; to see its contents, just do the usual Python thing and convert it to a list. Try entering this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list(bpy.data.objects) #or being lazy: bpy.data.objects[:]
&lt;/source&gt;
This time the response should be
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
[bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]]
&lt;/source&gt;
which shows you how to refer to the three default objects you can see in the 3D View window.

Let’s get a reference to the Cube object for more convenient access: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now let’s try querying the value of one of its attributes: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube.delta_location
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the response
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Vector((0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; type comes from the &lt;code&gt;mathutils&lt;/code&gt; module provided by Blender. But unlike &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt;, this is not automatically imported into the Python Console. So let’s bring it in for subsequent use: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import mathutils
&lt;/source&gt;
OK, now let’s try changing the location of the default Cube: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube.delta_location += mathutils.Vector((1, 1, 1))
&lt;/source&gt;
(Note the doubled parentheses: &lt;code&gt;mathutils.Vector&lt;/code&gt; takes a ''single'' argument, which is a tuple of X, Y and Z coordinate values.)

Were you watching the 3D View when you pressed {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}? You should have seen the cube jump to a different position. To make it move again, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|UPARROW}} to bring back the above command, so you can execute it again with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. As soon as you do this, the cube will jump another step, like before. And that’s it—you’re scripting!

== The &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt; Module ==

The contents of the &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt; module are divided into several submodules (actually classes, but never mind), among which are:

* &lt;code&gt;bpy.data&lt;/code&gt; — This is where you find the contents of the current document.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.types&lt;/code&gt; — information about the types of the objects in &lt;code&gt;bpy.data&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.ops&lt;/code&gt; — ''operators'' perform the actual functions of Blender; these can be attached to hotkeys, menu items and buttons. And of course they can be invoked from a script. When you write an addon script, it will typically define new operators. Every operator must have a unique name.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.context&lt;/code&gt; — contains settings like the current 3D mode, which objects are selected, and so on. Also accessible in the Console window via the global variable &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.props&lt;/code&gt; — functions for defining ''properties''. These allow your scripts to attach custom information to a scene, that for example the user can adjust through interface elements to control the behaviour of the scripts.

== The &lt;code&gt;mathutils&lt;/code&gt; Module ==

The module &lt;code&gt;mathutils&lt;/code&gt; defines several important classes that are used heavily in the rest of the Blender API.

* &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt;: the representation of 2D or 3D coordinates.
* &lt;code&gt;Matrix&lt;/code&gt;: the most general way of representing any kind of linear transformation.
* &lt;code&gt;Euler&lt;/code&gt;: a straightforward way of representing rotations as a set of ''Euler angles'', which are simply rotation angles about the X, Y and Z axes. Prone to well-known pitfalls such as [[w:Gimbal_lock|gimbal lock]].
* &lt;code&gt;Quaternion&lt;/code&gt;: on the face of it, a more mathematically abstruse way of representing rotations. But in fact this has many nice properties, like absence of gimbal lock, and smoother interpolation between two arbitrary rotations. The latter is particularly important in character animation.
* &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt;: a representation of RGB colours and conversion to/from HSV space (no alpha channel).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''tangent''' is a line in the same plane as a given circle that meets that circle in exactly one point. That point is called the '''point of tangency'''. A tangent cannot pass through a circle; if it does, it is classified as a '''chord'''. A '''secant''' is a line containing a chord.

[[Image:Tangent_Secant_of_circle.jpg‎|right|thumb|The point of tangency is labeled A, the tangent line is labeled B, and the secant line is labeled C.]]

A '''common tangent''' is a line tangent to two circles in the same plane. If the tangent does not intersect the line containing and connecting the centers of the circles, it is an '''external tangent'''. If it does, it is an '''internal tangent'''. 

Two circles are tangent to one another if in a plane they intersect the same tangent in the same point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On definition of term 'Potential energy' - 'Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.'

It looks incorrect a bit - internal (thermal, for example) energy is also described by state, but this energy is not potential, obviously. 

One more note - may be it's a bad idea to avoid negative numbers - gravitational energy is (actually) always negative.

And, may be the general formula for energy of gravitational interaction energy shuld be added?

E_p=-G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r}

== Cantonese sounds ==
=== Syllables ===
There are far fewer syllables in the Cantonese language than English.  The syllables are also easily described with the concepts of ''initials'' and ''finals''.  A syllable begins with a single consonant.  This is called the ''initial''.  The rest of the syllable is called the ''final.'' A final can have a single vowel or a diphthong (two vowels that glide from one to the other) and an optional final consonant (''p'', ''t'', ''k'', ''m'', ''n'', or ''ng'').

The pronunication guide below is based on American English except where otherwise noted.  Not all sounds can be described with English words and some are just approximations at best.  Be sure to listen to actual speakers to ensure that your pronunciation is correct.  Use the [http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-can/ Syllabary] to hear recordings of a native speaker.

==== Tips on finals ====
* The final consonants ''p'', ''t'', and ''k'' are '''unreleased'''.  This means that they are virtually silent and you hear no &quot;puff of air&quot; at the end of the syllable.  To give a concrete example, say the word &quot;cup&quot; and do not open your lips at the end of the word.  Note how there is no &quot;puff of air&quot; at the end. The ''k'' sound will also shift from being what is termed a '''velar stop''' to a '''glottal stop''' when it is used to add liveliness to final modal particles. The final consonant ''k'' will sometimes disappear in rapid speech as in the expression ''m4 sai2 haa[k]3 hei3''.
* The ''aa'' sounds are a low back vowel which is slightly longer in length and different in quality from the ''a'' sounds.  Be sure to note the difference in these sounds since confusing the two will change the meaning of words.
* The vowel quality in ''ing'', ''it'', and ''ik'' is not the same as in ''in'',''im'', or ''i''.  It's the same difference between the English words &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;seen&quot; (or in grammar school terms a &quot;short&quot; vowel versus a &quot;long&quot; vowel).   While this difference is not as important as the one above since it does not contrast word meanings, you will have a much more obvious &quot;foreign accent&quot; if you do not master these two sounds.
* The ''yu'' sound does not exist in English but it is not hard to produce.  Start by saying a long ''i'' as in &quot;see&quot; and--without changing anything else!--round your lips.  It's a common sound in French so &quot;think French&quot; if you have to.
* The ''eu'' sound does not exist in English either but like the ''yu'' it's just a case of rounding the lips.  Start by saying the ''e'' sound in &quot;bet&quot; and--without changing anything else!--round your lips.
* The ''eui'' sound is simply a fusion of ''eu'' and ''i'' (&quot;eu-ee&quot;) into a single syllable.
* The ''o'' sound does not exist in '''American''' English, but it is in British English.  It is the back rounded vowel that you hear when British people say &quot;more&quot; or &quot;scorn&quot;.  If you listen carefully to a British speaker, you'll notice they do not pronounce the &quot;r&quot; in these words.  It is the quality of the &quot;o&quot; vowel that makes them unique to American speakers' ears.
* The final ''eung'' has a faint, British ''r'' sound riding on the vowel, so the number two would be pronounced somewhat like &quot;leurng&quot;.  Be careful -- pronouncing this sound with an American ''r'' is a common mistake that sounds extremely foreign.
* Only the finals ''m'' and ''ng'' can be used as standalone [[w:nasal consonant|nasal]] syllables.
* Vowels preceding nasal final consonants are not nasalized, yet vowels following nasal consonants are.  You can hold your nose while pronouncing some syllables such as ''sin1'' or ''ngo5'' to test your pronunciation.  It's not critical to get this right, but doing so will reduce any apparent foreign accent.

=== Tones ===
==== Introduction ====
All the Chinese languages are tonal.  This is usually one of the biggest challenges for English speakers to overcome since English does not use tones to distinguish meanings.  But notice English does use stress to distinguish meanings, try for yourself: what does 'pro.test mean versus pro.'test?

There is a common misconception that tones requires a musical ear or that you must use a particular pitch.  In fact, tones are always relative.  For instance, if a tone is &quot;high falling&quot; then the key is to start on a pitch that is in the upper range of your normal voice and allow the pitch to drop to the lower range of your normal voice so that you end on a pitch lower than where you started.  Like any pronunciation in any language, success lies in a lot of listening and practicing.  You can and will eventually master them if you conscientiously work on them.

==== Tone categories and numbers ====
{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|'''Yale'''
|'''Description'''
|'''Alternative Notation'''
|'''Start to End Pitch'''
|-
|ā, à
|high level or high falling
|1
|55 or 53
|-
|á
|mid rising
|2
|35
|-
|a
|mid level
|3
|33
|-
|àh
|low falling
|4
|21
|-
|áh
|low rising
|5
|23
|-
|ah
|low level
|6
|22
|}

For the Start/End Pitch, the two numbers listed above are from one to five with one being the lowest pitch and five being the highest for the tone course.  Cantonese school children typically recite the tones in the order listed above: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with tone 1 being high falling.  For historical reasons, high level is not recited.  In some people, low falling is considerable and a &quot;creakiness&quot; can be heard in the pronunciation.

==== Tips on tones ====
* The syllables that end with ''p'', ''t'', and ''k'' usually are considered only to have &quot;checked&quot; level tones.  Because these syllables are so short, a rise or fall in the pitch usually cannot be detected.  Sometimes the pitch actually changes depending on the tones of the words before it, as in the word for &quot;dish&quot;, ''dip6'' versus ''dip2''.  Both can be correct, and you will notice many other low falling or low level words shift to a mid rising tone.
* A great way to practice tones is to listen to sound files of vocabulary words and guess the tones '''without''' looking at the romanization.  The better you can recognize the tones, the better you can reproduce them in your own speech.
* As you learn more words, you will automatically be able to guess some close tones (e.g., ''maai5'' versus ''maai6'') on many syllables in context, so don't be too concerned if you're having trouble at first.  Patience is the key!

== Yale Romanization ==
=== Conventions ===
#No spaces between syllables that make up a single word.  If the break between syllables becomes unclear you can use an apostrophe, e.g. 二奶 (yih'nāai).
#Tone mark always comes on first vowel.  In the case of the words 唔 (̀mh) and 五 (̀ngh), the tone mark falls on the ''m'' and ''g''.

'''Cardamom bread''' is a sweet yeast bread of Scandinavian origin which is good served at breakfast, with coffee, or as a light dessert. This recipe makes two loaves.

==Ingredients==
* 1 pkg [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], around 2.5 tsp
* 1/4 c warm water
* 3/4 c warm [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2 t [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] (about 20 green pods)
* 4 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* grated peel of 1 [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]]
* [[Cookbook:Pearl Sugar|pearl sugar]]
* sliced [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]

==Procedure==
# In a large [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]], mix flour, salt and orange peel; [[cookbook:whisk|whisk]] gently to distribute the ingredients.
# Split green cardamom pods and remove the seeds inside. With a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]], grind the seeds into a powder and add this to the other dry ingredients.
# In a small bowl, combine yeast, warm water and sugar. Stir gently for a few seconds, then let stand until the yeast is frothy.
# In a small saucepan on low heat, combine butter and milk until the butter is just melted.
# In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs and set aside.
# Check that the milk and butter mixture is not hot, then add the it into the dry ingredients and mix.
# [[cookbook:Knead|Knead]] the dough until it is smooth and elastic. 
# Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl and let rise in a warm place (in the oven, for example) until it doubles in size, about one hour.
# Knock back the dough, and cut in two parts (one for each loaf).

=== Braiding ===

# For each of the halves, 
## Split the dough into three equal sized portions.
## Roll these into &quot;ropes&quot; about 18 inches long.
## Pinch one end of each rope together.
## Braid the ropes together:
### Take the left rope and cross it over the middle one.
### Take the right rope and cross it over the middle one.
### Repeat this procedure until the ropes are fully braided.
## Pinch the other end of the ropes together.
## Tuck each pinched end underneath the main loaf.
# Put finished braids on a greased [[Cookbook:cookie sheet|cookie sheet]].
# Let rise again until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
# Prepare an egg wash by beating 1 egg thinned with water. 
# Brush the top of each braid with the egg wash.
# Sprinkle each braid with pearl sugar and sliced almonds.
# Bake at 180&amp;nbsp;°C (350&amp;nbsp;°Fahrenheit) for 25 minutes.

==Variations==
* For a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] version, substitute [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] for milk, egg replacer for eggs, and a vegan [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] for butter.

==Notes==
* Store-bought ground cardamom can be used in this recipe, but has a less intense flavor than freshly ground cardamom.
* Orange peel is not traditional in cardamom bread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linguistics ==
[[w:Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] is part of the [[Yue]] group in the [[w:Chinese language|Chinese language]] family.  Although you will often hear people refer to Cantonese as a [[w:Chinese spoken language|&quot;Chinese dialect&quot;]], it is important to realize in what sense the word [[w:Dialect|&quot;dialect&quot;]] is being used.  A dialect of a language means a variety of a language that is still mutually intelligible with other speakers of that language according to definition of western linguistics.  For instance, we can say that the English of New York City or London represent two different dialects of English.  But in Chinese linguistics, we often call any Chinese language that is not [[w:Standard Mandarin|Standard Mandarin]] a dialect of Chinese.  But many of the so-called dialects are not mutually intelligible.  For example, Cantonese is not at all intelligible with Mandarin.  Chinese people often make the joke that a Cantonese speaker and a Mandarin speaker together is like &quot;a chicken talking to a duck (雞同鴨講)&quot;.

Cantonese, a [[w:tonal language|tonal language]], is noted for its numerous tones (six categories of distinct pitch variations in Hong Kong Cantonese).  Like other Chinese languages it is not a [[w:Grammatical tense|tense language]] (does not distinguish past, present, and future verb forms), but rather an [[w:Grammatical aspect|aspectual language]].  An aspectual language marks verbs according to whether the action has been completed, progressive, been experienced, etc.  The benefit of Chinese languages for English learners is the relief of not having to study complicated verb conjugation charts.  There is also no concept of [[w:Grammatical_gender|feminine or masculine nouns]] that languages such as [[w:Romance_languages|Romance languages]] have.  On the other hand, the Chinese languages have become infamous among students because of the difficulty in mastering the [[w:Chinese character|Chinese characters]] in the [[w:Chinese written language|Chinese written language]].  Cantonese is even more unique in this aspect of the written language.  While Standard Written Chinese is widely used by its speakers, it is not representative of the spoken language.  Thus, over time a [[w:Written Cantonese|Written Cantonese]] language has developed that is vastly different from Standard Written Chinese.  Written Cantonese has yet to become an official written language but it is used by many speakers when chatting online, writing messages in bulletin boards, some Hong Kong newspapers, comic books, etc.  This website uses Written Cantonese throughout the lessons.

== Geography ==
Cantonese is the primary language of communication in [[w:Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[w:Macau|Macau]] in southeast China.  It is also widely spoken in [[w:Guangdong|Guangdong]] province in mainland [[w:China|China]], [[w:Singapore|Singapore]], and in many [[w:Chinatown|Chinatowns]] across the world.  There are estimates of about 70 million Cantonese speakers worldwide.

== Culture ==
Cantonese has held a lot of prestige in the Chinese speaking world in the last few decades.  The economic development of Hong Kong brought about a large film and music industry (including [[w:Cantopop|Cantopop]]) that is popular throughout Chinese societies.  But even before the economic success of Hong Kong, Cantonese people have maintained a long history of unique cultural traditions different from other regions of China.  [[w:Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]] is famous throughout China for its abundant seafood dishes and balanced flavors.  [[w:Dim sum|Dim sum]] (點心 dim2 sam1), a meal of tea and savory treats, has become world-renowned with hundreds of varieties and cooks are still developing new recipes everyday.  [[w:Cantonese opera|Cantonese opera]] and Cantonese literature also have a long and respected history in China.

I am a linguist-in-training and particularly passionate about Chinese linguistics.  I have been studying Mandarin for four years formally and Cantonese casually for around the same time.  I just got into the [[Cantonese]] wikibook today and am really excited to see where it can go.  Although I don't suppose I have time to be the main contributor, I hope that I can find some extra fun time to add this when possible.  Hope to meet other Cantonese students or speakers too who are interested in the project.   Cantonese is just begging for more accessible learning materials and references!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm trying out joy-of-cooking style for the ingredients part of the procedure. What do people think about it? It's a bit awkward visually, but I think it's more helpful as a printed out recipe. I'm not so sure about how the second half of the recipe is formatted. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 00:36, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

Giving the amounts a second time would make me nervously check them against each other. I've seen recipes that called for 2 cups of sugar, then used 1 cup in a batter and 1 cup as a topping. So if I see a second measurement, I'm going to get a bit paranoid. When a recipe gets too complicated for a simple numbered list (even with large steps), I split the list using headings. Rarely, I might use bulleted lists to break up steps that have multiple parallel tasks. For examples, see: [[Cookbook:Egg_Roll]], [[Cookbook:Turkey_Soup]], [[Cookbook:Molasses_Cookies]], [[Cookbook:Wonton_Soup]]. Oh, note that for some unknown reason it is standard for the Cookbook to skip 1st-level headers. Maybe this is bad, but we should reach general agreement on that before changing. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:55, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::Looking at the html, it makes sense. Each top-level header is rendered with a h1 tag. Html specifies that there should be only one h1 tag, so using level two headers everywhere would be the appropriate structural thing to do. I'll take a look at those recipes. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:04, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::I looked at those recipes; they work for the situation you describe with respect to the same ingredient being used in different sections of the recipe. What I am concerned with, however, is readability of the procedure when actually doing the recipe, which I feel is enhanced by a style like this. Still, I don't want to break the wikibooks de facto standard of listing ingredients separately without some consultation with the other contributors. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 03:51, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I should be clearer about the problem: The recipe requires 2 cups of sugar. I measure this out. Part way through the procedure, the recipe says to add 1 cup of sugar. I dump in the sugar that I've already measured. Whoops! To avoid this error, I must be extremely careful when using a recipe that specifies ingredients in two places. Also, what if the recipe disagrees with itself? This sort of thing happens as people adjust things. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
::::Oh, I totally understood that. I agree that listing ingredients in multiple places isn't desirable. I was just testing out a different style for the recipe as a whole. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:14, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
:::So I guess I don't care for the idea, but it isn't a big deal. I'd be less bothered if the numbers were only in one place. The fancier formatting looks like extra work too, without justification that I can see. I guess you might mention the ideas on the [[Talk:Cookbook|Cookbook talk page]] to see what others think. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
::::The main thing I was thinking about was if someone printed out the recipe and tried to use it as they are working in the kitchen. I'm not that bothered either way. Perhaps I'll mention it on the main talk page.  [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:14, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

This recipe calls for 1/2 c sugar in the list, but does not appear to use it in the recipe. It also calls for 1/2 t salt in the list, and uses salt twice in the recipe. My guess would be that sugar should replace salt in one of the instances, but I'm afraid I don't know enough about baking to say where. I do think it might be more appropriate to place this under &quot;vegeterian&quot; rather than &quot;vegan&quot;.

==Image==

Can we get an image for this article? [[User:Sugarpine|Sugarpine]] 03:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

: The next time I make it I'll take one. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

What about listing all the ingredients together, but, indicating when something gets split.

2 C Granulated Sugar, split
4 C Milk, Whole or 2%, split

It alerts the user that they will need to split or reserve part of this, however, for a shopping list, all the ingredients are listed together.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

'''Hash browns''' or hashed browns are a simple potato preparation in which potato pieces are pan-fried after being shredded, julienned, diced, or riced. This recipe refers to the shredded version, which is the most common in many parts of the United States.

Hash brown are considered a breakfast food, and are often served with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]].

==Ingredients==
* two [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], washed
* one half [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped (Optional)
* plenty of cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] ([[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola]] is good &amp;mdash; see [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] information)
* two tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] OR one [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==
# Grate the raw potatoes with a [[Cookbook:Grater|cheese grater]], place them into a bowl and cover completely with water. Let sit for 10 minutes.
# Place a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] on medium-high heat and add enough oil to provide a thin coating over the entire bottom of the pan. 
# Drain the grated potatoes well; if this is not done thoroughly the potatoes will steam instead of fry.
# Mix in chopped onions by hand.
# Mix the one egg OR two tablespoons of flour into the hash brown mixture evenly. This will allow the hash browns to stay together when frying.
# When the oil has come up to temperature apply a large handful of potatoes to the pan and reshape into a patty that is about [[Cookbook:Inch|1/4 in]] ([[Cookbook:mm|6 mm]]) to 1/2 in (12 mm) thick. The thinner the patty the crispier the hash browns will be throughout. 
# The hash browns are ready to flip when they are crisp and brown on the cooking side. They should also stick together nicely before they are flipped. This should take about 5 to 8 minutes.
# The hash browns are done when the new side is brown and crispy. This should take another 3-5 minutes.

==Variation==
Try using [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]] instead of the onion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Learning the Zulu Language}}


This book is designed to allow anyone who speaks English to learn Zulu for free.  Zulu is one of the most spoken languages in South Africa.  More than 20 million people are able to speak Zulu in South Africa.  The current book allows someone to go from an absolute beginner to the so-called breakthrough stage - this is encompassed in the first six lessons - and beyond.  The book currently provides pronunciation information in Appendix B. It is recommended that students should read it over to gain a better understanding of the pronunciation.

Hello as the creator of the original page.  I have to say even my creation of the page is shaky and I am a third language speaker at a push.  Basically I'm hoping that someone who actually speaks the language will come along and create something better.

== Introductory Lessons Aim == 

The book is going to be written to satisfy first the requirements of the A1 level according to Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  This is done since it is a reasonably accepted framework.  The requirements are presented below.

&quot;Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has.Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.&quot;

-Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, A1 --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] ([[User talk:IKnowNothing|talk]]) 15:13, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

=== Basic Points===

* Everyday Expressions
* Introductions

== Exercises? ==

Good work! This book is already looking better than some common-language ones. However, exercises are sorely missing and without exercises people won't remember much of what is taught. I'd also really like to see recordings, as Zulu probably doesn't sound at all like English ;-)

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 18:53, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

: I know that exercises are required. I just didn't know how to do them appropriately. It feels like there are not enough resources for book writers to improve their wiki skills.  I've used the same approach for exercises as the Spanish wikibook, which looks like one of the better language books around.  Sound clips would be excellent but unfortunately I'm not a native speaker so my efforts at audio would undoubtedly be dismal.  Most importantly, I really would like to know if anyone visits this book because I cannot help feeling that I am writing this book for myself. Oh, I've written two exercises so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Lesson 1=
This introductory lesson provides a simple conversation with a table of all the vocabulary used. Then the ways to say your name or the names of others is provided.

==Hello==

UPhilani ubingelela umngane wakhe, uLindi.

:'''uPhilani''': Sawubona Nandi.
:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani.
:'''uPhilani''': Unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Ngikhona, wena unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Nami ngikhona. Hamba kahle.
:'''uNandi''': Sala kahle.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Sawubona
| Hello
|-
| Unjani?
| How are you?
|-
| Ngikhona
| I'm fine
|-
| Wena
| You
|-
| Nami
| Also (and me)
|-
| Sala
| Stay
|-
| Hamba
| Go
|-
| Kahle
| well
|}

The first exchange illustrates a fairly casual or familiar tone. It is both more formal and more polite to use the plural forms, eg:

:'''uJacob''': Sanibonani
:'''uNjabulo''': Yebo, sanibonani.
:'''uJacob''': Ninjani?
:'''uNjabulo''': Sikhona, nina ninjani?
:'''uJacob''': Nathi sikhona.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Sanibonani
| Hello
|-
| Ninjani?
| How are you?
|-
| Sikhona
| We're fine
|-
| Nina
| You (plural)
|-
| Nathi
| Also (and us)
|}

It would normally be considered somewhat rude and abrupt to say goodbye just then. An exchange of pleasantries would normally follow such greetings, but in large cities, since people are often busy, this short conversation is sufficient.

A very polite way of saying farewell would be:

:'''uJacob''': Nihambe kahle.
:'''uNjabulo''': Nisale kahle.

=== Notes===
#Sanibona(ni) where the final ni may or may not be used

==Introducing people==

Philani introduces his friend Thabo to Nandi.

:'''uPhilani''': Nandi, Lo umgane wami, uThabo.
:'''uNandi''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi!
:'''uThabo''': Nami, ngiyajabula ukukwazi!

Thabo introduces himself to Nosipho.

:'''uThabo''': Igama lami nguThabo!
:'''uNosipho''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi! NginguNosipho.
:'''uThabo''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi!

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Igama
| Name
|-
| -mi
| my
|-
| Lo (Lona)
| This
|-
| Nina
| You (plural)
|-
| Ngiyajabula ukukwazi
| I'm pleased to know you.
|-
| Umngane
| Friend
|-
| Ngingu-
| I'm
|} 

The above table says that ''-mi'' means ''my'' but ''la-'' that is added to it is for agreement.  ''Lami'' agrees with ''igama''.  The same is true for ''wami'': the ''wa-'' agrees with ''umngane''.

==How are you?==

Philani sees his friend Thabo in the street.

:'''uPhilani''': Sawubona Thabo!
:'''uThabo''': Yebo, sawubona Philani!
:'''uPhilani''': Unjani?
:'''uThabo''': Ngisaphila, wena unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Angiphilile kahle.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Angiphilile kahle
| I'm not well.
|} 

==Surname==

Nandi tells Thabo her surname.

:'''Nandi''': Isibongo sami uNdlovu.
:'''uThabo''': NgingowakwaKhumalo.

{| border=1  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Isibongo
| Surname
|-
| Ngingowakwa-
| I'm of the family of
|}
==Summary==
* We can say hello: Sawubona, Sanibona.
* Ask people how they are: Unjani?, Ninjani?.
* Say how you are: Ngisaphila, ngikhona, angiphilile.
* Introduce yourself: Igama lami ngu-, Ngingu-.
* Introduce others: Lo ngu-.
* Say your surname: Isibongo sami, Ngingowakwa-.

==Grammar==
===Basic Sentences===
The sentence structure of Cantonese is very similar to that of English in that they both follow the pattern of [[w:Subject_Verb_Object|Subject-Verb-Object]] (SVO). Unlike many languages, verbs in Chinese aren't conjugated and noun and adjective endings don't change. They are never affected by things such as time or person. However, in the case of perfect tense, as an [[w:Grammatical aspect|aspectual language]], the word &quot;咗&quot; should be added after the verb to reflect the completion of the corresponding action. 

====S + V + O====
'''Example 1'''
:佢叫黃雪芳。
:''Kéuih giu Wòhng Suet Fōng.''
:She is called Suet Fong Wong.''

{{Warning|Note that in Cantonese you do not need the helping verb &quot;to be&quot; to use other verbs as in English.  While the sentence is translated as &quot;She '''is''' called Wong Suet Fong&quot;, it would be incorrect to say &quot;佢係叫黃雪芳&quot;. If you saying so, it would have the implication of confirmation.}}

====S + 係 + O====
係 ''haih'', the equational verb &quot;to be&quot;, can be translated in English as &quot;is&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, or &quot;are&quot;. The meaning is best summed up as &quot;equals&quot;.

'''Example 1'''
:我'''係'''黃雪芳。
:''Ngóh haih Wòhng Suet Fōng.''
:I '''am''' Suet Fong Wong. (I = Wong Suet Fong)

'''Example 2'''
:我嘅名'''係'''大偉。
:''Ngóh ge mèhng haih Daaih Wáih.''
:My name '''is''' David.'' (My name = David)

'''Example 3'''
:佢哋都'''係'''美國人。
:''Kéuihdeih dou haih Méihgwokyàhn''
:They '''are''' both Americans. (They = Americans)

====S + 唔係 + O====
係 (haih) is negated when preceded by 唔 ''m̀h''.

'''Example 1'''
:我唔係美國人。
:''Ngóh m̀h'haih Méihgwokyàhn.''
:I '''am not''' American.

'''Example 2'''
:佢唔係瑪麗。
:''Kéuih m̀h'haih Máh Leih.'' 
:She '''is not''' Mary.

===Basic Questions===
====V + 唔 + V / Yes-No====
Most statements can quickly become a yes-no question in Cantonese through the V + 唔 + V structure.  The simpliest way to answer such a question is either by repeating the verb (affirmative) or prefixing the verb with 唔 ''m̀h'' (negative).

'''Example 1'''
:佢係唔係你嘅朋友呀？
:''Kéuih haih-m̀h-haih néih ge pàhngyáuh a?''
:Is she/he your friend?

:係，佢係我嘅朋友。
:''Haih, kéuih haih ngóh ge pàhngyáuh.''
:Yes, She/he is my friend.

'''Example 2'''
:你哋係唔係美國人呀？
:''Néihdeih haih-m̀h-haih Méihgwokyàhn a?''
:Are you Americans?

:唔係，我哋係英國人。
:''M̀h'haih, ngóhdeih haih Yīnggwokyàhn.''
:No, we are British.

'''Example 3'''
:你識唔識瑪麗呀？
:''Néih sīk m̀h'sīk Máh Leih a?''
:Do you know Mary?

:識，我識瑪麗。
:''Sīk, ngóh sīk Máh Leih.''
:Yes, I know her.

{{Warning|Note that you must use the same verb in the question as in your answer.  It would be incorrect to respond to the question 你識唔識瑪麗呀？with 係.}}

====乜嘢 ''māt'yéh'' / What...?====
The question word  乜嘢 (māt'yéh), or simply 乜, make statements into questions without changing the order of the sentence. To make one, simply substitute 乜嘢 in the place the subject would be in the answer.  Notice how the word order does not change when you answer the question.

'''Example 1'''
:佢叫乜嘢名呀？
:''Kéuih giu māt'yéh mèhng a?''
:What is her name? (=She is called by what name?)

:佢叫瑪麗。
:''Kéuih giu Máh Leih.''
:She is called Mary

'''Example 2'''
:你識講乜話？
:''Néih sīk góng māt' wá?''
:What languages do you speak? (=You know speak which languages?)

:我識講廣東話。
:''Ngóh sīk góng Gwóngdōngwá.''
:I know Cantonese.

Note when spoken at a fast or natural pace, 乜嘢 is often pronounced mī'yéh.

===Particles===
Cantonese has a number of sentence final particles which expresses the speaker's tone and sometimes changes the sentence type.  The 呀 (a) is a particle which only affects the tone of the sentence.  It softens a question and is a required component of normal questions.  The 吖 (àh) indicates the speaker expects agreement with the statement.  Because the speaker expects a confirmation, this particle gives the sentence a questioning tone.  This is similar to English when we state a fact while using a rising intonation (e.g. &quot;You're going home?&quot;).

==Exercises==
===Pronunciation Drills===
====Initials====
Although most of the Cantonese initials are familiar sounds to English speakers, the ''ng'' initial in the pronoun 我 ''ngóh'' often frustrates beginners.  Actually the sound is also in E'''ng'''lish, but it simply never falls at the beginning of the word. Here's an exercise to help you produce this sound word-initially:

#Say the word &quot;sing&quot; slowly. Notice how the back of your tongue touches the back of your mouth at the end of the word.
#Say the word &quot;sing&quot; slowly again. But this time draw out the &quot;ng&quot; sound at the end of the word.  Try see how long you can hold this sound.
#When you say &quot;sing&quot; this time, hold the &quot;ng&quot; sound and add an &quot;o&quot;.  The word will sound like &quot;sing--o&quot; at first.  Practice this a few more times until the &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are produced together.
#Finally, say the word again but this time whisper the &quot;si&quot; sound.  Keep repeating the word until you can say it without the &quot;si&quot;.  With enough practice you see'll you are able to say 我 ''ngóh'' with little difficulty.

This is a good time to point out one of the sound changes that is undergoing in modern Hong Kong Cantonese.  The ''ng'' initial sound is being dropped in young people's casual speech.  If you listen closely, you may find your your Cantonese friends seem to say 我 ''óh'' when having informal conversations.  It appears that this sound change will likely become complete in the coming decades.  This will mean that the word initial ''ng'' will no longer exist in Cantonese.  However, it is still worth practicing this sound!  Dropping the ''ng'' is not yet considered standard speech by many people and has even been negatively labelled as &quot;lazy speech.&quot;

====Finals====
The syllables that end with one of the final stops ''p'', ''t'', or ''k'' are much shorter than the other syllables without stops.  In addition, it is important that the stop is &quot;unreleased.&quot;  This means there is no &quot;puff of air&quot; at the end of the syllable.  For instance, say the English word &quot;cup&quot; without opening your lips at the end.  Note how there is no puff of air.  Practice this with the following words:
:十 ''sahp'' ten
:國 ''gwok'' country
:識 ''sīk'' know
:乜 ''māt'' what

====Tones====
The list below shows all the tones in the traditional reading order (high to low).  Memorizing this list is an excellent way to improve your tone production and recognition.

:'''High Level:''' 詩 ''sī'' poetry
:'''High Rising:''' 史 ''sí'' history
:'''Mid Level:''' 試 ''si'' test
:'''Low Rising:''' 時 ''sìh'' time
:'''Low Falling:''' 市 ''síh'' city
:'''Low Level:''' 事 ''sih'' matter

The clipped tones are the are virtually the same as the high, mid, and low levels tones.  The only difference in these syllables is they are rather short in duration.
:'''High Clipped:''' 色 ''sīk'' color
:'''Mid Clipped:''' 錫 ''sik'' tin
:'''Low Clipped:''' 食 ''sihk'' eat

&lt;!-- MOVE TO LESSON 2 '''Rising Tones:''' The low rising tone should start in the low register of your normal voice and rise up to the middle register.  The high rising tone starts the middle (or low-middle) register and rises to the highest register of your normal voice.  These two tones are the hardest to distinguish so give yourself time and practice a lot.
:我 ''ngóh'' - 火 ''fóh'' fire
:你 ''néih'' - 幾 ''géi'' how many
:佢 ''kéuih'' - 嘴 ''jéui'' mouth --&gt;

===Grammar Drills===

===Conversation Practice===
#Introduce yourself to your language partner.  Make sure to say your name and your nationality.
#Ask your partner if they know one of your friends.
#Ask your partner their name and nationality. Let them know how happy you are to meet them.

Hello, I originally registered for the English Wikipedia under the username [[w:User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]], and then decided to make a Wikibooks account, so I could edit non-anonymously over here too.  Since I'll probably be on Wikipedia more, why don't you check out my [[w:User:Bulbaboy|Wikipedia userpage]] - I'm likely to put more stuff there than here.

By the way, I have evolved. I didn't get around to updating this on Wikipedia, but soon I will.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What do you mean by the protest orientation of sects?  Also, you may want to define sect

Need a section on religious conversion:

from Batson et. al.
p. 151 &quot;We have considered four possible facilitators of religious experience - psychedelic drugs, meditation, religious language, and music. We suggested that although none has the power to produce religious experience, each has the power to facilitate it. Moreover, we suggested that each works in its own unique way: Drugs affect both the self-surrender and new vision stages; meditation only the self-surrender stage; religious language the existential crisis, new vision, and new life stages; and various forms of music affect all four stages. Note that if these suggestions are correct, then to facilitate all four stages using drugs, meditation, and religious language, two or more techniques must be combined. To combine drugs with meditation would be largely redundant, and it would still leave two stages uncovered. So we would not expect such a combination to occur. But to combine either drugs or meditation with religious language would cover all four stages. Therefore, we would expect such combinations to occur and to prove effective. We would expect various forms of music, which affect emotional rather than cognitive processes, to be combined with any and all of the other facilitators.&quot;

==On Durkheim's Account of Religion==
Personally, I have a bit of a problem with the author's critique of Durkheim's explaination of Religion. Durkheim, in many ways, does stress that religion ''is'' society and/or any social gathering or state of shared conciousnes which is designated as sacred.

It is not what is thought of as the commonly &quot;religious&quot; event (i.e. God, a center of worship, etc) that makes it religious, it is the feeling of sacredness that surrounds the event, mentality or place. Therefore, saying that nationalism is not religion is wrong (as I understand it) by Durkheim - nationalism, if it is a sacred feeling that is expemplified in a gathering or a shared conciousness among many peoples of a territory, it may in fact be &quot;religious.&quot; Whether people consider it to be religious or not depends on their conception of religion, not Durkheim's. This is hardly a flaw in Durkheim's logic or reasonable grounds for a critique.

Durkheim at least implies that what we feel during these sacred events and gatherings is the force of society, and that is what makes it a '''sacred''' event. Bevcause we are no longer primitive peoples, by Durkheim's account, we no longer attribute every sacred event or feeling to that of a God. He attributes the many different settings in which a feeling of sacredness may come about to different social settings and implies that these many different feelings are the basis of polytheism (totemism). 

In sumation, for Durkheim religion ''is'' society. I think that point is greatly missed in this short account of his work on Religion. 
:That's a good point. I'll see if I can't give it a fairer treatment in the future.

I don't think the piece really captures Durkeim's contention, i.e., the sacred is the social. For Durkheim, engaging in religious activity reinforces the hierarchy of the colective over the individual. In class I illustrate the idea by reference to Norse mythology on the origins of scoial structure. I can't remember the particular part of the Edda (although it may be the Rigsthulla) but Heimdallr, one of the gods (going be the eke-name 'Rig' I think) manages to enviegle hs way into the beds of three generations of humanity. The offspring of these visits are the progenitors of the three social classes of norse society (thralls, karls and jarls). In retelling and and attending to the story individuals re-inscribed their relationship to an imutable social order a bit like singing the all things bright and beautiful hymn (the bit about the rich man in his castle and the poor man at his gate). The order is imutable because it has its origins in divine intervention. In short, the function of this instance of the sacred is to re-inforce the priority of a pre-existing social order over the aspirations of the individual, i.e. don't get above yourself.

The double wheeler, also known as the biverticycle or two-wheeler unicycle is a vehicle with two wheels, where the wheels are stacked on top of each other. The top wheel is pedalled by direct drive.  This drives the bottom wheel, which moves in the opposite direction.

By the same principle, multi-wheel unicycles have been built, with wheels often stacked in parallel, some with as many as 16 wheels.</text>

== Simple Arithmetic ==

Most any programming language can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between [[Computer programming/Variables]] to put the results into new Variables.  Watch out for risk of '''Divide by Zero''', which can give serious indigestion to some programming languages.

== Date Math ==

Many programming languages can calculate the number of days weeks months between two dates, provided the dates are defined using consistent [[Computer programming/Types]].
 
== Higher Math ==

Some programming languages can compute values using mathematics beyond simple arithmetic, such as Square Roots, Sine, Cosine, Logarithms, Imaginary Numbers.

== See also ==

If you want to know more you should read the sister article [[Ada_Programming/Mathematical_calculations]] which is a lot more elaborate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
There are many romanization schemes for Cantonese.  One of the most difficult things for learners is to handle the multiple systems.  Unfortunately there has been no well-established standard like [[w:Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]].  Here's a brief listing of common schemes:
* [[w:Yale romanization|Yale]]: Used by many textbooks for second language learners of Cantonese.  It is easily recognized by the use of a silent &quot;h&quot; to represent syllables that have tones in the low register and the use of tone diacritics similar to [[w:Hanyu Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]].  This website uses a version that was modified by Matthews and Yip (1994).
* [[w:Sidney Lau|Sidney Lau]]: Another method based on the Yale system that has been used in textbooks but not as popular as Yale.
* [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]]: Promoted by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong to be the standard romanization scheme, and used predominantly in the linguistics literature.  One of the pluses of this scheme is that it only uses the letters of the English alphabet and numbers. Thus, it is easy to type.  But few non-linguists have adopted this system and it has some characteristics which makes it unintuitive to English speakers because of the difference between Cantonese and English.
* [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: Also known as the International Phonetic Alphabet.  This is a romanization system used by linguists and is designed to transcribe any language in the world.  Because it is a standard system, it can be useful to compare other romanization schemes to.  However, it does not make the ideal system for learners because it often requires memorizing more symbols than needed.
* [[w:Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation|Hong Kong Government]]: Not suitable for foreign language training because there is no one to one mapping of sounds and symbols, although this is affected by the perception of Cantonese phonemes by English speakers.  Nevertheless, this is the romanization you will see on street signs and place names in Hong Kong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Future Directions/Road Map for this module ==

I'm going to try and get to data packets sooner or later (probably sometime in early 2006), but I'm trying to come up with a consistant API... or more to the point a bunch of standardized serial communication routines/objects that I can use with these later discussions.  As this is a book, I want to build on the previous chapters for this particular module, which means I'm not going to be going into the gritty details of how you get a few characters out, but instead get into how data packets are formed and what their general purposes would be.

Some sample &quot;projects&quot; I'm going to add include: 

*Reading temperature measurements from a temperature probe connected via serial data link.
*Sample Stock Market data feeds in serial format.
*:::::or
*Sports Scores data feed
*Updating a &quot;time and temperature&quot; display for outdoor advertising

I also want to cover CRC issues in some depth, and attempt to explain error checking algorithms.  Most of this, however, will be in [[Serial Programming:Error Correction Methods]], which is ripe for an overhaul as well and not written to build from this module.

If you think this roadmap is going the wrong way, or if there are suggestions on how to teach the concepts of forming data packets, please make mention here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:16, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Problem with a link on the page ==

Well, the link present on the page as [http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.cgi?SLIMP3ClientProtocol The SLIMP3 Client Protocol] is not functional. 

I temporarily replaced the link with another one that i found on that site which is present there now as [http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SLIMP3ClientProtocol The SLIMP3 Client Protocol], you may check whether it is the same one or some other.

But as that site is still under contruction so maybe you should replace the link with some equivalent from some other site to avoid future problems (you see, they replace a CGI page with a PHP one, assuming i have provided the link to the same page)...

Great work anyways. Thank you (:

|I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me,&lt;br&gt;and art become my salvation. The stone&lt;br&gt;which the builders refused is become the&lt;br&gt;head stone of the corner. This is the&lt;br&gt;Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 118: 22-23
|The Stone&lt;br&gt;rejected by&lt;br&gt;authorities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read&lt;br&gt;in the scriptures, The stone which the&lt;br&gt;builders rejected, the same is become the&lt;br&gt;head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing,&lt;br&gt;and it is marvellous in our eyes?&lt;br&gt;Mt. 21: 42
|-
|Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,&lt;br&gt;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&lt;br&gt;Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he&lt;br&gt;said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye&lt;br&gt;indeed, but understand not; and see ye&lt;br&gt;indeed, but percieve not. Make the heart&lt;br&gt;of this people fat, and make their ears&lt;br&gt;heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see&lt;br&gt;with their eyes, and hear with their ears,&lt;br&gt;and understand with their heart, and &lt;br&gt;convert, and be healed. Is. 6: 8-10
|People do not&lt;br&gt;believe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Therefore they could not believe, because&lt;br&gt;that Esaias said again, He hath blinded&lt;br&gt;their eyes, and hardened their heart; that&lt;br&gt;they should not see with their eyes, nor&lt;br&gt;understand with their heart, and be&lt;br&gt;converted, and I should heal them.&lt;br&gt;These things said Esaias, when he&lt;br&gt;saw His glory, and spake of Him.&lt;br&gt;Joh. 12: 39-41&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|In those days they shall say no more, The&lt;br&gt;fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the&lt;br&gt;children’s teeth are set on edge. But every&lt;br&gt;one shall die for his own iniquity: every&lt;br&gt;man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth&lt;br&gt;shall be set on edge. Behold, the days&lt;br&gt;come, saith the Lord, that I will make a&lt;br&gt;NEW COVENANT with the house of&lt;br&gt;Israel, and with the house of Judah.&lt;br&gt;Jer. 31: 29-31
|Ministers the&lt;br&gt;New Covenant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|For I say unto you, I will not drink of the&lt;br&gt;fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of&lt;br&gt;God shall come. And he took bread,&lt;br&gt;and gave unto them, saying, This is my&lt;br&gt;body which is given for you: this do in&lt;br&gt;remembrance of me. Likewise also the&lt;br&gt;cup after supper, saying, This cup is the&lt;br&gt;NEW TESTAMENT in my blood which is&lt;br&gt;shed for you. Lu. 22: 18-20&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom&lt;br&gt;I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath&lt;br&gt;lifted up his heel against me. Ps. 41: 9&lt;br&gt;(ca. 1000 B.C.)
|The betrayal of&lt;br&gt;Christ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|I speak not of you all: I know whom I have&lt;br&gt;chosen: but that the scripture may be&lt;br&gt;fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath&lt;br&gt;lifted up his heel against me. Joh. 13: 18
|-
|They that hate me without a cause are&lt;br&gt;more than the hairs of mine head: they that&lt;br&gt;would destroy me, being mine enemies&lt;br&gt;wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that&lt;br&gt;which I took not away. Ps. 69: 4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Hated without&lt;br&gt;cause&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|If I had not done among them the works&lt;br&gt;which none other man did, they had not&lt;br&gt;had sin: but now have they both seen and&lt;br&gt;hate both me and my Father. But this&lt;br&gt;cometh to pass that the word might be&lt;br&gt;fulfilled that is written in their law, They&lt;br&gt;hated me without a cause. Joh. 15: 24-25
|-
|And I said unlo them. If ye think good, give&lt;br&gt;me my price, and if not, forbear. So they&lt;br&gt;weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.&lt;br&gt;Zec. 11: 12
|Price paid for&lt;br&gt;Jesus' betrayal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|-
|Awake, O sword, against my shepherd,&lt;br&gt;and against the man that is my fellow, saith&lt;br&gt;the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and&lt;br&gt;the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn&lt;br&gt;mine hand upon the little ones. Zec. 13: 7&lt;br&gt;(ca. 500 B.C)
|Forsaken by&lt;br&gt;disciples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then saith Jesus unto them. All ye shall be&lt;br&gt;offended because of me this night: for it is&lt;br&gt;written, I will smite the shepherd, and the&lt;br&gt;sheep of the flock shall be scattered &lt;br&gt;abroad. Mt. 26: 31 (Mk. 14: 50)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|And the Lord said unlo me, Cast it unto the&lt;br&gt;potter: a goodly price that I was prised at&lt;br&gt;of them. And I took the thirty pieces of&lt;br&gt;silver, and cast them to the potter in the&lt;br&gt;house of the Lord. Zec. 11: 13&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Price of&lt;br&gt;betrayal cast&lt;br&gt;away on a&lt;br&gt;potter’s field&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And he cast down the pieces of silver&lt;br&gt;in the temple, and departed, and went and&lt;br&gt;hanged himself. And the chief priests took&lt;br&gt;the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful&lt;br&gt;for to put them into the treasury, because&lt;br&gt;it is the price of blood. And they took&lt;br&gt;counsel, and bought with them the potter’s&lt;br&gt;field, to bury strangers in. Mt. 27: 5-7
|-
|False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my&lt;br&gt;charge things that I knew not. Ps. 35: 11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|False witnesses&lt;br&gt;at His trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|For many bare false witness against him,&lt;br&gt;but their witness agreed not together.&lt;br&gt;Mk. 14: 56
|-
|He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,&lt;br&gt;and as a sheep before her shearers is&lt;br&gt;dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&lt;br&gt;Is. 53:7
|Silent before&lt;br&gt;His accusers as&lt;br&gt;a lamb to the&lt;br&gt;slaughter
|And he answered him to never a word;&lt;br&gt;insomuch that the governor marvelled&lt;br&gt;greatly. Mt. 27: l4 (Joh. 1: 29)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|But he was wounded for our&lt;br&gt;transgressions, he was bruised for our&lt;br&gt;iniquities: the chastisement of our peace&lt;br&gt;was upon him; and with his stripes we are&lt;br&gt;healed. Is. 53: 5
|Jesus' scourging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
|Then released he Barabbas unto them: and&lt;br&gt;when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered&lt;br&gt;him to be crucified. Mt. 27: 26&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|As many were astonied at thee; his visage&lt;br&gt;was so marred more than any man, and&lt;br&gt;his form more than the sons of men:&lt;br&gt;Is. 52: 14 
|His marred&lt;br&gt;visage (face)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then Jesus came forward, wearing the crown&lt;br&gt;of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilatus&lt;br&gt;said to them, [&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Christianity/ECCEHOMO|&lt;small&gt;ECCEHOMO&lt;/small&gt;]]&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;] Behold the&lt;br&gt;man. Joh. 19: 5
|-
|And if a man have committed a sin worthy&lt;br&gt;of death, and he be to be put to death, and&lt;br&gt;thou hang him on a tree: His body shall not&lt;br&gt;remain all night upon the tree, but thou&lt;br&gt;shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he&lt;br&gt;that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy&lt;br&gt;land be not defiled, which the Lord thy&lt;br&gt;God giveth thee for an inheritance.&lt;br&gt;De. 21: 22-23
|The Saviour's&lt;br&gt;crucifixion&lt;br&gt;according to the&lt;br&gt;law of the land&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And he said unto them the third time, Why,&lt;br&gt;what evil hath he done? I have found no&lt;br&gt;cause of death in him: I will therefore&lt;br&gt;chastise him, and let him go. And they&lt;br&gt;were instant with loud voices, requiring&lt;br&gt;that he might be crucified. And the voices&lt;br&gt;of them and of the chief priests prevailed. &lt;br&gt;And Pilate gave sentence that it should be&lt;br&gt;as they required. Lu. 23: 22-24
|-
|I gave my back to the smiters, and my&lt;br&gt;cheeks to them that plucked off the hair:&lt;br&gt;I hid not my face from shame and spitting.&lt;br&gt;Is. 50: 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Spat upon in&lt;br&gt;humiliation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And they smote him on the head with a&lt;br&gt;reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing&lt;br&gt;their knees worshipped him. And when&lt;br&gt;they had mocked him, they took off the&lt;br&gt;purple from him, and put his own clothes&lt;br&gt;on him, and led him out to crucify him.&lt;br&gt;Mk. 15: 19-20
|-
|For dogs have compassed me: the&lt;br&gt;assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:&lt;br&gt;they pierced my hands and my feet.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 22: 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|He is nailed to&lt;br&gt;the cross&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|The other disciples therefore said unto him,&lt;br&gt;We have seen the Lord. But he said unto&lt;br&gt;them, Except I shall see in his hands the&lt;br&gt;print of the nails, and put my finger into the&lt;br&gt;print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his&lt;br&gt;side, I will not believe.&lt;br&gt;Joh. 20: 25 (Re. 1: 7)
|-
|Therefore will I divide him a portion with the&lt;br&gt;great, and he shall divide the spoil with the&lt;br&gt;strong; because he hath poured out his&lt;br&gt;soul unto death: And he was numbered&lt;br&gt;with the transgressors; and he bare the sin&lt;br&gt;of many, and made intercession for the&lt;br&gt;transgressors. Is. 53:12
|Numbered with&lt;br&gt;transgressors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|-
|They part my garments among them, and&lt;br&gt;cast lots upon my vesture. Ps. 22: 18&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|The parting of&lt;br&gt;His garments by&lt;br&gt;castings lots&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for&lt;br&gt;they know not what they do. And they&lt;br&gt;parted his raiment, and cast lots.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 34
|-
|I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried:&lt;br&gt;mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 69: 3
|He becomes&lt;br&gt;thirsty&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|Given bitter&lt;br&gt;drink&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|They gave him vinegar to drink mingled&lt;br&gt;with gall: and when he had tasted thereof,&lt;br&gt;he would not drink. Mt. 27: 34

|I became also a reproach unto them: when&lt;br&gt;they looked upon me they shaked their&lt;br&gt;heads. Ps. 109: 25
|He is mocked&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And they that passed by reviled him,&lt;br&gt;wagging their heads. Mt. 27:39&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|All they that see me laugh me to scorn:&lt;br&gt;they shoot out the lip, they shake the head,&lt;br&gt;saying, He trusted on the Lord that he&lt;br&gt;would deliver him: let him deliver him,&lt;br&gt;seeing he delighted in him. Ps. 22:7, 8
|Railing and&lt;br&gt;taunting toward&lt;br&gt;Christ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And one of the malefactors which were&lt;br&gt;hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be&lt;br&gt;Christ, save thyself and us. Lu. 23: 39&lt;br&gt; (Mt. 27:43)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|And he bare the sin of many, and made&lt;br&gt;intercession for the transgressors.&lt;br&gt;Is. 53:12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|His intercession&lt;br&gt;for a fellow&lt;br&gt;sufferer in&lt;br&gt;need&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|But the other answering rebuked him,&lt;br&gt;saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing&lt;br&gt;thou art in the same condemnation? And&lt;br&gt;we indeed justly; for we receive the due&lt;br&gt;reward of our deeds: but this man hath&lt;br&gt;done nothing amiss. And he said unto&lt;br&gt;Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou&lt;br&gt;comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said&lt;br&gt;unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day&lt;br&gt;shalt thou be with me in paradise.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 42-43
|-
|And it shall come to pass in that day. saith&lt;br&gt;the Lord God, that I will cause the sun to go&lt;br&gt;down at noon, and I will darken the earth in&lt;br&gt;the clear day. Am. 8: 9

|An intense&lt;br&gt;lonely cry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with&lt;br&gt;a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli lama&lt;br&gt;sabachthani? that is to say, My God,&lt;br&gt;my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&lt;br&gt;Mt. 27: 46

|-
|For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;&lt;br&gt;neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to&lt;br&gt;see corruption. Thou wilt show me the&lt;br&gt;path of life: in thy presence is fulness of&lt;br&gt;joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures&lt;br&gt;for evermore.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 16: 10-11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|His resurrection
|And he said unto them, These are the&lt;br&gt;words which I spake unto you, that all&lt;br&gt;things must be fulfilled, which were written&lt;br&gt;in the law of Moses, and in the prophets,&lt;br&gt;and in the psalms, concerning me. Then&lt;br&gt;opened he their understanding, that they&lt;br&gt;might understand the scriptures, And&lt;br&gt;said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus&lt;br&gt;it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise&lt;br&gt;from the dead the third day: And that&lt;br&gt;repentance and remission of sins should&lt;br&gt;be preached in his name among all&lt;br&gt;nations, beginning at Jerusalem, And&lt;br&gt;ye are witnesses of these things.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 24: 44-48 (Ac. 2: 22-28)

|The ascension&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|To sit at the&lt;br&gt;Right Hand of&lt;br&gt;God, the Father&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|So then after the Lord had spoken unto&lt;br&gt;them, he was received up into heaven, and&lt;br&gt;sat on the right hand of God. Mk. 16: 19&lt;br&gt; (Re. 3: 21)

|All we like sheep have gone astray; we&lt;br&gt;have turned every one to his own way; and&lt;br&gt;the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of&lt;br&gt;us all. Is. 53: 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|Who did no sin, neither spoke deceitfully:&lt;br&gt;Who, when he was reviled, did not answer&lt;br&gt;contemptuously; when he suffered, did not&lt;br&gt;threaten; but committed Himself to&lt;br&gt;righteous judgment from on high: Who&lt;br&gt;bore our sins in His own body on the tree&lt;br&gt;by whose stripes you are healed, that you,&lt;br&gt;being dead to sins should live under&lt;br&gt;righteous conviction. While you were as&lt;br&gt;sheep gone astray; you are now returned&lt;br&gt;to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.&lt;br&gt;I Pe. 2: 22-25 (1 Co. 15: 3)

|Who hath wrought and done it, calling the&lt;br&gt;generations from the beginning? I, the&lt;br&gt;Lord, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;br&gt;Is. 41:4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>Insert global perspective</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Moral reasoning is a thinking process with the objective of determining whether an idea is right or wrong.

To know whether something is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; one must first know what that something is intended to accomplish.
Thus, to know if &quot;this direction&quot; is the right direction to follow to get to a coffee shop, one must first know where one is, where the coffee shop is, and the terrain between here and there (to avoid blocks, etc).

Or, to know if this action is the right action to take, one must know what one wants to accomplish, where one is, and the environment between here and the accomplished state (for example, to impress my boss, I have to know what is likely to impress him/her, what I, myself, can do at the work-place or where he/she would observe, etc).

Thus, to know if something (an idea, an action, a behavior) is &quot;right&quot; one has to know both what one intends to accomplish and the environment that exists between &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there.

But that alone is not enough! To go to a bank and threaten the cashier might well accomplish your aim because you know security is weak and the prospect of capture is low. There is a third consideration: is it good for the people who live around me, and supply the things my stolen cash will buy. Here we have a further dilemma: a quick injection of stolen cash may well help my closest suppliers, but where should we draw the boundary? The neighbourhood? The city? Our Nation? or The whole world? Only this last reason: Good for all humanity, yields &quot;moral reasoning&quot;

Satisfactory solutions to problems are determined by using this principle. Problems or behaviors are difficult to solve when either the environment or the desired accomplishment are incompletely understood from a global perspective. (Religions face this difficulty.)

Therefore, moral reasoning can not be correctly performed until what is sought and the surrounding world-wide environment is fully understood. An example: is it &quot;right&quot; to use fetal stem cells? Only by first deciding &quot;what&quot; the use is intended to accomplish and if the way of accomplishing this is understood could such a question be answered. This is discussed in Thinking And Moral Problems [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Thinking_And_Moral_Problems]]

      <comment>Broaden morality and separate 'religion'</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Our actions stem from our thoughts, and such actions influence the lives of others. Unfortunately, we are not born with a &quot;code of conduct&quot;. Rather we absorb our morality from our parents, schools religions, societies and, sometimes we also have to adopt the codes of professions. But such impositions only provide general directions, they do not solve specific questions as to how we should live our lives or how should treat other people:
* One approach  is to seek the knowledge of leaders whose wisdom is respected and simply follow the herd. 
* Alternatively, one could d take such wisdom as one finds and then engage is moral reasoning to determine whether ones actions are right or wrong.

Even in making the choice to seek the knowledge of respected leaders, or to choose a life-philosophy or religion, one is making a decision regarding right action - e.g. &quot;Is this leader, philosophy or religion the correct one to guide my life-stile and inform my choices?&quot;  Even the decision to hand one's decision-making power over to another requires that one be capable of making a decision - hopefully the right one.

Most of us have no choice in our religious, social or moral formation - it is imposed by parents, teachers and politicians. Only later in life do we have the  ability to choose to follow a particular religious calling or to rethink our early indoctrination in the light of some seemingly more relevant philosophy.is as  in  any other similar choice, one can benefit from the application of moral reasoning.

In strongly religious societies the ability to break with convention and make an informed  choice is not available without punishment for [[w:religious offense]]s.   

In secular and democratic societies, with less rigid rules, it is often necessary to  to make a good choice, has powerful consequences thereafter. Our lives, and our effect on others, are governed by the decisions we make, and the consequences of our decisions are likely to be governed by the quality of the decisions we make. The ability to make good decisions - however we may end up defining &quot;good&quot; will impact our lives, how we treat others, how we are treated in return. The ability to have a good framework for making our own decisions will allow us to make better decisions than a person who does not so educate or increase themselves.

While we will often find ourselves lacking good information, and sometimes lacking in the ability to perceive pertinent facts (our ancestors did not know of the existence of microbes), the ability to formulate good decisions with whatever information is available can enable us not to merely muddle through, but to intelligently choose the most effective roads. In an uncertain, complex, and always-changing world, we cannot always count on good data or rely on being able to fall back on past experience and precedent, so it is ever-more important to have the ability to make &quot;good&quot; decisions with what we have, and that requires the ability to choose or recognize what we know to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right&quot;. Moral Reasoning serves this purpose.

      <comment>Add the XOR operator from [[Java Programming/Operators]].</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=Boolean expressions}}
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Loop blocks|next=Variables}}
{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Boolean values are values that evaluate to either {{java:true}} or {{java:false}}, and are represented by the {{java:boolean}} data type.  Boolean expressions are very similar to mathematical expressions, but instead of using mathematical operators such as &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;, you use comparative or boolean operators such as &quot;==&quot; or &quot;!&quot;.

== Comparative operators ==

Java has several operators that can be used to compare variables.  For example, how would you tell if one variable has a greater value than another?  The answer: use the &quot;greater-than&quot; operator.

Here is a list of the comparative operators in Java:

* &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; : Greater than
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; : Less than
* &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; : Greater than or equal to
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; : Less than or equal to
* &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; : Equal to
* &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; : Not equal to

To see how these operators are used, look at this example:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-37&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.37: Comparisons.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 5, b = 3;
System.out.println(a &gt; b); // Value is true because a is greater than b
System.out.println(a == b); // Value is false because a does not equal b
System.out.println(a != b); // Value is true because a does not equal b
System.out.println(b &lt;= a); // Value is true because b is less than a
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for code section 3.37'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
true
false
true
true
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Comparative operators can be used on any primitive types (except &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;), but only the &quot;equals&quot; and &quot;does not equal&quot; operators work on objects.  This is because the less-than/greater-than operators cannot be applied to objects, but the equivalency operators can.

{{XNote|1=Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; operators test whether both variables point to the same object.  Objects will be covered later in the tutorial, in the &quot;[[Java Programming/Classes,_Objects_and_Types|Classes, Objects, and Types]]&quot; module.}}

== Boolean operators ==

The Java boolean operators are based on the operations of the [[Wikipedia:Boolean algebra|boolean algebra]]. The boolean operators operate directly on boolean values.

Here is a list of four common boolean operators in Java:

* &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean NOT
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean AND
* &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean inclusive OR
* &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean exclusive OR

The boolean NOT operator (&quot;!&quot;) inverts the value of a boolean expression.  The boolean AND operator (&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;) will result in true if and only if the values on both sides of the operator are true.  The boolean inclusive OR operator (&quot;||&quot;) will result in true if either or both of the values on the sides of the operator is true.  The boolean exclusive XOR operator (&quot;^&quot;) will result in true if one and only of the values on the sides of the operator is true.

To show how these operators are used, here is an example:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-38&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.38: Operands.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
boolean iMTrue = true;
boolean iMTrueToo = true;
boolean iMFalse = false;
boolean iMFalseToo = false;

System.out.println(&quot;NOT operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(!iMTrue);
System.out.println(!iMFalse);
System.out.println(!(4 &lt; 5));
System.out.println(&quot;AND operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(iMTrue &amp;&amp; iMTrueToo);
System.out.println(iMFalse &amp;&amp; iMFalseToo);
System.out.println(iMTrue &amp;&amp; iMFalse);
System.out.println(iMTrue &amp;&amp; !iMFalse);
System.out.println(&quot;OR operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(iMTrue || iMTrueToo);
System.out.println(iMFalse || iMFalseToo);
System.out.println(iMTrue || iMFalse);
System.out.println(iMFalse || !iMTrue);
System.out.println(&quot;XOR operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(iMTrue ^ iMTrueToo);
System.out.println(iMFalse ^ iMFalseToo);
System.out.println(iMTrue ^ iMFalse);
System.out.println(iMFalse ^ !iMTrue);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for code section 3.38'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
NOT operand:
false
true
false
AND operand:
true
false
false
true
OR operand:
true
false
true
false
XOR operand:
false
false
true
false
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Here are the truth tables for the boolean operators:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!a !! &lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;a
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!a !! b !! a &amp;&amp; b !! a &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; b !! a &lt;nowiki&gt;^&lt;/nowiki&gt; b
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
|}

:''For help on simplifying complex logic, see [[Wikipedia:De Morgan's laws|De Morgan's laws]].''

In Java, boolean logic has a useful property called ''short circuiting''.  This means that expressions will only be evaluated as far as necessary.  In the expression &lt;code&gt;(a &amp;&amp; b)&lt;/code&gt;, if a is false, then b will not be evaluated because the expression will be false no matter what. Here is an example that shows that the second expression is not automatically checked:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-39&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.39: Short circuiting.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
System.out.println((4 &lt; 5) || ((10 / 0) == 2));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for code section 3.39'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
true
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

To disable this property, you can use &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; but it's not recommended.

:''For the bitwise operations on &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, see [[Java Programming/Basic arithmetic#Using bitwise operators within Java|Arithmetic expressions]].''

== Re: User:Ivyboy ==

Possible? Yes.  Likely? You're right- probably not.  Still, there's little harm in trying to bend him into shape rather than blocking him right away.  That's why I'm going to keep an eye on him for any more 'funny business' so I can block him right away if I see that he's not willing to cooperate and learn. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 12:37, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

:Ivyboy continued his disruptive behavior, as you predicted.  I've blocked him for 24 hours, but it'll probably deserve a one week block if he does it again.  Oh well, it was worth a try :). -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 16:18, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

::I noticed that he said he was going to &quot;update this on wikipedia,&quot; so I've registered the wikipedia account &quot;Ivyboy.&quot; I don't plan to use it- I just wanted to make sure he didn't get it.

:::No problem :) I've protected your user page only against moves; that should probably be sufficient.  Most people are okay with it, especially if it's just against moves (there's no reason for anybody to move a user page).  Mind you, some people might complain if you fully protect it- that's usually only done if a page gets a lot of vandalism. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 23:06, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

::::He did the same thing on my wikipedia talk page...thanks for reverting.  You should be proud to have your own personal imposter :D.  I did a whois on the IP, and it looks like the abuse email is &quot;Bamam.Forum@mail.biu.ac.il&quot;.  I think that a lot of the edits coming from the IP look alright, so I don't think that we need to take such drastic action yet.  I personally don't mind people vandalizing my talk page so much that I would even block them, but other editors are usually very different about it; therefore, I'll block if ivyboy vandalizes somebody else's talk page, user page, or articles, but I don't plan to block if they're just vandalizing my talk page.

Could you please post the following in my name on the Pokeproposal page at Wikipedia?&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;****I agree that the clicking to go forwards and backwards is important. This is one of the reasons that I put in Stubs for Pokemon who didn't have pages, and added the tables to articles that didn't have them.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

[[Image:Percentages of the us population by race - 2000.png|thumb|220px|right|A pie chart showing the racial make-up of the US in 2000.]]

A Pie-Chart/Diagram is a graphical device - a circular shape broken into sub-divisions. The sub-divisions are called &quot;''sectors''&quot;, whose areas are proportional to the various parts into which the whole quantity is divided. The sectors may be coloured differently to show the relationship of parts to the whole. A pie diagram is an alternative of the sub-divided bar diagram.

To construct a pie-chart, first we draw a circle of any suitable radius then the whole quantity which is to be divided is equated to 360 degrees. The different parts of the circle in terms of angles are calculated by the following formula.
 
     Component Value / Whole Quantity * 360

The component parts i.e. sectors have been cut beginning from top in clockwise order.

Note that the percentages in a list may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.  For example if a person spends a third of their time on each of three activities: 33%, 33% and 33% sums to 99%.

'''Warning:''' Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear  measures and bad at judging relative areas.  A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data.

Cleveland (1985), page 264: &quot;Data that can be shown by pie charts always can be shown by a dot chart.  This means that judgements of position along a common scale can be made instead of the less accurate angle judgements.&quot; This statement is based on the empirical investigations of Cleveland and McGill as well as investigations by perceptual psychologists.

==Does a File or Directory exist ?==


Example:

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
   IF Exist(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;) = TRUE THEN
   Label1.Text=&quot;OK i found Bash&quot;
 END IF
   IF Exist(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;) = FALSE THEN
   Label1.Text=&quot;Error Bash is missing&quot;
 END IF
  END


==Get system's root / home folder ?==

Example :

'Created : Cijo Jose
'E-mail  : info.cijo@gmail.com
'Job ID  : Junior Software Engineer

PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()

dir_name as string 

dir_name = system.root    ' Will return root folder 

print dir_name

dir_name = system.home    ' Will return home folder 

print dir_name

END



When you click on your button your gambas program checks for Bash
if Bash is found then Label1 displays &quot;OK i found Bash&quot; if Bash is not found 
then Label1 displays &quot;Error Bash is missing&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cardinal Numbers ==

=== General Rules ===
In Cantonese, numbers can be interpreted as a series of digits. From decimal to ten-thousandfold, each digit has a corresponding character. To read out the number, read the number of the value of the digit followed by the value of the digit. For example, the number ''four-hundred and seventy-nine'' (479) has three digits: ''four hundreds'' (四百, read as sei-bāak), ''seven tens'' (七十, read as chāt-sahp) and ''nine'' (九, read as gáu). The number is written as 四百七十九 and is read as sei-bāak-chāt-sahp-gáu. The word &quot;''and''&quot; in &quot;''four-hundred and seventy-nine''&quot; is omitted.

Any digit in zero followed by a digit which is not zero is replaced by the character 零 (read as lìhng). For example, the number ''one-thousand and one'' (1001) is read as yāt-cin-lìhng-yāt.

The number ''eleven'' (11) is literally ''one-ten'' and ''one'' but the character &quot;''one''&quot; in &quot;''one ten''&quot; is usually omitted. The same case applies to twelve to nineteen.

The number ''two'' sometimes becomes 兩 (read as loeng) rather than 二 (read as yih). Examples include: 
*兩性  loeng-sing ''the two sexes''&lt;br&gt;
*兩文三語 loeng-man-sāam-jyu ''two written languages and three spoken languages''&lt;br&gt;
*一國兩制 yāt-gwok-loeng-zai ''one country two systems''&lt;br&gt;

Generally, ''two'' is 兩 when:
* it is used for counting (e.g. two apples, two people, two houses)
* it precedes units more than or equal to a thousand

''two'' is 二 in:
* certain set expressions (such as idioms)
* numbers less than or equal to a thousand

=== One through Ten===
{{audio|Zero_to_ten_in_Cantonese_Chinese.ogg|Listen to audio}}
*〇 (零) lìhng ''zero'' 0
*一 (壹) yāt ''one'' 1
*二 (貳) yih ''two'' 2
*三 (叁) sāam ''three'' 3
*四 (肆) sei ''four'' 4
*五 (伍) ng ''five'' 5
*六 (陸) luhk ''six'' 6
*七 (柒) chāt ''seven'' 7
*八 (捌) baat ''eight'' 8
*九 (玖) gáu ''nine'' 9
*十 (拾) sahp ''ten'' 10

Parenthesized entries are the complex forms, which are used mainly in notarized, official documents. An exception is zero wherein the complex form is more widely used.

=== Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Etc. ===

*十一 sahp-yāt ''eleven'' 11&lt;br&gt;
*十二 sahp-yih ''twelve'' 12&lt;br&gt;
*十三 sahp-sāam ''thirteen'' 13&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*二十一 yih-sahp-yāt ''twenty-one'' 21&lt;br&gt;
*二十二 yih-sahp-yih ''twenty-two'' 22&lt;br&gt;
*二十三 yih-sahp-sāam ''twenty-three'' 23&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一百 yāt-bāak ''one-hundred'' 100&lt;br&gt;
*一百零八 yāt-bāak-lìhng-baat ''one-hundred and eight'' 108&lt;br&gt;
*一百六十六 yāt-bāak-luhk-sahp-luhk ''one-hundred and sixty-six'' 166&lt;br&gt;
*二百三十 yih-bāak-sāam-sahp ''two-hundred and thirty''&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一千 yāt-cin ''one-thousand'' 1,000&lt;br&gt;
*七千二百一十三 chāt-cin-yih-bāak-yāt-sahp-sāam ''seven thousand two hundred and thirteen'' 7,213&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一萬 yāt-maan ''one myriad'' or ''ten-thousand'' 10,000&lt;br&gt;
*四萬三千 sei-maan-sāam-cin ''forty-three thousand'' 43,000&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;


*十萬 sahp-maan ''one-hundred thousand'' 100,000&lt;br&gt;
*九十六萬八千二百七十四 gáu-sahp-luhk-maan-baat-cin-yih-bāak-chāt-sahp-sei ''nine hundred and sixty-eight thousand two hundred and seventy-four'' 968,274&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一百萬 yāt-bāak-maan ''one million'' 1,000,000&lt;br&gt;
*六百七十八萬二千 luhk-bāak-chāt-sahp-baat-maan-yih-cin ''six-million seven-hundred and eighty-two thousand'' 6,782,000&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

== Ordinal Numbers ==
To show the position of something in a list of items, simply add the word 第 (read as dai) before the number.

*第一 dai-yāt ''the first''&lt;br&gt;
*第十一 dai-sahp-yāt ''the eleventh''&lt;br&gt;
*第四百八十九 dai-sei-bāak-baat-sahp-sahp-gáu ''the 489th''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Ductal Carcinoma in Situ'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Clinical Presentation==
*Ductal carcinoma in situ - by default not metastatic; up to 5% axillary LN+ probably due to undiagnosed invasive focus
*Risk factors same as invasive BCA: FH, reproductive events, EtOH consumption


==Mammography==
*Presenting abnormalities (Tabar, 1999):
**microcalcifications 76%
**asymmetric densities 10%
*Size underestimated by 1-2cm compared to pathology


==Pathology==
*16-24 duct-lobular systems, culminating in collecting duct at the nipple; multiple lateral ductal anastomoses
*Histologically very diverse, no easy way to grade, but typically [http://surgpathcriteria.stanford.edu/breast/dcis/ 3 groups]

===Upstaging to Invasive Disease===
*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 17891441 -- &quot;Sentinel node biopsy is important in mastectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ.&quot; (Dominguez FJ, Ann Surg Oncol. 2008 Jan;15(1):268-73. Epub 2007 Sep 22.)
**Retrospective. 179 patients, mastectomy with SLB for DCIS on intial biopsy. 
**Outcome: Unsuspected invasive cancer in 11%; of these, 20% had SLN+. However, overall SLN+ in 11% (micromets 1%, ITCs 10%), suggesting 10% SLN+ (94% ITCs) in patients with DCIS only. completion ALND in 3 patients, SLNB was the only positive node in all of them
**Conclusion: 11% of DCIS patients had invasive disease; use of SLND allowed them to avoid axillary dissection


==Natural history==
*Considered rare until 1980's, prior to advent of population-wide mammographic screening
*Autopsy series show rates &lt;1% - 13%
*Cumulative lifetime risk: ~0.5%
*Prevalence on screening mammograms: ~20%


'''''Progression of DCIS into invasive cancer:'''''
*Cumulative progression rate after biopsy in 7 studies: 36%. Most occur within 10 years, but some &gt;15 years
*Development of invasive CA (10-year rates): after BCS only ~15%, after BCS+RT ~8%
*'''Nurses' Health Study''', 2005 - PMID 15770688 &amp;mdash; &quot;Outcome of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ untreated after diagnostic biopsy: results from the Nurses' Health Study.&quot; Collins LC et al. Cancer. 2005 May 1;103(9):1778-84. 
**13 pts with DCIS later identified in breast biopsy originally thought benign.  6 pts developed invasive cancer (OR 13.5) and 10 pts developed either an invasive or in-situ lesion (OR was 20.1).

==Mastectomy==
*Locoregional failure rate 4% or less, cancer specific mortality &lt;4%
*No randomized study comparing mastectomy with BCT

===Surgical Margin===
*'''Harvard; 2012''' (1998-2005) -- &quot;Impact of Margin Status on Local Recurrence After Mastectomy for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.&quot; (Childs SK, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Sep 10.)
**Retrospective. 142 pts underwent mastectomy without RT for pure DCIS (without microinvasion). 
***positive margin: 21 (15%). close margin (&lt;= 2 mm): 23 (16%). Deep margin (close 14, positive 6). Superficial margin (close 13, positive 19). 
**Median f/u 7.6 yr. 
**Chest wall recurrence 2/142 (1.4%) -- 1/21 (4.8%) for positive margins, 1/23 (4.3%) for close margins, 0/98 for negative margins.
**Conclusion: &quot;Mastectomy for pure DCIS resulted in a low rate of local or distant recurrences. Even with positive or close mastectomy margins, the rates of chest wall recurrences were so low that PMRT is likely not warranted.&quot;

*'''UC San Francisco; 2010''' (1985-2005) PMID 20646871 -- &quot;Is Radiation Indicated in Patients With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and Close or Positive Mastectomy Margins?&quot; (Chan LW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Jun 18. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 193 patients underwent mastectomy. DCIS median size 4.5 cm. Surgical margin: 55 close SM, 4 SM+. Median F/U 8 years
**Outcome: Chest wall recurrence 1/59 close/positive SM (patient had 4 cm, G3 DCIS, SM 5 mm, skin-sparing mastectomy). 
**Conclusion: Risk of chest wall recurrence low for patients with margin &lt;5 mm; not enough cases with positive margin

*'''Southern California Permanente; 2008''' (1994-2002) PMID 18954711 -- &quot;Close or positive margins after mastectomy for DCIS: pattern of relapse and potential indications for radiotherapy.&quot; (Rashtian A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Nov 15;72(4):1016-20.)
**Retrospective. 80 patients, DCIS treated with mastectomy without RT, with margins &lt;10 mm. SM &amp;le;2 in 39%, SM 2.1-10 61%. Median F/U 5 years
**Outcome: Local recurrence 7%; if SM &amp;le; 2 mm 16% vs SM &gt;2 mm 2% (SS). Of the 6 patients with LR, 5 had G3 DCIS and/or comedonecrosis. All were &lt;60 years
**Conclusion: Greater than expected local recurrence in patients with &lt;2 mm margin, particularly if they have high grade disease or comedonecrosis

*'''Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle; 2007''' (1990-2006) &lt;u&gt;ASTRO Abstract&lt;/u&gt; -- &quot;The Role of Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Mastectomy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, Breast&quot; (Eulau SM, Abstract 2043, 2007)
**Retrospective. 16 patients, mastectomy for DCIS, adjuvant RT. Average DCIS size 6.8 cm, positive or &amp;le; 1mm SM 7 patients, 1 mm SM 7 patients, &amp;ge; 2 mm 2 patients (lesion size 10 and 15 cm). RT dose average 55.8 Gy (45 - 66.4). Median F/U 4.7 years
**Outcome: LC 100%, DFS 100%, OS 100%
**Toxicity: No lymphedema, decreased shoulder ROM 12%, chronic mild pain 12%. In 2 immediate reconstructions, both failed. In 2 delayed reconstruction, neither failed.
**Conclusion: Excellent local control with RT despite close/positive margins and large lesions

*'''Emory; 2007''' PMID 17481544 -- &quot;Local recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ after skin-sparing mastectomy.&quot; (Carlson GW, J Am Coll Surg. 2007 May;204(5):1074-8; discussion 1078-80.)
**Retrospective. 223 patients, DCIS treated with skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. No adjuvant RT. Mean F/U 6.9 years
**Outcome: local recurrence 3.3%, regional recurrence 0.9%, distant recurrence 0.9%. If SM &lt;1mm, local recurrence 10%. High grade also influenced LR
**Conclusion: LR after skin-sparing mastectomy similar to total mastectomy. Re-excision of close SM should be performed and adjuvant RT should be considered


==Wide excision alone==
*'''ECOG E-5194''', 2009 (1997-2002) - PMID 19826126 &quot;Local Excision Alone Without Irradiation for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast: A Trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.&quot; (Hughes LL, J Clin Oncol. published online ahead of print Oct 13 2009.)
**Prospective, non-randomized. 670 pts. Low or intermediate grade DCIS 2.5 cm or less, or high grade DCIS 1 cm or less; surgical margins 3 mm or greater; no residual calcifications on postoperative mammography. Presence of comedo necrosis was categorized in the high grade group. Tamoxifen was allowed in those pts enrolled after 2000 (about 30% of pts received tamoxifen). Pathologic assessment was rigorous (sequential sectioning and complete embedding).
**Median f/u 6.2 yrs(low-int;n=565) and 6.7 yrs(high grade;n=105). Median age 60; median tumor sizes 6mm (low/int grade) and 5mm (high grade). 5-yr ipsilateral breast events 6.1% (low/int) and 15.3% (high); 7-yr rate 10.5% (low/int) and 18.0% (high).
**Conclusion: &quot;Rigorously evaluated and selected patients with low- to intermediate-grade DCIS with margins 3 mm or wider had an acceptably low rate of ipsilateral breast events at 5 years after excision without irradiation. Patients with high-grade lesions had a much higher rate, suggesting that excision alone is inadequate treatment.&quot;
**Comment: pathologic assessment included &quot;complete sequential tissue processing&quot;. Their results may not be extrapolated to other centers using less rigorous pathologic assessment.
** 10 year update ECOG 5194 (Solin SABCS 2012):  10 yr IBTR is is ~ 15% in both groups.


*'''Harvard''', 2006 (1995-2002) - PMID 16461781 &quot;Prospective study of wide excision alone for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.&quot; Wong JS et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar 1;24(7):1031-6. 
**Prospective, non-randomized. 158 pts. Pts with DCIS size &lt;= 2.5 cm, grade 1-2. Necrosis allowed. Required wide excision with margins &gt;= 1 cm. Tamoxifen not allowed.
**Median f/u 40 mos. LR was 2.4%/yr, 5-yr rate of 12%. 69% of recurrences were DCIS and 31% were invasive cancer. 
**Conclusion: substantial risk of LRR with WLE without RT.
--8yr update LR 15.6%

===Surgical Margin===
*'''EBCTCG; 2010''' (PMID 20956824)
**10-year IBTR (lumpectomy + RT): SM- 12% vs SM+ 24%
**10-year IBTR (lumpectomy alone): SM- 26% vs SM+ 44%
*NSABP: 14 year IBTR (lumpectomy + RT): SM- 13% vs. SM+ 23%

**Meta-analysis. 4,660 patients, 22 trials evaluating BCS and RT.  
**Outcome: median time to IBTR 5 years. Recurrence 64% less if negative SM vs positive SM (OR 0.4, SS, using trial definition of negative margin, which ranged from no cells at ink to 10 mm). Margin thresholds for recurrence, &amp;ge; 5-mm OR 1.0 vs 2-mm OR 1.5 (NS) vs 1-mm OR 2.9 (SS) vs no cells on ink OR 2.6 (SS). 
**Conclusion: Negative surgical margins should be obtained; 2mm margin a good cut-off

**Retrospective. 2 health systems: Monroe County, New York and Henry Ford Health System, Michigan. 994 women with DCIS, 50 treating surgeons. Evaluated surgical margin and treatments (BCS alone, BCS + RT, mastectomy), stratified by surgeon. Final SM positive 4.6%, close (&amp;le; 2mm) 20.0%, negative 75.4%. Median F/U 5 years
**Outcome: 5-year IBTR all ~6%, SM+ ~19%, SM close ~9%, SM negative 4% (SS). Surgeon performance accounted for 15-35% of 5-year IBTR and 13-30% of 10-year IBTR. 5-year DFS after mastectomy (99.3%), lumpectomy + RT (94.5%), and lumpectomy without RT (82.4%) significantly different by surgeon. IBTR risk: BCS no RT SM- 1.0; RT 0.25, BCS SM+ 3.4, SM close 1.4, mastectomy SM- 0.03, mastectomy SM close 0.4, mastectomy SM+ 2.0
**Surgeon impact: If surgeon effect were improved to mean, IBTR reduction by 15%; if median, IBTR reduction by 22%, and if at 75th percentile, IBTR reduction by 31%
**Conclusion: Positive SM large impact on IBTR, even for mastectomy and BCS with RT. Extent of surgeon variation and its contribution to long-term outcomes are troubling

**Retrospective. 194 patients, DCIS, excision alone or excision + RT
**Outcome: IBTR 10-year 22%, 15-years 29%. By SM, &lt;1mm 28% vs 1-9 mm 21% vs &amp;ge; 10 mm 19%. RT reduced IBTR by 62% (SS), if &lt;1mm by 83% vs 1-9 mm by 70% vs &amp;ge; 10mm by 24% (NS). High volume disease near margin (margin width, number of involved ducts at closest margin) associated with increased risk of IBTR in no RT group, and greater proportional benefit of RT in RT group
**Conclusion: Effect of RT on IBTR influenced by disease volume near margin

Epub 2009 Apr 20.)
**Retrospective. 208 women, DCIS, BCT with close (&lt;2 mm) or involved margins. Re-excision 29% or RT + boost 71%. Median RT dose 67 Gy. Median F/U 7.4 years
**Outcome: On re-excision, 56% residual DCIS and 6% residual IDC. 7-year LRF if re-excision 9.6% vs RT + boost 9.3% (NS)
**Conclusion: In selected patients, re-excision may be avoided by increasing RT dose to tumor bed to at least 66 Gy

**Retrospective analysis. 1569/1799 patients analyzed, 692 (44%) received optional boost. Majority boost 10 Gy (1-20 Gy) after 50 Gy whole breast. Mean F/U 14 yrs
**Outcome: IBTR SM- 13% vs. SM+ 23% (SS). By margin status, if SM- boost 13% vs no boost 13% (NS), if SM+ boost 21% vs. no boost 26% (NS). On multivariate analysis, boost not significant predictor for recurrence; while age, SM status, comedo necrosis were significant predictors  
**Conclusion: Surgical margin status significant predictor for recurrence

==BCS +/- RT==
*10-year local recurrence: 25-30% BCS alone vs. ~15% BCS + RT (~50% reduction)
**Invasive recurrence: ~16% vs. ~8% (~50% reduction)
**Non-invasive ~15% vs. ~8% (40-50% reduction)
*Based on NSABP B-17 data, annual IBTR recurrence rate is ~4% per year with surgery alone (2% invasive and 2% noninvasive); adjuvant RT decreases it to ~2% per year
*Based on 3 randomized trials (NSABP B-17, EORTC 10853, and UKCCCR), all subgroups (as analyzed by multivariate analysis looking at individual variables) benefit from RT. These data have not been analyzed for subgroups defined by several variables (such as &lt;40 and intermediate grade and large size). 
*Some retrospectively-defined prognostic groups (such as Van Nuys, see Prognosis section below) suggest there are discrete patient groups that may have different outcomes, and may benefit from different treatments:
**&quot;Low risk&quot; patients - RT does not offer much if any additional benefit over BCS alone. These patients could potentially be treated with BCS alone
**&quot;High risk&quot; patients - while RT does offer significant benefit, the rate of recurrence is still unacceptably high. These patients should probably be treated with mastectomy
**In clinical practice in US, ~30% DCIS patients are treated with BCS alone, ~40% are treated with BCS+RT, and ~30% are treated with mastectomy. These rates vary widely with geography
**Unfortunately, there are no commonly accepted guidelines to help stratify patients

***Outcome: Breast events: OBS 22% vs. TAM alone 18% vs. RT alone 8% vs. TAM+RT 6%. Too few deaths for meaningful analysis.
***RT: benefit for invasive IBTR (3% vs. 6%, HR 0.45), and benefit for ipsilateral DCIS (3% vs. 7%, HR 0.36), no impact on contralateral events. New breast events reduced 16% to 7% (SS)

**Randomized. 1701 women with DCIS. 2x2 factorial (921 randomized to fully 2x2, the remaineder one way randomization to +/- RT or +/- TAM): BCS followed by 1) observation, 2) RT alone, 3) tamoxifen alone, or 4) RT + Tamoxifen. RT to 50 Gy, TAM 20mg qd x5 years
**'''5-years; 2003''' PMID 12867108 -- &quot;Radiotherapy and tamoxifen in women with completely excised ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand: randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Houghton J, Lancet. 2003 Jul 12;362(9378):95-102.). Mean F/U 4.4 years
***Outcome: Breast events: OBS 22% vs. TAM alone 18% vs. RT alone 8% vs. TAM+RT 6%. Too few deaths for meaningful analysis.
***RT: benefit for invasive IBTR (3% vs. 6%, HR 0.45), and benefit for ipsilateral DCIS (3% vs. 7%, HR 0.36), no impact on contralateral events. New breast events reduced 16% to 7% (SS)
***Tamoxifen randomization: no impact on invasive IBTR (7% vs. 7%), no impact on ipsilateral DCIS (7% vs. 10%), benefit for bilateral DCIS (7% vs 11%, HR 0.68)
***Subgoup analysis: No synergy between tamoxifen and RT. No benefit of tamoxifen differs from B-24 trial: authors suggest it may be due to differences in the patient population.  In B-24 33.5% of patients were under 50 compared to only 9.5% in the UK/ANZ trial
***Conclusion: RT can be recommended for DCIS, there is little evidence to recommend tamoxifen

==Multi-focal DCIS==
*'''Toronto; 2007''' (1982-2000) PMID 17984188 -- &quot;Significance of multifocality in ductal carcinoma in situ: outcomes of women treated with breast-conserving therapy.&quot; (Rakovitch E, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 10;25(35):5591-6. Epub 2007 Nov 5.)
**Retrospective. 615 cases of DCIS (multifocal n=260, unifocal n=314, unreported n=31), treated with BCS alone (50%) or BCS+RT (50%); most RT 50/25, some 40/16
**Outcome: local recurrence BCS alone 21% (50% invasive) vs. BCS+RT 9% (24% invasive); 10-year LRFR BCS alone 72% vs. BCS+RT 82%. Median time-to-recurrence BCS alone 4.3 years vs. BCS+RT 3.0 years
**Multifocality: 10-year LRFR multifocal 59% vs. unifocal 80% (SS); but if treated with BCS+RT, no difference (80% vs. 87%, NS)
**Conclusion: Multifocality significant predictor of local recurrence if BCS only; no difference if adjuvant RT used


==Prognosis==
'''NCCN Guidelines'''
*RT for all patients after BCS, unless DCIS diameter is &lt;0.5 cm
*Boost recommended for everyone getting RT

**949 pts with DCIS, 604 excision alone, 345 excision + RT. No hormonal therapy. Used the updated USC / Van Nuys scoring system (size, margin, DCIS classification, age) which gives scores 4-12. Goal is to update the treatment recommendations to achieve a LR risk of &lt;20% at 12 yrs.
**Outcomes: Median f/u 86 months (7.1 yrs). 165 local recurrences (103 - excision alone, 62 - RT). 
***12-yr local recurrence: score 4-6, &lt;= 6% (NS difference for RT vs no RT); score 10-12, &gt;= 40% (for excision + RT); 
**Original treatment recommendations: excision alone for those who score 4-6; RT for those who score 7-9; mastectomy for those who score 10-12.
**New treatment recommendations: to achieve a LR risk of &lt;20% at 12 yrs.

N Engl J Med. 1999 May 13;340(19):1455-61.
**Retrospective. 469 pts. Pts treated until 1989 received post-op RT and those treated after 1989 did not. RT was 40-50 Gy to whole breast + 16-20 Gy boost. Tumors were assessed for histologic subtype, nuclear grade, comedonecrosis, maximal diameter, and margin width. Margins were classified as close or involved (&lt;1 mm), intermediate (1 to &lt;10 mm), or wide. 
**RT decreased the recurrence rate for close or involved margins; for intermediate or wide margins, was not statistically different. 
**Conclusion: RT is not necessary for margins &gt; 10 mm.

**Came up with Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI). Combines tumor size, margin width, histologic classification. Score 1-3 for each to arrive at a total score of 3-9.
**Evaluated 333 pts treated with excision alone or excision + RT. 
**For pts with VNPI score of 3-4, excellent recurrence free survival (100% vs 97%) whether or not RT was used. For VNPI scores of 5-7, there was a 17% decrease (85% vs 68%) in RFS when RT was used. For score of 8-9, recurrence rate &gt; 60% despite RT. 
**Conclusion: recommend excision alone for score of 3-4, excision + RT for score of 5-7, and mastectomy for 8-9.

*[[Cookbook:Rosemary|Rosemary]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]]
*[[Cookbook:Noodle|Rice noodles]]
*red [[Cookbook:Chile|chile]]
*[[Cookbook:Shallot|Shallots]]

==Procedure==
#Cook onion in olive oil until it is transparent.
#Add chopped garlic.
#Toss in placenta.
#Cook quickly.
#Add a dash of fresh rosemary and 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of cumin.
#Add a pinch of salt and ground pepper to taste.
#Place on a bed of rice noodles and garnish with thin slices of red capsicum and shallots.

== Which Programming Language Should I Use? ==
Shouldn't there actually be some information on WHICH programming languages are good for competitions in this section, rather than just a very quick review of the differences between programming for an organisation and programming for a competition? [[User:24.225.233.40|24.225.233.40]] 17:09, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== The Word &quot;Stupid&quot; ==

The statement, &quot;Why would they pay so much for a stupid programming contest?&quot; is ambiguous. &quot;Stupid&quot; in this context means too many possible things. Perhaps, &quot;Why would they pay so much for a simple programming contest?&quot;, or even better, &quot;Why would they pay so much for a programming contest?&quot;

== Scope of this book? ==

What do people feel is the correct scope for this book? It was nominated for deletion and the consensus was that it could be left as a stub that could grow larger, but it's not clear to me exactly what content people foresee being added. Is there any utility to providing details about the various programming competitions, beyond simply linking to the web pages of the competitions? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 20:10, 9 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gaining the support of your neighbors is crucial to residential beekeepers. There are a variety of ways to gain their support, or at least acceptance, for your activities. First, do some subtle checking amongst your neighbors beforehand to see if any are allergic to bee-stings.  If any are allergic, you may want to reconsider your hobby, locating your bees as far from their home as possible, or purchasing an EpiPen. Education on honeybees may also help alleviate your neighbors concerns.  Furthermore, small gifts from your beehive such as products made from wax or the ever popular honey, can work towards calming your neighbors.

Back to [[PHP Programming|PHP]]

As you should have already learned in previous sections of this book.  PHP is more than just a web server language.  It can be used to create GUI applications, shell like scripts, and even daemons, among other things.  This chapter focuses on using PHP to create GUI applications using PHP-GTK.


== What is PHP-GTK ==
PHP-GTK is a GTK+ and GNOME language binding for PHP.  That's just a fancy way of saying that PHP-GTK makes it so that GNOME and GTK+ programs can be written using PHP.

You have to have PHP-CLI and GTK installed on your box.

For questions, search or browse this [http://www.nabble.com/Php---GTK-f170.html PHP GTK Forum] hosted by [http://www.nabble.com Nabble].

== Example PHP-GTK Program ==
Below is a very simple PHP-GTK program.  It just creates a window that doesn't do anything.  In fact, as you'll find out if you run it, this window won't even close if you try to ''close it'' using the normal means.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $window = new GtkWindow();
  $window-&gt;show_all();
  gtk::main();
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a little more complex than your usual ''Hello World program''.  But we'll go through it step by step.

The first line:
        $window = new GtkWindow();
creates a new GTK+ window.  One thing to note about GTK+ and GNOME programming is that when you create a window it does not automatically get displayed.  (That's what the next line does.)

The next line:
        $window-&gt;show_all();
displays the newly created window.

The last line:
        gtk::main();
is where all the magic happens with GTK+.  For now, just take my word for it that you need to call this to make you GTK+ program ''run''.

== External Links ==
*[http://www.nabble.com/Php---GTK-f170.html PHP GTK Forum] lots of GTK related topics

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Your Japanese wikibook edits==
Hey, I noticed you've been making some additions to the Japanese wikibook. Looks good. Next time you make an edit you should try to remember to use the &quot;Show preview&quot; button instead of &quot;Save page&quot;. This gives you a chance to review your changes before submitting them and it helps prevent clogging up the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese:JLPT:Verb_Types&amp;action=history page history] pages. It also makes it much easier to track what changes have been made, since we only have to view one diff instead of 15. Anyway, thanks for the edits! We hope to see more :) - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 03:04, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ZZT-OOP''' is a primitive object-oriented scripting language used by the DOS game creation system ''ZZT''. The language was created by Tim Sweeney of Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games).

== History of ''ZZT'' ==

''ZZT'' was made in 1991. It was Epic's first release; although it was not terribly successful, it did gain some attention. After version 3.2 (the version considered to be the &quot;official&quot; ''ZZT''), Tim Sweeney discontinued development, moving on to other projects, such as ''Jill of the Jungle''. A sequel to ''ZZT'' with more advanced features was made, called ''Super ZZT'', but it never had the success of its predecessor. The source code for the original was lost, putting a stop to the development of any further versions.

In 1997, Epic decided to release ''ZZT'' and the four games that came with it as freeware, due to the program's being severely outdated in both graphics and sound. Despite its age, ''ZZT'' continues to draw a following, and an online community based around it still exists today. Many attempts have been made in recent years to improve the program, ranging from hacking the ''ZZT'' executable itself to writing emulators that work like ''ZZT'', except with a few new features. ''ZZT'' has even inspired various other fan-created game creation systems, such as ''ZIG'' and ''MegaZeux''. However, the original ''ZZT 3.2'' continues to be the most widely used.

== Overview of ''ZZT'' ==

The ZZT-OOP language is an integrated part of ''ZZT''; as a result, in order to write a program in ZZT-OOP, you must have some familiarity with ''ZZT''. ''ZZT'' is not playable by itself; it is an interpreter through which ''ZZT'' games can be played. These games, called ''worlds'', usually have all their code contained in one file with a &lt;tt&gt;.ZZT&lt;/tt&gt; extention.

=== World Structure ===

The space in each world is divided into segments called ''boards''. The display size of a board is fixed in size, and the player can only view one board at a time. However, these boards can be linked together to create the illusion of a continuous landscape. To clarify this concept, suppose that you were designing some dungeons in ''ZZT''. The entrance to the dungeons would be on one board. The entrance on this board might link to a second board that contained the first rooms of the dungeons and a staircase. The stairs would link to a third board, which would contain part of the underground dungeons. This board might link to yet other boards that contained adjacent dungeon rooms, and so on. Note that scale is not always kept consistent; for example, each dungeon board might only contain a few rooms, while the board containing the dungeon entrance could be made into a zoomed-out map of everything else in the area. When a player leaves the board he or she is on, the board disappears from view, replaced by the board that he or she has moved to.

Every board in a world file is playable with the exception of the first board in the file. This board is called the ''Title Screen'' because it is the first board that the user sees when he or she loads your game. Because the player cannot actually play it, the Title Screen is usually used as a splash screen for the game; however, ZZT-OOP code will still run, which allows simple animation and even introductory cutscenes to be displayed.

=== Board Structure ===

The terrain on each board is based on a 60 by 25 grid of ''tiles''. Each tile is a block on the screen that has a certain appearance and properties. Because ''ZZT'' runs in text mode, each tile is character sized, takes the appearance of one of the 256 ASCII characters, and has both a foreground and background color. Terrain limits the movement abilities of the player, but it is often used just to create an interesting backdrop. Although the word &quot;terrain&quot; implies an outdoor setting, it is also used for constructing indoor features, such as walls. The terrain can range from a simplistic box that represents a room to a more decorative, organic board; using different colors of terrain, it is even possible to draw simple pictures.

Tiles are not limited to representing terrain; various items and creatures can also be put onto boards as well. A detailed list of all tile types is beyond the purposes of this introduction; however, one of the most useful tile types will be mentioned here; the ''object''. Objects are important because, unlike most of the other tile types, object tiles can contain ZZT-OOP programs. This allows the world designer to customize object behavior. For example, say you wanted to fill a dungeon full of monsters, but you did not want to use ''ZZT'''s built-in enemies. After designing the dungeon and laying down the proper terrain, you would add several objects to the board. You would then write a ZZT-OOP program that would instruct them on how to attack the player; how to write such programs is the subject of this book.

== Reasons to Learn ZZT-OOP ==

There are several reasons for learning ZZT-OOP:

* ZZT-OOP is necessary for writing an original ''ZZT'' game. Although it is possible to make ''ZZT'' games without knowing ZZT-OOP, one is restricted to only using the preprogrammed items and enemies.

* ZZT-OOP is a good introductory programming language. Although you couldn't turn programming in ZZT-OOP into a career, it is a fun and easy way to learn the basics of programming.

* ZZT-OOP (and ''ZZT'') is a fun hobby. Writing games for ''ZZT'' is a nice medium for expressing your creative self, and it's not hard to go online and find somebody who will play your games.

* ZZT-OOP is restrictive, but in a fun way. Because the language was only meant for simple adventure games, code that would be easy in other languages becomes a challenge in ZZT-OOP. However, some of us live for such challenges, and although it won't get you a date or a job, being able to code complex things - a fractal generation program, for example - using only an archaic game creation system is rather impressive.

      <comment>/* Origin of Chinese characters */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Origin of Chinese characters==
You might wonder why you have to bother with the origin of Chinese characters if you are merely learning the Chinese written language. However, Chinese characters are less like most Western languages, where words are formed by spelling, and pronunciations can easily be read from the letters. However the meaning and sound of some Chinese characters can be guessed from their similarity to other characters once you begin to understand how the system works. Most Chinese characters are composed from about 200 basic radicals put together to make a single character. The following are some examples:&lt;br&gt;
'''人'''(human)&lt;br&gt;
'''男'''(male)&lt;br&gt;
'''女'''(female)&lt;br&gt;
'''上'''(up,above)&lt;br&gt;
'''下'''(down,below)&lt;br&gt;
'''河'''(river,in ancient times it refers particularly the Yellow River)&lt;br&gt;
'''家'''(home)&lt;br&gt;
'''花'''(flower)&lt;br&gt;
So, you can see, even the most useful words are as complicated as puzzles.

However, the Chinese characters can be systematic and easier to understand if you know ''why'' they will be written like that. That brings you back to the origin of Chinese characters, which is the only link and classification between Chinese characters.

The Chinese characters are actually originated from six different origins. They are 象形(pictograms),指事(simple indicatives),會意(compound indicatives),形聲(phono-semantic compounds)(,轉注(derived characters) and 假借(borrowed characters).
{{wikipedia|Chinese character classification}}
===象形 (xiàng xíng, ''Pictograms'') ===
Pictograms is the oldest origin of Chinese characters. Words originated from pictograms are actually simple pictures of the objects. For example, 人(man) is a simple picture of a man's side-view.

[[Image:人.gif]]

Another example is the word 女(female), which is a simple picture of a woman sitting in the traditional Chinese posture in ancient times:

[[Image:女.gif]]

So, as you can see, understanding these characters is not that difficult, once you know their origin, you can remember it quite well. Try to imagine the picture of a man's side-view if you forgot how to write 人. The same goes for the other characters with this origin.

===指事 (zhǐ shì, Simple indicatives)===
Ancient Chinese people can easily draw things out to create words. But how about abstract ideas like &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;? That explains one weakness of pictograms: you can only express things that have an actual form. This is where simple indicatives come in handy. Words originated from simple indicatives usually consist of two parts: a picture just like pictograms, and an indicator which indicates the abstract meaning applied on that picture. The character 上(up,above) is an example which realizes the abstract meaning of &quot;above&quot; to &quot;things above the ground&quot;. Look at the explanations below:

[[Image:上.gif]]

The same goes for the word 下(down,below):

[[Image:下.gif]]

Be careful that these two words don't mean only ''things above/below the ground''. They &quot;use the ground as an example&quot;, thus meaning &quot;up/above&quot; and &quot;down/below&quot; respectively.

===會意 (huì yì, Compound indicatives)===
Compound indicatives is another type of Chinese characters which combines two or more characters to express a certain meaning.

The character 男(male) is a typical example. It consists of the character 田 and 力. 田 means farm or field; and 力 means force. By combining the meaning of 田 and 力, we can draw the meaning of this word: a person working (indicated by 力, force) in the farms(田), which matches exactly as male - they are the working labour in ancient times, and the work required in ancient times was mostly farming. 

Another example is 家(home). It consists of a 宀(this is not a character, just a part of the word, representing the roof of the house - imagine it), and a 豕(pig). Keeping pigs in the home is an important matter of ancient Chinese people, as it provides them food and milk, in ancient times where they rely on farming. This way we can draw the meaning of this word: the place(宀) where we keep pigs(豕).

===形聲 (xíng shēng, Phono-semantic compounds)===
If all Chinese characters originated from the above three methods, then it would be extremely hard to memorize the characters, as each of them would be completely different in shape. Fortunately, over 90% of the Chinese character originated from phono-semantic compounds, which is far more systematic. Phono-semantic compounds characters consists of two parts: 形符 (the &quot;semantic&quot; element), indicating the general meaning of that character; and 聲符 (the &quot;phonetic&quot; element), indicating the pronunciation of that character. Look at the remaining two characters from the above example:

河(river) consists of 氵and 可. 氵is the semantic element, and it itself means &quot;water&quot;, so, we can deduce that the character 河 is related with water. 可 is the phonetic element, and it itself means &quot;can&quot; (modal verb), but we don't have to mind that. The pronunciation of 河 and 可 are ho&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and ho&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Cantonese respectively; and hé and kĕ in Mandarin. So, you can see, their pronunciations are similar. So, to understand this word, we can first quickly recall its meaning from the sematic element, 氵, that it is related to water. That helps a lot to recall your memory about its meaning: river. The next part is the pronunciation. The phonetic element, 可, gives you a general idea about how it should sound like. Usually the sound will not be the same, but at least in most cases the phonetic elements gives you a general idea of the rhyme of the word: for 河, &quot;o&quot; in Cantonese and &quot;e&quot; in Mandarin. That should help you recall the pronunciation of the word.

The other example, 花(flower), works the same way. Note that this time the characters is divided vertically into two parts, unlike 河, which is horizontally divided. Yet this is not a problem. We can still find the semantic element, 艹, which means &quot;grass&quot;, and is used to represent plants. The phonetic element is 化, which is pronounced fa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Cantonese, and huà in Mandarin. Comparing to that of 花, which is fa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Cantonese and huā in Mandarin respectively, we can see the same similarities. Thus we can know the meaning of 花, flower, and the pronunciation easily.

Many learners could find it hard to learn Chinese because everything is memorizing. But by this method we can simplify the problem a lot. Remember, over 90% of the Chinese characters originate from phono-sematic compounds.

===轉注 (zhuǎn zhù, Derived characters), 假借 (jiǎ jiè, Borrowed characters)===
These two are not origin of characters, but about the way ancient Chinese use characters.

====Derived characters)====
Derived characters refers to pairs of words that share the same etymological root, usually with similar (or same) meaning in the very first, yet is now used to denote different meanings.

The characters 老 lǎo (old) and 考 kǎo (a test) is a pair of derived characters, both originating from a common etymological root, and both meant &quot;old&quot; in the very first. Yet now a part of each character is changed to express different meanings. The pronunciations has also changed for the pair.

====Borrowed characters====
Borrowed characters refers to characters that was &quot;borrowed&quot; to express a new meaning differing from the original one. This is usually due to the few number of characters in ancient China. When people had new ideas to express, yet cannot find a corresponding word, they might just use an exisiting one to express the new idea. As for the original meaning, sometimes it was expressed in the same character along with the borrowed meaning, and sometimes a new character was created to substitute it.

The character 自 (self) was originally a pictogram of the nose, thus denotes the meaning &quot;nose&quot;. However, it was later borrowed to express the meaning of &quot;self&quot;. Nowadays this character retain only the new meaning &quot;self&quot;. As a side note, the character 鼻 (nose) was created later on to express the meaning &quot;nose&quot;.

Welcome to the wikibook course on written Chinese. This course aims at teaching Chinese for all dialects. The Chinese spoken language is extremely diverse. It can be mainly divided into [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese]], not mentioning the diverse dialects. The map on the right can give you an idea of the diversity of the Chinese spoken language. Therefore, this course aims at the written form of Chinese, which is universal in most parts of China. You can pick up different pronunciations of the language in the corresponding dialect you target to learn.

==Pronunciation/讀音/读音==
The difference between the written and spoken language in Chinese differs even more in regions. The official Mandarin, spoken all throughout mainland China (put aside the slight differences in dialects for now), is rather simple: you speak what you write. It is just like in English: you speak what you write in passages or books, etc. In English even the spoken abbreviations (I'm, it's, etc) can be written down half-formally. This is the case in Mandarin.

The spoken language in other dialects, especially those in Southern China, are however more complicated. The written language can, of course, be spoken as usual as you do when reading aloud an English passage; however the language used in everyday lives are different from the written forms. Their spoken language features many alterations of the words, not to mention the different pronunciations of most of the Chinese words from the Mandarin. Although the spoken language can be written down, it is clearly regarded as informal (save for those books that are especially targetted for spoken-language readers).

For beginners and those who wish to use Chinese as a mean of communication throughout China, Mandarin is surely your choice (the only exceptions are some of the Southern provinces, most notably the cities of Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou, where people use Cantonese for everyday communications). However, for those who wish to study the Chinese culture or the language in depth, it is recommended that you learn Cantonese, Min Nan or Hakka. Mandarin is a language based on the original northern dialects recently half-invented in order to unify the spoken language used throughout China. Because the northern part of China has been under the influence of many other tribes, such as the Mongols, Huns, etc, which actually ruled the northern people and forced their culture into the Chinese people's lives, many alterations to the original Chinese language can be observed.

In contrast, the southern part of China has managed to retain the features of the original language (for example, 食 - eat, is the word used in spoken Cantonese and Hakka, yet it should be replaced by the Mandarin 吃 in all written forms. However, 食 is the original word used by ancient Chinese, and is the word featured throughout the developing years). So for investigators, scholars, or other who want to study the language in depth, Cantonese is recommended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scope of the text==
This Cantonese Basic Course is a course in spoken Cantonese. It uses all the basic grammatical structures of the language and a vocabulary of approximately 950 words. The subject matter of the course deals with daily life in Hong Kong. The course was designed to be taught in an intensive language program of 25-30 class hours a week. Students are expected to spend additional time outside of class listening to tapes of the lesson. There are 30 lessons in the course, and the rate of progress in an intensive class is expected to be approximately 2 lessons per week, including time for review and testing. Each lesson contains five sections:
#A basic conversation to be memorized;
#Notes;
#Pattern Drills, structural drills of the type in which the teacher's cue is the stimulus for the students' response;
#Conversation for Listening, a listening comprehension section; and
#Say it in Cantonese, English to Cantonese practice, much of it in conversational question-answer form, in which students activate what they have learned in the lesson.
The early lessons in addition contain explanation and practice drills on pronunciation points, and some classroom phrases for the students to learn to respond to when used by the teacher.

==Method of Instruction==
Ideally, but perhaps not typically, instruction is by a team consisting of a native speaking Cantonese as instructor and a native speaking American as linguist, with the instructor teaching by voicing the Cantonese sentences of the text for the students to imitate and the linguist giving explanations in English when required.  A good 80-90% of class time will then be spent with the native speaking instructor drilling the students in recitations, during which time the language in use is entirely Cantonese.  Students will read the notes of each lesson outside of class, and questions they have on the text will be answered in English by the linguist during periods set aside for that purpose.  Questions in English are not asked during drill sessions with the instructor.  Psychologically this establishes the habit of using only Cantonese in classes with the instructor. Class time is concentrated on learning the language by imitation, repetition, and transformation, according to spoken cues. The instructor speaks at natural speed, and the students learn to comprehend and speak at the same natural speed. If there is no linguist to explain students' questions, special periods are set aside for students to ask questions of the instructor. It is recommended that the rhythm of the drills not be interrupted by questions in English.

==Pace==
Although the course is projected as a 16 week course if studied on an intensive program, the time plan is to be viewed as a rough guide only.  The number of students in the class, their language learning aptitude, their amount of previous experience with related languages, the amount of time available for outside study, the excellence of the teacher--all these are variable factors which could affect the pace of learning.

An earlier version of the course was tested out on a pilot class of five students during the summer of 1967, and the proposed pace of two lessons a week seemed about right.  However the students in that course had been selected on the basis of roughly the same language aptitude score on the Modern Language Aptitude Test, and they had all previously studied Mandarin Chinese, a closely related language. Also, the present version incorporates pronunciation practices which the earlier version did not have, and additional Conversations for Listening and Say It in Cantonese sections.

It is therefore suggested that the teacher rely on his own judgment in regard to the pace of the lessons, rather than follow a set pace rigidly.  The text has been devised so that the crucial grammatical structures are covered in the first 26 lessons.  By covering the first 26 lessons well, students will gain a firm structural control of the spoken language.  We firmly feel that confident mastery of the first 26 lessons is preferable to hesitant control of the entire text, if a choice must be made between the two.  The rule of thumb should be that before going on to a new lesson students should be able to recite the old lesson's Basic Conversation fluently and with expression and should be able to do the Pattern Drills without looking at the book and without marked hesitation.

==Objectives of the course==
The objectives of the course are to teach students to speak Standard Cantonese in the locales where Cantonese is spoken, to speak it fluently and grammatically, with acceptable pronunciation, within the scope of topics of daily life. The course was not designed to lay the groundwork for learning the written language. At the end of the course students will be able to buy things; talk on the telephone; ask and give directions; handle money; discuss events past, present, and future; make comparisons; talk about themselves and their families; tell time; order simple meals; talk with the landlord, doctor, servant, bellboy, cabdriver, waiter, sales-clerk; discuss what, when, where, why, who, how, how much. They will not be able to discuss politics or their jobs or other topics of a specialized nature.

==Reliability of the material==
All the conversations and drills in this book were written by native Cantonese speakers working under the direction of an American linguist who specified which grammatical points to cover and what situations were required. The design of the text—--what to cover, what sequence to use in introducing new material, what limits to set on vocabulary, the write-ups of structure notes, types and layouts of pattern drills, and the contents of the English-to-Chinese translation sections, were done by the American linguist. 

What we have done to handle the problem of limited structures and vocabulary is to plan the lessons so that certain topics and forms don't come up until rather late in the course. The words 'yesterday,' 'today,' and 'tomorrow,' for example, don't occur until Lesson 16. Meanwhile the student has built up the grammatical structure and vocabulary to talk fluently on some subjects which don't involve these expressions and the complexities of verb structures that are involved with time-related sentences.  For this reason the present text is not appropriate for use of students whose needs are for just a few phrases of Cantonese--it takes too long from that point of view to get to some of the phrases which a tourist, for example, wants to use right away.  But the student who can study hard on an intensive program for H months and cover at least 26 of the 30 lessons, will then speak natural-sounding and grammatical Cantonese, and will be able to cope with most daily life situations in the language.

==Procedure==
===Basic Conversation===
Each lesson begins with a Basic Conversation covering a daily life situation, organized around one or more grammatical points. The conversation is presented first in buildup form, then in recapitulation. The buildup is partly a device to isolate new words and phrase for pronunciation and identification, partly a device to enable students to gain smooth delivery and natural sentence rhythm by starting with a small segment of a sentence then progressively adding to it to build a full sentence.

The recommended procedure for the buildup is as follows:  Students open their books to the new lesson and look at the English equivalents as the teacher voices the Cantonese.  The teacher voices the first item six times--three times for the students to listen only, three times for them to reenact after the teacher. (The teacher may voice the items more times, but it is recommended that he not do less.) The teacher then moves on to the next item and repeats the same procedure.  When the entire buildup hae been performed this way, the students close their books, and the teacher leads them through the buildup again giving each item one time, the students this time watching the teacher and imitating his behavior both vocal and kinetic--his lip movements, facial expressions, and body gestures.

If the students have particular trouble with a portion of the buildup, the teacher may give it a few more repetitions than the rest, but if the difficulty persists, he drops it for the time being and marks it to return to later. Repetitions under pressure are quite tension-producing, and it works better to return to a difficult passage in a more relaxed mood.

In the recapitulation section the conversation is repeated in full sentence form.  The teacher voices each sentence at least two times, with pauses after each sentence for students to repeat. The first goal is for the students to be able to say the conversation after the teacher at natural speed and with natural sentence rhythm.

Details of pronunciation are spotlighted in another section--the first goal for the conversation is sentence rhythm and natural speed. The second goal is for the students to memorize the Basic Conversation, so they can say it independently without the teacher's model to follow, maintaining natural speed and rhythm. Students will find the tape recorder a valuable aid to memorizing. The tape recorder is tireless in furnishing a model for students to imitate, and enables them to proceed at the pace best suited to their needs.

The purpose of memorizing the Basic Conversations is twofold. Memorizing situational material gives students tip-of-the-tongue command of usable Cantonese. Secondly, since the basic conversations are organized on grammatical principles, students by memorizing the conversations will be learning the grammatical framework of the language, on which they can construct other sentences. 

The second day on the lesson, when students have memorized the conversation, it is recommended that the teacher have them act out the conversational roles. Later, after moving on to a new lesson, the teacher has them act out the Basic Conversation of an earlier lesson as a form of review.

===Pronunciation Practice===
In general, the Pronunciation Practices concentrate on giving limited explanation and fuller practice drills on new sounds encountered in a lesson, plus comparison drills with sounds previously learned and sometimes comparisons with American close counterparts. Instead of giving many examples, using items unknown to the students the pronunciation drills stick to examples from material they have met in the Basic Conversation or Pattern Drills. The exception to this is Lesson One, which presents an overview of all the tones, consonant initials, and vooalio finals of the language, in addition to giving an introduction to intonation and stress. Students who absorb pronunciation best though mimicking the model and who find the linguistic description of sounds confusing or boring or both, should concentrate on mimicking the model and skimp or skip the explanations.

===Notes===
There are two kinds of Notes--Structure (grammar) Notes and Culture Notes. These are to he read outside of class. The structure notes summarize the structures used in the Basic Conversations and practiced in the Pattern Drills, and are for those students who want a general explanation of how the language works. The students who absorb language structures better through learning model sentences and drilling variations of the model can concentrate on the Basic Conversations and Pattern Drills, and skimp on the Structure Notes.

The Culture Notes comment on some Cantonese life patterns which differ from our own.

===Pattern Drills===
There are six kinds of Pattern Drills in Cantonese Basic Course. The purpose of the drills is to make the vocabulary and sentence structures sink in and become speech habits, so that the student understands spoken Cantonese without having to translate mentally and speaks fluently and grammatically at natural speed without awkward hesitation and groping for words. The Pattern Drills give students practice in structures and words which have been introduced in the Basic Conversations. In addition, there are other vocabulary items which appear first in the drill sections. A plus sign marks each occurrence of a new word in this section, and the English equivalent is given.

Each drill begins with an example giving a model of the teacher's cue and the students' response. Then there follow 8 to 10 problems to be done on this pattern. The teacher gives the cue, and the student responds to the new cue following the pattern set in the example. The response is thus predictable, controlled by the pattern and the cue. In the book the ones are given in the left hand column and the responses on the right, with the example above.

Students will find that going over the drills in a session with the tape recorder before performing then in class with the teacher aids their grasp of the material and smooths their delivery.  In class students look at their books to check the example for each drill, to learn what their task is. Then they perform the drill with books closed, relying on the pattern of the example sentence and the cues provided to know what to say. A drill is mastered when the student can respond to the cues promptly, smoothly, and without reference to the book.

The types of drills follow:
#Substitution Drills
#*The teacher voices a pattern sentence, then voices a word or phrase (called a cue) to be substituted in the original sentence.  The student notes the substitution cue and substitutes it in the appropriate place to make a new sentence.
#*; Example :
#*:T (for Teacher):  Good morning, Mrs. Brown. /Jones/
#*:S (for Student):  Good morning, Mrs. Jones.
#Expansion Drills
#*There are two kinds of expansion drills.  One could be called a listen-and-add drill, using vocabulary and structure familiar to the students.  The teacher says a word or phrase and the students repeat it.  Then the teacher voices another word or phrase and the students add that word to the original utterance, expanding it.  The teacher adds another cue, and the students incorporate it, and so on, making each time a progressively longer utterance.
#*; Example :  
#*:T:  Hat
#*:S:  Hat
#*:T:  Blue
#*:S:  Blue hat
#*:T:  Two
#*:S:  Two blue hats.
#*:T:  Buy
#*:S:  Buy two blue hats.
#*This type of expansion drill is handled a little differently if it includes new vocabulary.  In that case it is performed as a listen-and-repeat drill, the students echoing the teacher.
#*;Example:  
#*:T:  Hat
#*:S:  Hat
#*:T:  Blue hat
#*:S:  Blue hat
#*:T:  Two blue hats
#*:S:  Two blue hats
#*In the second type of expansion drill the example sentence gives the model to follow and the students expand the subsequent cue sentences according to the pattern set by the example.
#*;Example:  
#*:T:  I'm not Mrs. Lee.  /Chan/
#*:S:  I'm not Mrs. Lee--my name is Chan.
#Response Drills
#*The response drills involve 1) question stimulus and answer response, or 2) statement stimulus and statement response, or 3) statement stimulus and question response.
#*; Ex. 1:  
#*:T:  Is your name Chan?  /Lee/
#*:S:  No, it's Lee.
#*; Ex. 2:  
#*:T:  He speaks Cantonese.  /Mandarin/
#*:S:  He speaks Mandarin too.
#*; Ex. 5:  
#*:T:  He speaks Cantonese.  /Mandarin/
#*:S:  Does he speak Mandarin too?
#Transformation Drills.
#*In transformation drills the students transform the grammatical form of the cue sentences from positive to negative to question, according to the pattern set in the example.  A positive to negative transformation would be:
#*; Ex:  
#*:T:  Her name is Lee.
#*:S:  Her name isn't Lee.
#Combining Drills.
#*In combining drills the students make one long sentence from two short cue sentences, according to the pattern set in the example.
#*; Ex:
#*:T:  It's nine o'clock. We study Chinese.
#*:S:  We study Chinese at nine o'clock.
#Conversation Drills.
#*In conversation drills students carry on a conversation following the pattern set by the example.  The book or the teacher furnishes cues to vary the content while retaining the structure.
#*; Ex:
#*:A:  Good morning, Mrs. Lee.
#*:B:  Excuse me, I'm not Mrs. Lee.  My name is Chan.
#*:A:  Oh, excuse me, Miss Chan.
#*:B:  That's all right.
#*:A.........Miss Smith. / A.  Good morning, Miss Smith.
#*:B..............Brown. / B,  Excuse me, I's not Miss Smith, My name is Brown.
#*:A..................   / A:  Oh, excuse me, Miss Brown.
#*:B..................   / B:  That's all right.

===Conversations for Listening===
The Conversations for Listening, recorded on tapes, give the students a chance to listen to further conversations using the vocabulary and sentence patterns of the lesson under study. These can be listened to outside of class and replayed in class, with the teacher then asking questions (in Cantonese of coarse) on the selections and the students answering. Usually several replays are needed before the students' comprehension of the conversation is complete. After they understand a conversation in its entirety, it is recommended that they play it through two or three more times, listening especially for the expressive elements of intonation and final particles, as these occur primarily in conversation and not as natural features of pattern sentences which the students practice 4n the drill sections.

After Lesson l0, there will be new vocabulary in the Conversation for Listening, to help the story along. These words and phrases are glossed in Cantonese and English at the foot of each conversation in the printed text, but students will not be held responsible for learning them.

===Say It in Cantonese===
The Say It in Cantonese section gives situations and sentences in English, and students are to give Cantonese equivalents. This section is to be performed in class for the linguist or the teacher, though the students may prepare it beforehand if they like.  Students should recognize that there is often more than one acceptable way to 'say it in Cantonese.'

===Vocabulary Checklist===
At the end of each lesson is a vocabulary checklist, giving the new vocabulary for that lesson, the part of speech for each entry (noun, verb,etc.), and the English translation.

===Suggestions for Further Practice===
The Say it in Cantonese section is the final working section of each lesson. After doing that section the teacher is encouraged to allow time for the students to carry on conversation practice using the material in the lesson. The teacher should be referee for this part, and make sure all students get a chance to participate.  Some students are by nature more talkative than others, and the teacher must see to it, by asking a few questions of the more retiring students, that participation in free conversation is fairly evenly distributed and that the naturally talkative students don't do all the talking.

Repeating the dialogue of the Basic Conversations of earlier lessons is a good way to keep those vocabularies and sentences fresh in the students' minds.  Also, selections from earlier dialogues can often be used during free conversation practice of the lesson under study.

==System of Romanization Used==
The system of romanization used in the text is a modification of the Huang-Kok Yale romanization. It is described in detail in Lesson l. In comparing Cantonese and Mandarin sentence structures the system of romanization used for the Mandarin is Yale romanization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Causes of war==
There is great debate over why wars happen, even when most people do not want them to. Representatives of many different academic disciplines have attempted to explain war.

===Historians===
Historians tend to be reluctant to look for sweeping explanations for all wars. A. J. P. Taylor famously described wars as being like traffic accidents. There are some conditions and situations that make them more likely but there can be no system for predicting where and when each one will occur. Social scientists criticize this approach arguing that at the beginning of every war some leader makes a conscious decision and that they cannot be seen as purely accidental.

===Psychological theories===

[[w:Psychology|Psychologist]]s such as [[w:E.F.M. Durban|E.F.M. Durban]] and [[w:John Bowlby|John Bowlby]] have argued that human beings, especially [[w:men|men]], are inherently violent. While this violence is repressed in normal society it needs the occasional outlet provided by war. This combines with other notions, such as [[w:displacement|displacement]] where a person transfers their grievances into bias and hatred against other ethnic groups, nations, or ideologies. While these theories can explain why wars occur, they do not explain when or how they occur. In addition, they raise the question why there are sometimes long periods of peace and other eras of unending war. If the innate psychology of the human mind is unchanging, these variations are inconsistent.

A solution adopted to this problem by militarists such as [[w:Franz Alexander|Franz Alexander]] is that peace does not really exist. Periods that are seen as peaceful are actually periods of preparation for a later war or when war is suppressed by a state of great power, such as the [[w:Pax Britannica|Pax Britannica]].

If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it. One alternative is to argue that war is only, or almost only, a male activity and if human leadership was in female hands wars would not occur. This theory has played an important role in modern [[w:feminism|feminism]]. Critics, of course, point to various examples of female political leaders who had no qualms about using military force, such as [[w:Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]].

Other psychologists have argued that while human temperament allows wars to occur, they only do so when mentally unbalanced men are in control of a nation. This school argues leaders that seek war such as [[w:Napoleon|Napoleon]], [[w:Hitler|Hitler]], and [[w:Stalin|Stalin]] were mentally abnormal and thus if some sort of screening process, such as elections, could prevent these types from coming to power, war would end.

A distinct branch of the psychological theories of war are the arguments based on [[w:evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychology]]. This school tends to see war as an extension of animal behaviour, such as territoriality and competition. However, while war has a natural cause the development of technology has accelerated human destructiveness to a level that is irrational and damaging to the species. We have the same instincts of a chimpanzee but overwhelmingly more power. The earliest advocate of this theory was [[w:Konrad Lorenz|Konrad Lorenz]]. These theories have been criticized by scholars such as [[w:John G. Kennedy|John G. Kennedy]], who argue that the organized, sustained war of humans differs more than just technologically from the territorial fights between animals.

===Anthropological theories ===

[[w:Anthropology|Anthropologists]] take a very different view of war. They see it as fundamentally cultural, learnt by nurture rather than nature. Thus if human societies could be reformed war would disappear. To this school the acceptance of war is inculcated into each of us by the [[w:Religion|religious]], [[w:Ideology|ideological]], and [[w:Nationalism|nationalistic]] surroundings in which we live.

Anthropologists also see no links between various forms of violence. They see the fighting of animals, the skirmishes of [[w:hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer]] tribes, and the organized warfare of modern societies as distinct phenomena each with their own causes. Theorists such as [[w:Ashley Montagu|Ashley Montagu]] emphasize the top down nature of war, that almost all wars are begun not by popular pressure but by the whims of leaders and that these leaders also work to maintain the system of ideological justifications for war.

===Sociological theories===
Sociology has long been very concerned with the origins of war, and many thousands of theories have been advanced, many of them contradictory. Some use detailed formulas taking into account hundreds of demographic and economic values to predict when and where wars will break out. The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Department of Peace and Conflict Research. So far none of these formulas have successfully predicted the outbreak of future conflicts. On the other hand there is a case for avoiding war in the Democratic peace theory, since liberal democracies rarely go to war against each other. A detailed study by Michael Haas found that no single variable has a strong correlation to the occurrence of wars. There have been many other attempts at Predicting War.

Many sociologists have attempted to divide wars into types to get better correlations, but this has also produced mixed results. Data looked at by R.J. Rummel has found that civil wars and foreign wars are very different in origin, but Jonathan Wilkenfield using different data found just the opposite.

Sociology has thus divided into a number of schools. One based on the works of Eckart Kehr and Hans-Ulrich Wehler sees war as the product of domestic conditions, with only the target of aggression being determined by international realities. Thus World War I was not a product of international disputes, secret treaties, or the balance of power but a product of the economic, social, and political situation within each of the states involved.

This differs from the traditional approach of Karl von Clausewitz and Leopold von Ranke that argue it is the decisions of statesmen and the geopolitical situation that leads to war.

===Information theories===
A popular new approach is to look at the role of information in the outbreak of wars. This theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as Geoffrey Blainey, argues that all wars are based on a lack of information. If both sides at the outset knew the result neither would fight, the loser would merely surrender and avoid the cost in lives and infrastructure that a war would cause.

This is based on the notion that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack. This notion is generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since Karl von Clausewitz. This notion is made harder to accept because it is far more common to study the cause of wars rather than events that failed to cause wars, and wars are far more memorable. However, throughout history there are as many invasions and annexations that did not lead to a war, such as the U.S.-led invasion of Haiti in 1994, the Nazi invasions of Austria and Czechoslovakia preceding the Second World War, and the annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union in 1940. On the other hand, Finland's decision to resist a similar Soviet aggression in 1939 led to the Winter War.

The leaders of these nations chose not to resist as they saw the potential benefits being not worth the loss of life and destruction such resistance would cause. Lack of information may not only be to who wins in the immediate future. The Norwegian decision to resist the Nazi invasion was taken with the certain knowledge that Norway would fall. The Norwegians did not know whether the German domination would be permanent and also felt that noble resistance would win them favour with the Allies and a position at the peace settlement in the event of an Allied victory. If in 1941 it had been known with certainty the Germans would dominate central Europe for many decades, it is unlikely the Norwegians would have resisted. If it had been known for certainty that the Third Reich would collapse after only a few years of war, the Nazis would not have launched the invasion at all.

This theory is predicated on the notion that the outcome of wars is not randomly determined, but fully determined on factors such as doctrine, economies, and power. While purely random events, such as storms or the right person dying at the right time, might have had some effect on history, these only influence a single battle or slightly alter the outcome of a war, but would not mean the difference between victory and defeat.

There are two main objectives in the gathering of intelligence. The first is to find out the ability of an enemy, the second their intent. In theory to have enough information to prevent all wars both need to be fully known. The Argentinean dictatorship knew that Britain had the ability to defeat them but their intelligence failed them on the question of whether the British would use their power to resist the annexation of the Falklands. The American decision to enter the Vietnam War was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerillas had the capability to long oppose American forces.

One major difficulty is that in a conflict of interests, some deception or at least not telling everything, is a standard tactical component on both sides. If you think that you can convince the opponent that you will fight, the opponent might desist. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercly partly by playing on the myth of Arian superiority, and by making sure that Hermann Göring only saw Elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.

===Economic theories===
Another school of thought argues that war can be seen as an outgrowth of economic competition in a chaotic and competitive international system. That wars begin as a pursuit of new markets, of natural resources, and of wealth.  Unquestionably a cause of some wars, from the empire building of Britain to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in pursuit of oil this theory has been applied to many other conflicts. It is most often advocated by those of the left of the political spectrum who argue that such wars serve only the interests of the wealthy but are fought by the poor.

===Marxist theories===
The economic theories also form a part of the Marxist theory of war, which argues that all war grows out of the class war. It sees wars as imperial ventures to enhance the power of the ruling class and divide the proletariat of the world by pitting them against each other for contrived ideals such as nationalism or religion. Further, wars are a natural outgrowth of the free market and class system, and will not disappear until the world revolution occurs.

'''International relations''' ('''IR''') is an academic and public policy field, a branch of political science, dealing with the foreign policy of states within the '''international system''', including the roles of international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and multinational corporations (MNCs). Because international relations seeks to analyze as well as formulate foreign policy, it can be either positive or normative.

It draws upon such diverse fields as political science, economics, history, law, philosophy, area studies, sociology, cultural studies and other social sciences. International relations involves a diverse range of issues, including the environmental movement, nuclear proliferation, nationalism, foreign aid, economic development, and human rights.

== Theories ==

There are many ways of thinking in international relations theory, including Constructivism, Institutionalism, Marxism, Neo-Gramscianism, and others. However, two schools of thought are predominant: Realism and Liberalism.

==== Realism ====

The term '''Realism''' is often associated with the German term realpolitik. Realpolitik is a combination of two words: the German &quot;real&quot;, meaning &quot;real&quot; or &quot;substantive,&quot; as in the German &quot;Realität&quot; (meaning &quot;reality&quot;), and &quot;politik&quot; (meaning &quot;politics&quot; or &quot;policy&quot;).
Bismarck used the term after following Metternich's lead in finding ways to balance the power of European empires. Balancing power meant keeping the peace, and careful realpolitik practioners tried to avoid arms races. However, during the early-20th Century, arms races (and alliances) occurred anyway, culminating in World War I.

Realism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that the international system is anarchic, in the sense that there is no authority above states capable of regulating their interactions; states must arrive at relations with other states on their own, rather than it being dictated to them by some higher controlling entity (that is, no true authoritative world government exists). It also assumes that sovereign states, rather than international institutions, non-governmental organizations, or multinational corporations, are the primary actors in international affairs. According to realism, each state is a rational actor that always acts towards its own self-interest and the primary goal of each state is to ensure its own security. Realism holds that in pursuit of that security, states will attempt to amass resources and that relations between states are determined by their relative level of power. That level of power is in turn determined by the state's capabilities, both military and economic.
Moreover, Realists believe that States are inherently aggressive (&quot;offensive realism&quot;), and that territorial expansion is only constrained by opposing power(s).
The principal Realist theorists are [[w:E.H._Carr|Carr]], [[w:Hans_Morgenthau|Morgenthau]] and [[w:Kenneth_Waltz|Waltz]].

There are two sub-schools of realism: '''maximal realism''' and '''minimal realism'''.  The theory of maximal realism holds that the most desirable position to be in is that of the hegemon]], the most powerful entity in the world, and that smaller entities will align themselves with the hegemon out of political self-interests.  Under maximal realism, the position where there are simultaneously two equally powerful co-hegemons (such as was the case during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union) is an inherently unstable one and that situation will inevitably collapse into a more stable state where one nation is more powerful and one is less powerful.

The theory of minimal realism holds that non-hegemonic states will ally against the hegemon in order to prevent their own interests from being subsumed by the hegemon's interests.  Under the minimal-realism theory it is possible to have two equally powerful co-hegemons with whom a smaller entity may ally in turn depending on which hegemon better fits with the smaller entity's policies at the moment (playing both sides against the middle).

==== Liberalism ====

'''Liberalism''' holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior. Preferences will vary from state to state, depending on their culture, economic system, or type of government. Many different strands of liberalism have emerged; some include commercial liberalism, liberal institutionalism, idealism and regime theory.

Recently, realism and liberalism have evolved into neo-realism and neo-liberalism. no

==== Other Schools of Thought ====

Other schools, which cannot (yet) be counted to the established mainstream in the Study of International Relations, include postmodern, feminist and Neo-Marxist approaches, and Neo-Gramscianism. These perspectives differ from both Realism and Liberalism in their epistemological and ontological premises and are postpositivistic in nature.

Different schools of thought in international relations can predict the same events. The theories are differentiated by the assumptions they make in their reasoning toward predictions. For example, both realists and liberals claim that events as disparate as World War I, the Cold War, and the relatively conflict-free post-Cold War Europe were predicted by their theories. The theories differ in the fundamental assumptions they make in predicting state behavior. It is possible that one liberal theorist will predict war while another liberal theorist will predict peace; their disagreement arises from how they interpret events, but their fundamental assumptions are the same. Similarly, it is possible that a realist theorist and a liberal theorist could both predict peace, but their fundamental assumptions as to why that occurs would be different. _

== History ==

The history of international relations is widely traced back to the [[w:Peace of Westphalia|Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 where the modern states system as we see it today was developed.  It was not until 1919 that the first university department devoted to 'international politics' (and its Woodrow Wilson Chair of International Politics) was founded by David Davies at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales.  The first university to found an international relations department was the London School of Economics in 1924.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''use of force''' doctrine is employed by police forces, as well as soldiers on guard duty, to regulate the actions of police and guards. The aim of such a doctrine is to balance security needs with ethical concerns for the rights and well-being of intruders or suspects.

U.S. soldiers on guard duty are given a &quot;use of force briefing&quot; by the [[w:sergeant of the guard|sergeant of the guard]] before being assigned to their post.

&quot;The only difference between lawful force for police and civilians is that peace officers are not given the option of fleeing the scene to avoid confrontation.&quot; [http://web.archive.org/20011019111115/www.geocities.com/gunversation/useofforce/useofforce.htm]

Indeed, soldiers on guard duty will be severely punished for &quot;abandoning their post&quot; if they leave before being &quot;properly relieved&quot;.

A '''foreign policy''' is a set of [[Politics|political]] goals that seeks to outline how a particular country will interact with the other countries of the world.

Foreign policies generally are designed to help protect a country's national interests, national security, ideological goals, and economic prosperity. This can occur as a result of peaceful cooperation with other nations, or through aggression, war, and exploitation.

The 20th century saw a rapid rise in the importance of foreign policy, with virtually every nation in the world now being able to interact with one another in some [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] form.

Creating foreign policy is usually the job of the head of government and the foreign minister (or equivalent). However, in the United States, Congress also has considerable power and influence, and is able to pass Foreign Relations Authorization bill's.

[[Image:Schlacht-bei-waterloo.png|thumb|right|200px|Military strategy in the Waterloo campaign]]

'''Military strategy''' is a collective name for planning the conduct of warfare.  Derived from the Greek ''strategos'', strategy was seen as the &quot;art of the general&quot;.  Military strategy deals with the planning and conduct of campaigns, the movement and disposition of forces, and the deception of the enemy.  The father of modern strategic study, [[w:Carl von Clausewitz]], defined military strategy as &quot;the employment of battles to gain the end of war.&quot;  Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of &quot;arts&quot; or &quot;sciences&quot; that govern the conduct of warfare; the others being '''tactics''', the execution of plans and maneuvering of forces in battle, and '''logistics''', the maintenance of an army.

== Fundamentals of military strategy ==

Strategy and tactics are closely related.  Both deal with distance, time and force but strategy is large scale while tactics are small scale.  Originally strategy was understood to govern the prelude to a battle while tactics controlled its execution.  However, in the world wars of the 20th century, the distinction between manoeuvre and battle, strategy and tactics, became blurred.  Tactics that were once the province of a company of cavalry would be applied to a panzer army.

In its purest form, strategy dealt solely with military issues.  In earlier societies, a king or political leader was often the same person as the military leader.  If he was not, the distance of communication between the political and the military leader was small.  But as the need of a professional army grew, the bounds between the politicians and the military came to be recognized.  In many cases, it was decided that there was a need for a separation.  As French statesman Georges Clemenceau said, &quot;war is too important a business to be left to soldiers.&quot;  This gave rise to the concept of the '''grand strategy''' which encompasses the management of the resources of an entire nation in the conduct of warfare.  In the environment of the grand strategy, the military component is largely reduced to '''operational strategy''' -- the planning and control of large military units such as corps and divisions.  As the size and number of the armies grew and the technology to communicate and control improved, the difference between &quot;military strategy&quot; and &quot;grand strategy&quot; shrank.

Fundamental to grand strategy is the diplomacy through which a nation might forge alliances or pressure another nation into compliance, thereby achieving victory without resorting to combat.  Another element of grand strategy is the management of the post-war peace.  As Clausewitz stated, a successful military strategy may be a means to an end, but it is not an end in itself.  There are numerous examples in history where victory on the battlefield has not translated into long term peace and security.

Strategy (and tactics) must constantly evolve in response to technological advances.  A successful strategy from one era tends to remain in favour long after new developments in military weaponry and mat&amp;eacute;riel have rendered it obsolete.  [[w:World War I]], and to a great extent the [[w:American Civil War]], saw Napoleonic tactics of &quot;offense at all costs&quot; pitted against the defensive power of the trench, machine gun and barbed wire.  As a reaction to her WWI experience, France entered [[w:World War II]] with a purely defensive doctrine, epitomised by the &quot;impregnable&quot; Maginot Line, but only to be completely avoided in the German blitzkrieg.

:''&quot;Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.&quot; '' &amp;ndash;[[w:Sun Tzu]]

==Principles of military strategy==
''Main article:'' [[w:Principles of military strategy]]

Many military strategists have attempted to encapsulate a successful strategy in a set of principles.  Sun Tzu defined 13 principles in his ''[[Wikisource:The Art of War|The Art of War]]'' while Napoleon listed 115 maxims.  American Civil War General [[w:Nathan Bedford Forrest]] required only one: &quot;get there first with the most&quot;.  The fundamental concepts common to most lists of principles are:

#The Objective
#Offense
#Cooperation
#Concentration (Mass)
#Economy
#Manœuvre
#Surprise
#Security
#Simplicity

Some strategists assert that adhering to the fundamental principles guarantees victory while others claim war is unpredictable and the general must be flexible in formulating a strategy.  Field Marshal Count [w:[Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke]] expressed strategy as a system of &quot;ad hoc expedients&quot; by which a general must take action while under pressure.  These underlying principles of strategy have survived relatively unscathed as the technology of warfare has developed.

== Development of military strategy ==

=== Early military strategy ===

The principles of military strategy can be found as far back as 500 BC in the works of Sun Tzu and earlier in Spartan thinking.  The campaigns of [[w:Alexander the Great]], [[w:Hannibal]], [[w:Julius Cæsar]] and [[w:Genghis Khan]] demonstrate strategic planning and movement.  In 1520 [[w:Niccol&amp;ograve; Machiavelli]]'s ''Dell'arte della guerra'' (Art of War) dealt with the relationship between civil and military matters and the formation of the grand strategy.  In the [[w:Thirty Years War]], [[w:Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] demonstrated advanced operational strategy that led to victories in Holy Roman Empire area.

It was not until the 18th century that military strategy was subjected to serious study.  In the Seven Years War  (1756-1763), [[w:Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] improvised a &quot;strategy of exhaustion&quot; to hold off his opponents and conserve his [[w:Prussia|Prussian]] forces.  Assailed from all sides by [[w:France]], [[w:Austria]], [[w:Russia]] and [[w:Sweden]], Frederick exploited his central position which enabled him to move his army along interior lines and concentrate against one opponent at a time.  Unable to achieve victory, he was able to stave off defeat until a diplomatic solution was reached.  Frederick's &quot;victory&quot; led to great significance being placed on &quot;geometric strategy&quot; which emphasised lines of manoeuvre, awareness of terrain and possession of critical strongpoints.

=== Napoleonic strategy ===

The [[w:French Revolution]] and the [[w:Napoleonic Wars]] that followed revolutionised military strategy.  The impact of this period was still to be felt in the American Civil War and the early phases of World War I.  With the advent of cheap small arms and the rise of the drafted citizen soldier, armies grew rapidly in size to become massed formations.  This necessitated dividing the army first into divisions and later into corps.  Along with divisions came divisional artillery; light-weight, mobile and with great range and firepower.  The rigid formations of pikemen and musketeers firing massed volleys gave way to light infantry fighting in skirmish lines.

[[w:Napoleon I of France]] took advantage of these developments to pursue a brutally effective &quot;strategy of annihilation&quot; that cared little for the mathematical perfection of the geometric strategy.  Napoleon invariably sought to achieve decision in battle, with the sole aim of utterly destroying his opponent, usually achieving success through superior manouevre.  As ruler and general he dealt with the grand strategy as well as the operational strategy, making use of political and economic measures.  Napoleon was ultimately defeated when his opponents adopted the strategies that he had perfected.

Napoleon's practical strategic triumphs inspired a whole new field of study into military strategy.  The two most significant students of his work were Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian with a background in philosophy, and [[w:Antoine-Henri Jomini]], who had been one of Napoleon's staff officers.  Clausewitz's ''[[w:On War]]'' has become the bible of strategy, dealing with political, as well as military, leadership.  His most famous assertion being:

:&quot;War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument, a continuation of policy carried out by other means.&quot;

Clausewitz dismissed &quot;geometry&quot; as a significant factor in strategy, believing instead in the Napoleonic concept of victory through battle and destruction of the opposing force, at any cost.  However, he also recognised that limited warfare could influence policy by wearing down the opposition through a &quot;strategy of attrition&quot;.

In contrast to Clausewitz, Antoine-Henri Jomini dealt mainly with operational strategy, planning &amp; intelligence, the conduct of the campaign, and &quot;generalship&quot; rather than &quot;statesmanship&quot;.  He proposed that victory could be achieved by occupying the enemy's territory rather than destroying his army.  As such, geometric considerations were prominent in his theory of strategy.  Jomini's two basic principles of strategy were to concentrate against fractions of the enemy force at a time and to strike at the most decisive objective.

One notable exception to Napoleon's ''strategy of annihilation'' and a precursor to trench warfare were the [[w:Lines of Torres Vedras]] during the [[w:Peninsular War|Peninsular campaign]]. French Armies lived off the land and when they were confronted by a line of fortifications which they could not out flank, they were unable to continue the advance and were forced to retreat once they had consumed all the provisions of the region in front of the lines.

The Peninsular campaign was notable for the development of another method of warfare which went largely unnoticed at the time, but would become far more common in the 20th century. That was the aid and encouragement the British gave to the Spanish guerrillas who forced the French to squander most of the assets of their Iberian army in protecting the army's line of communications. This was a very cost effective move for the British, because it cost far less to aid Spanish insurgents than it did to equip and pay regular British army units to engage the same number of French troops. As the British army could be correspondingly smaller it was able to supply its troops by sea and land without having to live off the land as was the norm at the time. Further, because they did not have to forage they did not antagonise the locals and so did not have to garrison their lines of communications to the same extent as the French did. So the strategy of aiding their Spanish civilian allies in their guerrilla war benefited the British in many ways, not all of which were immediately obvious.

=== Strategy in the industrial age ===

The evolution of military strategy continued in the American Civil War (1861-1865).  The practice of strategy was advanced by generals such as [[w:Robert E. Lee]], [[w:Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[w:William T. Sherman]], all of whom had been influenced by the feats of Napoleon ([[w:Thomas J. Jackson|Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] was said to have carried a book of Napoleon's maxims with him).  However, the adherence to the Napoleonic principles in the face of technological advances such as the long-range infantry rifle generally led to disastrous consequences.  The time and space in which war was waged changed as well.  Railroads enabled swift movement of large forces but the manoeuvring was constrained to narrow, vulnerable corridors.  Steam power and ironclads changed transport and combat at sea.  

There was still room for triumphs of strategy of manoeuver such as Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864, but these depended upon an enemy's willingness to not entrench.  Towards the end of the war, especially in defense of static targets as in the battles of [[w:Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] and [[w:Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], trenches between both sides grew to a World War I scale.  Many of the lessons of the American Civil War were forgotten when in wars like the [[w:Austro-Prussian War]] or the [[w:Franco-Prussian War]], when manoeuver won the day.

In the period preceding World War I, two of the most influential strategists were the Prussian generals, Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke and [[w:Alfred von Schlieffen]].  Under Moltke the Prussian army achieved victory in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), the latter campaign being widely regarded as a classic example of the conception and execution of military strategy.  In addition to exploiting railroads and highways for manoeuvre, Moltke harnessed the telegraph for control of large armies.  He recognised the increasing need to delegate control to subordinate commanders and to issue directives rather than specific orders.

Moltke is most remembered as a strategist for his belief in the need for flexibility and that no plan, however well prepared, can be guaranteed to survive beyond the first encounter with the enemy.

Field Marshal Schlieffen succeeded Moltke and directed German planning in the lead up to World War I.  He advocated the &quot;strategy of annihilation&quot; but was faced by a war on two fronts against numerically superior opposition.  The strategy he formulated was the [[w:Schlieffen Plan]], defending in the east while concentrating for a decisive victory in the west, after which the Germans would go on to the offensive in the east.  Influenced by Hannibal's success at the [[w:Battle of Cannae]], Schlieffen planned for a single great battle of encirclement, thereby annihilating his enemy.

Another German strategist of the period was [[w:Hans Delbrück]] who expanded on Clausewitz's concept of &quot;limited warfare&quot; to produce a theory on the &quot;strategy of exhaustion&quot;.  His theory defied popular military thinking of the time, which was strongly in favour victory in battle, yet World War I would soon demonstrate the flaws of a mindless &quot;strategy of annihilation&quot;.

At a time when industrialisation was reaping major advances in naval technology, one American strategist, [[w:Alfred Thayer Mahan]], almost single-handedly brought the field of naval strategy up to date.  Influenced by Jomini's principles of strategy, he saw that in the coming wars, where economic strategy could be as important as military strategy, control of the sea granted the power to control the trade and resources needed to wage war.  Mahan pushed the concept of the &quot;big navy&quot; and an expansionist view where defence was achieved by controlling the sea approaches rather than fortifying the coast.  His theories contributed to the naval arms race between 1898 and 1914.

=== Strategy in World War I ===

At the start of [[w:World War I]] strategy was dominated by the offensive thinking that had been in vogue since 1870, despite the more recent experiences of the [[w:Second Boer War]] (1899-1902) and [[w:Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905), where the machine gun demonstrated its defensive capabilities.  By the end of 1914, the Western Front was a stalemate and all ability to manoeuver strategically was lost.  The combatants resorted to a &quot;strategy of attrition&quot;.  The German battle at [[w:Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the British on the [[w:Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]] and at [[w:Passchendaele]] were among the first widescale battles intended to wear down the enemy.  Attrition was time-consuming so the duration of World War I battles often stretched to weeks and months.  The problem with attrition was that the use of fortified defenses in depth generally required a ratio of ten attackers to one defender for any reasonable chance of victory.  The ability of the defender to move troops using interior lines prevented the possibility of breakthrough.

On other fronts, there was still room for the use of strategy of manouever.  The Germans executed a perfect battle of annihilation against the Russians at the [[w:Battle of Tannenberg (1914)]].  Britain and France launched the disastrous [[w:Dardanelles Campaign]], combining naval power and an amphibious landing, in an effort to aid their Russian ally and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war.  The Palestine campaign was dominated by cavalry and the British achieved two breakthrough victories at [[w:Third Battle of Gaza|Gaza]] (1917) and [[w:Battle of Megiddo|Megiddo]] (1918).  Colonel [[w:T.E. Lawrence]] and other British officers led Arab irregulars on a guerilla campaign against the Ottomans, using strategy and tactics developed during the Boer Wars.

World War I saw armies on a scale never before experienced.  The British, who had always relied on a strong navy and a small regular army, underwent rapid expansion that outpaced the training of generals and staff officers able to handle the strategic planning of such a mammoth force.  Technological advances also had a huge influence on strategy: aerial reconnaissance, artillery techniques, poison gas, the automobile and tank, telephone and radio telegraphy.

More so than in previous wars, military strategy in World War I was directed by the grand strategy of a coalition of nations; the Entente on one side and the Central Powers on the other.  Society and economy were mobilised for total war.  Attacks on each enemies' economies included Britain's use of a naval blockade and Germany employing submarine warfare against merchant shipping.

Unity of command became a question when the various nation states began coordinating assaults and defenses.  The Entente eventually settled under Field Marshal [[w:Foch]].  The Germans generally led the Central Powers, though German authority diminished and lines of command became confused at the end of the war.

World War I ended when the ability of the German soldiers to fight became so diminished that Germany asked for peace conditions.  The exhausted German military was defeated during the battle of Amiens (8-11 August 1918)
and the German homefront entered general revolt over a lack of food and destruction of the economy.  Victory for the Entente was, however, assured by that point.  It was only a matter of time before the tank reintroduced manouever as a viable strategy.

===Strategy Development Between World Wars===

In the years following World War I, two of the technologies that had been introduced during that conflict, the aircraft and the tank, became the subject of strategic study.

The leading theorist of air power was Italian general [[w:Giulio Douhet]] who believed that future wars would be won or lost in the air.  The air force would carry the offensive and the role of the ground forces would be defensive only.  Douhet's doctrine of strategic bombing meant striking at the enemy's heartland -- his cities, industry and communications.  Air power would thereby reduce his willingness and capacity to fight.

British general [[w:J. F. C. Fuller]], architect of the first great tank battle at [[w:Battle of Cambrai|Cambrai]], and his contemporary, [[w:B. H. Liddell Hart]], were amongst the most prominent advocates of mechanization and motorization of the army.  They saw that the armoured fighting vehicle demonstrated firepower, mobility and protection.  It would negate the static defences of the trench and machine gun and restore the strategic principles of manoeuvre and offense.

The innovative German General Heinz Guderian further developed Fuller's and Liddell Hart's ideas to create the groundbreaking blitzkrieg tactics that were used by Germany against Poland in 1939 and later against France in 1940. France, still used to stationary World War I strategies, was completely surprised and summarily overwhelmed by Guderian's Panzer Corps.

Technological change has had both an enormous effect on strategy, and little effect on leadership.  The use of telegraph and later radio, along with improved transport, has enabled the rapid movement of large numbers of men.  However, the amount of men that one officer can effectively control has, if anything, declined.  The increases in the size of the armies has led to an increase in the number of officers.

===Strategy in World War II===
During the World War II, led by British intelligence forces, the allied forces developed and deployed sophisticated ruses, strategic deception, designed to mislead Axis planners resulting in ineffective actions.

[[w:Churchill]], [[w:Roosevelt]], [[w:Stalin]] and other heads of state met at several [[w:List of World War II conferences|conferences]] to prioritize strategies such as [[w:Europe first]].

===Cold War Strategy===

The Cold War was the first time period dominated by the threat of total world annihilation through the use of nuclear weapons, a policy known as [[w:mutual assured destruction]].  As a consequence it was also a war in which attacks were not exchanged between the two main rivals, the [[w:United States]] and the [[w:Soviet Union]].  Instead, the war was fought through proxies.  The battle-grounds were everywhere the superpowers weren't.  Instead of mainly being confined to Europe or the Pacific, the entire world was the battlefield, with countries rather than armies acting as main players.  The only constant rule was that troops of the Soviet Union and the United States could not overtly fight with each other.

The difference between tactics, strategy and grand strategy began to melt during the Cold War as command and communication technologies improved to a greater extent, in first world armed forces.  The third world armed forces controlled by the two superpowers found that grand strategy, strategy and tactics, if anything, moved further apart as the command of the armies fell under the control of super power leaders.

American cold warriors like [[w:Dean Acheson]] and [[w:George Marshall|George C. Marshall]] quickly recognized that the key to victory was the economic defeat of the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union had adopted a defensive posture following the end of World War II, with the United States and its strong navy quickly finding that it had to aggressively defend much of the world from the Soviet Union and the spread of Communism.  It was one of many seeming contradictions in the logic of strategy.

[[w:Nuclear strategy|Strategies]] during the Cold War also dealt with nuclear attack and retaliation.  The United States maintained a policy of [[w:limited first strike]] throughout the Cold War.  In the event of a Soviet attack on the Western Front, resulting in a breakthrough, the United States would use tactical nuclear weapons to stop the attack.  The Soviet Union responded by adopting a policy of [[w:no first use]], involving massive retaliation resulting in mutual assured destruction.  So, if the [[w:Warsaw Pact]] attacked using conventional weapons, [[w:NATO]] would use tactical nukes.  The Soviet Union would respond with an all out nuclear attack, resulting in a similar attack from the United States, with all the consequences the exchange would entail.  This did not happen.  The United States continues to maintain a policy of limited first strike to the present (June 2004).

===Post Cold War Strategy===

Strategy in the post Cold War has come to be defined by the hyperpower status of the United States

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation and Goals==
Ask yourself: '''Why do I want to study Cantonese and what is my eventual goal?'''  Choosing the best method of study will depend a lot on these answers.  It will also give you a better idea on how to measure your personal successes.  Language learning needs a lot of self-encouragement!

Here are some common reasons for studying Cantonese:
*Communicate with friends or family
*Work in Hong Kong, Macau, southeast China, or in other Chinese speaking communities
*Learn a language that is considerably different from English
*Be able to better appreciate Cantonese culture and art, like [[w:Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]], [[w:Cantonese opera|Cantonese opera]], [[w:Cantopop|Cantopop]], etc.
*Learn a language that has few foreign learners and is less-commonly taught
*Study ancient (during [[w:Tang Dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]) Chinese poem 
*...

'''Note to Hong Kong tourists:''' If you are going to Hong Kong for a short vacation, you should realize that most people can speak some English and you do not have to know Cantonese to get by.  This isn't to say there is no reason to study some Cantonese before going.  Actually, if you want to have the opportunity to really enjoy the Cantonese cuisine, get off the beaten tourist tracks, or just learn more about the culture, then learning some Cantonese could be very beneficial.  In such a case though, a book like [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0864426453/qid=1116944375/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-0475329-2411030?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846 Lonely Planet's Cantonese Phrasebook] might be sufficient.

==Means of study==
===Informal study===
A lot of people like to self-study a language as a hobby or create language clubs.  If your interest in Cantonese is more than just passing, you should definitely consider finding a Cantonese-speaking person to supplement your studies.  Try searching [http://www.meetup.com Meetup] or visiting your local Chinatown for more resources.  If this truly isn't feasible, then plan on gathering a lot of sound recordings and work extra hard on your listening/speaking.
A good Cantonese book for self-study is [http://www.amyleunglanguage.com.hk 'No sweat Cantonese'] by Amy Leung. It is commercially available in Hong Kong and it comes with an audio CD for pronunciation.

===Formal training===
If you are truly serious about becoming fluent in Cantonese then you need to study more than just this book.  You would best off taking a formal course.  Brigham Young University maintains a [http://asiane.byu.edu/cla/CantProg.html list of programs] around the world that teach Cantonese. The ideal choice for many people would be the courses in Hong Kong, although it is a bit expensive.

==Suggestions on using this book==
*Study the pronunciation pre-lessons very well before you begin the regular lessons.  A good foundation will make everything go smoother.
*Each lesson will probably take at least two or three sessions to review well.
*Studying the book too closely will get tedious after a while.  Bring creative ways of learning into your routine by watching a Cantonese movie or listen to music.  Afterwards, take a clip of the movie or song and try to listen for words you know or imitate the words/sentences you hear.
*Work with a language partner on the exercises

==Method for studying dialogues==
This method or one similar is often taught by foreign language teachers and many learners have found it to be successful.  However, if you find it demanding or not suitable to your learning style you should adjust it accordingly.  The main point is to use your listening skills and inductive reasoning ability as much as possible.

#At the beginning of each lesson, read the short English summary of the conversation.  '''Do not''' look any farther in the book. 
#Listen to the dialogue one or two times (sounds files are coming!) to get a feel for the conversation.  '''Do not''' look at the book, just listen!  
#Then listen to vocabulary list, again '''do not''' look at the book!  Listen to each word and repeat it.  Make a guess at the romanization and try even writing it down as you go through the list.  In the first couple lessons, you might want to hold off on writing until you get a better feel for the romanization system.  But as you progress, practice writing the complete Yale romanization '''with''' tones each time you listen to the vocabulary list.  Tones obviously will be extremely difficult to get right in the beginning.  Focus first on getting the correct segments and the tones will come gradually.  Of course, you will have to listen more once!  Don't worry about meanings, just focus on the sounds.
#After you feel you have put forth your best effort, double check your romanizations with the book and start associating the English meanings with the sounds.  Pay careful attention to any of your romanization mistakes and listen to the file again until you feel you can recognize the correct sound.
#Now listen to the conversation, but still '''do not''' look at the book (not the Cantonese transcription nor the English translation)!  You know all the vocabulary in the conversation now and you should be able to pick up a few words (maybe even most of them).  When you have gotten past the first couple lessons, aim to listen to the dialogue recordings enough times so that you can guess the general meanings of what each person said before you check the book.
#Look at the Cantonese transcription and listen again.  Make a mental note of which words you picked up yourself in the previous listenings.  Pay attention to the difficult spots that you couldn't understand.  Refer to the transcription and listen again to see if you can pick out the words now.  By now, you probably know the gist of the conversation even though you haven't looked at the English translation yet!  You may be surprised to realize this skill of listening and reasonable guessing is critical for advancement in the language learning.  Route memorization and &quot;cheating&quot; by looking at the English translations at first will constantly hold you back.  Furthermore, it's important that you learn how to feel comfortable with this process now because as you reach intermediate and advanced levels you will depend on these skills even more.
#Finally, you can look at the English translation.  You should just check that your understanding is factually accurate.  Do not dwell on translation details.  For example, Cantonese doesn't distinguish past or present tense so there is no point in trying to understand why a particular verb in the translation is past tense.  Translations are to be taken as a rough guide.  Detailed understanding of the grammar will come through the grammar notes and more exposure to the language.  The real key to learning a language is recognizing the patterns within the language itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- This page was changed because the previous entry had nothing to do with the triangle inequality. --&gt;
==The Triangle Inequality==

'''The Triangle Inequality''' states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side of the triangle.

For instance, if you have a triangle with sides of length A, B and C.  Then you know that
* A + B &gt; C
* A + C &gt; B
* C + B &gt; A

In Euclidean Geometry, it is impossible to draw a triangle that violates the Triangle Inequality.

===Using the Triangle Inequality===

The Triangle Inequality can be used to find the length of a side of a triangle.  For instance, say you have a triangle with sides labeled A, B and C.  If you know that A = 7, and B = 5 then you can figure out the approximate value of C as follows:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Statement&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reason&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7 + 5 &gt; C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Triangle Inequality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12 &gt; C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Addition&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C &lt; 12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Less Than&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So we know that the third side of our triangle is less than 12, but that doesn't help us very much.  It turns out that the triangle Inequality can help us again.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Statement&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reason&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C + 5 &gt; 7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Triangle Inequality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C &gt; 7 - 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Subtraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C &gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Subtraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In this situation, there is a range of values that C could take.  C has to be more than 2, and less than 12.  2 &lt; C &lt; 12.  

So it turns out that the measure of the third side of any triangle falls in between the Sum and Differences of the other two sides.  Example: If two sides are 9 and 6, then the remaining side's measure would be between 15 (the sum of 9 and 6) and 3 (the difference of 9 and 6).  This would result in the following inequality:  3 &lt; c &lt; 15.

There are many triangles that could fit our givens.

==Exercises==

1) Try to draw a triangle that violates the Triangle Inequality.

2) For each of the following sets of A, B and C, indicate whether the 3 lengths could be the sides of a triangle or not.
* A = 3, B = 4, C = 5
* A = 3, B = 8, C = 5
* A = 14, B = 5, C = 8
* A = 5, B = 5, C = 5

3) Given that you have a triangle with sides of length 12 and 2, write a proof showing what range of values the third side could take.  Use a two-column format as shown above.

== Triangle Inequality Theorem ==
In any triangle, the longest side is opposite of the largest angle, the middle sized side is opposite the middle measured angle, and the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle.

Example Problem
In triangle ABC, if angle A is 100 degrees and angle B is 35 degrees and angle C is 45 degrees, what are lengths of sides from longest to shortest?

Answer:
        Since side BC is opposite the largest angle, it is the largest side.
        Since side AB is opposite the middle sized angle, it is the middle sized side.
        Since side AC is opposite the smallest angle, so it is the smallest side.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;big&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Subscript text&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Triangle Inequality In Two Triangles: The Hinge Theorem ==
If two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of a second triangle, and the angle between these sides of the first triangle is greater than the angle between these side of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is greater than the third side of the second triangle.

         Example: If triangles ABC and DEF have sides AB= DE and AC = DF and m&lt;A = 80 degrees and m&lt;D = 70 then BC &gt; EF.

'''This page refers to the popular 7400 series IC'''

The 7400 series is a popular set of logic ICs that can be ordered from many vendors, and used in many applications. 7400 chips are generally 14-pin or 16-pin DIP packages, although other form factors are available as well. 

The power supply required is +5V. For most of the 7400 chips, pin 7 is the ground (GND) connection and pin 14 is the +5V power supply. There are exceptions like the 7490. 2.0V or higher signifies a logical &quot;1&quot;; 0.8V or lower signifies a logical &quot;0&quot;. 

{{wikipedia| logic family}}
Each chip has its name printed on top (for example, &quot;74HC132&quot;), describing its logic family and digital logic functionality.

== OR Gates, 7432 ==
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is high only when either one, or both, of the input pins are high.

== NOR Gates, 7402 ==
[[File:7402_Quad_2-input_NOR_Gates.PNG|thumb|right|150px]]
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is low only when either one, or both, of the input pins are high.

== XOR Gates, 7486 ==
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is low when both input pins are equal (both high or both low), and it is high when one of the input pins is high and at the same time the other input pin is low.  This is called the &quot;odd but not even gate&quot; meaning that an odd number of inputs need to be high in order for the output to be high.  The XNOR gate is just the opposite; called the &quot;even but not odd gate&quot;.

== AND Gates, 7408 ==
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is high only when all input pins are high at the same time.

== Other AND Gates ==

7411 has 3 AND gates, each with 3 inputs and 1 output.
7421 has 2 AND gates, each with 4 inputs and 1 output.

== NAND Gates, 7400, 74132 ==

4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is low only when all input pins are high at the same time.

== Other NAND Gates ==

7410 has 3 NAND gates, each with 3 inputs and 1 output.
7420 has 2 NAND gates, each with 4 inputs and 1 output.
7430 has 1 NAND gate, with 8 input pins, and 1 output pin.

== Flip Flops ==

7474 has 2 JK flip flops.  Pin 4 is the 5V power pin; pin 11 is GND.

== Design ==

When designing new digital circuits, we may sketch dozens of slightly different kinds of [[Digital Circuits/Gates | gates]] -- different numbers of inputs, etc.
Just about every kind of gate you can imaging has been manufactured somewhere.
However, when it comes time to actually construct a circuit, we typically use only a few kinds of &quot;common&quot; chips rather than every possible chip.
The Apollo Guidance Computer is an example of an entire computer out of only one kind of gate.

If our sketch includes a 4-input AND gate, you might think we would simply grab a 7421 off the shelf and wire it up.
Ha! I haven't seen an actual 7421 chip in over a decade.
It is far more likely that we will do one of:
* draw it in a schematic capture application with a &quot;7421&quot; from a &quot;7400 library&quot;, then download the design into a FPGA.
* implement it using some other more common [[Digital Circuits/Common Integrated Circuits]], using [[Digital_Circuits/Logic_Operations#Boolean_Algebra | Boolean algebra]] -- then grab *that* chip off the shelf and wire it up.
* translate it into [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6/Boolean Expressions|Boolean expression]]&lt;!-- is there a better page this should link to? --&gt;, then run it on a microprocessor.

Currently the most useful physical gates are:
* 74AC132 -- 4 Schmitt 2-input NAND gates
* [[Digital Circuits/Multiplexers-Demultiplexers | multiplexers]]
** 74AC153 dual 4:1 mux chip -- can be wired as any logic gate with up to 3 inputs, including XOR.
** 74AC157 quad 2:1 mux chip
* 74AC595 SIPO shift register
* 74AC165 PISO shift register
* ...
* ... ''(that other chip I'm forgetting)'' ...
* ... ''(any other extremely useful chip that can't be easily replaced by a couple of the above chips?)'' ...

Very wide gates (say, a 16-input NOR gate) are typically implemented as a handful of less complicated gates in a &quot;tree&quot; or &quot;funnel&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A main argument of realist theory is that states (or nations) are always engaged in a struggle for power. One of the earliest books to espouse Realist theory is Machiavelli's ''The Prince'', which was written for the de Medici family as a guide to uniting Italy. A later, more comprehensive book that helped build the foundation of Realist theory was &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot;, by Hans J. Morgenthau.

Realist theory advocates the use of power to fulfill the interest of a nation. &quot;National power&quot; is composed of geography, economy and natural resources, population, military strength and preparedness, national character and moral, and the competency of the national government. 

The influence of geography can be broken down into the separation of nations and the size of nations. Nations can be separated by deserts, mountains, rivers, and, most notably, oceans. Deserts prevented Egypt, Greece, and Rome from establishing contact with the parts of Africa south of the Sahara and prevented the Aztecs from contacting Indians in the modern United States. Though they rarely destroy a powerful army, deserts often wear the army down and help its eventual destruction. The power of mountains is illustrated by the Alps, which prevented Rome from effectively controlling modern-day France and Germany. The power of water is twofold; military power and trade/economic power. It is no accident that the two most recent superpowers, Britain and the United States, are isolated from rivals by oceans. Armies can only cross water when it is bridged; rivers can be bridged, oceans cannot. Thus, both Britain and the US have been protected from foreign armies by water, and need only to maintain a navy to ensure that enemy troops cannot be transported by boat. 

Water also provides fast, easy, cheap, and large-scale transportation. It is no accident that the two most economically powerful cities in the world, New York and Hong Kong, are on river deltas. Not only does this transportation benefit industry, but it can also allow troops to be moved in large numbers (and they will not be tired when their journey is over), but it also allows a nation to watch over its interest with a navy, as both Britain and the US have done. 
The size of a nation works much like natural barriers. However, rather than an army being unable to cross a certain barrier, a large nation may have too much land for the army to cross. Russia used this advantage when it was invaded by Napoleon and Hitler, and had success when wearing the enemy down, rather than facing it head-on (wearing the enemy down is usually termed attrition). A large landmass also gives a nation better chance of having ample natural resources. This is not to say that small nations are weak, it is often the opposite. Though Britain has depended on food imports for well over 100 years, it upheld considerable power until the end of WWII, and the Netherlands have been, and still are, a notable economic power. Further, the Papal States is arguably the most influential nation, per capita, on Earth, though its military power is subject to much speculation. 


It is the economy of a nation that supports the creation of a military. A modern economy can build modern equipment for a military, while a large economy can build massive amounts of equipment and supply more troops. 

There are 3 ways in which economies are used in national competition: military Vs. economy, sustainable military Vs. overstretched military, and economy Vs. economy.

The first situation is when nation A uses its military to attack the economy of nation B. Examples of this are naval blockades (which prevent trade) and the destruction or capture of cities or vital infrastructure. These tactics were used notably in WWII with varying success. In order to conduct a successful naval blockade, there are three things to analyze: the strength of your navy compared to the enemy navy, the enemy's dependence on imports by sea (and if those imports can be redirected to a land route), and the potential reactions of those who will no longer be able to trade with the blockaded. The first aspect is illustrated in the mutual blockades of Britain and Germany during both World Wars. Britain had the more powerful navy, and though German U-boats made Britain pay dearly for its supplies, the more powerful navy eventually won the rivaling embargos. The second consideration is illustrated in Napoleon's embargo on Britain. Though Britain did suffer from the embargo, it did not depend on mainland Europe for supplies, and was able to survive with the help of its colonies. The third aspect is exemplified by the German attack on the Lusitania, which pushed America to enter WWI and helped tip the scales in favor of Britain and France. 

The second possibility, sustainable military Vs. overstretched military, is not a conflict of the militaries themselves, but rather a struggle of two nations to sustain their respectful militaries. In this case, the overstretched (or oversized) military, like those of napoleon and Hitler when invading Russia, eventually crumbled because the militaries could not be maintained by the nation. Additionally, much of the Cold War falls into this category. 

Finally, economy vs. economy competitions are seen in international trade, tariffs, and embargos. If nation A wants to destroy a certain part of nation B's economy, nation A can flood nation B with products at an extremely low price, and eventually destroy the companies in nation B which cannot compete with nation A's far cheaper products. The effects of such an action are twofold; nation B depends on nation A for that product, and nation A can raise prices as competition has vanished; also, nation B is deprived of a product that may be important to the nation's security, and thus is weaker if nation A and nation B go to war. Protective tariffs are designed to prevent actions such as this. Protective tariffs are an extra tax on certain, or all, products, thus preventing nation A from flooding nation B's economy, as nation A's products are no longer cheaper, as they have to pay the extra tax. Additionally, protective taxes can be used to help build a new or small industry, not just protect one that is at risk. Not all tariffs are protective, many are used only to raise revenues for national governments, but all tariffs have financial and protective effects. Finally, embargos are very similar to blockades, but the embargoing nation threatens to impose trade restriction on those who trade with the embargoed, rather than use military force. This method is not as effective as blockades – there is nothing to prevent nations that are already embargoed from trading with each other – but it is useful for compelling a nation to follow the wishes of the embargoing, and can also be used as a predecessor to blockades if a war is to break out.

== System monitoring overview ==


=== What is system monitoring? ===
Computer monitoring systems are used to repeatedly gather data from various monitored systems for the purpose of real-time incident notification, system health verification, performance analysis, and longitudinal capacity planning. Various metrics are typically gathered by these systems, including CPU, memory, network, or disk utilization, response time of network services, occurrence of anomalous messages in system log, et al. Without such a tool, like big brother or Xymon, a system administrator would have to login to each machines to collect these information repeatedly. This kind of repetitive task can be automated using a system monitoring tool.

Please see the chapter ''[[../Other Docs/About System Monitoring/]]'' for a more details overview of monitoring systems.

* ''Repository model'' describes the relationship between various copies of the source code repository. In a client-server model, users access a master repository via a client; typically, their local machines hold only a working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are propagated to other users. In a distributed model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a local repository with version history available, in addition to their working copies.
* ''Concurrency model'' describes how changes to the working copy are managed to prevent simultaneous edits from causing nonsensical data in the repository. In a ''lock'' model, changes are disallowed until the user requests and receives an exclusive lock on the file from the master repository. In a ''merge'' model, users may freely edit files, but are informed of possible conflicts upon checking their changes into the repository, whereupon the version control system may merge changes on both sides, or let the user decide when conflicts arise. Note that distributed version control almost always implies a merge concurrency model.

=== Hobbit Renamed to Xymon ===
This note needs a date...
&lt;pre&gt;
Greetings!

As I wrote some time ago, I was contacted by the owners of the 
&quot;Hobbit&quot; trademark back in June.

Several names have been suggested by you on the mailing list
(see ), but
the decision has now been made.

As of today, the official name is &quot;Xymon&quot; (pronounced just
like &quot;Simon&quot;).

At the moment this renaming has not caused much of a change,
but it will be implemented over the coming weeks.

* The Sourceforge project URL remains at 
   due to project renamings
  currently being suspended on Sourceforge. Once the suspension
  is lifted, however, there is a queued request to rename the
  project. It will then be available at

* The mailing list address remains &quot;&quot; for the
  moment. A new &quot;Xymon&quot; mailing list will be setup, but 
  this will be announced separately.

* The demo website  is active. The old
  address -  - will remain in place for
  some time, but no longer than August 2009.

* Changes to documentation, code, webpages inside the
  Hobbit monitor etc. will be happening over the next couple
  of weeks, and will be fully implemented in the upcoming
  release.


Best regards,
Henrik

== Development Road Map ==
=== Henrik, Feb 9 2009 ===
On February 9, Henrik posted the following roadmap to the list.  I 
haven't heard much lately so I don't know if it has changed.

Version 4.4:
* SNMP support for data collection
* Status updates based on data collected in the RRD files (this is really nice - essentially, *any* value you put into an RRD file can trigger a new or modified status in Xymon. So you could eg. change the status of your &quot;http&quot; test to go red, if the response time of a webpage exceeds 5 seconds).
* Status &quot;flap&quot; handling, to catch statuses that change rapidly.

Version 4.5:
* Support for communication between clients and Xymon to use compression and/or encryption.
* Support for client authentication via SSL certificates (so you cannot spoof a client message).

Version 4.6:
* Revised web interface - eliminate the need for webserver-based authentication, and provide more fine-grained authorization for the various Xymon components.
* Per-user custom login pages, so the login will always show those systems that the user has responsibility for / is allowed to access.

Somewhere along the road I will also introduce a new &quot;ping&quot; test
daemon - I am getting to the point where ping'ing all hosts take 
longer than 5 minutes (I have a lot of hosts). So something needs
to be done, and I think I know how to do it.

=== Changes ===


=== Todos ===
 Tasks that most team member agree to implement.

=== Design Document ===
[[Hobbit Design Document]]

=== Wish Lists ===
* Test Suite for software quality assurance.
* Migrate all the bb modules from deadcat.net to hobbit.
* SLA Report built in.
* Better Theme support.
* Provide encrypted communication pipe between hobbit server and hobbit client.
* hobbit messages compression.
* ipv6
* 4.2.x maintenance release.
* Rewrite of the alerts module to work properly. ;) It's quite flawed at the moment.

== Autoconfiscate Hobbit ==
This section describe the conversion of hobbit source tree into autotool control.
=== Why the autoconfiscation ? ===
* To be more portable across OS platforms.
* Plan for I18n and L10n.
* To become true GNU software which require use of autotool.

=== Learn autotool ===
* [http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html the autotools tutorial] and read the [http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/dl/autotools.pdf pdf slides].
* hand on testing on hello world example.
* [http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/ example of using autoscan].

=== Convert hobbit source tree ===
* make sure your autotool sets has following version.
&lt;pre&gt;
GNU Autoconf 2.61 (November 2006)
GNU Automake 1.10 (October 2006)
GNU Libtool 1.5.24 (June 2007)
GNU Gettext 0.17 (November 2007)
&lt;/pre&gt;
* download the [http://www.hswn.dk/beta/hobbit-snapshot.tar.gz latest hobbit source tar ball].
* run autoscan to get configure.scan and then modify it as configure.ac.
* convert lib/Makefile demotool/Makefile ... etc into Makfile.am.
* Fine tune configure.ac to take configuration options as configure options.
* Support Linux and Solaris OS setting in configure.ac.

=== References ===
* [http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html Great Autotool tutorials and links started here]
* [http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/ Another tutorial]
* [http://vindaci.members.sonic.net/cbreak/projects/autotools/ Autotool for Beginners]

== Xymon Documentation ==
#Current
## Henrik Stroner use troff to generate manual pages so that we have the RTFM type of documentation.
## Also troff2html is used to create html page for web browser viewing.
#Enhancements Proposals.
## Use latex+dia+make+wiki to create publishing grade docs
## Use Table of Conetent, index, references and Figures to describe Xymon related topic.
## Generate Xymon User Guide.
## Generate Xymon Developer Guide
## Generate Xymon System Admin Guide.
## Generate Xymon Slide for presentation purpose.
## Use Wiki documentation content incubation.
## Generate html.RTF and pdf for different purpose.
# Request Development Team to use doxygen syntax for source code documentation.


=== MediaWiki to DocBook ===
* use mvc to gain hobbit wiki source
* convert mediawiki source to latex.

=== Man pages ===

=== Reuse content from existing hobbit documentation source ===
*  http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/

== Xymon test suite ==
Run through test cases to verify the code changes are ok.

=== Performance test scripts ===
=== Quality assurance test scripts ===
==== shell scripts ====
* test script in build directory of hobbit-4.0.3 to make sure depended software are in build machine.
&lt;pre&gt;    
build/perl.sh
build/fping.sh             
build/rrd.sh   
build/ssl.sh
build/ldap.sh          
build/pcre.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Test script by Perl ===

=== Test script by Python ===
=== Test script by DejaGNU ===

=== Dtrace probes in hobbit server ===
[http://blogs.sun.com/barts/entry/putting_user_defined_dtrace_probe An example of putting dtrace probe int an application].

== Packaging ==
=== Hobbit Client for OpenSolaris IPS format ===

* Features of This hobbit client
** This hobbit client will use a local account and group to avoid NIS and NFS dependency.
** It will use SMF to start/top hobbit client.
** It will use sudo or Solaris 10's ACL to achieve reading restricted information off OpenSolaris.
** hobbit-client-serverconf is simple version of hobbit client without local messages processing.
** hobbit-client-local will do some processing filtering, it need more depended software.
** it use /opt/hobbitclient42 as installation path.
** svcadm disable/enable network:/hobbit-client-serverconf

== How to participate the hobbit development ==
* subscribe to hobbit mailing list
* create an account on en.wikibooks.org to participate in hobbit documentation effort.
* learn from http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/CPAM_with_TWW to participate in hobbit automated cross-platform software packaging effort.
=== Setup your development environment ===

==== On OpenSolaris x86 ====
===== Using prebuilt OpenSoalris VMWare Image =====
* Download OpenSolaris VMWare Image from here(TBA).
* Install VMWare player 3.0 from here(TBA).
===== Using VirtualBox OpenSolaris Image =====
==== On Solaris 10 Intel ====
* host info
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00# which cvs
/opt/csw/bin/cvs
bash-3.00# uname -a
SunOS unknown 5.10 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc
bash-3.00# which gcc
/opt/csw/gcc3/bin/gcc
bash-3.00# which gmake
/opt/csw/bin/gmake
bash-3.00#
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== On RedHat Linux ====
==== Setup your TWW developement ====
* download TWW tools onto your system
* compile hobbit*.[sb|pb].

=== checkout source code from sourceforge.net  ===
=== Read the source codes  ===
=== Feedback to Hobbit ===
* include your fix,patch, modules addition to sourceforge.net

== Hobbit Functional diagrams ==
=== Hobbit server ===
&lt;pre&gt;

So the core design looks like this:


   Network tests --\
                    \
            TCP:1984 \           IPC
   Clients ----------&gt; hobbitd --------&gt; hobbitd_channel ---&gt; worker module
                     /         Sh. mem.                 stdin
                    /
   Custom tests ---/


     
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Windows Hobbit client  ===

[http://bbwin.sourceforge.net/ BB Win]

== Hobbit Modules Development ==
== Developing Hobbit by Existing Internet Development Environment ==
=== Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit ===

[[System Monitoring with Hobbit/HOWTO/Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit]]
http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/hobbit-tips.html#scripts

== Developing Hobbit by CPAM/TWW Development Environment ==
=== Why use CPAM/TWW tool ? ===
* Pros
** Hobbit server and client need to be cross-platform thus the need of CPAM/TWW.
** Like Emacs editor, it can will be run everywhere without license. TWW tools is GPL opensource so it can be ported to any OS.
** A structural and automated approach to deal with packages creation and management.
* Cons
** Another learning curve need to climb.
** Changing people's development habit is hard.

=== Supported OS ===
* Solaris Sparc
* RH AS 3.0
* HP-UX 11.11
== Hobbit package sources ==
=== Hobbit client on MS windows Overview ===
# bbwin (Xymon client) is implemented in c++. It requires opensource software like boost c++ libary and tinyXML. 
# The packaging tool it used is Microsoft's opensource packaging tool - [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/ WiX]to do the Win32 packaging.
# The detals building instruction is [http://bbwin.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bbwin/trunk/Build.txt?revision=21&amp;view=markup build.txt] on bbwin project site. 
# You have two ways to build BBWin.msi, 
## Use Microsoft's make: nmake
## Use &quot;Build Soultion&quot; in VS2008.

Following is a procedure to create a Windows XP development box so you can create your own  BBWin.msi.

== Prepare your Xymon win32  build environment ==
# Install [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985 hhc.exe],it is used to compile html doc into windows chm help file.
## add &quot;C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop&quot; into PATH so hhc.exe is accessible.
# Install Visual Studio 2008 Standard or Professional Edition.
# Make sure your cmd.exe has following PATH name addition. echo %PATH% %INCLUDE% %LIB% in your DOS prompt.
## PATH
## &quot;LIB=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib\.;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\LIB;&quot;
## INCLUDE
 &lt;pre&gt;
 INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include\.;
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include\atl;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include
 &lt;/pre&gt;

#[http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases/ WiX opensource packaging tool from Microsoft]: this is use to turn the compiled binary into MS MSI package format.
# [http://www.boost.org/ Boost C++ library]:These powerful C++ libraries are used for some agents and will be certainly used in the BBWin core service in the future. 
##  [http://www.boostpro.com/download/ Download the pre-compiled 1.35 one for VS2008] and install it under C:\boost directory.
# [http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/ TinyXML]: BBWin used the excellent TinyXML library for the configuration loading XML. You do not need to download and install it. TinyXML sources are included in BBWin sources.
# Prepare your source code editors:
## [http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net notepade++]:
## [http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/ XEmacs for win32]:

# checkout bbwin src.
## Using command &quot;svn co https://bbwin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bbwin bbwin&quot;
# Change the Makefile code for C:\boost installation.
## Modify Makefile to point INCLUDE to C:\boost and LIB to include C:\boost\lib\*.lib
## Modify C/C++ iclude c:\boost and Linker to include c:\boost\lib\*.
# Optional software installation
## install cygwin to have a strong unix enviroment on your windows box. So you can run command like following to clean up *.obj file that current makefile can't do.
## Clean up Release directory by Deleting Setup/*.msi
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rm Setup/*
$ rm Release/*
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== Build the bbwin using command line approach ====
BBWin.msi creation process is automated in &quot;C:\BBWin\trunk\Setup\Makefile&quot;.
This makefile will be called from &quot;C:\BBWin\trunk\Makefile&quot;
* Make sure your nmake command is avaiable.

follow text will turn into wiki procedure above.
Build file for BBWin
    2 ==============================================================
    3 
    4 This file explains you how to build BBWin from the sources.
    5 
    6 
    7 Getting the last sources 
    8 ========================
    9 
   10 BBWin is developped in C++ (the Standard Template Library and the Standard C++ Library
   11 are used)
   12 The source of BBWin are available from the sourceforge subversion
   13 repository for the BBWin projects :
   14 http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/bbwin/
   15 
   16 
   17 Install the tools
   18 =================
   19 
   20 BBWin has been developped thanks to many tools. You should install them to 
   21 build BBWin easily without troubles.
   22 
   23 Windows Platform SDK 2003 : it is used for the development environment.
   24 It is use to have the complete sdk to develop programs on Microsoft OS.
   25 You can download it for free from microsoft website :
   26 http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&amp;displaylang=en
   27 You will need 1 gb of free space if you install every thing :)

   28 BBWin Makefiles are using the nmake tool and Makefile templates from the SDK.
   29 This SDK is very important for anyone who would like to start developping under Windows.
   30 
   31 Visual C++ Toolkit : it is the compiler used to build the bbwin release
   32 It is the original compiler from Visual Studio 2003 Professional (Code optimisation is included)
   33 You can download it for free from the Microsoft website :
   34 http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/
   35 
   36 Wix Toolkit : this package is used to build the BBWin MSI installer
   37 You should install it and have the bin directory in your current path
   38 http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/
   39 
   40 TinyXML : BBWin used the excellent TinyXML library for the configuration loading XML.
   41 You do not need to install it. TinyXML sources are included in BBWin sources.
   42 
   43 Boost Lib : These powerful C++ libraries are used for some agents and will be
   44 certainly used in the BBWin core service in the future.
   45 You should get the boost C++ from the website : 
   46 http://www.boost.org/
   47 Build it in the directory C:\boost so you won't have to change BBWin Makefiles.
   48 If you want to build BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2005, please read the following page :
   49 http://www.boost.org/tools/build/v1/vc-8_0-tools.html
   50 
   51 
   52 I recommand you the Notepad++ editor if you are looking for a nice free code editor.
   53 You can download it from : 
   54 http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net
   55 
   56 
   57 
   58 Building the BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2005
   59 ===============================================
   60 
   61 Open the BBWin.sln file at the top directory of the project
   62 First, you should prepare your Visual C++ configuration by adding
   63 in the default bin, include and lib directories the different directories from :
   64 
   65 - the platform SDK
   66 - the boost libraries
   67 
   68 Then just build the solution.
   69 
   70 
   71 Building the BBWin with Visual C++ ToolKit 2003
   72 ===============================================
   73 
   74 Open a Platform SDK Build command line environment (installed with the Platform SDK)
   75 Go the top directory of the BBWin source tree
   76 Type nmake
   77 Go get a cup of coffee
   78 It's ready !

   80 If you get errors, it may be due to some errors in your include or lib path.
   81 Make sure the environment variables %Lib%; %Path% and %Include% are correctly 
   82 configured. You may need to add some directories.

== Package build automation  ==

=== The Makefile to automate the whole process ===

== Create a firefox search engine plugin for hobbit server ==
* References: http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/deepdocs.html

== Using relational DBs with Xymon Server ==
The default database back end of Xymon is RRD(Roun-Robin Database).
=== Database ===
==== RRD ====
==== SQLite3 ====
* Almost as fast as C fopen function code.
* No server process, data are store in plain files.
* Just like another rrd file that can be rsynced over to your standby xymon server.

==== MySql ====
* light weight DB.
==== Oracle ====
==== LDAP ====
==== XML flat file ====

=== Benefits of using relation DBs ===
==== Inventory Monitoring ====
* Store a machine's asset information
** Serial Number
** OS type
** Computer Maker
** Leased/owned 
** Trigger an alert if leasing is expiring soon.
** Display pie chart of OS type,Makers ... etc.

==== bb-hosts generation ====
* bb-hosts files got generated from host database table.

=== MVC Implementation ===
==== Mysql + PHP + EXTJS ====
==== Catalyst/SQLite ====
===== Bill of Materials =====
* Catalyst Book 1
* perl-5.10.0
* Fedora 11
* Address Book Example in Book 1.
* SQLite3
* Catalyst::Runtime,Catalyst::Plugins::*,Catalyst::Devel.
* Sql files to create Asset schema.
===== Procedures =====
* Use catalyst.pl to initiate your MVC project with sample templates.

=== Upgrade Xymon Web GUI ===
Current Xymon(Hobbit) is coded in C and using CGI and html code to compose a simple web interface.
Recently, we have a few javascript framework choices to upgrade xymon server with RIA web interface.

==== Using qwikioffice for Xymon Dashboard ====

==== Replace Xymon C/CGI with C/EXTJS ====
 
* [http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/ JSON in C]

== Compilation Errors and Warning ==
=== Possible Solutions ===
* To remove &quot;unsigned char&quot; usage hobbit src tree.
&lt;pre&gt;
 find . -type f -name &quot;*.[c|h]&quot; -exec perl -pi -e 's!unsigned\schar!char!g' {} \;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* To cast the char that need to be unsigned.

=== GCC Compilation Warnings  ===
* pointer targets in assignment differ in signedness

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''international organization''' (also called '''intergovernmental organization''') is an [[w:organization]] of international scope or character. There are two main types of international organizations: international intergovernmental organizations, whose members are sovereign states; and [[w:non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), which are private organizations. Generally the term international organization is used to mean international governmental organizations only. It is in this sense that the term is used in the remainder of this article.

Legally speaking, an international organization must be established by a treaty providing it with [[w:legal entity|legal recognition]]. International organizations so established are subjects of international law, capable of entering into agreements among themselves or with states. Thus international organizations in a legal sense are distinguished from mere groupings of states, such as the [[w:G-8]] and the [[w:G-77]], neither of which have been founded by treaty, though in non-legal contexts these are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well. International organizations must also be distinguished from treaties; while all international organizations are founded on a treaty, many treaties (e.g., the [[w:North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA)) do not establish an international organization and rely purely on the parties for their administration.

International organizations can be categorised in two main ways: by their membership, and by their function.

International organizations differ in who their members are and in who is permitted to join them. Membership of some organizations (global organizations) is open to all the nations of the world. This category includes the [[w:United Nations]] and its specialized agencies, as well as the [[w:World Trade Organization]]. 

Some specialized agencies predate all other types. In the [[w:nineteenth century]], [[w:France]] was the ''fons et origo'' of many of them. By this it is meant that much of the driving force to form such bodies (such as those which maintain the [[w:metric system]]) came from the French, and that their headquarters is in France, often in [[w:Paris]]. Under the [[w:Third Republic]], the [[w:Exposition Universelle (1878)|International Exposition of 1878]] in that city held a great number of meetings of such international organizations - as opposed to the preceding regimes. The motivation was that to keep France a republic and not slip back into either a monarchist or [[w:Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] regime, the republicans would underscore their inheritance of the crusading nature of the [[w:French Revolution]] against feudal cultural remnants within France, which had been generalized to the rest of feudal Europe, eventually to the world. Some conclude from this example that internationalism often has national origins, at the difference of [[w:globalism]].

Other organizations are only open to members from a particular region of the world. Finally, some organizations base their membership on other criteria: cultural or historical links (the [[w:Commonwealth of Nations]], [[w:La Francophonie]]), level of economic development or type of economy ([[w:Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[w:OPEC|Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries]] (OPEC)), or religion ([[w:Organization of the Islamic Conference]]).

Were it to come about, the ultimate international organization would be a [[w:federation|federal]] [[w:world government]].

== Examples of global organizations ==

* [[w:World Trade Organization]]
* [[w:Universal Postal Union]]

== Examples of regional organizations ==

* Africa: the [[w:African Union]] (formerly the [[w:Organization for African Unity]]), [[w:Conseil de l'Entente]], [[w:Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[w:Southern African Development Community]] (SADC)
* Asia: [[w:Asian Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD), [[w:Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), [[w:South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), [[w:Gulf Cooperation Council]]

* Trans-atlantic: [[w:North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO), [[w:Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE)
* Eurasian: [[w:Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), [[w:Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), [[w:Eurasian Economic Community]]
* Pacific: [[w:Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), [[w:Pacific Islands Forum]]

* [[w:Unión Latina]] 
* [[w:Non-Aligned Movement]]
* [[w:Arab League]]
* [[w:Organization of the Islamic Conference]]

[[Image:world_government_hierarchy.gif|right]]

A '''world government''' is a hypothetical entity consisting of a single or series of levels of government with authority encompassing the entire planet. No such world government has ever existed, although large empires and superpowers have attained something of that level of power; historical examples have generally been hindered by the fact that insufficient communications and travel made a world organisation of any sort, much less an entire government, unfeasible.  This article will examine what proposals have been made for a world government, and which movements have advocated such a state.

Some internationalists seek the establishment of a world government as a way of establishing freedom and a benign rule of law over the world. Some (including internationalists) have concerns that a world government would need to respect the diversity of the nations or peoples it includes. Others regard a global government as a nightmarish possibility, with a malevolent world government creating an endless totalitarian state without the prospect of escape or revolution. The alternative term '''global political monoculture''' emphasizes the latter fears perceived by some to be developing via either  the transnational corporations or international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund the World Trade Organization and World Bank. Similarly, the term '''global cosmopolitan democracy''' describes a world government based on respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 

Many modern internationalists say that current shortcomings in the international order may be redressed not by merely opposing globalization, which they see as an inevitable and even welcome process, but by counterbalancing the ills brought by over-centralization or purely economic interests (such as violation of human rights - including labor rights - and sociocultural and environmental integrity) with similarly global representative democratic institutions having supranational authority.

The idea of world government is often explored in science fiction, either as a central theme or as plot backdrop.

==Multinational empires, federations and unions==

Effective governance of multiple nations has been accomplished in the past either by empire, by federation, or by supranational union.

=== Empires with pretensions or asprirations to world dominance ===

* Perhaps the empire coming closest to dominance of the then-known world was Alexander's in 323 BC, an empire which sought to fuse the disparate cultures of its rapidly conquered territories rather than impose a Macedonian template.
:&quot;When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.&quot; (Attributed to John Milton&lt;sup id=&quot;Footnote_1&quot;&gt;[[#Footnotes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;)

* The Roman Empire (1st century BC to 5th century AD) ruled most of the Mediterranean rim, as well as parts of the Celtic regions of Northern Europe. 

* The Mongol Empire of the 13th century was probably the largest continuous land empire of all time, ruling about half of the world population. Most historians believe that Western Europe would also have fallen under Mongol rule had the news of Ögedei Khan's death not forced Batu Khan to suspend his campaign.

* Ming Dynasty China had dominion over the &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;, which it believed all significant culture, science, and art in the world. On the verge of global naval dominance the Chinese fleet was recalled partially because the Emperor was thought to need nothing in the outside world. Jared Diamond has advanced the thesis that a government, such as China's, without meaningful external opposition will tend to technologically and socially stagnate; many modern objections to World Government are based on the long decline of Imperial China.

* The Ottoman Empire which ended in 1922, covered the entire Arab world, to include the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe and Asia. 

* The British Empire reached its peak in early 20th century, ruling over about a quarter of Earth's population. 

* The Soviet Union (&quot;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; - USSR) stretched over large parts of the northern Eurasian continent from 1922 to 1991. Until 1935 it proposed a global communist government through exported revolution and military expansion.

=== Voluntary unions of polities in history ===

Countries like Switzerland and Belgium developed confederal forms of government centuries ago to bring diverse groups together to peacefully form stable and effective societies that continue to respect internal linguistic and ethnic diversity. The Netherlands established the world's first federation by creating the United Provinces in 1581 by signing of the Oath of Abjuration. The United States established the world's second federation with the replacement of the Articles of Confederation by the Federal Constitution of 1787, which has since been emulated by dozens of countries. In addition, the extent of the United States' influence both military and economically in affairs outside its borders has been described as an American Empire. India, the world's largest democracy, is a federation of dozens of peoples, each with its own culture and language. 

More recently, the evolving and expanding European Union has attempted to unite a large group of widely diverse, formerly hostile, nations spread over a large geographical area. The EU's lead is being followed by the African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the South American Community of Nations. These multinational associations are at different stages of development, but they are all growing, both in coverage and in extent of economic and political integration.

The total population currently aggregated under multi-national political governance organizations, either a full federation or an evolving regional integration process, is approximately 3 billion, about a half of humanity.

==Functional international institutions==

The United Nations (UN) is the primary institution coordinating human activities on a global scale. In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the World Health Organization the International Labour Organization, and International Telecommunications Union ([http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html chart]). Of particular interest politically are the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were formed together in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, 1944, to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. The World Trade Organization (WTO) sets the rules of international trade. It already has a semi-legislative body (The General Council, reaching decisions by consensus), and a judicial body (The Dispute Settlement Body).

There is also a body of international law, encompassing international treaties, customs, and globally acceptable legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) (also known as World Court) is the judiciary organ of the United Nations. It settles disputes submitted to it voluntarily by states (only), and gives advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by other organs of th UN, such as the General Assembly or Security Council.

A recent development towards the establishment of the rule of global law is The International Criminal Court (ICC). This is the first ever permanent, treaty based, international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished. Of ninety-two countries who signed the treaty, forty-seven - including the United States - have not ratified it, citing various concerns about sovereignty and legal jurisdictions.

==Theories of international integration==

A number of scholars have theorized as to how a world government might come into being peacefully. Two general schools of thought on this are functional and regional integration. According to the functional school, world government would arise through all the nations of the world gradually establishing international bodies to deal with particular issues (trade, communications, health, etc.)&amp;mdash;these bodies would slowly grow in power, and, having succeeded their parent states in terms of importance, finally be federated to form one world government. According to the regional school, the formation of a world government would be preceded by the formation of regional governments in different parts of the world, these regional governments later joining together to form one world government. As described above, both forms of integration are currently active and growing in scope.

Both these schools of thought see the peaceful establishment of a world government as a slow and gradual process, which will take decades, if not centuries. However, others argue that a world government could come about very quickly, through an agreement between all the nations of the world. Such a view was quite popular in the idealism of the post-World War II era (one famous proponent being Garry Davis but by the end of the 1950s had been revealed to be quite unrealistic, at least in the climate of the times. Although there is no reason theoretically why it could not happen, the practical rules of politics (especially in today's world) make the sudden establishment of such a body highly unlikely, and the gradual route holds much more promise. Many who see the establishment of a world government as desirable still hold out hope.

Of course, both possibilities can operate.  Just as human society has evolved in progressively larger units of cohesion despite many setbacks&amp;mdash;and while pushed forward rapidly at times by the results of occasional calamities and/or ingenuity and opportunity, many have proposed that this tendency toward stronger coordination, yet with decentralized control, is an inevitable path.  The United States government, for example, did not come immediately into being (nor, its advocates would argue, at the expense of individuality).  The states of the union were initially quite resistant to the idea of supplying any resources to the national government (if they supported one at all).  However, certain events such as impending war with Great Britain drew its constituent elements closer to each other along another global trend, self-determination.  Although self-determination may seem the opposite of unification, federalists (whether national or international) argue that it is actually a prerequisite to true unification (though empires have undoubtedly achieved some measure of standardization and unification).  Once &quot;liberated&quot; to sufficiently govern their own affairs, states can associate with others in balanced relationships which allow mutual benefit.  However, such a unification brought about by war as the United States experienced was not sufficient to weld its constituent elements firmly together.  The  Articles of Confederation deliberately created a weak federal government, dedicated to the independence of the states, without even the power to raise troops in wartime. Despite this, the loose coallition was able to defeat the greatest military power of its day. However, some in Congress were unsatisfied with this, and considered the central government too weak. They thought that it might not be able to respond efficiently to serious crises in future. Therefore, the &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; of the (federal) United States devised a system which prevented the national government being ineffectual without undue interference in the affairs of the states. However, the American Civil War shattered this equilibrium, with the federal government waging war against break-away states. It has been argued that this test of the system was due to its being tied in its own contradictions of &quot;self-determination&quot; regarding the issue of slavery, and that the Civil War strengthened the nation's unity.  Much effort was also spent through educational avenues to inculcate a new sense of national unity amidst the people who had previously felt no special loyalty to those from other states.

Parallels have been drawn to the current state of weak world governance (through the United Nations and other related regional or international institutions) with the United States' Articles of Confederation.  In the current system of the United Nations, many have argued that this present system gives too much weight to state sovereignty and too little to cohesive action.  For example, any of 5 permanent members of the Security Council can veto any matter brought before it (not only security matters).  The World Parliament (the General Assembly), it is argued, hardly represents the people, since it is not elected by the people in a separate election for international governance (and in many cases, the governments currently choosing the representatives are unelected themselves). Furthermore, the representation is not proportional in any manner to population (unlike most bicameral legislatures, including the United States House of Representatives), and their decisions are not in any way binding (besides expressing opinion).  Moreover, the participating nations admitted into the United Nations General Assembly are in many cases oppressive dictatorships not accountable to their own people (perhaps parallel to the southern states of the U.S. before the Civil War not allowing black people basic economic or political freedoms such as the right to vote). The World Court, likewise, is severely limited in its powers in being able to adjudicate in matters not agreed to be brought before it by both parties, or if the parties are not states.  Even those belonging to permanent member countries have argued that such sovereignty only begets anarchy in getting things accomplished (especially during the Cold War).  While federalists are equally wary of the dangers of over-centralization, they argue that many aspects of the United Nations system (or a new system) should be sufficiently strengthened to allow effective action, whether dealing with security or auxiliary issues argued to be related to security.

(Besides federalism, some internationalists point to the model of a commonwealth for the future patterning of a world government which can offer another type of balance between national and international control.)

==Hopes and fears==

The forces of globalization have caused major changes in the type of threats and opportunities facing humanity. In many ways the world already operates as a single society, where everyone’s activities affect everyone else. Environmental damage that crosses international borders, nuclear weapons proliferation, terrorism, unchecked national militarism, international crime, cruel regimes, anarchic states and refugees are all examples of issues that cannot be fully addressed by individual national governments, or even by voluntary multilateral treaties and agreements. While some military spending contributes to prosperity, advocates of world government hope that non-military means of providing security will be more economical and free up resources that can stimulate prosperity directly and more efficiently. They hope that a worldwide democratic electorate would reassign military budgets to stimulate economic growth in poor countries, e.g., by improving education and productivity-amplifying infrastructure, and the global maintenance of the rule of law. The local populations, however, may prefer to reallocate military budgets to lowering taxes or increasing local social welfare spending instead.  

Beyond the humane benefits, advocates claim such reallocation would eliminate, once and for all, inter-governmental threats, including a large-scale nuclear holocaust (World War III). At the end of the second world war, nationalists and internationalists alike found this to be a compelling motive for the formation of world government: 

: &quot;Unless we establish some form of world government, it will not be possible for us to avert a World War III in the future.&quot; (Winston Churchill, 1945).

: &quot;As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is inevitable. There is no salvation for civilization, or even the human race, other than the creation of a world government.&quot; (Albert Einstein, 1945 [http://universal-democracy.editme.com/QuotesCitations from &quot;World Citizen Quotes&quot;]) 

While acknowledging that a world government may be wasteful and inefficient, proponents contend that the costs of not having such a government are far higher. Conversely, they claim that the currently fragmented and loosely coordinated system of international governance misses countless opportunities for beneficial collaboration across national boundaries. To quote H.G. Wells (''The Outline of History'', 1922): ''&quot;There can be little question that the attainment of a federation of all humanity, together with a sufficient measure of social justice, to ensure health, education, and a rough measure of equality of opportunity to most of the children born into the world, would mean such a release and increase of human energy as to open a new phase in human history.&quot;''

From the above observations, advocates of world government hope that enlightened self-interest at the national level would naturally lead to the rise of a world government, without the common external threats that led states and provinces to federate into countries in previous centuries. In the short term, however, many hurdles remain to be overcome.

National governments in positions of greater military or economic power enjoy greater freedom to pursue their agendas with lower concern for the reaction of governments of less powerful nations. Accepting the supremacy of global law requires such governments to accept additional constraints on the range of available actions they may take, and to comply with decisions of courts over which they have limited control. Even when support of a global authority is of clear benefit to the majority of citizens of a country, such support may still act against the desire of individual government members for greater personal influence. This unfortunate conflict of interests is much amplified in despotic regimes, reducing the likelihood that a democratic federal government with global jurisdiction can be established prior to the complete elimination of dictatorial governments at the national level.

There are also hurdles to expanding popular support for the idea. People in many countries feel intense loyalty to their nation-state and/or legally protected rights, resulting in reluctance to accept arrangements in which national sovereignty is compromised. In Western systems which place high value on individual autonomy, discussions of a global government sometimes invoke frightening visions of absolute collective or dictatorial control from which there is no escape. Others are concerned that proper controls over a remote world government would be difficult to implement, leading to excessive waste, corruption and abuse of power. To quote former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater: ''&quot;A government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away.&quot;'' 
On the other hand, some people in non-Western countries under the hegemony of their cultures and ruling oligarchies, demonize the anarchy of individuality and are suspicious of world government for fears that Western powers will unduly impose their values through control of these institutions.

Some religious teachings, such as those of the Bahá'í Faith and Unitarian Universalism, are highly supportive of a world government. At the other extreme, numerous fundamentalist Christians in the U.S. associate the idea of world government (and, indeed, powerful international organizations in general) with the Antichrist and the End Times.  (See, for example, Pat Robertson's book ''The New World Order''.)

Despite the slow progress, many advocates remain hopeful that ingenuity, education, statesmanship, and other proactive efforts would continue to advance support among nations and their leaders for a greater political and social union based on justice, consultation, and respect for state and individual rights. The desire of countries bordering the European Union to join it, in effect creating a voluntarily expanding democratic empire, demonstrates the attraction of a multi-national political and economical integration. (However, the apparent reluctance of many within the union to allow rapid expansion may be a countervailing indicator). Nations in Africa (AU), South America (SACN) and South-East Asia (ASEAN) have launched similar political integration efforts. Activist organizations, such as the World Federalist Movement, continue to promote the idea of a global federal democracy amongst national governments, and are constantly seeking to expand their membership.

===The United Nations as a budding federal world government===
{{npov}}
The United Nations currently mainly serves as a forum for the world's sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action. As such, it is not set up to easily evolve into a federal world government. Its most critical deficiencies are (1) legitimacy and (2) power.

Legitimacy is lacking in that the operation of the UN is not based on widely accepted democratic principles, such as proportional representation (each government has one vote regardless of population size, or whether it truly represents that population) or equality of status (some countries have permanent seats and veto power in the security council). Some proposals for improving the UN's legitimacy involve the introduction of weighted voting, the establishment of a directly-elected parliamentary organ, or the creation of an additional body (internal or external) open only to self-styled democracies.

Power is lacking in that implementation of its decisions is entirely dependent on the goodwill of its members. It has no legal power to directly collect taxes to fund operations, maintain an army or a police force, or directly impose economical penalties on national governments refusing to comply with its decisions. Proposals for increasing the UN's power include the direct collection of taxes, for instance:
* Taxing international monetary transactions (the &quot;Tobin Tax&quot;) 
* Licensing the use of global commons (oceans, space)
An independent income would permit the UN to establish its own standing rapid-deployment military and police forces. 

A proposal called the binding triad would make General Assembly resolutions binding if approved by a group of nations representing a majority of
*The world's population;
*UN financial contributions; and
*The membership of the General Assembly.

One the most significant current hurdle to the growth in UN influence is the reluctance of the current US administration to concede autonomy, especially following the refusal of the Security Council to approve a military attack on Iraq in early 2003 and the subsequent declaration of this attack as illegal by the UN's Secretary General. Some hope that the reluctance of the US government to support further UN growth would be overcome by reform, openness and accountability in the UN, and demonstrated integrity and transparency in the administration of international law. Others believe that a refusal by other nations to collaborate with the US other than via the UN (or other rule-governed institutions) would be necessary.

==Attributed ideologies==

Various people attribute, though not at times without caricature, the idea of a world government to, often exclusively, and often with false assumptions, ideologies (frequently extreme) such as :

===Nazism===
Adolf Hitler attempted to establish a &quot;thousand year Reich&quot; that, at the very least, would have encompassed Europe and Russia. It seems probable that had Hitler been successful in this, he would have eventually attempted to conquer the rest of the world. However, he believed that a state was at its strongest when at war, so perpetual or recurring war would probably have been something he would advocate; thus negating the possibility of a complete world government.

===Neoliberalism===
Neoliberals rarely advocate a world ''government'' in the classical sense of the word, and prefer instead a single world-wide ''economic order'' of free market capitalism. Their aim would be the eventual integration of all countries into this economic order, with the removal of all trade barriers and (in some cases) the removal of all regulations on capitalism. Strands of neoliberal thought influence the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are the focus of opposition from the anti-globalization movement.

===Communism===
The communist movement has an ideal of world government emerging from the voluntary co-operation of communist countries, presumably after capitalism has been overthrown. However, in the past, many communist states showed distrust or even outright hostility towards each other (see the [[w:Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet split]] between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China). 

In particular, Leon Trotsky is famous&amp;mdash;and probably foremost among communists&amp;mdash;in advocating a &quot;world revolution,&quot; as opposed to the single-state visions of Stalin and Mao. His supporters have suffered alienation within the communist movement, however, due in large part to the propaganda of the Soviet Union against Trotsky. They have been making a comeback only since the fall of the Soviet Union.

===Anarchism===
Although anarchists advocate a world not divided by borders, which they regard as nothing but artificial boundaries, and are generally against nationalism, they do not advocate a world government as such, because government itself is an institution they believe to be morally wrong and harmful. Instead, anarchists propose a world order based on free association and mutual aid, though this may vary depending on the specific branch of anarchism in question (see the main article on anarchism for further details).

===Conspiracy theory===
A number of conspiracy theories postulate the existence of a mysterious global cabal that controls the world, or large portions of it, from behind the scenes.  Other theories prophecise (or warn of) domination of the world by a single entity, often referred to as a &quot;One World Government&quot;.

===A large, loving family===
When children are young, their basic needs (food, shelter and clothing) are provided, and it should be possible to create in time a world government that will abolish all poverty-related hardships, possibly combined with a limitation of populations to areas where there is, and will be, enough for all. It may also involve other limitations, such as a guidance of students into careers where there will be certain to be a job for them when they are ready for a job. Probably there have already been (unsuccessful?) attempts to build such a society on a small scale.

===A society based on systems in a healthy human body===
The human body includes many highly successful systems that together do their best to keep the body working, and even working well, such as the food processing, the garbage/rubbish expulsion, the regulation of body temperature, the defences against various bacteria and virus infections. etc. The various organs do their work reliably and without strikes, slowdowns, etc. and they work for the well-being of the whole body, not just for individual selfish aims. Possibly there have already been (unsuccessful?) attempts to build such a society on a small scale.

==World government in science fiction==

In both science fiction and utopian/dystopian novels, authors have made frequent use of the age-old idea of a global state and, accordingly, of world government. In tune with Immanuel Kant|Kant's vision of a world state based on the voluntary union of all countries of this planet in order to avoid colonialism and in particular any future war (&quot;Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbürgerlicher Absicht&quot;, 1784; &quot;Zum ewigen Frieden&quot;, 1795), some of these scenarios depict an egalitarian and environmentally sustainable world supervised (rather than controlled) by a benevolent (and usually democratic) world government. Others, however, describe the effects of a totalitarian regime which, after having seized power in one country, annexes the rest of the world in order to dominate and oppress all humankind. James L. Halperin's novel ''The Truth Machine'' (1996) is an example of the former while Ira Levin's ''This Perfect Day'' (1970) and the evangelical Christian Left Behind series are examples of the latter.

'''''The Truth Machine''''' envisages the future of humankind after the invention of a device which is much more reliable than conventional lie detectors. Mass marketed and as small and cheap as a mobile phone, the truth machine is available to everyone so that lying has become something which just does not pay any longer and, consequently, is generally considered erratic behaviour which used to occur in the past. Also, crime has become almost obsolete. As politicians are in no way exempt from being continually checked, no economy with the truth can be found in their speeches or soundbites any longer, and only those who really wish well are prepared to take office. As the only remaining superpower, the United States of America takes the lead and all the other nations readily join in to form a truly global society.

The '''''Left Behind''''' books are a series of novels that tell the story of the Rapture according to evangelical Christian theology. The stories center around the quick rise to power of a charismatic, populist Romanian politician named Nicholae who is eventually appointed Secretary General of the United Nations. Once in power, Nicholae advocates a series of popular proposals, such as a global currency and massive international disarmament. Eventually, all countries unite into one &quot;Global Community.&quot; However, things quickly turn sinister, and although Nicholae remains increasingly revered (now as &quot;Global Pontiff&quot;) he institutes increasingly totalitarian measures to unite the world, such as allowing only one legal religion, and only one global media outlet. Nicholae is eventually seen as the antichrist, and is rejected by the books' Christian protagonists. The idea that the antichrist will be the leader and chief advocate of a world government is a popular theory among believers in Christian Rapture theory. 

'''''This Perfect Day''''' is set in a seemingly perfect global society whose genesis remains vague (&quot;Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei led us to this perfect day&quot; is what schoolchildren have to chant). The world is ruled by a central computer called UniComp which has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. People are continually drugged by means of regular injections so that they can never realize their potential as human beings. They are told where to live, what to eat and which job to take. Everyone wears a bracelet with a scanner which tells them where they are allowed to go and what they are allowed to do. At 65, they receive a lethal injection. Even opposition against such a life by those few who happen to be resistant to the drug and who consequently wake up to a day which for them turns out to be anything but perfect is dealt with by the programmers of UniComp who, in their underground hideaway, constitute the world government.

=== Lunar government ===
''Main article: [[w:Lunar Government|Lunar Government]]''

Perhaps the most promising prospect in the near future for a single world government may be on the moon. Administration of Lunar territories may initially follow the Antarctic model, whereby land is divided up amongst existing nations. Once a sufficient population has developed, several thousand perhaps, a path towards self-governance could be forged through either the UN or by a unilateral declaration of independence. (This would be a “world government” in the sense of unitary planetary authority but would lead to the balkanization of the solar system, and would actually create more, rather than fewer sovereign governments.)

== Footnotes ==

[[#Footnote_1|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] The Milton attribution for this line is a popular myth, not confirmed by any of his known work. [http://www.pothos.org/alexander.asp?paraID=96 pothos.org] has located the likely origin in an essay be Plutarch: 
: &quot;'Alexander cried when he heard Anaxarchus talk about the infinite number of worlds in the universe. One of Alexander's friends asked him what was the matter, and he replied: &quot;There are so many worlds, and I have not yet conquered even one.&quot;' (&quot;On Contentment of the Mind&quot; in Plutach's [[w:Plutarch#Other Works|''Moralia'']].)
In one sense the original quote has the opposite meaning to the legendary one, but both imply that he had the future conquest of the entire world within his grasp. Had he not died at 33, perhaps he would have created the first World government.

'''Green politics''' is a body of political ideas informed by [[w:environmentalism]] aimed at developing a [[w:sustainability|sustainable]] society. It is considered by its advocates to be an alternative to both [[w:left-wing politics|left]] and [[w:right-wing politics|right]] views and parties, although adherents to both views tend to view [[w:Greens]] as &quot;on the other side&quot;. Certainly it is true that [[w:Worldwide green parties|Green parties]] advocate measures that appear to conventional politicians different from those grouped into [[w:labour (economics)|labour]] and [[w:capital]] by economic interests.

Some of these views include:
*a commitment to the methods of [[w:consensus decision making]], [[w:participatory democracy]] and [[w:deliberative democracy]] wherever feasible
*a [[w:green tax shift]] that would increase consumption and sales taxes on all resource-intensive items, while reducing [[w:income tax]] and [[w:capital gains tax]] - a position also associated with [[w:Libertarianism]] and seen as extreme by many on the left and right.
*a cessation of all taxes levied against strictly local production and trade - a position shared only by some advocates of [[w:Libertarianism]]
*local and [[w:moral purchasing]] provisions for [[w:government]] especially, requiring the source of supply to follow similar environmental and labour standards as those prevailing in the consuming jurisdiction - a position usually associated with liberal religious groups, [[w:pacifist]]s, and left-[[w:feminism]]
*[[w:measuring well-being]] as an alternative to [[w:consumer price index]] based  means of measuring [[w:economic growth]] - seen also as a radical left-wing position especially as it would impact the [[w:money supply]] and measures of [[w:inflation]].
*[[w:full cost accounting]] and an end to [[w:dirty subsidy]] of [[w:pollution]] by [[w:government]]  - another economically neoliberal position, ending [[w:corporate welfare]] and requiring corporations to compete on the basis of energy and waste savings.
*against [[w:nuclear power]] and the build up of [[w:persistent organic pollutants]] - based on a strict adherence to the [[w:precautionary principle]] where technologies are rejected unless they can be proven to not cause significant harm to the health of living things or the [[w:biosphere]]
*an end to biological forms of pollution and human health damage via the subsidy of [[w:dairy farming]] and the [[w:meat industry]] - a position that cuts against the tendency of both left and right to support [[w:family farm]]s without limit or conditions
*treating [[w:waste]] as a [[w:resource]] - a commodification of something of negative value, previously dumped into the [[w:commons]] without [[w:full cost accounting]]
*investing heavily in [[w:human capital]] - usually a left wing position when done by the public sector, and a right wing one if the investment is via the private sector
*[[w:accounting reform]] that would probably disadvantage both labour and large investors in favor of small investors, customers, and the public at large - more of a left wing position but not considered as a key issue by most left parties
*an end to the [[w:War on Drugs]] in the [[w:United States]] and [[w:Europe]] - seen as both a radical left wing and [[w:Libertarianism|Libertarian]] position
*an end to the [[w:War on Terrorism]] and the curtailment of [[w:civil rights]] - focusing instead on growing [[w:deliberative democracy]] in war-torn regions and the construction of a [[w:civil society]] with an increased role for women - this position is seen by many as a somewhat radical position
*[[w:urban secession]] by major cities to permit them to shake off control of the suburbs and renew their economies in ways that they cannot do if they require the permission of their surrounding regions, e.g. to tax, ban cars in downtowns, or put money in [[w:mass transit]] instead of [[w:highway]]s - this view is usually more associated with [[w:Libertarianism]] and extreme decentralization movements of both left and right
*[[w:bioregional democracy]] reflecting ecological boundaries in politics directly - a scale which tends to be smaller than existing [[w:nation-state]]s, and thus is a de facto [[w:secession]] movement, favored more by left than right in modern times, although historically the right wing was often defined by ethnic and tribal identities.

Because it lacks clear identification with powerful interest groups, and tends to appeal more to a world-view or [[w:mindset]], Green politics tends to grow slowly but also not to easily lose ground to other views or parties over time. In [[w:developed nation]]s Greens have typically stood at 3-12% of the vote for long periods of time without making breakthroughs, usually participating in government as a minority partner, or working at municipal or regional levels. Most Greens reject [[w:radical centrist politics]] though there is a strong overlap between that perspective and what is occasionally referred to as the &quot;realist&quot; wing of the Greens.

Basic statements of Green political values include the [[w:Four Pillars of the Green Party]] originally adopted by the [[w:European Greens]], the [[w:Ten Key Values of the Global Greens]] adopted by most English-speaking Greens in the [[w:1990s]], and the [[w:six core Green principles]] accepted in [[w:2001]].

Greens often refer to [[w:productivism]], [[w:consumerism]] and [[w:scientism]] as examples of &quot;grey&quot; views, which implies age, ashphalt and obsolete ideas of human social organization, including [[w:globalization]] of economic relations. Many Greens are important players in the [[w:anti-globalization movement]]. This involvement includes the full spectrum from [[w:street protesters]] to those building local alternatives to [[w:global economic monoculture]].

Green politics is usually said to include the [[w:green anarchism]], [[w:eco-anarchism]], [[w:anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and [[w:peace movement]]s - although these often claim not to be aligned with any party. Some claim it also includes [[w:feminism]], [[w:pacifism]] and the [[w:animal rights]] movements. Most Greens support special policy measures to empower women, especially mothers; to oppose war and de-escalate conflicts and stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict, and such unusual measures as [[w:Great Ape personhood]] to end [[w:ape genocide]], which they see as akin to [[w:genocide]] of primitive human populations, e.g. [[w:Stone Age Amazon]] tribes.

'''Globalization''' (or '''globalisation''') is a term used to describe the changes in societies and the world economy that are the result of dramatically increased trade and cultural exchange. In specifically economic contexts, it refers almost exclusively to the effects of trade, particularly trade liberalization or &quot;free trade&quot;
Between 1910 and 1950, a series of political and economic upheavals dramatically reduced the volume and importance of international trade flows. In the post-World War II environment, fostered by international economic institutions and rebuilding programs, international trade dramatically expanded. With the 1970s, the effects of this trade became increasingly visible, both in terms of the benefits and the disruptive effects.

== Meanings of Globalization ==
&quot;Globalization&quot; can mean:
*The formation of a global village &amp;mdash; closer contact between different parts of the world, with increasing possibilities of personal exchange, mutual understanding and friendship between &quot;world citizens&quot;, and creation of a global civilization. The World Bank defines globalization as the &amp;#8220;Freedom and ability of individuals and firms to initiate voluntary economic transactions with residents of other countries&amp;#8221;.
*Economic globalization &amp;mdash; 'free trade' and increasing relations among members of an industry in different parts of the world (globalization of an industry), with a corresponding erosion of National Sovereignty in the economic sphere. The IMF defines globalisation as &amp;#8220;the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide through increasing volume and variety of cross-border transactions in goods and services, freer international capital flows, and more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology&amp;#8221; (IMF, World Economic Outlook, May, 1997).
*The negative effects of for-profit multinational corporations &amp;mdash; the use of substantial and sophisticated legal and financial means to circumvent the bounds of local laws and standards, in order to leverage the labor and services of unequally-developed regions against each other.
*The spread of capitalism from developed to developing nations.
*&quot;The concept of Globalisation refers both to the compression of the world and the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole&quot; - Roland Robertson   

It shares a number of characteristics with internationalization and is used interchangeably, although some prefer to use globalization to emphasize the erosion of the nation-state or national boundaries. 

Globalism, if the concept is reduced to its economic aspects, can be said to contrast with economic nationalism and protectionism. It is related to laissez-faire capitalism and neoliberalism.

==History of globalization==
Since the word has both technical and political meanings, different groups will have differing histories of &quot;globalization&quot;. In general use within the field of economics and political economy, is, however, a history of increasing trade between nations based on stable institutions that allow individuals such as Masa and Kellie and firms in different nations to exchange goods with minimal friction. 

The term &quot;liberalization&quot; came to mean the combination of laissez-faire economic theory with the removal of barriers to the movement of goods. This led to the increasing specialization of nations in exports, and the pressure to end protective tariffs and other barriers to trade. The period of the gold standard and liberalization of the 19th century is often called &quot;The First Era of Globalization&quot;. Based on the Pax Britannica and the exchange of goods in currencies pegged to specie, this era grew along with industrialization. The theoretical basis was Ricardo's work on Comparative advantage and Say's Law of General equilibrium. In essence, it was argued that nations would trade effectively, and that any temporary disruptions in supply or demand would correct themselves automatically. The institution of the gold standard came in steps in major industrialized nations between approximately 1850 and 1880, though exactly when various nations were truly on the gold standard is a matter of a great deal of contentious debate. 

The &quot;First Era of Globalization&quot; is said to have broken down in stages beginning with the first World War, and then collapsing with the crisis of the gold standard in the late 1920's and early 1930's. 

Globalization in the era since World War II has been driven by Trade Negotiation Rounds, originally under the auspices of GATT which led to a series of agreements to remove restrictions on &quot;free trade&quot;. The Uruguay round led to a treaty to create the World Trade Organization or WTO, to mediate trade disputes. Other bilateral trade agreements, including sections of Europe's Maastricht Treaty and the North American Free Trade Agreement have also been signed in pursuit of the goal of reducing tariffs and barriers to trade.

==Signs of globalization==
Globalization has become identified with a number of trends, most of which may have developed since World War II. These include greater international movement of commodities, money, information, and people; and the development of technology, organizations, legal systems, and infrastructures to allow this movement. The actual existence of some of these trends are debated.
*Increase in international trade at a faster rate than the growth in the world economy
*Increase in international flow of capital including foreign direct investment
*Greater transborder data flow, using such technologies such as the Internet, communication satellites and telephones
*The push by many advocates for an international criminal court and international justice movements (see the ICC and ICJ respectively).
*Greater international cultural exchange, for example through the export of Hollywood and Bollywood movies. 
*Some argue that even terrorism has undergone globalization. Terrorists now have attacked places all over the world.
*Spreading of multiculturalism and better individual access to cultural diversity, with on the other hand, some reduction in diversity through assimilation, hybridization, Westernization, Americanization or Sinosization of cultures. 
*Erosion of national sovereignty and national borders through international agreements leading to organizations like the WTO and OPEC
*Greater international travel and tourism
*Greater immigration, including illegal immigration
*Development of global telecommunications infrastructure
*Development of a global financial systems 
*Increase in the share of the world economy controlled by multinational corporations
*Increased role of international organizations such as WTO, WIPO, IMF that deal with international transactions 
*Increase in the number of standards applied globally; e.g. copyright laws

Barriers to international trade have been considerably lowered since World War II through international agreements such as the [[w:General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). Particular initiatives carried out as a result of GATT and the WTO, for which GATT is the foundation, have included:
*Promotion of free trade
**Of goods: reduction or elimination of tariffs; construction of free trade zones with small or no tariffs
**Of capital: reduction or elimination of capital controls
**Reduction, elimination, or harmonization of subsidies for local businesses
*Intellectual Property Restrictions
**Harmonization of intellectual property laws across nations (generally speaking, with more restrictions)
**Supranational recognition of intellectual property restrictions (e.g. patents granted by China would be recognized in the US)

As defined through lecture series given by Dr. Cullenberg, Professor of Economics at the University of California, Riverside, globalization can be basically understood from an economic perspective through the following seven aspects:
*International Trade: Exports and imports of goods and services. Creation of increased interdependency and the creation of a balance of trade.
*International Portfolio Investment: Assets, cash, international currency, stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.
*Migration: Movement of people.
*Foreign Direct Investment: Movement of whole companies.
*International Environment: Global warming, O-zone layer, water resources etc.
*Global Culture: Creation of understanding and meaning, and international communication.
*International Governments: Control and power nationally and internationally.

==Anti-globalization==
''Main article: &quot;[[w:Anti-globalization|Anti-globalization]]&quot;.''

Various aspects of globalization are seen as harmful by public-interest activists as well as strong state nationalists This movement has no unified name.  &quot;Anti-globalization&quot; is the media's preferred term.  Activists themselves, for example Noam Chomsky, have said that this name is meaningless as the aim of the movement is to globalize justice.  Indeed, &quot;the global justice movement&quot; is a common name.  Many activists also unite under the slogan &quot;another world is possible&quot;, which has given rise to names such as ''altermondisme'' in French.

There is a wide variety of different kinds of &quot;anti-globalization&quot;. In general, critics claim that the results of globalization have not been what was predicted when the attempt to increase free trade began, and that many institutions involved in the system of globalization have not taken the interests of poorer nations and the working class into account. 

Economic arguments by fair trade theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more financial leverage (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor.

Many &quot;anti-globalization&quot; activists see globalization as the promotion of a corporatist agenda, which is intent on constricting the freedoms of individuals in the name of profit. They also claim that increasing autonomy and strength of corporate entities increasingly shape the political policy of nation-states.

Some &quot;anti-globalization&quot; groups argue that globalization is necessarily imperialistic, is one of the driving reasons behind the Iraq war and that it has forced savings to flow into the United States rather than developing nations.

Some argue that globalization imposes credit-based economics, resulting in unsustainable growth of debt and debt crises. 

Another more conservative camp in opposition to globalization are state-centric nationalists that fear globalization is displacing the role of nations in global politics and point to NGOs as impeding upon the power of individual nations.  Some advocates of this warrant for anti-globalization are Pat Buchanan and Jean-Marie Le Pen.

The main opposition is to ''unfettered'' globalization (neoliberal; laissez-faire capitalism), guided by governments and what are claimed to be quasi-governments (such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) that are supposedly not held responsible to the populations that they govern and instead respond mostly to the interests of corporations. Many conferences between trade and finance ministers of the core globalizing nations have been met with large, and occasionally violent, protests from opponents of &quot;corporate globalism&quot;.

The movement is very broad, including church groups, national liberation factions, left-wing parties, environmentalists, peasant unionists, anti-racism groups, libertarian socialists and others.  Most are reformist (arguing for a more humane form of capitalism) and a strong minority is revolutionary (arguing for a more humane system than capitalism).  Many have decried the lack of unity and direction in the movement, but some such as Noam Chomsky have claimed that this lack of centralization may in fact be a strength.

Protests by the global justice movement have now forced high-level international meetings away from the major cities where they used to be held, and off into remote locations where protest is impractical.

Some &quot;anti-globalization&quot; activists object to the fact that the current &quot;globalization&quot; globalizes money and corporations and at the same time refuses to globalize people and unions. This can be seen in the strict immigration controls that exist in nearly all countries and the lack of labour rights in many countries in the developing world.

==Pro-globalization (globalism)==
Supporters of democratic globalization can be labelled pro-globalists. They consider that the first phase of globalization, which was market-oriented, should be completed by a phase of building global political institutions representing the will of World citizens. The difference with other globalists is that they do not define in advance any ideology to orientate this will, which should be left to the free choice of those citizens via a democratic process.

Supporters of free trade point out that economic theories of comparative advantage suggest that free trade leads to a more efficient allocation of resources, with all countries involved in the trade benefiting. In general, they claim that this leads to lower prices, more employment and higher output. 

Libertarians and other proponents of laissez-faire capitalism say higher degrees of political and economic freedom in the form of democracy and capitalism in the developed world produce higher levels of material wealth. They see globalization as the beneficial spread of democracy and capitalism.

Critics argue that the anti-globalization movement uses anecdotal evidence to support their view and that worldwide statistics instead strongly support globalization. One effect being that the percentage of people in developing countries living below $1 (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power) per day have halved in only twenty years [http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp]. Life expectancy has almost doubled in the developing world since WWII and is starting to close the gap to the developed world where the improvement has been smaller. Child mortality has decreased in every developing region of the world [http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=2429]. Income inequality for the world as a whole is diminishing [http://www.columbia.edu/~xs23/papers/worldistribution/NYT_november_27.htm].

Many pro-capitalists are also critical of the World Bank and the IMF, arguing that they are corrupt bureaucracies controlled and financed by states, not corporations. Many loans have been given to dictators who never carried out promised reforms, instead leaving the common people to pay the debts later. They thus see too little capitalism, not too much. They also note that some of the resistance to globalization comes from special interest groups with conflicting interests like Western world unions.

==Globalization in question==
There is much academic discussion about whether globalization is a real phenomenon or only a myth. Although the term is widespread, many authors argue that the characteristics of the phenomenon have already been seen at other moments in history.  Also, many note that those features that make people believe we are in the process of globalization, including the increase in international trade and the greater role of multinational corporations, are not as deeply established as they may appear.  The United State's global interventionist policy is also a stumbling point for those that claim globalization has entered a stage of inevitability.  Thus, many authors prefer the use of the term internationalization rather than globalization.  To put it simply, the role of the state and the importance of nations are greater in internationalization, while globalization in its complete form eliminates nation states. So, these authors see that the frontiers of countries, in a broad sense, are far from being dissolved, and therefore this radical globalization process is not yet happening, and probably won't happen, considering that in world history, internationalization never turned into globalization &amp;mdash; (the European Union and NAFTA are yet to prove their case.) 

However, the world increasingly shares problems and challenges that do not obey nation state borders, most notably pollution of the natural environment, and as such the movement previously known as the anti-globalisation movement has transmogrified into a movement of movements for globalisation from below; seeking, through experimentation, forms of social organisation that transcend the nation state and representative democracy. So, whereas the original arguments of anti-global critique can be refuted with stories of internationalisation, as above, the emergence of a global movement is indisputable and therefore we can speak of a real process towards a global human society of societies.

==New URL==

In time we will have to move to a new (hopefully shorter) URL like maybe&quot;food.wikipedia.org&quot; to support unique cookbook-only features like unit conversion, [[en:moral purchasing]] tags, etc. Maybe we should propose doing that right now, to have &quot;pl.food.wikipedia.org&quot; and &quot;en.food.wikipedia.org&quot;. Eventually make it &quot;wikook&quot; or something distinctive - sounds like &quot;we cook&quot;.
Why not do this right now?

:&quot;Wikook&quot; is cute. I suggest you purchase the domain name (both .com and .org) and donate that to the Wikimedia Foundation. However, I'm not sure if a cookbook project by itself will be broad enough to be viable (remembering that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia,  almanac and gazetteer; Wiktionary too is more than just a dictionary since it is also a thesaurus and a translating dictionary and grammar guide). Is there anything similar that can be tacked onto the subject of cooking that is complementary? The last thing we need is another project that is so focused that it is still born (like the Sept11wiki - which, as I suggested, should have been a general tribute wiki). --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 08:37 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)
::No risk whatever of that - cookbooks are the largest single segment of, and have among the longest shelf life, of any books.  Compare that to the Sep11 tribute books.  I suspect also that many people cook and share recipes and such who are not so interested in documentation in general, nor less in textbooks.  It would be good to attract in &quot;church ladies&quot; and chefs and cooking teachers  (especially).  I can't see them caring much about the concerns of say an organic chemistry textbooks.

:::Isn't cooking technicle organic chemistry?

::As for complementary issues, read the page:  group and institutional nutrition, hospitality, kitchens and utensils and table manners and settings and condiments of different cultures, ingredient sourcing and the relationship of that to your environment, community, health and ethics.  There's lots more to go through, and ideas like cooking competitions to explore - maybe we can get the rights to republish rights from cooking shows or restaurants, for publicity.  Go to a cookbook section and you'll see a lot of full-spectrum cookbooks.  Aside from what [[en:Slow Food]] does, imagine a treatment like [[en:Diet For A Small Planet]] by [[en:Frances Moore Lappe]], which has recipes and implications of them for the whole planet.  This could be the largest subproject going, it's easy to imagine

:::Yes! That is what I was talking about - a broad based project about all things related to food. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 06:32 13 Jul 2003 (UTC)

----
Wikook sounds good to me. I think one thing that should be resolved swiftly is a [[template for recipies]] that is complete enough to accomodate the wide variety of cuisine there exists.

I concur with the above, and wonder: the 'nutrition' link, for one, should that be a cookbook link or a wikipedia link? --[[User:JakeNelson|Jake Nelson]] 23:38 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:I think they can link to Wikipedia first but eventually should be imported and integrated into the Cookbook. [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]]

Is somebody going to buy wikook.org/.com before some cybersquatter does? I would, but I've already bought 6 domain names for Wikimedia - time for somebody else to have fun! ;) http://www.godaddy.com registers domain names for less than 10 bucks American each for a one-year plan. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]
----
Wouldn't '''Wikicook''' be a bit easier for new users ? Think Grandma. The URL would be something like http://food.wikimedia.org , right ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 13:31 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:Wikook = We Cook. It doesn't get any better than that. --mav

:I dont plan on being a big contributor to a cookbook, but I dont think many people would &quot;get it&quot;.
----
Wait -- wouldn't it be, http://cook.wikibook.org or http://food.wikibook.org ? (And then maybe the textbook site would be http://tb.wikibook.org .. as long as &quot;tb&quot; is taken as ''textbook'' and not ''tuberculosis''. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 00:32 30 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Authors of this Cookbook might be interested to know and integrate
an open cookbook by Matthew Balmer which is available 
[http://www.randomdata.net/osc/downloads/OSCOOKBOOK.txt here] and is released
under GNU FDL 1.1
&lt;/div&gt;

:We can't use it - it has Invariant Sections. Permission will be needed to use it here without the Invariant Sections. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 22:21 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: So, has anyone contacted Matthew Balmer about this? I'm almost positive he'd be ok with our licensing, considering it's already released under the GFDL. I'll do it if no one else has, just let me know.-- [[User:Merphant|Merphant]] 07:29 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:::Matt Balmer writes:&lt;br&gt;'' You have my permission to incorporate parts of the cookbook into the project, but I have one request: I'd like to know what you're importing. Is it whole chapters, individual recipes, or what? I'm just interested in knowing how people are using my cookbook.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Also, if you would like portions of your cookbook integrated into mine and given a nice, professional print look (for people that want a print version), I would be more than happy to integrate parts of your project and put those in the PDF and PostScript versions I will be distributing with 0.5. Let me know if you're interested.

:: Great! I've started an info page for this book: [[Cookbook:Balmer Open Source Cookbook]]. Let's take this discussion there. -- [[User:Merphant|Merphant]] 09:32 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)

==Talk concerning the old main page==
Talk about ambitious. Added Japanese cuisine and first two points to outline. Hope I don't make a total mess of it.

Also changed links in Learning section from Country/culture to Country/culture Cuisine. Japanese pointed to a Japanese language text. Question: Shouldn't the word cuisine in the page titles be capitalized? I capitalized the links I changed, but noticed later that the links in the outline section are lower case. Which way do we go?

==Atkins==
Atkins is listed on http://www.quackwatch.org, in other words, he's a quack suspect!  I vote that we remove any commerical affiliations with this cookbook, and that we immediately remove the Atkins section of the book.  Keep the Atkins recipes fine, but remove their affiliation to Atkins and do not endorse any recipes as part of any sort of diet.  Wikipedia should not advertise nor advocate any eating habits.   [[User:207.112.53.29|207.112.53.29]] 03:11, 14 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:It's a good thing we ain't Wikipedia then. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:Atkins is not a quack. There is ample scientific evidence behind it. If wikipedia (I assume you mean to include Wikibooks) can't endorse any diets, than there goes low fat diets, low calorie diets, and not caring about what you eat at all. Everything is a diet. Atkins has become a generic term, so I wouldn't worry about that issue either. The Atkins diet is more sustainable than other diets and has the same, if not better, results for weight loss in most people. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 22:40, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Atkins is controversial, yes.  There are other specialised diets, such as vegetarian though; why not Atkins?  I vote for keep; I'm a vegan, which is about as far as you can get from Atkins, and I think Atkins is an unhealthy fad diet [although good for quick weight loss], but there's absolutely no reason to delete the section.  If people want to put in recipes which match their diet, including in a specific section, why stop them?  The type-of-diet things are a great convenience; now all we need is better cross-referencing.  Wikipedia is not advertising or advocating eating habits; people who share eating habits sort recipes by them.  Big difference.

==What to do with recipes at wikipedia==

Should we port over all of the recipies from the regular Wikipedia to this cookbook? The recipies should really be here, not at Wikipedia proper. Right now, there is no interwiki page moving feature, though. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 22:40, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:My preference is that this should be done sooner than later, in order to get this project rolling.  However, there is one small problem.  Wikipedia gets more visibility than wikibooks does.  How do we ensure that we get traffic?  The search engine on Wikipedia does not search through wikibooks does it?  I guess we can just rely on Google to pick up our pages over time.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 17:37, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Well, hopefully once the cookbook here is a little more functional we'll be able to move everything from wikipedia proper here and have the old articles there link to here. -- [[User:The_Grimm_Ripper|Grimm]]

:::May I make a request? Over on Wikipedia, I did a lengthy, detailed reworking of the article on [[chili con carne]], which incorporates a number of actual recipes by way of illustration and to distinguish between types of chili. I have no objection to ''copying'' those recipes to this cookbook -- but please do '''not''' simply delete them from that article in the process. The article would completely meaningless without them. --[[User:Mksmith|Mksmith]] 21:19, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)

==Library of Cookery==
&quot;Library of Cookery&quot; by the Women's Institute is now online at Project Gutenberg. [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc110h.zip Vol 1], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc210h.zip Vol 2], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc310h.zip Vol 3], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc410h.zip Vol 4], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc510h.zip Vol 5]. It's roughly 2 megs of text, and quite a few images so it could probably get this cookery section off to a good start. -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 10:05, 2 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:There's also [http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/1/0/0/1/10011/10011-h/10011-h.htm 365 Foreign Dishes] -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 15:07, 9 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::365 Foreign Dishes may not be of much use. I only gave it a quick glance but it contains such helpful advice as &quot;cook until done&quot;. Yes that really is all the information the recipie gave on determining when to stop cooking. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

==Spices and herbs==
Just a small note: I am currently building better pages for spices and herbs.  I have a template [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Herbs_and_Spices Wikipedia:WikiProject_Herbs_and_Spices] going, and I have ported a few pages over to this format.  Some herbs and spices already have an article written but it is in a plant/botanical slant.  I rename those to [[spice_name (plant)] and create a new cooking/spice slanted page at [[spice_name (spice)]] or [[spice_name (herb)]].  All of the spice pages listed at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spices Spices] should be moved over to this wiki eventually.  I could wait until we have some interwiki moving feature.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 17:37, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Alphabetical listing of recipes==
I have created a space for alphabetical listing of recipies (probably a good place for recipies to begin their life in the cookbook) and also begun to copy over some recipies from the en Wiki's [[w:List_of_recipies|List of recipies]]. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|The Grimm Ripper]]

==Should we include cooking techniques==
How about in addition to recipes, Wikook includes basic cooking skills-how to boil, how to roast, how to stir-fry, etc. Thoughts? [[User:Kagredon|Kagredon]] 03:06, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I'd think that Wikook (cute name btw) would cover everything to do with food, and be a kind of culinary encyclopedia. There's an infinite variety of things to write about, and I'm excited to help work on it. All I need to know is where to do it! I was doing some of this kind of stuff in the wikipedia... Karen J., who'd better register here if this is where the wiki cookbook will be.

==Page too ugly==
IMNSHO, this page is too ugly to be the first page everyone comes to when they click ''Cookbook''.  This page seems more like a planning or orginization page, so propose that the page be moved to [[Cookbook:Cookbook planning]], and a new, Table of Contents type page replace it.  That page should have only a few links, such as [[Cookbook:Ingrediants]], [[Cookbook:Techniques]], [[Cookbook:Equipment]], [[Cookbook:Cuisines]], and [[Cookbook:Recipes]], as well as a link to the planning page.

Any thoughts? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:18, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

*If anyone wants to see what I'm thinking, I've put together [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp]]. The current page would move to [[Cookbook:Planning]], or something similar.[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]
**I've my own version at [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp2]] to further separate out planning stuff and provide a place for more links (which is appropriate for a table of contents, IMO). [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 22:15, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)
*I like your version better, but there should be links to the various types of dishes, not just the cuisines, as well as the recipe index. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]
**Added them. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:37, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)
*Here is another vote for TUF-KAT's version. Looks pretty nice to me. Not that I have edited the cookbook ... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::I agree, the TUF-KAT version is even more eye-catching. I would retain the title centered at the very top as in the Gentgeen version, however&amp;mdash; and perhaps make the type a bit larger. Look at [[German:Contents]] for an example of larger centered titles at the very top - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:35, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)
*Have moved temp2 to [[Cookbook]], and the old version to [[Talk:Cookbook/Planning]]. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 19:54, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I haven't had any internet access for the last few days... so this is the first I've seen of the new page and I hate it! I don't see any logical place to hang actual useful articles off that table of contents. What happened to the index list I was working on last week with cookbook sections that needed to be worked on? I agree that was WAS on the page before was a hideous mess but I don't really think this is much better. Instead of too much information now we're presenting the reader with none at all. There's got to be a middle ground. (One of the reasons I HATE tables is that I don't have a clue how to edit them, and nor do a lot of people...)[[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 12:22, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)

*I agree that the new main page is rather... terse and I too hate editting tables. This is why I keep a copy of the HTML 4.whatever specs under my pillow: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/  [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

==TOC vs Intro==
Regarding the new design of this page -- I changed it because I figured this should be the table of contents for the Cookbook.  Perhaps the old text should be integrated here, but I'm also considering redesigning the table itself.  There are undoubtedly more subjects to be incorporated in a table of contents, and a new format might make it more wieldy to read and edit. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 07:50, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)
----
We need a link to [[Cookbook:Glossary of Ingredients]] to store things like comparisons/conversions between different countries. I don't know how to edit tables or where it would best go. [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 07:57, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Also, thinking about the front page, people have been adding a lot of ingredients to the little lists, and they're starting to get pretty long so it's hard to read them. We can't put EVERYTHING on the front page of the book! I'd suggest revamping the front page a bit and instead of having categories for meat/veg/fruit/grains/dairy etc we amalgamate them all into the category of INGREDIENTS - then put the meat etc over in the examples column and people can go to Meat to find buffalo etc. This would also allow us to add a section for Pantry Cupboard Staples or Dry Ingredients or Baking Ingredients (not sure what you'd call it) to cover all the myriad of explanations that we really need... (oops, forgot to sign) [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 08:05, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*I've put your idea of an Ingredients row, with all the various ingredients on their own page, together at [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp3]].  I agree that it clears up much of the clutter of this page. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 13:29, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)
** That test version looks so much neater! It's great... I'd give it my vote :) [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 02:56, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Another question. I was just trying to fix the Italian Cuisine page because it was broken... but when I tried to link pasta back to Italian Cuisine it said there is no such page and I discovered that whoever made the index used 'Cuisine of Italy' for the page title (and most of the other countries too) Why use the awkward title 'Cuisine of France' 'Cuisine of Germany' etc. If you're going to mention it in an article you're going to write 'French cuisine' 'German Cuisine' etc. Why not just give the page the most obvious title? [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 04:14, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: You could create redirect sets in one way or the other... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:23, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::I saw the &quot;Cuisine of xxx&quot; page somewhere, and just accecpted it as the standard without thinking about it.  If I remember correctly, that naming convention came to us from Wikipedia, where the cuisine pages are part of the &quot;Culture of xxx&quot; pages.  I prefer the &quot;xxx cuisine&quot; name myself, but what do we call food from New Zealand? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:06, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::I think it was simply established on en and bled over here.  I don't see either title as being much better than the other, but there are pros and cons for both sides.

:::I think the single biggest reason for using &quot;Cuisine of XXX&quot; on Wikipedia is that it is has less of an ethnic connotation.  &quot;Cuisine of Japan&quot; could mean ethnic Japanese in Japan, or ethnic Japanese in Europe, or Ainu, Okinawans or Russians in Japan, as well as info on how the Cuisine of Japan has had an impact elsewhere.  Another objection is that many countries have a rather obscure adjectival form ([[Nigerian cuisine]] vs. [[Nigerien cuisine]], for example) or one that is simply awkward ([[New Zealander cuisine]], [[Solomon Islander cuisine]]) -- for consistency's sake, then, the adjectival form should be avoided even in &quot;Cuisine of Italy&quot; or &quot;Cuisine of Japan&quot;, where these issues are not as prominent.  On wikibooks, all this seems less important, so it doesn't much matter, as long as there is consistency and the other form is a redirect. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 07:14, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

It's looking good! Much less messy :) Well done on the change :)

== cookbook gfdl(Open Source Cookbook) ==

[http://www.randomdata.net/osc/downloads/OSCOOKBOOK.txt Look what I found.] [[User:Perl|Perl]] 21:35, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)
: Oh yes, the Open Source Cookbook.  He apparently takes submissions of recipies and compiles them into a book.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in a while.  THe recipes definetly need to be ported over (it's under the GNU FDL).  It's hosted at http://www.ibiblio.org/oscookbook/.

:We love all recipes.  Just use put it at [[Cookbook:Hot and Spicy Dip]], or anywhere else if you think up a snappier title.  When you're done, make a link there from [[Cookbook:Recipes]], and anywhere else it belongs. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:42, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::Done.  I've got a bunch of recipies around here somewhere, I'll post more when I find em. --[[User:Phantom|Phantom]] 12:35, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Could we port all of the recipes from that cookbook? Since it's open-source, we may only have to provide credit to the authors.
--[[User:OMouse|OMouse]] 3:36, 5 Mar 2005 (EST)

==Recipe Template==
I was nosing around the German cookbook ([[Kochbuch]]), after they put alink at the top of ours, and noticed they have a nice recipe template ([[Kochbuch/Rezeptvorlage]], with a machine translation into English [http://www.worldlingo.com/wl/translate?wl_lp=DE-en&amp;wl_glossary=gl1&amp;wl_fl=2&amp;wl_rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FRezeptverzeichnis&amp;wl_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FKochbuch%2FRezeptvorlage here]) that's more developed, and I think much better, than ours ([[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]]).  Anyone object to ditching the old template and making a new one based on the work of our German cohorts, but tweaked a little to match our style? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 12:08, 3 May 2004 (UTC)

==Redesign Needed for Recipe Search==

*I think that the main page should be redesigned so that the link to all recipes is much clearer, rather than just being a small &quot;more recipes&quot; at the bottom of the &quot;Featured Recipe&quot; box.  Why not in '''LARGE''' letters at the top of the screen?  That's the logical place for a visitor to start looking.

Also, why doesn't the &quot;search&quot; function work better?

I wrote a recipe for &quot;tartiflette&quot; that was in the main Wikipedia for a while before being moved here a day or so ago.  If you're in the Wikipedia and type &quot;tartiflette&quot; into the &quot;search&quot; you then get a link to it as well as a link to the Wikibooks cookbook.  But if you then go to the cookbook by error you can't use &quot;search&quot; to find &quot;tartiflette....&quot;[[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 17:45, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:Um, there is another link to the recipe index as one of the main links on the left hand side of the &quot;Table of Contents&quot; area below the featured ingredient and recipe.  As far as searching, I understand that the search index is currently not being updated, but that it is only a temporary situation. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:00, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)


Is there an automatic way to alphabetically list every recipe that is in this category?&lt;br&gt;
For example: I create a recipe with 'Martian cuisine' on the header. Do I have to add it to the Martian cuisine list of recipes or it could be done automatically?&lt;br&gt;
It would also be really nice to have it for ingredients... if I click on cucumber I get in some way the complete list of recipes that use cucumber.&lt;br&gt; --[[User:Sbenza|Sbenza]] 18:22, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== public domain sources ==

I searched '''Project Gutenberg''' to see what books it had concerning cooking and came up with some historic and possibly still useful books.  They are below:
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/catalog/world/authrec?fk_authors=3210 Woman's Institute Library of Cookery] 5 Vol. set.
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/10632 The Healthy Life Cook Book, 2d ed.]
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/6912 School And Home Cooking], A home economics text.
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/6385 Simple Italian Cookery]
*There are a whole bunch.  Just go to http://www.gutenberg.net and search for &quot;cook&quot; in the title field.  It gives some false positives for Captain Cook but other relevant resources as well.

'''Government sites''': The following sites have recipes that come from government sites and may be useful for the purposes of this cookbook.
*http://www.metrokc.gov/HEALTH/nutrition/cookbook.htm - I liked this one because it has a nutrition facts included. If there is question about the copyright, I have an email I can post here that gives permission. They asked that I cite them if I do use a recipe. No problem. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:56, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Ingredients vs Basic Foodstuffs ==

When clicking on the &quot;Ingredients&quot; link on the Cookbook main page, it links to a page named &quot;Basic Foodstuffs.&quot; It would be more consistent to title this page &quot;Ingredients&quot; but I'm not sure what the purpose of the page is. I would like to add &quot;pasta&quot; somewhere but I don't know that I would call it a &quot;basic foodstuff&quot; but it is an ingredient. There is a large class of manufactured/processed ingredients such as pasta, breakfast cerials, and sauces that don't fit well into the present basic foodstuff categories.  Anybody have suggestions? [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 17:17, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)


== Recipes from copyright-protected cookbooks. ==
&quot;Mere listings&quot; of ingredients are not subject to copyright. 
http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl122.html mentions this.
What -is- potentially subject to copyright is the directions.

How willing/resistant is this wiki cookbook project to the inclusion of recipes from still-protected cookbooks, with the directions entirely rewritten and potential modifications to the ingredients list, along with a note of the original source and the fact modifications were made?  
I'm not proposing taking whole cookbooks and treating them this way, but there are a few specific recipes which I quite enjoy and are adapted from mildly to unrecognizably from relatively current cookbooks, and would like to put up here.
* I personally would '''not''' like the idea of merely just taking recipes from cookbooks or recipe sites and then posting them here, unless they were the Open Source Cookbook or one of the public domain cookbooks.  Even then, we should still cite them as sources.  That's just my opinion.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 08:30, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)

* If someone writes a book with the recipe for 'Boiled Water', it means that I can't use it here anymore? Most recipes are of public domain and most cookbooks are just recopilations of these kind of recipes. --[[User:Sbenza|Sbenza]] 18:33, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)
**The directions to a recipe are a procedure, and procedures are not copyrightable under US law (although they can be patented, but that's another matter).  The part of a recipe that can be copyrighted include the descriptive blurb at the top, any photographs, and perhaps the layout of the recipe if it (the layout) is new or novel.  If we rewrite those parts, and make sure to use the [[Cookbook:Cookbook/Recipe template]], we should be fine. However, IANAL. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:44, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've come up with another layout for the main cookbook page, again.  I've updated [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp]] with the new layout. Any suggestions or comments will be appriciated. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:07, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:The alternative layout looks good.  I don't have a preference between the two.  Of note is that the new look wouldn't hold featured recipe pictures very well.  Both seem to have too many links but that follows the pattern of much of Wikibooks.  I haven't thought of anything better myself so I don't have room to talk :-) [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:39, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

==A matter of philosophy==

Here's a question - should we generally exactly dictate ingredients and cooking times, which seem to me to cut out matters of personal taste, or should we instead strive to explain the concept of a dish and the methodology behind its production, and leave matters as to, for instance, whether the ideal roast turkey brine employs maple syrup or apple juice, or what the exact right poultry rub for fried chicken is up to individual chefs?

My feeling is that it is more helpful to explain what one is doing than it is to simply give a list of directions, and that ingredient lists should only contain those items necessary to fulfill the technical requirements of the dish. Certainly guidance on possible seasonings should be included, but I think the distinction between stuff that must be done in order for the recipe to work (It is simply a bad idea, for instance, to make fried chicken with no breading)  and the stuff that makes the recipe your fried chicken (Corn flakes or flour?) is important to make clear in the recipes. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 06:34, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:If people don't realize recipe's can be changed &quot;to taste,&quot; even in drastic measures, then they really should be following the directions carefully. If I have a way to cook something that I think is best, why not tell others the exact way.  They can create their own best recipe by modifications themselves. My two cents. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:46, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::I agree for most  cookbooks, but this is not most cookbooks. Unless we intend to have a wild multiplication of pages on various recipes, we are faced with the problem of a multiplicity of views on how to cook something. The problem is analagous to the problems that require a NPOV policy on the encyclopedias. We need some method of ensuring, for lack of a better word, culinary NPOV. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 15:13, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::Well, the template for recipes (which only about 20% of recipes use, sorry, I burned out on converting recipes) provide a place for variations.  It's also easy to set up a new page and link to it, for example at [[Cookbook:Chocolate Mousse]], where we link to the Atkins-freindly version.  We also might suggest more specific naming of recipes, so that we don't have a recipe at [[Cookbook:Chili]], for example, but use that page for a collection of recipes.  Just some suggestions. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 17:34, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::I think, though, that a lot can be done with explaining the methodology of a dish, and that this is, in the end, more useful than being just another cookbook. I'm thinking something more in line with either of Alton Brown's cookbooks - containing directions for how to do something, but also containing a whole lot of explanation of what you're doing, and clear guidance of when it's OK to divert from the recipe, and when it's going to be disastrous. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 04:25, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::Snowspinner, I see what you're saying about the cookbook scaling. Though, I wonder if it would be a problem to have a multiplicity of recipes as long as the variation section is used appropriately. But, &quot;appropriately&quot; could be a thorny decision.  I'm not sure I understand what your suggested alternative is so it may be better.  An example would be nice. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 15:26, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::::[[Cookbook:Fried chicken]] is a good example of the sort of recipe I think we should have. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 23:15, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::::Nice recipe.  I've got a copy of AB's first cookbook, and another one called ''What Einstein told his cook'' by Robert L. Wolke ( ISBN 0-393-01183-6 ) which has a similar style, and I agree that explaining what is going on is really more important than providing just a recipe.  However, I think we could put these &quot;teaching someone about their kitchen&quot; segments in the ingredient, technique, and cuisine modules, with links to example recipes.  For example, [[Cookbook:Sautéing]]  describes the cooking method, compairs it to other similar methods, and lists recipes that call for food to be sautéed. We've still got a long way to go with this project. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:16, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::::Thanks Snowspinner, I now know what your talking about :-)  While the recipe is presented well and gives something concrete for people to use (except the spice which is understandable), I'm not sure it will keep recipes from proliferating any better than making use of the &quot;variation&quot; section. For example, I know that if I were to add a fried chicken recipe it would be different enough to require another page; the only fried chicken I've seen cooked in a home before was in an iron skillet and was not soaked in brine. I think your recipe could be presented in our current template format that included the same info but was presented differently. The '''Procedures''' section would just have three parts, The spice rub, Brining the chicken, and Prepping the chicken. Comments about ingredient variations could be split out to go into the variation section. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 04:40, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Going left again - my feeling on the brining is that it is not so much a specific POV on the recipe as an underused technique. Since you can, if you want, just use a water brine (Though I think it's boring), it amounts to a particular way of salting the chicken that's really effective on meats. 

As for pan-frying, I know of that style. I just didn't go with it because, well, iron skillets of oil scare me. But, again, this would amount to a little note in the frying section indicating that you can pan-fry it. Again, I think this is superior to a variations section, though, because it presents the variations not as different recipes, but as different ways of achieving the same goal on a single recipe (whether it be seasoning, roasting, or whatever). Maybe this is just me, but I view a food not as a set of six or seven possible recipes, but as one process with a differance of opinion on each step of the process. But I don't think the process itself changes that much from recipe to recipe. Just the nagging details. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 05:19, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

For my own part I think we should have detailed recipies with notes indicating how they may be modified (and we should encourage people to modify and be creative). I would humbly submit my own (thus far) [[Cookbook:Gyoza]] (they're better known as 'Potstickers'). I give a detailed list but with a number of suggestions for alterations and leeway within the recipie to allow people to season the dish themselves. I must admit I do actually have some more ideas for alterations to this that I've held back but I'm afraid they may cause the dumplings to break during cooking. On the other end of the argument there are some recipes without much room for alteration (for example a roux should always be made from the same ratio of fat and flour but after one has a roux an infinite number of uses exist). [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

::::::
Completely disagree, this will dissuade amateur cooks.  As they take grow more expereienced and know what make what tastes like ____, they themselves will make changes to the recipe.  Explanation will be good, but still give exact measurements please! ''Rogers'' 02 Dec 2004


:I agree with Rogers. Experienced cooks will already look at a recipe and think of ways it could be modified to meet their individual tastes. Amateur cooks, on the other hand, such as myself, need specific instructions because we often aren't yet familiar enough with the ingredients and possibilies out there to have a personal taste, or to articulate it if we do have one. The fried chicken recipe is about as minimal as it could be and still be useful to a beginner. The section about the spice rub was, in fact, a little too vague to be of use. It was helpful, at least, that it suggested some spices to use, but it would have been better if it had suggested a complete ratio of spices to use for a sample spice rub. Certainly I could throw some random spices together and find out through experimentation whether they worked; but the reason a beginner comes to a cookbook is because they want to be told some answers without having to waste time and food on experiments that often don't work out. --[[User:209.108.217.226|209.108.217.226]] 22:03, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introductory FAQ ==
=== Q. What is hobbit ?  ===

'''A.''' Hobbit was the old name used by Xymon System Monitoring tool. http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/about.html

=== Q. What is Xymon ?  ===

=== Q. Why should I use Xymon instead of BB ? ===

* Speed.  Hobbit runs much faster and is less resource intensive than Big Brother.
* More functionality built in
* GPL
* Integrated Trending
* A write up of why I use hobbit at http://gendalia.public.iastate.edu/Hobbit.txt


== User FAQ ==

===  When is the next version going to be released ? ===
'''A.''' 
Hobbit is a  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS FOSS] project by [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/System_Monitoring_with_Hobbit/Developer_Guide#Developers_Who_is_who hobbit developers] who contribute to the project in their spare time. It is under active development but a release date for the next version has not been announced.  The current development snapshot is available for download from sourceforge if required. If you are chasing a specific bug fix or feature not currently available within the existing production release, please search the archive and/or post a query to the general discussion mailing list to see if there is a solution available. You can subscribe to the list by sending an e-mail to hobbit-subscribe@hswn.dk. A searchable archive of the list is available at http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/ 
 
Please subscribe to the hobbit announcement list to be notified of the release of new versions. You can subscribe to the list by sending an e-mail to hobbit-announce-subscribe@hswn.dk. 

There is another answer for this question at http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/2008/02/msg00227.html

===  Where can I find more tests ? ===
'''A.'''  
Deadcat http://www.deadcat.net 
Deadcat is mostly Big Brother scripts, but most of them will work on Hobbit without too much fuss.

The Shire Project (Xymonton) http://xymonton.org/about
Shire Project is specific to Xymon(Better than Deadcat)

===  How do I put duplicate hosts in the bb-hosts file ? === 
'''A.'''  
The first occurrence of the host is as normal. All further occurrences should be 
&lt;pre&gt;  
0.0.0.0 hostname # noconn 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  How does the conn test work if the first ping doesn't respond ? ===
'''A.'''  bbtest-net calls either hobbitping or fping (configurable is FPING= in hobbitserver.cfg) 

====  How many pings are sent simultaneously ?  ====
'''A.'''  Exactly how many parallel connections are being used depends on your operating system - 
    the default is FD_SETSIZE/4, which amounts to 256 on many Unix systems
    You can choose the number of concurrent connections with the &quot;--concurrency=N&quot; option to bbtest-net. 

====  How many packets are sent each time ?  ====
'''A.'''  hobbitping normally stops pinging a host after receiving a single response, and uses that to determine the round-trip time.

====  What is the ping time-out ?  ====
A  The default timeout is 5 seconds. 

====  Can we configure it?  ====
'''A.'''  Yes. The --timeout=N parameter to hobbitping allows you to set the timeout to N seconds. 

===  What do the conn test (ping) colours mean?  ===
'''A.'''  Green is an OK response, yellow with packet loss (not delays, just lost packets) and red when there is no response. 

===  How do I get the hobbit client to download etc/hobbitclient.cfg from the server (or other files in etc or ext), then restart?  ===

'''A.'''  Why? If the clients are set up to use server-side config, they don't even need the /etc/*.cfg files locally... 

===  Is there a way within Hobbit of creating a graph with data from multiple RRD files ?  ===
'''A.'''  If you want to create a graph from multiple rrds, I would suggest using the 3rd party tool called drraw http://web.taranis.org/drraw/

===  How do I disable the REPEAT alerts ? ===
'''A.'''  Leaving off the REPEAT= defaults to repeat alerts every 30 minutes. Setting REPEAT=0 defaults to every minute. 
   To disable repeat alerts, set REPEAT=365d 
   If your problem lasts that long, you have bigger problems than too many alerts. 

===  The data being sent from my clients is being truncated.  ===
'''A.'''  The maximum message size can be set in hobbitserver.cfg 
   MAXMSG_CLIENT= 
   MAXMSG_DATA= 
   MAXMSG_STATUS= 
   Change the above parameters to suit your needs.

===  Do I need to restart the Hobbit server after editing the config files ? ===
'''A.'''  No. All files are reread every 5 minutes. 
   The only exception to this is hobbitserver.cfg Changes to this file require a restart. 

===  Do I need to restart my Hobbit client after making a change ?  ===
'''A.'''  No. All client config files are reread periodically 

===  How do I monitor a web page ?  ===
'''A.'''  Add the following line to the bb-hosts file 
   ip.ad.dr.ress www.example.com # http://www.example.com/ 
or for https 
   ip.ad.dr.ress www.example.com # https://user:passwd@www.example.com/ 
Note that there are also content checks and post and browser options available. See the &quot;HTTP TESTS&quot; section of the bb-hosts(5) manual for details.

===  My test only runs every hour. How do I get it to not go purple after 30 minutes ? ===
'''A.'''  Sometimes you want something monitored/tested only once each hour (remote Internet site), once each day (backup job or DNS update), or even less often. Or perhaps more frequently (a critical connection once per minute or less).

There is a &lt;code&gt;LIFETIME&lt;/code&gt; option when you call &lt;code&gt;bb&lt;/code&gt; on the client to report status. It defines how long a status message is considered valid (i.e. ''fresh'' and not yet ''stale''). Search &quot;LIFETIME&quot; on the [http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/man1/bb.1.html bb man page] for a bit more info. Syntax is like the following.
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
$BB $BBDISP &quot;status+4h $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`
&lt;/source&gt;
The defaults are 5 minute testing intervals and 30 minute status lifetimes, so 5 misses are accepted by default. The lifetime should be adjusted for the acceptable number of misses, otherwise false positives might occur. For example, if the host goes completely offline for 2 hours, or twice coincidentally overlapping each hourly reporting period, an hourly test probably doesn't need immediate debugging. Alternatively, for something being tested every minute, a lifetime of 30 minutes should probably be adjusted downward.

A couple of sample scenarios:
* If a script reports backup status only when a backup is finished, and the host or display is not communicative at that exact time, purple might or might not be desirable for that host's backup status in that NOC.
* If a script checks the size of each subdirectory within a parent directory, and the status is more intended for graphing than for green/yellow/red reporting, many misses may be acceptable.

Warning: The man page suggests &quot;sligtly more than the interval between your tests&quot;. But if that was actually followed then the default timeout would be 6 minutes. It isn't 6, and it's not designed to be easily changed from 30: Instead of being an option in a configuration file, it's hardcoded in the &lt;code&gt;hobbitd/hobbitd.c&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;handle_status&lt;/code&gt; function: &lt;source lang=c&gt;int validity = 30;&lt;/source&gt;

===  Does Hobbit encrypt its transmissions ? ===
'''A.'''  Natively, no. Some people have reported success using external encryption. 
   Later versions might support data encryption. 

===  How do I monitor files? I have added FILE /path/to/my/file to hobbitclient.cfg but still nothing happens. ===

'''A.'''  

You also need to add monitored files to client-local.cfg (This tells the client to send the file metadata to the server)
The server then uses the metadata and the config in hobbitclient.cfg to determine test results.
Also make sure hobbit has read access to the files.

===  How do I monitor log files other than the default ones?  ===

'''Answer 1'''  

&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;Kauffman, Tom&quot; &lt;KauffmanT@nibco.com&gt; 
 
&gt; On your hobbit server -
&gt; 
&gt; 1) set up etc/client-local.cfg to reference the logs you want AND any exclusions. For AIX, I have:
&gt; [aix]
&gt; log:/var/log/syslog:10240
&gt;         ignore 3004-004
&gt;         ignore 3004-035
&gt;         ignore 3004
&gt; log:/var/log/console.log:10240
&gt; log:/var/log/dsmsched.log:10240
&gt; 
&gt; 2) set up etc/hobbit-clients.cfg to create your alerting criteria. For AIX, I've got these set:
&gt; HOST=%.*
&gt;         LOG /var/log/syslog %.*crit.su.*to.root red
&gt;         LOG /var/log/syslog %.*crit.su   yellow
&gt;         LOG %/var/(adm|log)/console.log %.*not.responding.still.trying yellow
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Change client-local.cfg first. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for this to propagate to the client;
&gt; look for a file called logfetch.&lt;hostname&gt;.cfg in client/tmp. This should match your entries in
&gt; client-local.cfg.
&gt; 
&gt; Once the logs started to coming in, play with the client-local.cfg and a test system, to track
&gt; what you're interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; Tom
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Answer 2.''' 
I have added LOG /path/to/my/logfile WARNING COLOR=yellow to hobbitclient.cfg but still nothing happens. 

You also need to add monitored log files to client-local.cfg.
This tells the client to send the log file to the server because Hobbit messages protocol is bi-directional, not just hobbit client sending message to server. hobbit server can actually instruct hobbit client to send in log files that are not default ones.

   The server then uses the sent data and the config in hobbitclient.cfg to determine test results. 
   Also make sure hobbit has read access to the log.

An example client-local.cfg file.

===  What's the meaning of the track alert-mail-number in the subject of hobbit alert emails ?   ===
'''A.'''  The number is the ack-code you can use for acknowledging the alert. 
   They are random numbers generated for each alert. 

===  How do I restrict access to Hobbit pages to specific people or groups ?   ===
'''A.'''  Apache has its own authentication. Use it. 
   To give one group access to some info, and another group access to other info, use the PAGE
   statement in bb-hosts. This will create a new directory for each page, which can be controlled
   by apache's authentication system.

===  I am having a problem with devmon ....  ===
'''A.'''  Please post devmon related questions to the devmon support mailing list. 

===  How do I create custom scripts and graphs ?   === 
'''A.'''  http://xymonton.org/tutorials:customgraph

=== Why does my custom graph only show in the trends column but not its own column ? ===
'''A.''' This is typical for tables. One must append the column name to the &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; setting.
#Look in the source file ''web/hobbitsvc.c''.
#*Find the &lt;code&gt;multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; assignment and note its value.
#Edit the configuration file ''server/etc/hobbitcgi.cfg'':
##Find the &lt;code&gt;CGI_SVC_OPTS&lt;/code&gt; assignment.
##Add a &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs=&lt;/code&gt; value to the assigned string, including the columns that tend to have tabular data. For example: &lt;pre&gt;CGI_SVC_OPTS=&quot;--env=/home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg --no-svcid --history=top --multigraphs=disk,if_load,if_dsc&quot;&lt;/pre&gt; (Note that, while the setting in ''hobbitsvc.c'' starts and ends with a comma, the setting in ''hobbitcgi.cfg'' does not.)
#Then try out the change (refresh the web page).
More details on &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; is in the hobbitsvc.cgi documentation. (''man hobbitsvc.cgi'')

===  I don't want to display column foo in my display. How do I do that ?   ===
'''A.'''  Add the entry NOCOLUMNS:foo,bar to hide column foo and bar. 

===  How do I check to ensure something is not running ?   ===
'''A.'''  In bb-hosts 
&lt;pre&gt;
1.2.3.4 my.host.com # !ftp 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will cause the test to go red if FTP is running

===  I want to monitor Windows servers. How do I do that ?   ===
If you have to, use BBWin as your client. http://bbwin.sourceforge.net/

=== What are the translations between BBWin's XML and Central Mode? ===

=== Is it possible to disable and acknowledge alerts via email, how? ===

Include an &lt;tt&gt;IGNORE&lt;/tt&gt; '''exception''' with hosts or alert that you wish to ignore:

   HOST=* SERVICE=*
      IGNORE HOST=%[a-z]{3}[0-9]{4} 
      MAIL admin@foo.com

or perhaps more specific:

   HOST=* COLOR=red
      IGNORE HOST=marketing.foo.com SERVICE=cpu TIME=4:1500:1800
      MAIL admin@foo.com

and check configuration:

   $ cd ~/server
   $ ./bin/bbcmd hobbitd_alert --test tic0102 comm
   00026606 2012-03-01 10:52:51 *** Match with 'IGNORE HOST=%[a-z]{3}[0-9]{4}' ***
   00026606 2012-03-01 10:52:51 IGNORE rule found

=== Can I configure a maximum time limit a alert can be acknowledged for ? ===
'''A.'''  
=== Can I restrict what hosts can be disabled on the enable/disable page ? ===
'''A.'''

=== Can I enable/disable on only one display server and have it show on both? ===

Typical installations with dual display servers have them configured to act independently.  Each Xymon display server lists only itself in the &lt;tt&gt;XYMSERVERS&lt;/tt&gt; setting in &lt;tt&gt;xymonserver.cfg&lt;/tt&gt;, so usually, the enable/disable page only applies to the server that served the form.

However, the &lt;tt&gt;XYMSERVERS&lt;/tt&gt; value can be overridden for each CGI script, and the enable/disable form will send updates to all Xymon servers defined in &lt;tt&gt;XYMSERVERS&lt;/tt&gt;.  To override for enable/disable, perform the following.

Create the file &lt;tt&gt;xymonserver-enadis.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; containing:

  include /etc/xymon/xymonserver.cfg
  XYMSERVERS=&quot;display1 display2&quot;  # replace with IP addresses of Xymon servers

Then edit &lt;tt&gt;cgioptions.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; and add this line:

  XYMONENV_ENADIS=/usr/lib/xymon/server/etc/xymonserver-enadis.cfg

and modify &lt;tt&gt;CGI_ENADIS_OPTS&lt;/tt&gt; to reference the new variable:

  CGI_ENADIS_OPTS=&quot;--env=$XYMONENV_ENADIS&quot;

=== Can the SMS alert format be reconfigured to display more or less information ? ===
'''A.'''  Not directly, but an alert script ([http://xymonton.org/alerts:smsplus smsplus]) has been written to provide more information than the default
SMS output does.  The script can be easily modified using the following environment variables (from the hobbit documentation):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Description
|-
| BBCOLORLEVEL	|| The current color of the status
|-
| BBALPHAMSG	|| The full text of the status log triggering the alert
|-
| ACKCODE	|| The &quot;cookie&quot; that can be used to acknowledge the alert
|-
| RCPT	        || The recipient, from the SCRIPT entry
|-
| BBHOSTNAME	|| The name of the host that the alert is about
|-
| MACHIP	|| The IP-address of the host that has a problem
|-
| BBSVCNAME	|| The name of the service that the alert is about
|-
| BBSVCNUM	|| The numeric code for the service. From SVCCODES definition.
|-
| BBHOSTSVC	|| HOSTNAME.SERVICE that the alert is about.
|-
| BBHOSTSVCCOMMAS || As BBHOSTSVC, but dots in the hostname replaced with commas
|-
| BBNUMERIC	|| A 22-digit number made by BBSVCNUM, MACHIP and ACKCODE.
|-
| RECOVERED	|| Is &quot;1&quot; if the service has recovered.
|-
| DOWNSECS	|| Number of seconds the service has been down.
|-
| DOWNSECSMSG	|| When recovered, holds the text &quot;Event duration : N&quot; where N is the DOWNSECS value.

'''A.''' Use the &quot;badTEST&quot; setting in bb-hosts (see the man-page). This delays
a yellow or red status from appearing until it has stayed yellow (or
red) for a number of test cycles. So you could use this to suppress the
yellow status until it had been yellow for some time, so when it does
turn yellow you know this is something you have to handle.

Or if your custom test reported a &quot;red&quot; status, you could make it go
yellow for the first 5 test cycles, and red after that.

&gt; Is the new Hobbit client compatible with the old BigBrother server?
&gt; BigBrother is run by a different part of the organization and I may not 
&gt; be able to get them to change to Hobbit, but for my Linux guests and my 
&gt; z/VM systems, I would be interested in converting to the new Hobbit code.

In the default mode, you cannot use the Hobbit client to report to a Big
Brother system. No data would ever show up, because a Big Brother server
doesn't know how to feed the client data through the hobbitd_client
module, which takes care of converting the client data into status
columns.

However, you *can* run the Hobbit client in the local-configuration
mode. When the configure script asks
   Server side client configuration, or client side [server] ?
answer &quot;client&quot;, and the launch the client with the &quot;--local&quot; option.

In this mode, the client sends normal &quot;status&quot; messages to the Hobbit/BB
server. I'm not sure if alerts will work, though, since the Hobbit
client doesn't generate the &quot;page&quot; messages that the BB server expects
to trigger sending out alerts. (Hobbit ignores these messages
completely, so it did seem like a waste of time to generate them).

Note that this isn't really described very well anywhere. It means you
will have to maintain the client configuration on the client, not on the
Hobbit server.

Henrik

&lt;pre&gt;
There are 3 files that need to be updated so that fping can be executed as root (uid=0)
on Solaris by a named user, in this case the hobbit user.

The three files in question are,
/etc/user_attr
/etc/security/exec_attr
/etc/security/prof_attr

These have been updated with the following lines

In /etc/user_attr:

Subject: Re: [hobbit] Hobbit newbie from BB: differences and what may I
lose from migrating?

Hi Jordan,

I'll try to answer your questions. Since I also develop Hobbit I am
probably slightly biased when it comes to the &quot;is-this-more-difficult-
to-do-than-with-BB&quot; type of questions, but I am sure others will
voice their opinions on that.

On Tue, Aug 01, 2006 at 12:36:29PM -0700, Jordan Mendler wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; First, after reading through whatever I could find on the website I am
&gt; still a little bit confused about configuration and setup. With BB,
&gt; you install and configure each client and server on the local machine,
&gt; except for the universal bb-hosts. Is this the same on Hobbit, or does
&gt; Hobbit use a central configuration file that is modified only on the
&gt; server to configure clients? I am trying to figure out the difference
&gt; between installing, maintaining and configuring BB and Hobbit setups.

First, let me stress that Hobbit is fully compatible with your existing
BB clients. You can keep your current client setup and just switch to
Hobbit on the server side, and all of your clients will continue to 
work as they do with BB as the server. So you can migrate the server
side first, and then migrate clients when you find that it is convenient
to do so - or you want to take advantage of some of the new stuff that
is in Hobbit.

The Hobbit client configuration is maintained on the Hobbit server. 
Clients in Hobbit are designed to be *really* dumb; they just collect
data, and all of the configuration of what to monitor, what thresholds
to use for e.g. disk utilization and so on is configured only on the
Hobbit server.

This is a major difference between Hobbit and BB. With BB you have
delegated the client administration to whoever manages each server.
Hobbit centralizes the monitoring configuration, so you will probably
have a group of people who take more control of the monitoring setup.

&gt; Hobbit looks a lot more complex to setup, but once I get my feet wet is
&gt; it any harder than BB?

I think it is easier, once you get used to the Hobbit way of doing
things. But as I said, I am biased.

&gt; Second is performance. I know this list may be biased toward Hobbit,
&gt; but is it actually faster? We have about 50-100 clients on BB and I did
&gt; not notice any performance issues.

With that number of systems monitored, you probably will not see a huge
difference. BB works quite well for a small number of systems, but when
you move beyond a couple of hundred boxes the overhead of generating 
webpages through shell scripts becomes very noticeable. On my setup,
the servers were simply choking on the disk I/O caused by BB saving
every status in a separate file, and from the huge number of small
cut-grep-awk-sed etc. commands that ran to generate webpages.

&gt; Hobbit looks like it is very complex, so does this mean it uses a lot 
&gt; of resources on the client and server? What speed/ram server is
&gt; usually the minimum recommended for a dedicated Hobbit server? Would
&gt; something like a dual Pentium II 266mhz have any performance issues 
&gt; as a server, if it does nothing else? What about for clients? We have
&gt; still have some testing, stating and production servers left that are
&gt; singe chip Pentium III 700-850 mhz, and even a couple Pentium II's. 
&gt; Just need to make sure all the resources used for things like graphs
&gt; are taken from the server and not each client.

The Hobbit server uses fewer resources than the BB server. The main
resource usage is memory; Hobbit keeps everything in memory except 
the history logs and the RRD files used for graphs. That doesn't mean
a whole lot, though: Here's a ps listing of the Hobbit processes running

on my main monitoring system - it handles about 2500 hosts:

As you can see, the biggest chunk of memory goes to the &quot;hobbitd&quot;
process which is the one that keeps all state information. It's
currently using some 31 MB of memory. (This box has 1 GB RAM).

A rough estimate of how much memory Hobbit needs would be the size of
your bbvar/logs/ directory, plus 30 MB.

As for CPU usage, your PII/266 should be adequate for 50-100 servers.
The box I'm running on is an old (7-8 years) Solaris server with a 
900 MHz UltraSparc II processor. That's roughly comparable to a PII
running at 1.2 GHz. And it handles 25 times as many hosts as you are
aiming for.

&gt; Third is plugins. Are BB plugins compatible with Hobbit?

Yes.

&gt; Also how hard are plugins to write for Hobbit? 

Plugins that run on the monitored client systems are as easy to write
as for BB, since it is basically the same thing.

Hobbit also allows you to write plugins for the Hobbit server, which
receive events from the Hobbit server daemon. This is used by the 
core Hobbit tools - e.g. the hobbitd_rrd processes you see in the
ps-listing above are a plugin that handle updating of the RRD files
from the status- and data-messages that are sent to Hobbit. There
aren't any third-party plugins that use this yet (at least, I 
don't know of any), but writing them is fairly simple since it 
basically involves reading data from a pipe and processing it in
whatever way you want.

&gt; I don't know if these even exist for bb, but I ultimately would 
&gt; like to integrate plugins that 1) monitor legato tape backup, 

Don't know about this.

&gt; 2) run nmap to see what ports are open/can be seen from an external 
&gt; machine, 

The Hobbit client in version 4.2 (about to be released soon) reports
details about the network services running on a host. So you can check
for which ports are open/listening for connections, and trigger alerts
if any unwanted ports show up.

&gt; 3) run 'lshw -html' to show a list of all the hardware on the system, 

This would typically be a client-side test.

&gt; 4) monitor uptime, 

This is standard.

&gt; 5) monitor OS and kernel versions (uname -a and head -n 1 /etc/issue),

This data is collected by the Hobbit client.

&gt; 6) maybe some more router/network monitoring stuff and 

Hobbit comes with built-in network service monitoring. There is also
an SNMP add-on which can be used for monitoring devices such as routers.

&gt; Fourth is relay. By this I mean monitoring systems on a private
&gt; subnetwork that are only accessible to the Hobbit server by going
&gt; through an intermediate server. Is this possible with Hobbit and is it
&gt; any more difficult to do than on BB?

Two ways of doing that. First, there is a proxy utility which is used
to forward Hobbit messages from one network to another. This is used if
your client systems on the private subnet are allowed to make outgoing
connections to the proxy, and the proxy can connect to the real Hobbit
server.

Second, Hobbit 4.2 includes a set of tools where it's the server that
contacts clients to pick up the data they have collected (i.e. the
traffic is initiated by the server, where the normal BB setup is for 
the client to initiate the connection). Useful for DMZ style setups
where clients are not allowed to generate outbound connections.

&gt; Fifth is portability. BB is very portable, I can make a 'model' client
&gt; for say Red Hat and tar it and distribute it very easily to every
&gt; server I have using only a few commands. Is Hobbit the same, or are there
&gt; client dependencies or other things that may make this more difficult.

The Hobbit client uses only the system libraries and standard utilities 
found on your client systems. You will need at least one system where
you can compile the client binaries (that's similar to the BB
requirements), since a few of the client-side tools are written in C.

Once you have a client compiled for an OS, it is as portable as any
binary that is dynamically linked on your platform. I.e. you can 
just copy it over as long as the same run-time libraries are available.

So far, we haven't managed to find any unix-like system that couldn't
run the Hobbit client. Including some rather odd ones. The current list
of client-side data collectors are

hobbitclient-aix.sh    hobbitclient-darwin.sh  hobbitclient-freebsd.sh
hobbitclient-hp-ux.sh  hobbitclient-irix.sh    hobbitclient-linux.sh
hobbitclient-netbsd.sh hobbitclient-openbsd.sh hobbitclient-osf1.sh
hobbitclient-sunos.sh

&gt; Sixth is development. How active is the development of Hobbit, how big
&gt; is the community, etc? How many people can attest to having fully
&gt; functional hobbit setups, how long has it been around and how often
&gt; are new releases usually made? 

Hobbit started back in late 2002 when it was called the &quot;bbgen toolkit&quot;.
It was renamed to Hobbit in March 2005 when it had developed into a 
complete replacement for BB. More details in the hobbit(7) man-page
available online at http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/

It is actively being developed by me, but people on this list have
made contributions of code. Some have picked up special projects
like the Windows client and run that completely on their own.
I'd say Hobbit currently has a very active user community, and
the development community is slowly growing beyond just myself.

There are currently 433 subscribers to the Hobbit mailing list.
According to the Sourceforge download statistics, it is downloaded
about 1000 times per month.
http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=128058&amp;ugn=hobbitmon&amp;type
=&amp;mode=year

There was a thread on the mailing list back in May about who uses
Hobbit. The results were summarized here:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/System_Monitoring_with_Hobbit/User_Guide#Wh
o_use_Hobbit_.3F

New releases have usually happened frequently - 2-4 times a year.
The current interval between the 4.1.2 release and version 4.2 is 
unusually long - a whole year. I don't expect that to happen again.


&gt; Also I saw something this morning about a Windows client -- how 
&gt; stable is that? 

From what I hear it should be usable. But you can stick with the
current BBNT client until it reaches version 1.0.

&gt; How stable is the Solaris version?

Rock-solid.


&gt; Is there a client for Mac OSX? 

Yes. It will run the Hobbit server also, if you want to.


&gt; Is Hobbit like BB in the sense that you can change paths to system 
&gt; binaries like grep and sed to allow easy use on other UNIXes like OSX?


Adding a client for a new OS will require implementing both a
client-side script to collect whatever data is interesting for this
system, and implementing the data parsing on the Hobbit server-side.
So it is somewhat more challenging. But since Hobbit already supports
all of the common Unix systems, I doubt that you will need to worry 
about that. If you do have a system which is not on the list, I will
help you with adding support for it.


&gt; When will 4.2 be officially released as a production version? 

Probably by the end of this week.


&gt; Since we have a working BB setup for now, I need to
&gt; decide if I should try to start migrating now or if I should wait some
&gt; time for Hobbit to develop more before I migrate from BB.

I don't think you have to wait. But it's for You to decide.

Henrik

=== How do I monitor HP-UX network log ? ===

Alternatively, you could modify the HP-UX client script to generate a
normal Hobbit &quot;msgs&quot; section with the text-output from the netfmt
command; then Hobbit can process it as if it were an ordinary text-based
logfile.

E.g. at the bottom of the hobbitclient-hp-ux.sh script running on your
clients, just before the &quot;exit&quot; command add this:

   echo &quot;[msgs:/var/adm/nettl.LOG000]&quot;
   netfmt ...whatever needs to go here to get the text-output ...

Then you can use a normal log-file entry on the Hobbit server to process
the log data.

=== Q. How do I  configure SMF for hobbit on Solaris 10 ? ===
'''A.''' From: Everett, Vernon [mailto:Vernon.Everett@woodside.com.au]
For those of you familiar with Solaris 10, you should know about services, but for some, adding new ones is a little tricky.
To get Hobbit working as a sevice we need to do the following.

Create a file named /var/svc/manifest/application/hobbit.xml with the following content:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE service_bundle SYSTEM &quot;/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1&quot;&gt;

&lt;dependency name='filesystem' grouping='require_all' restart_on='none' type='service'&gt;

&lt;service_fmri value='svc:/system/filesystem/local'/&gt;

         timeout_seconds='10'&gt;
&lt;method_context&gt;
&lt;method_credential user='hobbit'/&gt;
&lt;/method_context&gt;
&lt;/exec_method&gt;
        &lt;exec_method type='method' name='stop' exec='/usr/lib/hobbit/client/runclient.sh stop'
         timeout_seconds='10'&gt;
&lt;method_context&gt;

&lt;/method_context&gt;
&lt;/exec_method&gt;

 timeout_seconds='10'  &gt;
&lt;method_context&gt;
&lt;method_credential user='hobbit' /&gt;
&lt;/method_context&gt;
&lt;/exec_method&gt;
        &lt;instance name='default' enabled='true' /&gt;
        &lt;stability value='Unstable' /&gt;
        &lt;template&gt;
&lt;common_name&gt;
&lt;loctext xml:lang='C'&gt; Hobbit Monitor Client &lt;/loctext&gt;

&lt;/common_name&gt;

&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;/service&gt;

&lt;/service_bundle&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Take note of lines 37, 47 and 57, the lines that start &quot;exec=&quot;. You may need to edit the path to your Hobbit start script.

To avoid confusion or possible issues, shut down your hobbit client at this point using the runclient script.

Now, as root, run the command
 #svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/hobbit.xml

We should now have a service called hobbit.
 #svcs | grep hobbit
 online 9:23:05 svc:/application/hobbit:default
(It will probably have gone online at this point)

You can now treat it as you would a regular service. If it hasn't gone online, kick it off as normal.
 #svcadm enable hobbit
It may be necessary to do a disable and then an enable, but that should get it going.

And because we have set the default as enabled, the service should start automatically when you do a reboot.

Confirm it's all good by doing
 # ps -efa | grep hobbit
All the usual scripts should be running.

If you don't want it as a service anymore, as root run
 #svccfg delete hobbit.
This will remove the service, and allow you to continue running it from the runclient script.

=== Q. How do I configure Hobbit Client for Solaris 10 using SMF ? ===
'''A.''' copied from http://xymonton.org/addons:hobbitsmf

 replacement of /etc/rcN.d).

Installation

   1. mkdir -p /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit
   2. copy the client and server xml files to /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit
   3. import the service(s)

      svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit/server.xml
      svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit/client.xml

   4. enable the service(s)

      svcadm enable svc:/application/monitoring/hobbit/client:default
      svcadm enable svc:/application/monitoring/hobbit/server:default

The command,   bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;hobbitdboard&quot;
is your friend, combined with a bit of scripting. E.g:

&gt; Is it possible to remove a single test from *all* hosts? 

bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;hobbitdboard test=MYTEST fields=hostname&quot; |
   while read H; do bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;drop $H MYTEST&quot;; done

&gt; Or all tests from all hosts? 

bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;hobbitdboard test=info fields=hostname&quot; |
   while read H; do bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;drop $H&quot;; done

&gt; Or all tests that are purple?

bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;hobbitdboard color=purple fields=hostname,testname&quot; |
while read L; do 
      HOST=`echo $L | cut -d'|' -f1`
      TEST=`echo $L | cut -d'|' -f2`
      bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;drop $HOST $TEST&quot;
done

=== Q. How can I request the hobbit server to ask hobbit client to run a command locally based on an alert. ===

'''A.''' 
&lt;pre&gt;
Run this as a client extension:

  #!/bin/sh

  # Get the current status of the &quot;msgs&quot; column
  MSGSSTATUS=`$BB $BBDISP &quot;query $MACHINE.msgs&quot; | awk '{ print $1 }`

  # Get the command we must run from the client config
  CMD=`grep &quot;^msgsrecovercmd:&quot; $BBTMP/logfetch.$MACHINEDOTS.cfg | sed -e 's!^msgsrecovercmd:!!'`

  # If &quot;msgs&quot; is red and there is a command, run it
  if test &quot;$MSGSSTATUS&quot; = &quot;red&quot; -a &quot;$CMD&quot; != &quot;&quot;
  then
     $CMD
  fi

  exit 0

Before doing this, consider the security implications of having your
servers run commands that they fetch from a remote host without
authentication.

=== Q. How do I configure &quot;GROUP&quot; alerts ? ===


'''A.''' &quot;GROUP&quot; keyword is used in hobbit to classify many process name or disk partition name into different groups. This feature is needed in a big IT environment usually has different teams responsible for different areas of IT infrastructure. Ex. an IT organization usually consists of network,data/storage,backup, databases, application and Unix teams.

* hobbit-client.cfg : We need to specify which process will alert which GROUP.
* hobbit-alerts.cfg : In this file we then specify which email address receive the GROUP alert.

=== Example ===
This is simple setup for learning purpose.
Assuming when / is over 93% usage we want unix team to be paged.when /boot is over 15 percent apps team need to be alerted.
Also cron process is dead, Unix team should be alerted. when Xvnc is over 120 processes then apps team need to be alerted also.

==== hobbit-client.cfg ====
&lt;pre&gt;
HOST=t-rh9.mywork.com
        DISK / 93 98            GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PARTITION
        DISK /boot 15 20        GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PARTITION
        PROC cron 1 -1 yellow   GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PROCESS
        PROC Xvnc 1 120 yellow  GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PROCESS
        PROC defunct  0 0  red
        LOG /var/log/messages  WARNING COLOR=yellow
        LOG /var/log/maillog   WARNING COLOR=yellow
        LOG /var/opt/hobbitclient42/log/clientlaunch.log WARNING COLOR=yellow
        LOG /var/opt/hobbitclient42/log/hobbitclient.log  WARNING
        FILE /etc/passwd  SIZE&gt;0  OWNERID=root  COLOR=yellow
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== hobbit-alerts.cfg ====
The names after GROUP, have to be exact the same that are used in hobbit-client.cfg
&lt;pre&gt;
GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PROCESS
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT

GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PARTITION
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT

GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PROCESS
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT

GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PARTITION
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Debugging ===
Hobbit provide a very powerful debugging tool to trace the alert rules. From following example we check a host against all the rules in hobbit-alert.cfg.

* How do I debug &quot;Oversize data/client msg&quot; error message?
** following is a example error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Oversize data/client msg from 10.5.64.212 truncated (n=2068326, limit 1961984)
First line: linux2.test.com|linux|linux
&lt;/pre&gt;
** Checking the size of msg file got sent from hobbit client side.
&lt;pre&gt;
# ls -l msg.linux2.test.com.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 hobbitc hobbitc 2068297 Jan 29 07:54 msg.linux2.test.com.txt
#
&lt;/pre&gt;
** Find out why msg.linux2.test.com.text is so big.

* Setup the debugging environment by running bbcmd. it will set up all the hobbit environment variables.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00$ bin/bbcmd
2007-07-23 14:28:21 Using default environment file /etc/opt/hobbitserver42/hobbitserver.cfg
bash-3.00$
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Also have a look at command syntax of hobbitd_alert.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ bin/hobbitd_alert --debug --test
Usage: hobbitd_alert --test HOST SERVICE [options]
Possible options:
        [--duration=SECONDS]
        [--color=COLOR]
        [--group=GROUPNAME]
        [--time=TIMESPEC]
$ bash
bash-3.00$
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Using the hobbitd_alert debugging command: A successful match, /boot disk usage has to be really over  16%.

=== Q. How do I get trimhistory to work for a hobbit server on Solaris ? ===

'''A.''' The default example in [http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net/docs/man8/trimhistory.8.html hobbit manpage] is for hobbit server on Linux.
* run bbcmd first to inherit BBHIST etc of variables.
* 31676645 is about 1 year of epoch time number.
* ./trimhistory --debug --cutoff=`/usr/bin/perl -e 'printf &quot;%d\n&quot;, (time-31676645);'`
* References : http://solarisjedi.blogspot.com/2006/06/solaris-date-command-and-epoch-time.html

=== Q. How do I exclude &quot;info&quot; and &quot;trends&quot; columns from the NK overview page? ===

'''A.''' As of Hobbitd 4.12 it is currently hard-coded that the &quot;info&quot; and &quot;trends&quot; columns show up on all pages, including the NK and BB2 pages. If you want those columns removed you'll have to edit the Hobbit source-code. The change is pretty simple. In the hobbit-4.1.2/bbdisplay/pagegen.c file, lines 121-123 look like this:
 /* TRENDS and INFO columns are always included on non-BB pages */
 if (strcmp(column-&gt;name, xgetenv(&quot;INFOCOLUMN&quot;)) == 0) return 1;
 if (strcmp(column-&gt;name, xgetenv(&quot;TRENDSCOLUMN&quot;)) == 0) return 1;
Change the &quot;return 1&quot; on both lines to &quot;return 0&quot;, save the file, run &quot;make&quot; and either run &quot;make install&quot;, or copy the bbdisplay/bbgen program to ~hobbit/server/bin/ . Next time the NK page is updated, those columns will be gone.

=== Q. How do I use the internal HTTP test feature of Hobbit to test a Squid proxy server? ===

'''A.''' If you want to check that the service is actually functional use something like this in your bb-hosts file:
 &lt;pre&gt;0.0.0.0   squid.domain.com   # http://squid.domain.com:8080/http://www.google.com/&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. How do I use the internal HTTP test feature of Hobbit to test a proxy server with authentication to a Windows domain? ===

'''A.''' If you want to check that the service is actually functional use something like this in your bb-hosts file:
 &lt;pre&gt;0.0.0.0   servername.domain.com   # \
    http://domain\username:password@servername.domain.com:8080/http://www.google.com/&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. How do I compare graphs from different hosts on one page? ===

'''A.''' As of Hobbitd 4.12 there currently isn't a  front-end to build the URL's needed for the graphs, but you can do it by hand for any graphs with ''-multi'' definitions (eg load average, swap):

# Find the base graph you want, e.g. the cpu &quot;load average&quot; graph for one of your hosts.
# In your browser, right-click the graph and select &quot;view image&quot; or &quot;open image&quot;. You now have a view of your load graph only.
# In the address bar field you'll see the URL for this image. E.g.
         &lt;pre&gt;http://hobbit.domain.com/hobbit-cgi/hobbitgraph.sh?host=host1.domain.com&amp;service=la\
&amp;graph_width=576&amp;graph_height=120&amp;disp=host1%2edomain%2ecom&amp;nostale&amp;graph=hourly&amp;action=view
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now, you can add more hosts after the &quot;host=...&quot; part of the URL - just list all of your hosts separated by commas. Like:
  &lt;pre&gt;http://hobbit.domain.com/hobbit-cgi/hobbitgraph.sh?host=host1.domain.com,host2.domain.com,\
host3.domain.com&amp;service=la&amp;graph_width=576&amp;graph_height=120&amp;disp=host1%2edomain%2ecom&amp;nostale&amp;\

=== Q. I just upgraded from the BigBrother client to the Hobbit client and I don't get any status for CPU or disk, but I get status for other tests ===

'''A.''' Most common cause is that the hostname used by the client is different from the hostname you have in your bb-hosts file. On the client, what's the hostname reported by the &quot;uname -n&quot; command ? If that is different from the hostname you have in the bb-hosts file, start the client with the &quot;--hostname=THE.REAL.HOSTNAME&quot; option.
=== Q. How do I fix &quot;Oversize status msg from 192.168.1.31 for test.my.com:ports truncated (n=508634, limit=262144)&quot; ===
'''A.'''

Try to increase value of MAXMSG_STATUS in ~server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg :
&lt;pre&gt;
MAXMSG_STATUS
   The maximum size of a &quot;status&quot; message in kB, default: 256. Status
   messages are the ones that end up as columns on the web display. The
   default size should be adequate in most cases, but some extension
   scripts can generate very large status messages - close to 1024 kB.
   You should only change this if you see messages in the hobbitd log
   file about status messages being truncated.
&lt;/pre&gt;
limit=262144 is 256kB.  You can divide n value for 1024 (508634/1024 = 496) then you can set MAXMSG_STATUS=&quot;500&quot; and restart hobbit server.

&quot;godzilla&quot; - a Solaris host - sent a too-large &quot;client&quot; message of
815825 bytes. There's a limit set in Hobbit for the size of client
message at 512 KB, so the message was truncated.

This is interesting. If the truncated message caused hobbitd_client to
crash, I would have expected a different exit-code. I'll have to check 
how it handles truncated messages.

&gt; How can this happend?

Dont know, but apparently some input from your host caused it.

&gt; Has this been fixed in latest snapshot?

Probably not. Which version are you running?

&gt; Which worker process died? (hobbitd_client is still running)

It's restarted automatically by hobbitlaunch.

* We need to investigate why the hb client message is oversize. Like following we found we have msg.*.txt file that is over 512k. This is  abonormal for bb message sampling of a system.

&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00# wc msg.k206.test.com.txt
    7943   55662  611936 msg.k206.test.com.txt
bash-3.00# ls -l  msg.k206.test.com.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 hobbitc  hobbitc   611936 May  2 18:35 msg.v04k206.test.com.txt
bash-3.00#

&lt;/pre&gt;
* Further investigation  found that [ports] section of msg.*.txt has too many output from two &quot;netstat -na&quot; commands.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00# grep netstat /opt/hobbitclient42/bin/hobbitclient-sunos.sh
netstat -rn
echo &quot;[netstat]&quot;
netstat -s
netstat -na -f inet -P tcp | tail +3
netstat -na -f inet6 -P tcp | tail +5
bash-3.00#

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. I'ld like to change the default period for graph display: by default hobbbit displays trends with 4 graphs (48h,12d,48d,576d periods).  It is possible change it to 48h,7d,30d,365d for example ? ===

'''A.''' It isn't configurable, but in the hobbit-4.2.0/web/hobbitgraph.c file near the top of the file you'll find these lines:

  #define HOUR_GRAPH  &quot;e-48h&quot;
  #define DAY_GRAPH   &quot;e-12d&quot;
  #define WEEK_GRAPH  &quot;e-48d&quot;
  #define MONTH_GRAPH &quot;e-576d&quot;

Change them to suit you. Then search that same file for the HOUR_GRAPH
etc. further down; you'll find 1 place where each is used like this:

  period = HOUR_GRAPH;
  persecs = 48*60*60;

and you need to change that &quot;persecs&quot; calculation also for all 4 graph
types.

Change the legend:
  //persecs = 12*24*60*60;
  persecs = 7*24*60*60;
  //glegend = &quot;Last 12 Days&quot;;
  glegend = &quot;Last 7 Days&quot;;

Then run &quot;make&quot; (from the hobbit-4.2.0 directory) and &quot;make install&quot; 
(or just copy the &quot;web/hobbitgraph.cgi&quot; file to your ~hobbit/server/bin/ 
directory).

== Graph FAQ ==

=== Q. Why does my Hobbit server have the following http response graph ? ===
Why does the response time of the http service differ so much. Is this a mis-configured http server?&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:hobbitserver-http-time.png|A trending of http response time.]]

'''A.'''Hundreds of reasons could cause a delay on an http server. We see a graph differ only in a range between 2 and 10 ms. This is quite normal. Due to the automated scaling, the graph differences look more important or drastic than they actually are.

=== Q. My Hobbit server has the following wrsmd* network traffic trending graph ? ===
      
[[Image:hobbitserver-bge0-network-traffics.png|A trending of bge0 network traffic.]]

'''A.''',  Inbound traffic is much more than outbound, this is normal. The Hobbit server receives lots of bb/hb message from clients.

==== Q. What are those wrsmd* interfaces ?  ====
'''A.''',
The wrsmd(7D) (WCI Remote Shared Memory (WRSM) DLPI driver) status was reported 
by the Solaris 10 command &quot;/usr/bin/kstat -p -s '[or]bytes64'&quot; used for 
[ifstat] in hobbitclient-sunos.sh. I said &quot;was&quot; because on all our patched 
Solaris 10 servers, we have not seen this for quite a while.

You can avoid this output by using &quot;/usr/bin/kstat -p -s '[or]bytes64' | grep 
-v wrsmd | sort&quot; for [ifstat]. You need also to remove all ifstat.wrsmd*.rrd files.

==== Q. Graph after correction   ====
The wrsmd interfaces now disappeared from the graph.

[[Image:hobbitserver-bge0-network-traffics-corrected.png|A trending of bge0 network traffic without wrsmd* intefaces.]]

=== Q. How can we use Hobbit/BBWin client to collect Bit/s on the Network interfaces? ===
'''A.''',  I'm very interesting in this question, but have not found an answer yet.

== Error FAQ ==
===  semop failed, Invalid argument ? ===
'''A.''', Frequently seen when hobbit dies ungracefully. Stop Hobbit, and run, 
          # ipcs |grep hobbit
          0x0100ba76 162758665  hobbit    600        262144     2
          0x0200ba76 162791434  hobbit    600        262144     2

          And remove any remaining shared memory segments.

==The Second Industrial Revolution==
The 1920s saw a period of unprecedented industrial growth, known as the &quot;Second Industrial Revolution&quot;. The industrial nations of the world saw the conclusion of a major shift in their primary energy source from coal to oil.  As well as providing cheaper and more abundant energy, which greatly stimulated economic growth, this shift had important geopolitical consequences.  Britain and France became deeply engaged in the countries of the Middle East to protect their petroleum supplies.  Japan similarly found itself dependent on overseas oil, specifically from Indonesian and Malay sources.  Russia and the United States were largely self-sufficient in oil during this period.  However, tensions and disputes over oil production regions and sea lanes, most notably those of Japan, would have a great influence on the outbreak and course of the Second World War (Adolf Hitler sought to seize Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus, while the Japanese justified their attack on Pearl Harbor by claiming that the United States was moving to choke off its supplies by sea).

Many consumer goods such as [[w:car|cars]] and radios were produced for the first time on an industrial scale, especially in the United States, where new highways and suburban home developments sprang up to accommodate the growing economic output.  The combination of inexpensive chemical fertilizer and mechanized harvesting saw agricultural productivity surge in many regions of the world, providing the basis for the twentieth century's exponential leap in world population.  Centralized, industrial agriculture had its dangers, however, as was seen in the Soviet Union, with the Bolsheviks' destruction of the independent peasant farmers and the great famine which Stalin deliberately caused in Ukraine for political reasons.

==The Great Depression==
One of the worst events of this period was the Wall Street Crash, which took place in 1929. A speculative bubble in stock market prices during the 1920s came to an end and investors (many of whom had borrowed money to buy stock) panicked, causing the US stock market to collapse. Millions were thrown out of work, and thousands of banks collapsed worldwide over the next three years.  The simplest explanation for the cause of the Depression was too much industrial output and not enough liquid currency to purchase all the goods produced.  There was no destruction of factories or other physical disaster; rather, the losses caused by the stock market crash magnified themselves across the global economy, as companies found themselves unable to sell their output to other firms which had been ruined.  Bread lines and economic refugee movements appeared in many countries.  

In hard-hit Germany, both Communists and Adolf Hitler's Nazi party assailed the centrist democratic government for failure to deal with the economic crisis and, in Hitler's case, for not restoring Germany to its pre-World War I great power status.  Hitler emerged the victor in this political contest, becoming Chancellor with help from high-placed conservatives who thought they could manage and control the Nazis.  Within a year and a half, however, Hitler had wiped out most opposition to his rule.

During this period, the Soviet Union, with its closed state-run economy, was insulated from the effects of the free-market crisis.  The brutal purges and political repression of dictator Josef Stalin, however, brought misery of a different kind on a great scale.  Paranoid and seeing enemies everywhere, Stalin reached unchallenged power by 1929 and soon began herding entire classes of people — peasant farmers, dissident Communists, non-Russian nationals — into the prison camp system known as the Gulag, on various flimsy pretexts.  Those who didn't perish from exposure, malnutrition or disease essentially became slaves of the Communist rulers, who needed large amounts of forced labor as they tried to forcibly industrialize the backward Soviet economy to match the West.

==Roosevelt and the &quot;New Deal&quot; in the U.S.==
Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as President of the USA in 1932, and promised to sort out the USA's problems with his &quot;New Deal&quot;. He introduced a wide range of social and economic policies to stimulate the American economy and raise standards of living through government intervention in the economy.  This was a major break with the values, deeply held by many in the U.S., that private business and industry should flourish or fall free from public influence.  Although many people criticized the New Deal when it was introduced, it did do a lot to help millions of Americans - for example, hundreds of schools, hospitals and roads were built by the Public Works Administration, one of the new agencies set up by Roosevelt.

Yes, the odds are minute. But, here's the thing, Charlie, even if you increase the odds of winning to 99.99999999% YOU STILL LOSE ON AVERAGE. Why?
Because the payout on high percentage bets is exeedingly low. In fact, when you account for a built in house edge/pay-to-play/bookie-cut, you are actually losing a small but real portion of your stake each bet. 
You may win some, you may lose some, the laws of large numbers dictate that if you play long enough your wallet will eventually be empty. That you can bet on! --[[User:Shmeedogg|Shmeedogg]] 01:14, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

Hi,

I cannot in any way see this as a wikibook for edutacional and academic purpouses. Also, you call it 100% complete, whilst it is mereley one page, and not a book at all. What do you mean with doing this? Have you not read the policies of the wikibooks?

Take a look at the [[Wikibooks:About|about page]], and please reconsider your book. --August 09:50, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

== [[Car Terms]] ==

Any particular reason this needs to be split into a total of four pages so far, when one would have sufficed? I find it best to use a minimum number of pages, then only split it, if it's getting too long. Furthermore, if you should need to create subpages, please follow the conventions on the page [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]. Thankyou. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 16:20, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Re: [[Car Terms]] ==

''If the book expands, it will be necessary to split it into sections;''

: Indeed. '''If''' the book expands. Perhaps you should wait to see how long it gets before making the decision as to split it. Also at this time, you will have a better idea of where a good place to split it would be. Leaving it on one page, using a '==' heading for each term would allow for easy linking via &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Car Terms#ABS|ABS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This way you don't have to remember which page number it's on. Page numbering is generally frowned upon.

''furthermore, short pages take less time to load. Remember that we don't all have broadband yet!''

: With text data, this is a negligable consideration, and probably unwise to model the book based on technical considerations. Generally we split pages which are over 32k (the system will warn you when this is the case), although a small hardcore of users belive it's always preferable to have the book in a single page to make it easy to print.

''How would you recommend naming the sections?''

: According to the provisional policy, one of two conventions is currently acceptable. &lt;code&gt;bookname/pagename&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bookname:pagename&lt;/code&gt;. The former has the advantage of automatically creating a link on the subpage back to the main page. In addition, you can extend the hierarchy if necessary to &lt;code&gt;bookname/sectionname/pagename&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bookname:sectionname:pagename&lt;/code&gt;. The former will then create a link back to the section and the book.

''If it gets big enough, one section for each letter of the alphabet might be a good idea - then something would always stay in the same section. Let me know what you think... [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 16:25, 12 July 2005 (UTC)''

: That would seem reasonable when it becomes necessary, and would allow for people to easily link via &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Car Terms/A#ABS|ABS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 16:49, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Becoming an admin on the Wikibooks Simple English ==

I see that you are trying to become an administrator with Simple English Wikibooks.  I hope that you have had some good luck in this area.  If not, I would strongly recommend that you take a look at [[meta:Steward|the Steward page on Meta]] to ask one of the folks there for some help.  I would also strongly suggest that you &quot;e-mail this user&quot; rather than try to use the talk pages, although the stewards will more than likely respond.  I totally agree with you that Simple English needs an admin, and if you are willing to do the work, put in the request.  There is no admin nomination page for that wiki either, so it is fertile ground to try and get it organized more properly.

I've also taken a glance around and there appears to be a couple of pages that need to be deleted as well.  So there is some cleanup work that needs to be done as well.  Contact the stewards to see if they can get you set up as an admin for Simple English Wikibooks  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:58, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

: From experience, you should also get a fairly swift response (&lt;24h) by using the official [[m:Requests for permissions]] page on Meta. There's usually at least one admin watching the page who can get things sorted out. It would probably be polite to use this page prior to contacting a specific steward, since this page is also watch by the developers who have even more power than stewards. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:59, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

This is a simple rice pudding recipe, dating to at least 1965, in Columbus Ohio USA.  

== Ingredients ==

*2 cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*2/3 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 cups cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (brown rice works as well as, if not better than, white rice)
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] or [[Cookbook:Zante currant|Zante currants]], if desired
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|Cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]] to taste if desired. (Approximately 1/8 teaspoon (US) for this serving size.  Add with other spices).

== Procedure ==

#Mix milk, eggs, sugar in a 3 quart casserole dish until thoroughly mixed and frothy.  
#Mix in cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla.  
#Mix in rice, then put in raisins.  Do not mix in raisins, or they will all wind up on the bottom!
#Place casserole in a larger baking pan with about 1 inch of water. 
#::This will keep the bottom from cooking too fast and burning.
#Bake in a 325 degree oven until set, about 1.5 hours.

'''Microwave Risotto'''. This risotto is made using the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]]. It requires
very little stirring and turns out quite well.

==Ingredients==

*3 cups simmering hot chicken broth
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*dash ground white or black pepper
*2 tablespoons butter
*2 tablespoons olive oil
*1/2 cup minced yellow onion
*1 cup uncooked medium grain rice

==Procedure==

#In a saucepan, bring chicken broth, salt and pepper to a low simmer, keep warm until needed.
#In 8&quot; x 8&quot; x 2&quot; an oven proof dish (or 10&quot; [[Cookbook:Quiche|quiche]] dish), heat oil and butter in microwave for 2-minutes.
#Add minced onion to the oven proof dish, stir to coat with oil, cook in microwave for 4-minutes.
#Add uncooked rice to the oven proof dish, stir to coat with oil, cook in microwave for another 4-minutes.
#Pour simmering chicken broth into the oven proof dish and stir well. Microwave 9-minutes. 
#Stir rice and chicken broth well and microwave another 9-minutes.
#If a creamier risotto is desired, add 1/4-cup warm water, stir well and microwave for another  2-minutes. 

Makes 3 main dish servings or 6 side dish servings.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#For a 750-watt microwave, use 100% power settings for each time interval. For 1000 or 1500-watt microwaves, use 70% power settings for each time interval.
#As a variation, use 2 1/2-cups chicken broth and 1/2-cup white wine.
#Freshly grated Parmesan cheese may also be added after cooking.

Hello Jimmy, I'm amazed with what you are doing in the mathematics School. I think you are doing a great job. I have no almost Idea about mathematics, but I'd like to help you if you have some doubt about how Wikimedia works.
May i give you some advises about the work to do? (they are just some opinions of my own, don't take them as if i were the commander who you must obbey, ok? :)
*Wikiversity is a baby so we don´t really know what it is going to be. It depends mostly on our work. 
*We must be careful so that we don´t make a mess. I mean, I think we should be careful making a clear distinction between the Wikiversity contents and the contents from other wikis. But, don´t forget that they exist and wikiversity may/should/have to/or even must get profit of their contents in order to save time and to make them more useful. Ah, of course, i also think that external links may always be very useful when Wikis do not cover an specific area.

*Another idea i had about Wikiversity is that we may enable discussion forums for the students where they may ask specific questions. The forums could be the discussions pages of each page in Wikiversity. It seems obvious, but I think it is very important.

So, until here, some ideas. I only wanted to share them with you, but, I will be glad to read your opinions, (excuse my terrible English, I'm spaniard)Chao, and continue with your great job. --[[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario_Discusi%C3%B3n:Javier_Carro Javier Carro]] 13:21, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==How can we solve the problem to separate School and resources?==
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that you would save much time if the theory part of the courses is filled with links to Wikibooks and articles of Wikipedia dealing with those topics, or with pedagogical resources of internet. I think that the content to study has got a right place in both projects. Wikiversity could be the place to meet those who want to study these topics and where may be described what a person may study, how, in which way, where can this person search for answers, ...

I don't want to discourage you at all. You do it great, but i think that in a wikischool we don't need to follow the same patterns as in a conventional school sometimes. For example, if somebody wants to learn maths, but he doesn't have the time to do it in a semester, as it is said in the divisions stablished by the conventional educational system, they should be able to study in the Wikiversity anyway, what do you think so? It's just my opinion, but in general terms your work is great. Continue, we will see the results in a few years of a free education which breaks many borders :) --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 13:11, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I think the idea of problems, questions, answers and solutions is great. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 13:14, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Yes, you should do it as you think so. Eventhough, sometimes, you may consider adding some link to support your course with optional resources, for those who want to contrast different views or to complement, somehow as if it were additional bibliography.--[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 13:34, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Content issues ==
Jimmy, you seem to be duplicating a lot of content. That in itself is not a big deal, it seems to be the norm here so that's not really the issue. The problem is that we should be trying to include as much of the differing content here as possible, to go in the Wikiversity sections, perhaps. I'd like to move your [[Wikiversity:Pure Mathematics]] sections elsewhere, but I don't want to do this in case I move it to a name you don't like. Do let me know what name you'd prefer, or you could move the stuff yourself. I'd like to rework the Pure Mathematics section to integrate all the existing content and add room for expansion [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:35, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Firstly, please sign your posts. Secondly, I'm talking about pages like [[Pure Mathematics 4]] which says nothing that it involves integration. I'm not trying to obliquely make a reference to your work ,but since everyone here seems to go off and write their own books, then what we can do is have a gatewy page for the Pure Math section or whatever, or have another seperate gateway page, and link to all the books and courses. Or we can simply pool resources and work on the content we have. I don't know.

But for the moment, we should make the several content pages as compartmentalized as possible, and that means that your pages such as [[Pure Mathematics 4]] should be moved. If you want to create a title for your structure, you can either let me know (&quot;Pure Mathematics&quot;?) and I'll move them, or you can move them yourself.

English-speaking people should thank God that we have so many different versions to use for devotional reading. Also, since the verse divisions and number were not included in the Bible until 1560 A.D., I haven't always quoted the entire verse, but rather focused on the phrase that was appropriate.

= About Me =

Welcome, I arrived on my birthday, April 5, this being the 63rd recurrence. My primary concern is the Modernity Version of the New Testament, secondarily, the definition of omnificence, who, what and wherefore that unique word, and thirdly, could expand on [[Pharmacognosy]]. A vision from God appeared in my rain soaked study Bible in 1991. On the quoted Ladder of Divine Ascent, it must rank as a 10. I would consider myself eligible to moderate a spiritual Wikipedia project.

We, the Wikipedia/WikiChristian Bible people translate/paraphrase the N.T. within the Weymouth tradition. I set the rules with the first two chapters of the Gospel of John and we see what develops as each verse starting with John 2:23 is up for edit. Unlock the secret, possibly, reverent thinking, definitely. THE RULES: Eliminate the seeming anti-semitism &amp;mdash; appears to be regional strife &amp;mdash; that is, Galilean against Judean supremacy. This requires [http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/greek/johnpap.html Judean(s)] for Jew(s). Racial epithets invariably are harsh sounds like the N word, Jew (boy), Wop, Slob, Injun, or Chink. &quot;Jews&quot; is emblematic, why not the more historically sound and melodic, Jew-dee-ans? There are 101 believes in John (KJV). Retain &quot;believe&quot; instead of Weymouth's &quot;trust,&quot; &quot;regards,&quot; or &quot;convinced.&quot; The watchword could be I AM [That I Am] He, rather blasphemous in that day. Order of Gospels should be JOHN, MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, and ACTS. What better in the beginning than &quot;In the beginning?&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia says John had sometimes been first in order in earlier times because of the surety of authorship (or statement of eye-witness account). The Epistles of Paul in historical order, is there a split Timothy movement, there is an outline in Weymouth? Make St. John, &quot;the greatest marvel of all the world's literature,&quot; more literary and the most important letters in history more historical, if it happens, this would be a testament to the communion of minds available here and, come on, your particular verse may live forever. Change British spelling and Elizabethan phraseology of Weymouth (sometimes all that is required). Highlight Aramaic origin (at least once). Explain John 7:53, make consistent figures of speech and capitalization throughout, i.e. Life of the Ages (3rd edition Weymouth) = eternal Life (5th edition). I love John's theology, although his discourses are somewhat repetitious. Matthew, Mark and Luke are open source, you can discuss Alpha and Omega till Kingdom come and, wala, Wikibook? Gender neutral when possible. John is the Book of Signs, use &quot;signs&quot; for quoting that word when spoken and substitute, miracles, for the running commentary. Plan to reconstruct an icon &quot;the truth&quot; in Greek of the P52 fragment as the ultimate visual image of the earliest New Testament manuscript. Each new verse will follow Weymouth 5th edition, minor changes have already been made with problem words for the sake of consistency. Bracketed [text] is termed explanatory apposition or inline footnote, could be read not said. Need only three such notes in the Gospel of John, initiate the ultimate Word play, add a touch of the miraculous, and send everybody home. John as a Gospel evidences considerable play on words, punning, and irony, such irony they say, that the &quot;very Christ&quot; (7:26) is proclaiming the Word all about with total impunity.

Thank you for your courtesy. This is an experiment, I just finished the layout, you found it before I was ready to publicize. I am a newbie, so maybe I won't publish at all. I have to contact the initiator of [[John 20:16]] and get his thoughts about Wikibook possibilities. [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] 00:21, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Come back [[User:64.198.97.66|64.198.97.66]]. How very fitting if the first verse (2:23) was edited anonymously, sure, there will be protocol for review with later verses, but if you feel the urge and accept the challenge, change the two words suggested, underline &quot;believers&quot; and leave your comment in the temporary (Discussion Start) section for the record. Even more fitting, it would be from the Avalon (High) School of Biblical Research, so well known in eccleciastical circles.

Thanks Dr. Prab, my image would have had copyright problems, this is even better, outstanding, and the caption still represents the quest for the truth in religious modernity or post-modernity which years past may have fragmented.

Glad to help, one of the things I'm working on is moving some of the more cumbersome links to easier to find ones (e.g., moving &quot;What does salvation mean?&quot; to simply &quot;salvation&quot; since someone is far more likely to type that into the search bar). ---- 08:36, 26 Apr 2005 (PDT)

= Annotation of N.T. (Discussion Start) =
Why change the verse?
example &amp;mdash; 2:23 Judeans do sometimes designate their celebrations as Festivals. Suggest return to original &quot;Feast&quot; and maybe &quot;witnessing&quot; instead of watching miracles. Passover revolves around the food or festive meal, others could be, for example, Celebration of Tabernacles.

= Constructive criticism, if wanted =
The translation below is rather free. We are dealing here with the Word of God! Therefore explanations belong into a commentary, not into the text (that's not just my view, that's even a pre-Christian tradition). If the syntax requires words to be supplied that are not in the Koine, then they should be placed in brackets, e.g. &quot;creative power&quot; in Jn 1:3 - that's apart from missing in this verse the difference betweeen &quot;to come&quot; and &quot;to become&quot; (when a bus comes along, hurray, but it has been in existence before it came into view...), and changing a negative into a positive statement. In v. 6 the translator introduces an appearance but drops a pregnant sending. In v. 7 the sending itself replaces the more humble came - humble, since this time it is the bus-type coming, not the being created one. Next a Semitism, a tell-tale literary feature, has been eliminated: &quot;witness that he might witness&quot;. These few examples of liberties in the translation convince me that its value is limited to a literary exercise. The translator of the text below cannot be regarded as a servant of the original, I mean servant like doulos, you know: like Mary, like David, like in Isaiah?!!!

Now everything is ok - the issue is with Wikimedia caching system - sometimes you have to reload page several times to see changes in templates used in it.

I changed WIW according to your suggestions. I'm not American so I am sometimes not aware of some small but vital details (like about educational system). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:33, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

==Regarding Gospel 101 Translation==
I accept the suggested task.  It will take me a while. Thanks! [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 07:31, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:I wanted to let you know, I have decided to drop the gospel translation class for the moment.  When I attempt it I get a lot of free associations that dogmatic believers might find heretical and I do not wish to expend the energy at the moment arguing with them.  I am attending adult sunday school and relearning the basics from an adult perspective.  Perhaps in a year or two I will be better prepared to venture into open discussion /debate on a public wiki such as this.  Thanks for the opportunity!

== Speedy Delete ==

I have posted a reply to the thread at '''[[User talk:Kernigh#Speedy Delete]]'''. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:28, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

== Deleting content on [[Christianity]] Wikibook ==

I'm sorry if it seemed arbitrary on the VfD.  This really was a legitimate place to have a speedy delete of the module, which really didn't have any content at all.  The sum total content of the page under dispute earlier was &quot;There is no wikipage about this.&quot;  I hardly consider that content worth keeping.  I am not trying to condemn the idea of the Christianity Wikibook, and indeed I have been a general defender of the concept.  I just felt that this one module needed rapid resolution as there was nothing to fight over.

I hope you continue to develop this Wikibook.  Don't take my deletion of one page as a slight against the Christianity Wikibook in general.  Keep up the very excellent work you have been doing here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

== An invitation ==

Please take a look at http://christianity.wikia.com and consider joining our project! --[[User:70.25.244.31|70.25.244.31]] 07:27, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Christianity]] and such ==

I sent a message to [[User:TeamZissou]], telling him that his actions are not correct, that he can't just delete content, and that he needs to work towards a solution as per [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]. You need to do the same. Add your table of prophesies back into the page (because it was improperly deleted), and make a message on the corresponding talk page ''and'' on [[User:TeamZissou]]'s talk page stating that the table has been reinserted, and that it should not be removed again without discussion first. [[User:TeamZissou]] has been warned, and if he causes more problems, we will be blocked. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== bold edits on recent changes page ==

A long time ago you asked why some edits on the recent changes page ( [[Special:Recentchanges]] ) were in bold.
I finally [[User_talk:DavidCary#Lord.27s_Table | figured out why]].

== Minor Changes ==
I have changed the phrases using 'me chamo' to 'chamo-me' and 'tchau' to 'adeus' as the former strikes me as Brazilian rather than European.  If someone has some evidence to show that the former usage is becoming more common in Portugal I would appreciate seeing it as I've never once heard that from a Portguese person (though I have not yet had the opportunity to visit Portugal istelf).  


== Giving some help here ==

I'm from Brazil, so I'm just revising everything here and fixing some things that sounded very unnatural. If any help is needed in further development of the course, please state this here.
Thanks





i've renamed this Lesson One, Saying Hello, just to tell people what's going to be taught.

== Transcription ==

Hi,
I don't know Portuguese at all. I try to begin from here but there is no pronunciation of the words. I think there are some peculiarity. For example: você - [vo`ke] or [vo`se] (as Complete Pronunciation says about letter c) or something other? Eu - [oi] (as German) or [eu] or ...?&lt;BR&gt;
I think it will be more clear if some native speaker add pronunciation to the words. No matter how easy for one part of world is to pronounce, some other part of the world may have difficulties.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A 'gripper' is a component of the robot used to manipulate an object loose from the robot itself. This can be a ball it needs to pick up, or the dirty socks it was programmed to find and dispose of. Grippers exist in many varieties ranging from simple; a thong-like design to complex arms.

How complex your robot's gripper has to be depends on what it's supposed to do with it. Picking up a ball requires a different approach than picking up socks.

== Kind of grippers ==
Grippers are commonly modeled after tools, machines or the human hand. The choice behind a gripper doesn't differ much from the choice of the tool on a excavating machine, forklift, crane or other machine.

== Scoops ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Flat Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Raised scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Raised Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Scoops are very simple 'grippers'. These can be flat, flat with raised edges or more complicated shapes. These 'grippers' are easily to control as they can be build with minimal moving parts: being able to move up and down is sufficient for many purposes. Forward Tilting is common too and may be necessary to 'unload' the scoop.

== Tongs ==
Tongs are more complicated than scoops but allow better control over what is picked up. For example: with a scoop it's very hard to pick up a glass and put it down somewhere else. With a tong-like gripper this is trivial.
Otherwise is it much harder to move a ball with a tong than with a scoop.

Tongs differ in the number of fingers and their shape. Most tongs have 2 fingers, one of those could be fixed.

=='Hands'==

[[File:CACM-film81jpg.jpg|thumb|Robot Gripper]]
Many designs for robot hands have been tried including quite anthropomorphic hands.  

Robotics has also led to a renewed interest in the 'design' of the human hand.  The asymmetry of the human hand and in particular the fact that a rod like object gripped in the hand naturally falls at about &lt;math&gt;45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; to the axis of the hand givews much greater flexibility in tool use than a symmetrical design would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=I.A.Kapandji |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Physiology of the Joints, Volume One|origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition=Fifth |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Church Livingstone  |location= |language=en |isbn=0-443-02504-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=278 |chapter= |chapterurl=|quote=..the tool can only be properly oriented for use when the handle runs obliquely with the axis of pronation-supination   }} &lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
==Degrees of Freedom==

Grippers also differ in their degree of freedom. Basicly there are 6 degrees of freedom: 3 translations and 3 rotations. See [[Theoretical Mechanics]] about these degrees of freedom.

But generally, unless you're building an arm, you wouldn't need all 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). You get one DOF for free on a mobile robot: it can already move forwards and backwards on its own. Although adding gripper movement along this direction will increase your robot's accuracy, it's not really necessary.

How many DOF you need depends on how complicated the movement of your robot has to be. If it only needs to pick up a glass and move towards a goal and put it down again, it would be sufficient to make a gripper that can tilt back (towards the robot).

If you intend that your robot will have to be able to pick up Lego blocks and build a structure with them, you'll need more DOF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==By air==
London has five main [[w:airport|airports]].
*[[wikipedia:London Heathrow|London Heathrow]] ([[wikipedia:LHR|LHR/EGLL]]) - has five terminals.  Flights arrive here from all over the world, including North America and Australia.  According to the owner, [[wikipedia:BAA|BAA]], Heathrow is the world's busiest airport, serving over 67 million passengers in 2004.  The &quot;Heathrow Express&quot; train goes from all terminals to [[wikipedia:London Paddington|London's Paddington station]] in 15 minutes.  All terminals are also served by the Piccadilly Line of London's Underground train network.  The Underground is cheaper than the Heathrow Express, but journey time to central London is around 45 minutes.  Expect to pay around £5 for travel to the centre of London.
*[[wikipedia:London Gatwick|London Gatwick]] ([[wikipedia:LGW|LGW/EGKK]]) - has two terminals. There are &quot;[[wikipedia:Gatwick Express|Gatwick Express]]&quot; trains to [[wikipedia:London Victoria|London Victoria station]], which take about 30 minutes.  Local Commuter trains are also available, and are cheaper with a slightly longer journey time.
*[[wikipedia:London Stansted|London Stansted]] ([[wikipedia:STN|STN/EGSS]]).  London Stansted is the main airport for Low Cost Airlines from Europe.  Their are direct train connections to Liverpool Street Station. The National Express A9 bus service operates a 45-55 minute service to [[wikipedia:Stratford|Stratford]] train and tube station.  As of July 2005, this costs £7 one way.
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are all operated by BAA (British Airport Authority).
*[[wikipedia:London Luton|London Luton]] ([[wikipedia:LTN|LTN/EGGW]]) - mainly handles European flights
*[[wikipedia:London City|London City]] ([[wikipedia:LCY|LCY/EGLC]]) - in the [[wikipedia:Docklands|Docklands]] area of the city. Flights from airports in the UK and Europe only.  London City Airport is linked to the Canary Wharf area and to the Liverpool Street Station by a shuttle bus.  The Docklands Light Railway opens in December 2005 providing direct links to Canary Wharf and on to Bank tube station in the city

==By rail==
===International services===
There are [[w:Eurostar|Eurostar]] services direct to the city from Brussels, Lille and Paris. They arrive at [[w:St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]].

===Domestic services===
Express rail services link London to all other major cities in Britain. The main stations include:
*[[w:Euston station|Euston]] for services to the West Midlands, north and mid-Wales, northwest England and western Scotland.  
*[[w:Kings Cross railway station|King's Cross]] for services to West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, northeast England and eastern Scotland. 
*[[w:St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] for services to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire.
*[[w:Fenchurch Street|Fenchurch Street]] and [[w:Liverpool Street|Liverpool Street]] for services to Essex and East Anglia.
*[[w:Waterloo station|Waterloo]], [[w:Victoria Station (London)|Victoria]] and [[w:Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] for trains to the south
*[[w:Paddington station|Paddington]] for services from the west, southwest England, and south Wales

==By sea==
Ferry services run from [[w:Portsmouth|Portsmouth]], [[w:Hull|Hull]] and [[w:Dover|Dover]] in the UK to neighbouring towns in Europe. [[w:Catamaran|Catamaran]] services provide a faster crossing. Rail, bus and taxi services provide connections to the London.

[[w:Hovercraft|Hovercraft]] services between [[w:Dover|Dover]] and [[w:Calais|Calais]] ended in October 2000 after thirty years of service. Although not useful for entering the country, a hovercraft ferry service still runs to the [[w:Isle of Wight|Isle of Wight]].

      <comment>/* ADHD */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==A short note on the purpose of this section==
This section is intended as a Psychology 101 level introduction to mental disorders. For a more complete course of study, go to the PSY 2065 section.

•	Criteria for defining psychological disorders depend on whether cultural norms are violated, whether behavior is maladaptive or harmful, and whether there is distress.
•	The medical model describes and explains psychological disorders as if they are diseases.
•	The vulnerability-stress model states that disorders are caused by an interaction between biological and environmental factors.
•	The learning model theorizes that psychological disorders result from the reinforcement of abnormal behavior.
•	The psychodynamic model states that psychological disorders result from maladaptive defenses against unconscious conflicts.
•	Psychologists use objective and projective tests to assess psychological disorders.

==What Is Abnormal?==
Abnormal Psychology is the study of psychological differences from the norm. Usually this means disorders, but also includes mental deviances that are still considered unusual, but do not seriously affect a person's functioning. 
A disorder is defined as a mental trait or other facet of mental functioning that occurs in the minority of the population and is detrimental to the well being of the self or of others.

See: [[../Criticisms of Psychology/]] for some critiques of this concept.

==The diagnostic systems==
===What is the diagnostic systems?===
Among the mental health professions (marriage and family therapy, clinical social work, professional counseling, psychology, and psychiatry) different diagnostic systems are used. The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is used in the USA. It is issued by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Outside the USA the most used system is the ICD (International Classification of Diseases [http://www3.who.int/icd/vol1htm2003/fr-icd.htm]). This is issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 

The current editions of the systems are DSM-IV-TR (text revision) and ICD 10.

===Types of Disorders===

==Disorders Diagnosed in Early Childhood==
This category of disorders includes disorders that are usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood.
==== ADHD ====

'''ADHD in children'''

ADHD(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a psychological complaint that usually starts in early childhood. As with many other disturbances, it has been more than a challenge to diagnose the prevalence of ADHD and it is estimated that three to ten percent of children show symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity or inattentiveness (Nair, 2006). It is evident that boys are more than twice as likely to be affected, than girls (Knölker, 2003). ADHD does not have a single cause, it is a medical disturbance, affecting several areas of the brain, especially the frontal part which is responsible for executive functioning that controls regulation of behavior, working, learning, planning and organizing. Currently it has a multifactoral and integrative clinical picture which includes genetic predispositions, neurobiological, psychological, as well as psychosocial and environmental factors, which are especially important concerning the progression of the disorder (Schneider, 2009). The DSM-IV currently states three different subtypes of the disorder. First, the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive type where the patient suffers from six or more of the inattentive symptoms but less than six of the symptoms of hyperactivity for at least six months. Second, the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, where the patient suffers from at least six symptoms of the hyperactivity and impulsivity scale but less than six on the inattentive scale for at least six months. Finally, the combined type, which is a combination of at least six symptoms on both scales and persisting for at least six months (Michael B. First, Allen Frances, &amp; and Harold Alan Pincus, M.D., 2002).

''Symptoms of the inattentive type''

* Difficulty paying attention in school or in general. Produced work is often chaotic and  filled with careless mistakes
* Rapidly distracted by all kinds of trivial stimuli, noises or people
* Difficulty  paying attention to one task or activity at a time
* Trouble finishing and concentrating on everyday tasks that require concentration and time management like homework, paperwork or other duties
* Frequently drifting from one unfinished task to another
* Procrastination
* Disorganized work manner
* Forgetfulness in daily activities
* Inability to complete tasks such as homework or other assignments
* Frequent drifts, not being able to be present and follow the conversation and not grasping the details or rules when it comes to activities in social situations

''Symptoms of the hyperactive type''

* Squirming and Fidgeting when seated
* Frequent aimless running and walking
* In teens, being restless and in children running, climbing and squirming when it is not appropriate
* Having difficulty engaging in any quite or calm activity
* Always being on the go
* Excessive and pointless talking  
(Michael B. First, Allen Frances, &amp; and Harold Alan Pincus, M.D., 2002).

'''Causes'''
	
It has been found that about 50 percent of affected individuals suffer from a genetic dysfunction of the neuronal communication in the brain (Nadder, 1998). This is especially the case for the neuronal circuit that is responsible for motivation, cognition, emotions and motor behavior which includes the frontal lobe and the striatum. It is mostly acquired genetically, but prenatal complications during child delivery, pollutants, decreased birth weight, infections and deprivation or ailment of the central nervous system can also be possible risk factors. Research also confirmed a lack of dopamine or lower levels of receptors and transporters in the accumbens and midbrain.  Additionally, prenatal conditions like cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption have been related (Bush, 2005).

'''Treatment'''

ADHD can be classified in three levels of severity. Individuals, who are less severely affected, but have the genetic predisposition for the disorder and do not necessarily need treatment. Visible symptoms might include less inhibition and slight difficulties to concentrate. Individuals, who are more severely affected, need treatment. They might be more likely to suffer from comorbid disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety etc.), suicidal thoughts and are more prone to difficulties in school and loss of employment. However they usually do not have any social malfunctions or disruptive behavior. The severe affected individuals depend on treatment, their behavior is socially disruptive and they are at much greater risk for developing substance abuse or criminal tendencies. It has been found that the two most important aspects of development of the disorder are the age when it is detected, and the way the social surrounding reacts to it, up until to the point of diagnosis. With an extensive prophylaxis and the education of the patients social environment, it is possible to attenuate the symptoms (Lauth, 2002). A treatment-plan could for instance include some of the following (coaching, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, psychoeducation, psychosocial intervention, pharmacology). However, the attenuation can only go as far as the synaptic and cortical plasticity of the brain, because the seriousness of ADHD mostly depends on neurobiological aspects. In this regard, it is crucial to approach the treatment in a multimodal way. The patients' potentials should be detected and expanded, improvement of social skills and the treatment of possible comorbid disorders should be important aspects (Deutscher Ärzte Verlag, 2003). 

'''Medication'''

Medications that are commonly used to treat ADHD since the 1950´s are stimulants, which include methylphenidates and amphetamines. Non-stimulant drugs like atomoxetine are also available as alternative (Wigal, 2009). Stimulants have various side-effects, the most common ones include insomnia, euphoria, increased locomotion, restlessness, loss of appetite, psychosis, dependence, increased heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term side effects on the other hand have not been sufficiently established yet. The most common and known methylphenidate is Ritalin. Ritalin belongs to the immediate release tablets, together with Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Methylin, Penid, and Rubifen. Their most important characteristic is that the majority of the beads are released immediately after intake and a small amount of beads are released again about five hours after intake. The other type of methylphenidates are sustained release tablets, namely Concerta, Metadate CD, Methylin ER, Ritalin LA, and Ritalin-SR.  These tablets have an immediate release of approximately 30 percent or even less and the rest is evenly distributed 10-12 hours after intake. This guarantees a much longer effect (Green List: Annex to the annual statistical report on psychotropic substances 2003). Another type of medication includes amphetamines like Adderall, which are also used for the treatment of ADHD and work similar as cocaine, but last longer. The effects on the central nervous system are diverse and independent of each other. They can be divided into three classes: psychoanaleptic, hallucinogenic and empathogenic. Just like methylphenidate, amphetamines increase norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. When amphetamines are active, the concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft increases (Robertson, 2009).

'''Culture and Society'''

The use and general perspective people have about stimulants differs from country to country. In the United States the medication is prescribed very fast and easily, however, in other countries, like the UK or Germany, it is very difficult and sometimes even illegal for adults to obtain them and is meant for very severe cases only (King, 2006). During authorization of the last Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) it was brought to light that some of the authors of the ADHD related chapters were paid by the pharmaceutical industry to write a rather subjective and brought diagnosis of ADHD. The goal was to make more children fit the criteria of the disorder and to substantially increase profits. For this reason, the authors that will publish the DSM-V in 2012 are obliged to disclose their income and are not allowed to earn more than 10000 US Dollar per year for manual embrace (Center for Science in the Public Interest 2008), (The New York Times 2008).

'''ADHD in adults'''

Children who have been diagnosed with ADHD in the United States are known to be less likely to graduate from high school, obtain a college degree and have higher chances of various negative life outcomes like being involved in car crashes, teen pregnancy, substance abuse etc. (Molina, 2009). The stigmatization of people and especially of peers with mental illness is common and has been a great problem in society. Mental illnesses can be unapparent like in the case of depression, or they can be obvious, like in the case of ADHD. High comorbidity of ADHD is responsible that patients are commonly mistreated for other mental illnesses like for instance depression. A study by Fischer revealed that mental health care professionals might still not be adequately capable of diagnosing ADHD and that they ought to take the presence of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) as a warning for potential ADHD (Fischer,2007). The severity of ADHD in childhood predicts the likely outcome of the illness in adulthood. It became evident that around four percent of adult population suffers from it, and that this subgroup attracts numerous negative life outcomes e.g. lower academic and professional performance, higher divorce rates and lower socioeconomic status (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005). Of those four percent overall affected, 80 percent present comorbid problems, and are often misdiagnosed with malfunctions like conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, antisocial personality disorder, substance abuse, anxiety disorders and most commonly MDD (Biederman, Faraone, Spencer, &amp; Wilens, 1993; Downey, Stelson, Pomerleau, &amp; Giordani, 1997). A subsequent study by Kessler found out that the majority of adults in the United States who suffer from ADHD remain untreated, even though they seek therapeutic help for many other comorbid disorders (Kessler et al, 2006).

==Tic Disorders==
===Tourette's Syndrome===
Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is a disorder characterized by the presence of at least two tics, one motor and one physical. The vocal tic is, however, more critical to the diagnosis of Tourette's. Tourette's syndrome sufferers usually have faster reflexes than other people. 
Tourette's syndrome sufferers have a roughly 40% occurrence rate of involuntary swearing, known as coprolalia. This relatively rare symptom has been abused by the media and is a source of much misunderstanding about TS.
Tourette's syndrome is also featured in a number of movies, such as 'What about Bob?', in which Bob, the main character, pretends to have Tourette's.

==Anxiety Disorders==
===Phobias===
Phobias are fears of a specific object or situation.  Most phobias have a heritable basis- identical twins separated at birth often develop the same phobia, regardless of environment.  Other evidence for the heritable argument is that many phobias are logical when the human ancestors are considered.  It makes sense that natural selection would favor genes that caused our ancestors to fear natural dangers like snakes, spiders, and other poisonous animals.
Strong memories of situations may also create a phobia.  For example, if a person was placed in a tight space as a toddler and nearly suffocated, a life-long fear of closed spaces may follow (claustrophobia).

===Panic Attacks===
Random panic
===Obsessive Compulsive Disorder===
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by the presence of two things: Obsessions and Compulsions.
Obsessions are defined as recurring or persistent thoughts, images, or actions that significantly interfere with a person's day-to-day functioning. Some common obsessions are cleanliness, symmetry/order, and fear of falling seriously ill. The person will attempt to minimize or eliminate these unwanted thoughts through the use of compulsions.
Compulsions are the behaviors used to cope with obsessions. The most common compulsions are hand washing, checking (as in checking to make sure doors are locked several times a night), and counting.


While most people with OCD only have one to a few main obsessions, the disorder also interferes with many thoughts and actions unrelated to their obsessions. For example:

A person who obsesses over cleanliness will often be caught in a loop: First, they will wash their hands. As they finish, the thought occurs to them that the water may have been contaminated. So they wash again, and this time, upon finishing, they wonder if there were germs in the soap. Again, they wash their hands, and after drying, they will likely wonder who's been touching the towel. This goes on and on - if the person does not execute the compulsions, the obsessive thoughts won't allow them to focus on anything else.

But the pattern often shows in other situations: perhaps the person notices a knife laying out in the kitchen, and suddenly realizes that, if they wanted, they could use it to kill their entire family. This normally isn't a pleasant thought, and the person tries to push it from their mind. But the thought doesn't go away - it stays at the front of the person's mind until the person acts on it (hopefully by putting the knife away or going into another room). These thoughts aren't (or shouldn't be) nearly strong enough to make a person murder anyone, but they are very distracting, unpleasant, persistent, and often damaging. For reasons similar to this example, many people with OCD are uncomfortable around sharp objects or weapons.



Case studies to follow?

==Psychotic Disorders==
===Schizophrenia===
The schizophrenic disorders are characterized in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are inappropriate or blunted. Clear consciousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained although certain cognitive deficits may evolve in the course of time. The most important psychopathological phenomena include thought echo; thought insertion or withdrawal; thought broadcasting; delusional perception and delusions of control; influence or passivity; hallucinatory voices commenting or discussing the patient in the third person; thought disorders and negative symptoms. 

The course of schizophrenic disorders can be either continuous, or episodic with progressive or stable deficit, or there can be one or more episodes with complete or incomplete remission. The diagnosis of schizophrenia should not be made in the presence of extensive depressive or manic symptoms unless it is clear that schizophrenic symptoms antedate the affective disturbance. Nor should schizophrenia be diagnosed in the presence of overt brain disease or during states of drug intoxication or withdrawal. (from [http://www3.who.int/icd/vol1htm2003/fr-icd.htm WHO - ICD 10])

==Sexual Disorders==
===Paraphilias===
====Pedophilia====
a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age

===Addiction And Dependence===
==  Impulse Control Disorders   ==

An Impulse Control Disorder can be loosely defined as the failure to resist an impulsive act or behavior that may be harmful to self or others (Hucker, S. J., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;	Hucker, S.J. (2004) “Disorders of impulse control”. In: Forensic Psychology by O’Donohue, W. and Levensky, E. (eds), Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Impulse-control disorders are psychological disorders characterized by the repeated inability to refrain from performing an act. An impulsive behavior or act is considered to be one that is not premeditated or not considered in advance and one over which the individual has little or no control. The concept of impulsivity covers a wide range of “actions that are poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation and that often result in undesirable consequences” (Daruna &amp; Barnes, 1993, p. 23)&lt;ref&gt;	Daruna, J. H., &amp; Barnes, P. A. (1993). A neurodevelopmental view of impulsivity. In W. G. McCown, J. L. Johnson, &amp; M. B. Shure (Eds.), The impulsive client: Theory, research, and treatment (pp. 23–37). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Impulsivity, by Grant (2008)&lt;ref&gt;	Grant, E. Jon., (2008), Impulse Control Disorders: A Clinician’s Guide to Understanding and Treating Behavioral Addictions, BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEW, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to stimuli (either internal or external) without thinking of the negative consequences. Impulse control disorders share common core qualities such as repetitive or compulsive engagement in a behavior despite unwanted consequences, diminished control over the problematic behavior, an urge or craving state prior to commitment in the behavior, and a hedonic quality during the performance of the behavior in question. Subjective distress and impaired functioning are often a consequence of impulse control disorders, and their avoidance feeds the cycle of repetitive behaviors. Patients with these disorders continue to struggle with their desire to engage in the behavior that might have terrible outcomes (i.e. addictions, gambling) and it might cause emerging social, occupational, financial, or legal consequences.

Another definition of impulse-control disorders are defined by the American Psychiatric Association (2000)&lt;ref&gt;	American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (IV-TR). Washington DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; as “the failure to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others”. Typically the “individual feels an increasing sense of tension or arousal before committing the act, and then experiences pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the act” (p. 609). Following the act there may or may not be regret, self-reproach, or guilt.

Under many of the poor decision making and impulsive/short sighted behaviors there lays a perceptual distortion called delay discounting (Perna, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;	Perna, Robert, (2010), Impulsivity, Shorsighted Decisions, and Discounting. A review of Madden, Gregory and Bickel, Warren, (2010), Impulsivity: The Behavioral and Neurological Science of Discounting, PsychCritiques, Vol:55, No: 8, 1&lt;/ref&gt;. Delay discounting is an evaluation process whereby when considering an immediate behavior; a person minimizes the long-term risks or benefits associated with that decision. It is a decrease in the subjective value of a reinforcer (i.e., money, drugs) as a function of time to its delivery. Impulsive behaviors occur when individuals choose small but immediate rewards over long term rewards (or reducing possible long term risks).
Eysenck (1977)&lt;ref&gt;	Eysenck SB, Eysenck HJ: The place of impulsiveness in a dimensional system of personality description. Br J Soc Clin Psychol, 1977; 16:57–68&lt;/ref&gt; related impulsivity to risk taking, lack of planning, and making up one’s mind too quickly. Patton et. al.(1995)&lt;ref&gt;	Patton JH, Stanford MS, Barratt ES: Factor structure of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. J Clin Psychol 1995; 51:768–774&lt;/ref&gt; considered impulsivity in three components;

# Acting on the spur of the moment (motor activation)
# Not focusing on the task at hand (attention)
# Not planning and thinking carefully (lack of future planning)

Impulse Control Disorders are a specific group of impulsive behaviors that have been accepted as psychiatric disorders under the DSM-IV- TR. The following are included under the Impulse Control Disorders in the DSM-IV-TR (APA,2000)&lt;ref&gt;	American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (IV-TR). Washington DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;;

*Intermittent Explosive Disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of failure to resist aggressive impulses resulting in serious assaults or destruction of property.
*Kleptomania is characterized by the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects not needed for personal use or monetary value.
*Pyromania is characterized by a pattern of fire setting for pleasure, gratification, or relief of tension.
*Pathological Gambling is characterized by recurrent and persistent maladaptive gambling behavior.
*Trichotillomania is characterized by recurrent pulling out of one's hair for pleasure, gratification, or relief of tension that result in noticeable hair loss.
*Impulse-Control Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is included for coding disorders of impulse control that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific Impulse-Control Disorders described above or in other sections of the manual.

===Etiology===

Grant (2008)&lt;ref&gt;	Grant, E. Jon., (2008), Impulse Control Disorders: A Clinician’s Guide to Understanding and Treating Behavioral Addictions, BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEW, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; suggests similarities regarding impulse control disorders and the existence of a neurobiological feature also present in addiction. Therefore, he suggests that impulse control disorders can be considered as behavioral addictions. The positive responses obtained from treatment with opioid antagonists and glutamatergic agents suggests that the dopamine and possible glutamate systems affected by these medication may have a role in impulse control disorders as well as substance abuse and dependence to substances. The neural systems regulating impulsive, compulsive, and habitual behaviors likely have some differences; however, there seems be overlapping neurobiology (e.g., activation of the OFC) that might explain why several psychiatric disorders have comorbid impulsive and compulsive features (Torregrossa, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;	Torregrossa, M, M., Jennifer J. Quinn, and Jane R. Taylor (2008) Impulsivity, Compulsivity, and Habit: The Role of Orbitofrontal Cortex Revisited, BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2008;63:253–255&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Prefrontal Cortex- more specifically the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC)- is thought to play a role in the etiology of decision making and impulse control behaviors. According to Jentsch (1999)&lt;ref&gt;	Jentsch JD, Taylor JR (1999): Impulsivity resulting from frontostriatal dysfunction in drug abuse: Implications for the control of behavior by reward-related stimuli. Psychopharmacol 146:373–390.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Prefrontal Cortex is thought to be impaired in disorders of impulsivity and compulsivity such as drug addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as attentional disorders.
	
The biological theories formulated to explain the causes of impulse control (or lack of) problems are similar to those of substance use. Schmitz (2005)&lt;ref&gt;	Schmitz, J. M. (2005). The interface between impulse-control disorders and addictions: Are pleasure pathway responses shared neurobiological substrates? Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity, 12, 149-168.&lt;/ref&gt; posits a biologically based theory of ICD’s or as he calls them “behavioral addictions”. He hypothesized that the behavioral addictions are using the same neurological reward/pleasure pathways as do substance related disorders. These specific neurocircuits have been identified to take role in the reward/pleasure pathways involved in the reinforcing properties or drug abuse and drug craving. According to Koob (1992)&lt;ref&gt;	Koob, G. F. (1992). Drugs of abuse: Anatomy, pharmacology and function of reward pathways. Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 13, 177-184.&lt;/ref&gt;, the neurotransmitters which have a role in the reward pathways are dopamine, opioid peptides, glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Drugs stimulate this pathway and cause the person to feel feelings of intense reward/pleasure. Addictive behaviors are thought to work in this manner too.

'''Reward Deficiency Hypothesis'''

The Reward Deficiency Hypothesis proposes that those individuals who have a malfunctioning reward/pleasure circuit are not satisfied with the normal rewards such as food and sex but rather they are in need of unnatural rewards that cause higher thrills and excitement (Becker, 1999; Comings &amp; Blum, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;	Becker, H. C. (1999). Alcohol withdrawal: Neuroadaptation and sensitization. CNS Spectrums, 4. 38-65. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	Comings, D. E., &amp; Blum, K. (2000). Reward deficiency syndrome: Genetic aspects of behavioral disorders. Progress in Brain Research, 126, 325-341&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schmitz (2005)&lt;ref&gt;	Schmitz, J. M. (2005). The interface between impulse-control disorders and addictions: Are pleasure pathway responses shared neurobiological substrates? Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity, 12, 149-168.&lt;/ref&gt;, impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, or pathological gambling have similar patterns to drug cravings associated with chemical dependency, therefore, they are thought to have their bases in the reward pathways. In example, when a kleptomaniac has the urge to steal, he/she is feeling the thrill and a high that is similar to high from drugs.

'''The Feeling State Theory (FST)'''

The Feeling State Theory posits that impulse control disorders were created when positive feelings form links with specific objects or behavior thus forming a state-dependent memory (Miller, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;	Miller, R. 2010, The Feeling-State Theory of Impulse-Control Disorders and the Impulse-Control Disorder Protocol, Traumatology, 16:3, pp 2-10&lt;/ref&gt;. This state dependent memory is formed of feelings and the event: which make up a unit called a ‘feeling state’. This is seen as the cause of impulse control disorders. During the creation of these ‘feelings states’ the person feels intense psycho-physiological arousal and can become fixation on this. Therefore, to feel it again, the will repeat the behavior to reach that state. FST includes the element of memory as well stating that the ‘feeling sate’ is composed of feelings associated with behaviors plus the memory of the behavior. For example, a person who thinks about the emotions and thoughts when he felt good could raise the memory and cause him to repeat the behavior and to be impulse in seeking the event.

===Connections between ICD and OCD, and Addiction===

Habits and impulsive behavior have been considered to be at the opposite ends of a behavioral spectrum however, the behaviors that define impulsivity and compulsivity have some commonalities. Compulsivity is the leading cause of obsessive-compulsive disorders where the person is compelled to do a certain act to relieve anxiety/stress even when the behavior seems inappropriate. They repeat these behaviors in a ritualistic manner and as mentioned above, the involve dysfunction in the OFC (Evans, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;	Evans DW, Lewis MD, Lobst E (2004): The role of the orbitofrontal cortex in normally developing compulsive-like behaviors and obsessive-compulsive disorder. &lt;/ref&gt;. When we consider impulsivity, it also includes an element of inability to inhibit a motor response and somewhat compulsive in nature. People suffering from an impulse control disorder have mentioned to obsess about performing the act (in relation to their disorder) and being feeling compelled to do so (Grant, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;	Grant JE, Potenza MN (2006): Compulsive aspects of impulse-control disorders. Psychiatry Clin North Am 29:539 –551.&lt;/ref&gt;.

One difference between the ICD’s and OCD’s is that individuals with ICD’s engaging in repetitive behaviors are considered to be egosyntonic; generally refers to behaviors, values, feelings that are in harmony with or acceptable to the needs and goals of the ego, or consistent with one's ideal self image or self concept. The person feels pleasure, gratification or relief at the time of committing the act. The repetitive behaviors or rituals in OCD’s are considered to be egodystonic (Grant, 2006; Blasczynski, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;	Blaszczynski A. Pathological gambling and obsessivecompulsive spectrum disorders. Psychol Rep 1999;84(1):107–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	Grant JE, Potenza MN (2006): Compulsive aspects of impulse-control disorders. Psychiatry Clin North Am 29:539 –551.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the compulsions experienced or expressed are not consistent with the individual's self-perception; the patient realizes the obsessions are not reasonable. Individuals with ICD are generally sensation seekers and that’s why they are impulsively repeating thrilling behaviors, where as OCD individuals are more interested in harm avoidance and repetition of behavior reduces anxiety for a certain time.

Drug addiction is also involves impulsivity (i.e. to take drugs), a compulsion that is pushing someone to take drugs after chronic usage and eventually developing into a habit that is further characterized by automatic responses to take drugs without considering the outcomes. ICDs and substance disorders have similar disturbances related to affective regulation. After performing ICD action and feeling the associated high patients have described the acute onset of depressive symptoms that is similar to those occurring during withdrawal from many substances, including depressed mood, feelings of guilt, fatigue. Another similarity has been the behaviors associated with tolerance and withdrawal. For example, pathological gamblers have reported that they need to progressively increase to larger sums of money in order to feel the desired ‘high’ (Goodman, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;	Goodman, A., 1997, Sexual addiction. In Lowinson JH, Ruiz P, Millmasn RB, Langrod, JG, eds Substance Abuse, A Comprehensive Textbook. Baltimore, MD: Williams and Wilkins, 1997:340-354&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to tolerance where to dosage of the substance has to be increased to get the same high). Also, the have reported to have physiological symptoms such as insomnia, anorexia, tremor, headaches, upset stomach, nightmares on discontinuation of gambling (Anderson, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;	Anderson G., Brown, R. I, 1984, Real and Laboratory gambling, sensation seeking and arousal. Br J Psychol. 75:401-410 &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Is a travel book suitable for Wikibooks? ==

Hi everyone. Is this a suitable book? I've just started with some info on getting to the city (airports, rail links etc.) The image on the title page was on Wikipedia, but was marked as GDFL so I hope it's OK to put it here. [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 15:19, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

: I think travel guides are at least as suitable as the [[Jokebook]].  Just to give you a bit of extra exposure, I linked to this book from the Wikipedia articles [[w:London]] and [[w:South Kensington]].  Oh, using a GFDL image from Wikipedia is accecptable, provided you attributed it to the proper author, and having a link back to its location in Wikipedia is nice too.  An image from [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] is even easier to use. ;). [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:15, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: At [[Help:How to start a book]] reads ''Travel-Guides should go to [http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page WikiTravel]'' --[[User:Easyas12c|Easyas12c]] 07:21, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

You're a star. Thank you :-) [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 14:26, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)

:This book was previously nominated for deletion but was kept. At that time en.wikivoyage.org did not exist, and now it does, and inside Wikimedia. So probably no, a travel book is no longer suitable for Wikibooks.

== Controversy ==

This is just crap, really. &quot;This Wikibook tells you about some of the best sights and things to do in London, England.&quot; lol &quot;London, England&quot; like it's in Alabama or something! &quot;&quot;Big Ben&quot; is the tower with the clock at the right of the building&quot; err no that's crap. at least get your facts right &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:81.153.154.60|81.153.154.60]] ([[User talk:81.153.154.60|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/81.153.154.60|contribs]]) 15:55, 5 Jul 2005  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

: Fair enough, it's the bell in the tower. There are other Londons in the world, and as many U.S. citizens seem to have a difficulty with European geography I thought I'd include the &quot;England&quot; to clear this up. And you should get a user account and sign with that instead of hiding behind an IP address. Coward. [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 7 July 2005 14:24 (UTC)

:: U.S. citizens have a difficulty with European geography because the majority of that country is seriously ignorant and has barely even looked at a map of the world. These people aren't welcome in Europe. Is there any doubt that this wikibook is talking about the London in England?? And you should use your real name instead of hiding behind a silly pseudonym. Coward. Bobby456 &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:81.153.154.194|81.153.154.194]] ([[User talk:81.153.154.194|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/81.153.154.194|contribs]]) 14:50, 7 Jul 2005  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

::: No need to get offensive. While there are a lot of problems with the US of A it has some good elements too. However the US is the country which currently causes the most environmental damage, and George W. Bush is a threat to the world. [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 8 July 2005 09:03 (UTC)

: In addition, if something is wrong, shouldn't you then edit the page to make it correct? That's what the whole wiki thing is about. Harrasing people to 'get their facts straight' is nonsense on a wiki. It's not like this is a fixed print publication, with a single author who is wholly responsible for factual errors. ''If something is wrong, then change it!'' [[User:Abc123|Abc123]]. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding signed but undated comment was added at 17:18, 12 July 2005  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

== The image ==

I've replaced the old image, which looked a bit gloomy and had little colour, with this new one from the (Wikimedia) Commons :-). This image is mroe suitable because it shows both the old (the Palace) and the new (Eye) elements of London, as well as the river.

===Union Contract===

The contract above is for non-union actors. For actors who belong to a union (in the USA and Canada, the Screen Actors Guild), you must talk to a SAG representative ('''lawyer''').  For low budget movies, there are [http://www.sagindie.com special agreements].  But understand that when you sign most of the SAG agreements (which appear very simple), you also agree to the SAG Basic Agreement which is not simple and is not available to the public. There are restrictions which are not obvious.  Signer beware!!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The conditional and provisional can be constructed in several ways. The bad news is that it can be tricky to choose which one to use. The good news is that even the less correct choices should be understandable. Here we'll try to explain the differences among these to give you an idea.

The main forms for &quot;if/when A then B&quot; are
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| style=&quot;color: gray&quot; rowspan=&quot;4&quot; | もし&lt;br /&gt;もしも
| A と B
|-
| Aぇば B
|-
| Aたら B
|-
| Aなら B
|}
Let's now look at each of these in turn.

The provisional and conditional forms are like the 〜て form in that they connect two sentences together. The second sentence is, however, not necessary if its meaning is contextually implied.

== Forms ==

=== Natural consequence ===

In cases describing a natural consequence one can use &quot;と&quot;. This is similar to English: &quot;Eat this apple and you'll be sick.&quot; which in Japanese would be &quot;このリンゴを食べると病気になります。&quot;

=== Provisional forms ===

'''Verbs''' take on the provisional form by changing the final syllable from the う-row to the え-row and adding &quot;ば&quot;. This applies to both consonant stem verbs, e.g. 行く -&gt; 行けば, and vowel stem verbs, e.g. 食べる -&gt; 食べれば, and 寝る -&gt; 寝れば.

'''Nouns and adjectival nouns''' take on the provisional form by using the provisional form of the copula, &quot;なら&quot;: &quot;勉強なら習う&quot;, &quot;if you study, you learn&quot;.

=== Conditional forms ===

The conditional form is formed by adding &quot;ら&quot; to the plain past tense (ending in 〜た), e.g. 行ったら, 食べたら, and 寝たら.

'''Nouns and adjectival nouns''' take the conditional form of the copula, either the polite &quot;でしたら&quot; or the plain &quot;だったら&quot;.

=== Unsorted... ===
{{Japanese example|
: いまいく。おそくない。
: いまいきます。おそくありません。 
:: I'll leave now.  I will not be late.

: いまい{{japanese verb style|provisional|ければ}}おそくありません。
: いまい{{japanese verb style|conditional|ったら}}おそくない。
:: If I leave now, I will not be late.
|}}

To use '''adjectives''' in a conditional expression, replace the final &quot;い&quot; with &quot;ければ&quot;.
{{Japanese example|
: ねむいです。ねる。
: ねむいです。ねます。
:: I'm tired.  I will sleep.

: ねむ{{Japanese verb style|provisional|ければ}}ねる。
: ねむ{{Japanese verb style|provisional|ければ}}ねます。
:: If I'm tired, I will sleep.
|}}

== Uncertainty ==

The word &quot;もし&quot; shows that the condition/provision is not necessarily true.

: もし、かなしかっ{{japanese verb style|conditional|たら}}、わらおう！ // If [you] are sad, smile!

Sometimes it takes the form もしも, which also means if.

      <comment>Whym moved page [[Japanese/Lesson Relative Clauses]] to [[Japanese/Lessons/Relative Clauses]]: sorting out the pages under [[Category:Japanese]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Relative clause}}
Japanese ''relative clauses'' are formed by placing the modifying clause immediately in front of the noun it modifies. The modifying clause acts much like an adjective (which it can also consist of).
{{Japanese example|
: Present positive: {{furi|水|みず}}を{{furi|飲|の|む}}{{furi|人|ひと}} — The person who drinks water:
: Past positive: テレビを{{furi|見|み|た}}{{furi|人|ひと}} — The person who watched television
: Present continuous: {{furi|寝|ね|て}}いる{{furi|猫|ねこ}} — The sleeping cat}}

Relative clauses allow relatively complex ideas to be expressed simply.
{{Japanese example|1=
: &lt;span title=&quot;くるま- Car&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;を&lt;span title=&quot;か.う- to buy&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;買った&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;あに- Older brother&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;兄&lt;/span&gt;は&lt;span title=&quot;かねも.ち- Rich person&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;金持ち&lt;/span&gt;です。- The older brother who bought the car is rich.
: &lt;span title=&quot;はて.る- To end&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;果てない&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;ゆめ- Dream&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;夢&lt;/span&gt;が&lt;span title=&quot;とま.る- to stop&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;止まって&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;しま.う&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;しまいました&lt;/span&gt;。- The unending dream is ending.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your personal plan should be made up of two parts: 1. Where to go, and 2. How to get there. 
== Where to go ==
=== SMART Goals ===
When we set out to do something, it is to our benefit to set clear goals and to make a plan that will help us reach them. The “SMART” acronym below is a tool that we can use to make sure that we are covering all of the appropriate areas in the process. More information can be found in the [[w:Time management| time management on Wikipedia]]. Just remember that if you don’t make your goals specific, measurable, achievable, results-oriented, and time-limited, they are not really goals, but intentions, no more. 
: S  Specific
: M  Measurable
: A  Achievable
: R  Results-oriented
: T  Time-limited
An example:
: Specific I want to improve my natural speech patterns, active vocabulary, fluency, and correct written form. 
: Measurable Improve my TOEFL score by 10 percent. (Use on-line or offline testing tools to determine beginning numbers, then set a goal for improvement.)
: Achievable (The improvement in the measured numbers to be within reason.)
: Results-oriented I want practical, real-world improvement in my levels of oral and written English.
: Time-limited The follow-up testing will be done two months after the first testing.

Now, using the above example as a guide, write out your own  SMART goals for improving your English. Decide which [[../Areas of English Proficiency|areas of English proficiency]] will be your priorities. Write down '''how much you would like to improve in each of the areas.'''

== How to get there (personalizing your plan) ==
Following are specific steps that you can take to improve each of your targeted [[../Areas of English Proficiency| areas of English proficiency]]. 

=== Vocabulary (passive and active vocab)  ===
* Daily reading (news and online articles, books, NYTimes, HBR, Give and Take, Wikipedia.org, The Millionaire Next Door …)
* Writing summaries of articles and mini research papers

=== Fluency (finding words quickly) ===
* Conversation with others
* Your internal mental conversation
* Reading (news, business literature, novels, magazines, blogs …)
* Writing
* Presentations (make up your own or imitate someone else’s)
4113321

=== Natural speech patterns ===
* Reading regularly in English. Daily is a good goal, even if it is only fifteen minutes. Look for topics on interest on the Internet or in English books or magazines.
* Conversation and contact in English with native speakers, or at least with others who are learning. 
* Watching TV and movies in English (news, entertainment, documentaries…)
* Online audio news (NYTimes, VOANews, BBC News …) 
* Presentations of speeches copied from native presenters 
* Listening to and reading CD magazines like English2Go and Speak Up for natural flow and inflection
=== Written English (grammar and spelling) === 
* Grammar book exercises 
* Reading 
* Writing
*test

=== Pronunciation ===
* Conversation
* TV, music and movies
* Listening to and reading passages at the same time
* In general, all oral communication: listening and speaking

=== Flow of speech ===
* Conversation
* TV, music and movies
* Listening to and reading passages at the same time
* In general, all oral communication: listening and speaking
* Reading newspapers in front of mirror.

=== Culture ===
* Reading about culture explicitly in Internet, books, and magazines
* Observing culture implicit in written materials
* Entertainment from target countries 
* Interacting with natives

Focus your attention on the activities that will help you improve primarily in the top areas on your personalized list. This takes a bit of discipline, but allow your actions to be guided by where you want to go in your learning. Don’t spend all of your time reading articles about current news if your main objective is to improve your pronunciation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Should the first page be restructured? ==

Having the fulfilled prophecies table on the first page might seem rather overwhelming to the casual reader. Perhaps they should see the contents of [[Christianity/Overview]] instead?

Also the way it is now if someone goes to the overview first they might not even find the prophecies list as it's not anywhere in the TOC.

Anyway, see what you think. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:53, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

== Should This Book Continue Without Radical Changes? == 

IMHO what content is here appears to be very much not NPOV. Esp. given the &quot;fulfilled prophecies&quot; table. The content appears to be specific to the perspective of some denominations of Christianity. 

While I think a humanities text on Christianity is not inappropriate, I believe it would need to be more descriptive of the religion in general being at least inclusive of the many denominations which claim the Christian tradition. Better yet, to my mind, would be for this &quot;book&quot; to be a section within a larger work on Comparative World Religions. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 21:06, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes I have been wondering about that for a while. However NPOV wordings of that section (&quot;prophecies that certain denominations have been fulfilled&quot; &quot;allegedly fulfilled prophecies&quot;) would sound rather awful. And Christianity is a vast enough topic that it gets its own book, indeed certain major denominations within it could even have their own books too one day. Just as we have a book on the C programming language and yet despite the fact that C++ is based on it we have that in a completely separate book. Related topics are only shoved together if they aren't very deep; Christianity has been the topic of countless multi-volume works. But yes I agree something does need to be done, as long as it can be done without making the text ungainly. The difficulty is that believers in Jesus have a difficult time writing in the pseudo-cynical manner that produces NPOV, as that goes somewhat against their deepest convictions. Hm. But it's something to work on. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:30, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::Someone might be offended by &quot;Our Savior,&quot; so the change to &quot;The Saviour&quot; is crucified (prophecy), now does that imply The Savior of the world? In Luke the term is &quot;'''A''' Savior which is Christ the Lord,&quot; hanged if you do, hanged if you don't. Serving the Lord as in computer language meant reverently delivering a web page, too cute, replaced that bottom line with entry into &quot;How To&quot; translate the Bible. Certainly, without presenting the Messianic prophecies as fulfilled, one would virtually emasculate Christianity. On the pseudo-cynical side, two of the prophecies have no exact O.T. reference according to authorities, but the Bible says no scripture can be annulled (John 10:35 Weymouth N.T.) and who would want to?

:::Hm, that's another problem, yes that could still be offensive; while no longer implying that he is ''your'' saviour it is still implying that he is ''a'' savior, and if you're an athiest you'd think that's rubbish. Saying &quot;the Christian Saviour&quot; is horrendous, but would certainly fulfill the NPOV issue. Really I don't know how things like this can be fixed without some parts ending up sounding stupid. Gah... :( [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:15, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

::No plans to solve the problems of &quot;the world&quot; here. Unless, this is an allegory of life. Well yes, the Savior of &quot;the world&quot; reference relates to the Samaritan woman discourse of [[Christianity/John 4|John 4]]. Jesus starts the discourse with an exclusivity claim, &quot;Our&quot; salvation is regional, but His message and demeanor say otherwise and convince a whole town of outsiders (Samaritans) that He is the Savior of the world. It is all about worship, only different mountains to climb and if there are too many paths to enlightenment, I guess you end up worshipping the mountain. The first outreach after Pentecost was to those Samaritans by Philip the Evangelist (Acts 8:5) and the rest is history. Then, the sheep are those who follow Christ and the remainder, nominally, the goats, are Samaritans or the mix. Thus, even though at the judgment you are on your own, we could have the ideal world where all Christians are CHRISTIAN and all Samaritans (outsiders) are GOOD (Luke 10:30-37) and everyone has a mountaintop experience, now, do you feel better already. Obviously, the best option is &quot;The Savior,&quot; but something must be said for the Samaritans (out there).

==Poorly written==

I think that this who wikibook is poorly written; The contents structure looks quite adequate, but the articles are poorly written, not detailed, and there seems to be a good dose of added weird stuff. I think that this wikibook should be deleted and started again. Anonymous browsing user: --[[User:121.45.182.172|121.45.182.172]] 15:55, 23 May 2007 (UTC) - or perhaps it should just link into wikichristian which is much better organized and has more detail.

==Chapter 5: Later Christian Movements==

Mormons, since they do not share the orthodox Christian conception of the Triune God nor much else shouldn't be called a Christian movement any more than Bahai is. Same goes for Christian Scientists as they deny the dual nature of Christ. Adventists are possibly Christian depending on the particular sect.

Perhaps a new division is needed?

Chapter 5: Later Christian Movements (SDAs, Christian Fundamentalism, ???)

Chapter 6: Non-Christian Groups With Christian Roots (perhaps put it between the current 6 &amp; 7)
(Bahai
Jehovah's Witnesses
Mormons
Christian Science
Unitarians?
Quakers?
Others?)

If we are going to define Christianity as Christians have for 2000 years, then we cannot lump neo-Arians and others who deny basic facts about Christ as Christians.
:Could change heading back to (Later) Prophetic Movements as listed in 2006 which would cover the 3 sects as they are. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:16, 25 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">My primary area of interest is Software Quality, especially in regards to Usability.  I've got a background in pre-press publishing, but that was in the heyday of '''Aldus''' PageMaker.  Still, the urge to design has never left my bones.

I hope to bring an aesthetic eye to everything that I do, so I imagine I'll do the same here.  While I may not be able to spot dangling participles, I'm nearly always wrangled into spearheading User Documentation for the projects that I've worked on, due to my desire to communicate ideas clearly.

As a ''non-traditional'' student, technical (and mathematical) content isn't always my strongest subject.  However, I am delighted by learning and fascinated with this project.  I thought perhaps I could bring my &quot;beginner's mind&quot; to wiki books, and improve the education other life-long students such as myself.

Hopefully, if I spot some tangled turn of phrase, I'll help it more than I hurt it.</text>

      <comment>yet more modular robots</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A robot is generally designed for one particular activity, or at best a few closely related activities. This of course isn't the ideal situation as many jobs require a large number of very different activities. For example, building the walls of a house and installing plumbing and electricity require very different tools and techniques. In practice this means you'll end up designing either several different robots or a very complicated one. 

Modular robotics is one answer to such problems. Typical modular robots consist of a number of independent cubes, which can move and connect themselves in many different ways. Each of the cubes have their own power supply and intelligence and can have specific tools. When a problem is fed to its computer, it analyzes it and connects the cubes in such a way that it can solve the problem.

Ideally such a robot would consist of a very large number of very small identical cubes. This is similar to the way plants, animals or humans are consisting of many cells, which are practically identical, with the difference that specification would happen in software rather than in chemical composition.

The difference between fractal and modular robotics is that the former allows multiple sizes of cubes and the latter does not. 

Most people are familiar with the fact that sufficient quantities of clay bricks (architectural bricks) or Lego bricks can be used to approximate nearly any shape, and so our introduction to modular robotics was in terms of cubes.
Instead of making each cube independent, some researchers make pairs or triplets of cubes independent&lt;ref&gt;
[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/index.php/The_Self-Reconfiguring_Robotic_Molecule MIT Distributed Robotics Lab wiki: &quot;The Self-Reconfiguring Robotic Molecule&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, some roboticists point out that rhombic dodecahedron are, in some ways, superior to cubes&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www2.parc.com/spl/projects/modrobots/publications/pdf/rdtechreport.pdf &quot;Rhombic Dodecahedron Shape for a Self-Assembling Robot&quot;]
by Mark Yim, John Lamping, Eric Mao, J. Geoffrey Chase. (1997 ?)
&lt;/ref&gt;.

The open-source Unified
Simulator for Self-Reconﬁgurable Robots (USSR)
can be used to simulate and test various modular robot designs and algorithms before building physical hardware.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://github.com/mimog/ussr GitHub: unified simulator for self-reconfigurable robots];
[http://modular.mmmi.sdu.dk/wiki/USSR Unified Simulator for Self-Reconfigurable Robots (USSR)] at the USD Modular Robotics Research Lab wiki.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The open-source ARGoS robot simulator can be used to simulate large heterogeneous swarms of robots.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/argos/ ARGoS]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have built physical prototypes of modular robots.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.selfreconfigurable.com/ &quot;Self Reconfigurable Modular Technology&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;


Some people use the phrase &quot;modular robot&quot; to indicate that its interfaces have been standardized so elements can be swapped out without custom-made adapters.
(See
[[Space Transport and Engineering Methods/Advanced Manufacturing#Modular Robot]],
[[Seed Factories/Basics#Modular Design]],
[[Seed Factories/Notes3#Modular Design:]],
[[Seed Factories/Notes8#1A.3.4 Supply Internal Transport]],
etc.
).
Such a modular robot has:
* the wrist of a robot arm has a standard mounting pattern so several &quot;hands&quot; with different kinds of tools can be swapped out;
* the shoulder of a robot arm has a standard mounting pattern that can be attached to a fixed pillar or various motion bases;
* a standardized power connector makes it easy to swap between a small lightweight battery, a heavier longer-lasting battery, and mains power;
* etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motion with Constant Acceleration ==

In some situations, you will find that a particle is accelerating at a constant rate, so it is helpful to derive some basic relationships between the parameters of the problem.  The problem of a constantly accelerating particle is completely characterized by the total time traveled, the initial position, the initial velocity, and acceleration.  That is, we can figure out anything about particle at any time with just these quantities. 

We will start from the definition of the problem that the particle has constant acceleration:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = a = const.&lt;/math&gt;.

Integrating once, we get

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dr}{dt} = at + C &lt;/math&gt;.

By the definition of velocity, we have

&lt;math&gt; v = at + v_0 &lt;/math&gt;

(I have replaced C with &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; the initial velocity because at t = 0, &lt;math&gt;C = v(0)&lt;/math&gt; which is a constant, and it makes sense to call it &lt;math&gt; v_0&lt;/math&gt;).

Integrating again, we have

&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + v_0 t + r_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial position.

Now we can find position and velocity as functions of time, which is the complete solution to the problem.  However, it is often useful to introduce the distance traveled as an independent variable instead of time.  To do this, all we have to do is eliminate t from two equations above.  The result is

&lt;math&gt; v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(r - r_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Much less useful, but standardly taught is to use the average velocity as an independent variable.  The average of a function between a and b is defined as

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;.

This is the limit of the arithmetic mean as the number of arguments goes to infinity.

Average velocity (averaged over time) is thus

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{r - r_0}{t} &lt;/math&gt;.

eliminating r and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; with the equations of a and v as functions of time we get

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{1}{2} ( v + v_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

So, here's the list of results:

&lt;math&gt; v = at + v_0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + v_0 t + r_0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(r - r_0) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{r - r_0}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{1}{2} (v + v_0).&lt;/math&gt;

I could come up with more independent variables (it's very easy!), but generally it's easier just to do the calculation when you need it, and not to memorize tables and tables of simple results.  On a similar note, you could calculate analogous results for a constant third derivative of position (commonly called jerk) or even constant nth derivative.  Or if the nth derivative equals a given function, such as acceleration &lt;math&gt;= ksin(cosh(t/t_0))&lt;/math&gt;.  It all reduces to doing a couple messy integrals, then some messy algebra.  The point is that the only reason working out constant acceleration is worth doing is because it comes up a lot, otherwise it is worthless.

==Motion in More Than One Dimension==

It is an intriguing result that the motion of a particle in one direction does not affect the motion in any perpendicular direction.  The classic example is if you shoot a gun level to the ground and drop a bullet at the same time, they hit the ground at the same time as if they started at the same height.  That is, the motion of the bullet horizontally has absolutely no affect on how it moves vertically.  You might ask why is it then that a paper airplane thrown and dropped do not hit the ground at the same time -- the answer is that the situation is fundamentally different because you have interaction with the air.

A mathematically precise way of saying this is that the velocity really is a vector.  It adds like a vector, and you can split it up into components like a vector.

Using this notion, let's derive the constant acceleration equations for vectors and you can see how vectors are very useful.

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 r_i}{dt^2} = a_i &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts indicate the ith component of the vector.

Integrating each component (or equivalently, integrating the vectors),

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{a} t + \mathbf{v_0} &lt;/math&gt;.

It's easy to see that everything is working out in exactly the same way it did for the 1 dimensional case, except we're doing it in every component!

Thus we have

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{a} t^2 + \mathbf{v_0} t + \mathbf{r_0} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v_0}) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0}}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

and with some messy vector algebra,

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 (2  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}}  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} - \hat{\mathbf{a}}) + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) + 2 \| \mathbf{v} \| \| \mathbf{v_0} \| (\hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \hat{\mathbf{a}} - \hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}} \hat{\mathbf{v_0}})&lt;/math&gt;.

which simplifies down to:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}  = \mathbf{v_0} \cdot \mathbf{v_0} + 2  \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;.

But that's what it is if you were wondering.  A hat above a vector is the vector divided by its magnitude, making it a unit vector in the direction of the original vector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''London''' is the capital of the [[w:UK|United Kingdom]]. It comprises 32 boroughs as well as the '''City of London''' which is where the Roman military camp '''Londinium''' was set up approximately 43AD.  There are around 7.4 million people in Greater London (the City and 32 London Boroughs).

The City of London is in fact one of the smallest cities in the UK at only about a square mile.  The term ''London'', as commonly used, refers in fact to '''Greater London''', which covers an area of approximately 1584km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and includes the actual city, the surrounding business district and the surrounding residental neighbourhoods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Roman London==
The military camp of [[w:Londinium|Londinium]] was established by the Romans in 43AD, on the north bank of the Thames near the modern Tower of London.  The actual Roman settlement was nearer to what is now Colchester.

In 60AD, the Iceni Britons rebelled and razed the military camp of Londonium and the settlements at Colchester and Verulamium to the ground.  Led by Boudicca, the Queen of the Britons, who had suffered humiliation after the death of her husband, Prasutagus, the rebellion did not last, as the Romans were quick to retaliate.  Boudicca was defeated, and took her own life by way of poisoned chalice soon afterwards.  The town of London was established by the imperial procurator Classicianus, whose tombstone can be found in London today.

The town was enclosed by high, stone walls, the remains of which are still accessible from London Wall and beside Tower Hill tube station. The old wall is still evident from the namings of some of the Underground (tube) stations: Moorgate on the west of the perimeter and Aldgate on the east.

Londonium was governed from the Guildhall in the City centre and some of the buildings are still used for municipal purposes to this day. When building contractors were excavating foundations for the new Guildhall art gallery in 1999, remains of a Roman ampitheatre were discovered and the gallery's blueprints were amended so that the excavated site could be preserved. The ampitheatre, dating from around 4AD, is now housed on display in the gallery's basement.

==Victorian London==

==The 20th Century==

===The Second World War (1939-45)===
London suffered extensive damage during this period. Over 35,000 were killed and hundreds of thousands were made homeless following heavy bombing campaigns. The [[w:East End of London|East End]] was one of the worst-affected areas, as the population density here was very high.


====Barrage balloons====
These were deployed in the many parks of London during that war. For details see

===Postwar London===

London hosted the [[w:Olympic Games|Olympics]] in 1948 - the first Games since the war.

==London in the 21st Century==
On the morning of 7 July 2005, four bombs exploded across the city's transport network. They killed at least 50 people. See [[w:7_July_2005_London_bombings|July 2005 London Bombings]] for more information.

London will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012.

==Population==
There were a few farmsteaders in 1 AD. In 300 AD there could have been up to 20,000 inhabitants following the Roman invasion. After they left the population declined, but following the establishment of [[w:Lundenburgh|Lundenburgh]], it began to increase again. Many were killed by the [[w:Black Death|Black Death]] in the 14th century.

By 1700 London had nearly 10% of the entire population of England and Wales, and was the world's largest city in 1801 with 959,300 people (this was recorded in the first census). Growth continued and reached a record level in 1939: 8.6 million lived in London at this time.

Following the destruction caused by the Second World War, many left London to new towns that were set up around the city such as Harlow. 7.2 million lived in the Greater London area in 2001, and this is predicted to rise to 8.2 million by 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Portuguese|Return to Portuguese]] &amp;ndash; [[Portuguese/Contents|Return to Contents]] &amp;ndash; [[Portuguese/Contents/L1/Lesson Three - What Are You Going To Do?|Go to Lesson Three]]

Welcome to the second lesson in our Portuguese language course. If you haven't already, have a look at [[Portuguese/Contents/L1/Lesson One - Saying Hello|Lesson One - Saying Hello]]

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;

== Dialogue 2==

'''Ricardo''': Você gosta de chocolate? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Sim, gosto de chocolate. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Sim. Gosta de chocolate de leite ou chocolate branco?  &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Eu e a minha esposa gostamos de chocolate preto. &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': O chocolate preto é bom.&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Até logo! &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Once again, don't worry if you don't pick up everything - or even anything. However some words are fairly obvious.

'''o chocolate''' - this means '''the chocolate'''.
The '''o''' we slipped in above means ''the'' in Portuguese - but here's the catch - only for certain words. Because in Portuguese we introduce a concept called 'noun gender' which means that every noun - that is, every word that represents a thing - animal, mineral, vegetable - is either masculine or feminine. This is a mostly abstract concept. However, there are some words like 'homem' ('man', which is masculine) and 'mulher' ('woman', which is feminine) that follow logical patterns (as do others that refer to something with a specific gender). Most words, however, like 'carvão' ('coal', which is masculine) and 'casa' ('house', which is feminine) seem to be completely random. That is why you always have to learn the gender of a word when you learn a word. 

Have a look at these examples.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''o gato''' - the cat (masculine)

'''os pêssegos''' - the peaches (masculine, plural)

'''a casa''' - the house (feminine)

'''as árvores''' - the trees (feminine plural)
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As you can see, the word for 'the' changes with every gender. It also changes depending on the NUMBER of things you are talking about. If there is more than one object we call it 'plural' and so the word for 'the' changes again. 

Unfortunately, the word for 'the' isn't the only thing that changes with gender. Adjectives - words that describe an object - change depending on what gender the object they are describing is.

Some more examples...

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''o gato é amarelo''' - the cat is yellow

'''os pêssegos são amarelos''' - the peaches are yellow

'''a casa é amarela''' - the house is yellow

'''as árvores são amarelas''' - the trees are yellow

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Can you see a pattern? We started with '''amarelo''' to translate &quot;yellow&quot;. Can you see the similarity between the word for &quot;the&quot; in this instance - '''o''' - and the ending of the adjective, ''amarel'''''o'''? &lt;br&gt; When the word for &quot;the&quot; changes to '''a''', so too does the end of the adjective - we get ''amarel'''''a'''. So to change an adjective from masculine to feminine, we just change the final letter from an '''o''' with the masculine form to an '''a''' in the feminine.

To get to the plural forms, add an '''s''' - ''amarel'''''os''' and ''amarel'''''as'''.
Try the following exercise out.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

'''Fill in the following chart for the word '''''vermelho''''' - which means &quot;red&quot;.'''

1. Masculine Singular = ______________

2. Feminine  Singular = ______________

3. Masculine, Plural  = ______________

4. Feminine,  Plural  = ______________

'''Complete the following phrases by converting the word in the brackets, which is the masculine singular adjective, to the appropriate form of the adjective.'''


5. As meninas são _________ (bonito) - ''The girls are (pretty)''

6. O gato é __________ (branco) - ''The cat is (white)''

7. Os tios são __________ (educado) - ''The uncles are (polite)''

8. A casa é __________ (bonito) - ''The house is (pretty)''


'''Answers'''

1. vermelho 

2. vermelha

3. vermelhos

4. vermelhas

5. bonitas

6. branco

7. educados

8. bonita

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt; 

How did you do? It's not that tricky if you keep in mind the link between the word for &quot;the&quot; and the ending of the adjective.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EED2EE&quot;&gt;
Before we move on to even more difficult ideas, let's have another quick pronunciation tip: if you have difficulty pronouncing the &quot;lh&quot; sound (like in '''vermelho'''), you can approximate it by pronouncing the &quot;ll&quot; sound from English words like ''billiard'' or ''million''. That is to say, it sounds similar to an &quot;l&quot; followed by a &quot;y&quot;.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Before we go, let's have a look at three things.

1. The Verb '''SER''' &lt;br&gt;
You may have noticed that, despite the fact that we said last lesson that the verb for &quot;to be&quot; is '''estar''', when we said &quot;The house is yellow&quot; we translated it as '''a casa é amarela'''. Shouldn't that be '''a casa está amarela'''? Unfortunately in Portuguese there are two verbs that translate to the English verb &quot;to be&quot;. One is '''estar''' - the other is '''ser'''.

Let's have a look at the verb table for SER in the Present Indicative Tense:

&lt;big&gt; '''SER - To Be''' &lt;/big&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ou&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (familiar) are&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;é&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Ela&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;é&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;é&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;omos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (plural) are&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Vocês s&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eles s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So when to use '''ser''' and when to use '''estar'''? 
One way to remember the difference is to remember where they came from. '''Ser''' comes from the Latin word 'esse'. In English, we derive the word ''essence'' from the same Latin root. '''Ser''' is used to talk about WHAT something or someone is. The verb '''estar''' that we met in Lesson One comes from the Latin '''stare''', from which we also get our English word '''status'''. '''Estar''' is used to talk about the state of something, HOW is it. Some examples...

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
Uses of '''SER'''

'''O sol é amarelo.'''
The sun is yellow.

'''Meu nome é Jim.'''
My name is Jim.

'''Nós somos portugueses.'''
We are Portuguese. 
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
Uses of '''ESTAR'''

'''A cerveja está gelada.'''
The beer is ice-cold.

'''Eu estou doente.'''
I am sick.

'''O livro está em cima da mesa.'''
The book is on the table. 
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

When talking about the location of something, use '''ser''' if the thing being located is always or usually there (like a building) but '''estar''' if (like a person, or animal) they tend to move around and are only in the spot for a period of time.
If you still find '''ser''' and '''estar''' confusing, go the this page - [[Portuguese/Contents/Ser and estar|Ser and Estar]]

2. The second thing we still haven't got around to the main point of this article - how to say we like something. In the dialogue 
Ricardo asks '''Você gosta de chocolate?''' This means &quot;Do you like chocolate?&quot;

João responds, '''Sim, gosto de chocolate.''' This means &quot;Yes, I like chocolate.&quot;

So we have a formula for asking someone whether they like something. We can also respond.

&lt;table
 style=&quot;text-align: left; height: 110px; width: 621px;&quot;
 border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 193px;&quot;
 colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Voc&amp;ecirc; gosta''' &lt;br&gt; ''Do you like''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;&gt;do &lt;br&gt; ''(of the)'' &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 129px;&quot;&gt;chocolate &lt;br&gt; ''chocolate''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;4&quot;
 style=&quot;width: 135px; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span
 style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''?'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;&gt;da &lt;br&gt; ''(of) the''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 129px;&quot;&gt;bebida &lt;br&gt; ''drink''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;&gt;dos &lt;br&gt; ''(of) the''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 129px;&quot;&gt;livros &lt;br&gt; ''books''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;&gt;das &lt;br&gt; ''{of the)''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 129px;&quot;&gt;ma&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;s &lt;br&gt; ''apples'&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The response will be 

&lt;table
 style=&quot;text-align: left; height: 54px; width: 606px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
 cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;big&gt; '''Sim''', &lt;br&gt; ''Yes,''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;'''gosto''' &lt;br&gt; ''I like'' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;do/da/dos/das &lt;br&gt; ''(of)(the)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 197px;&quot;
 colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;chocolate/bebida/livros/ma&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;s &lt;br&gt; ''chocolate/drink/books/apples''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''N&amp;atilde;o,'''&lt;br&gt; ''No,''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;'''n&amp;atilde;o gosto''' &lt;br&gt; ''I don't like'' &lt;/big&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

OK, but why do we have the options of do/da/dos/das? Perhaps you have picked up on the endings of these words? They correspond to the words meaning &quot;the&quot;. But why do we say '''do''' instead of '''o''' or '''das''' instead of '''as'''? Well, because in English we talk of &quot;to like&quot; wheras in Portuguese the phrase is '''gostar de''' which means &quot;to like of&quot;. As a memory aid, you can think of the English phrase &quot;to be fond '''of'''&quot;, which, like the Portuguese &quot;gostar&quot;, does not make sense without that &quot;of&quot;. The word for &quot;of&quot; in Portuguese is '''de'''. However when it appears before the words '''o''', '''a''', '''os''' and '''as''' we contract it - we squeeze the two words up. So, for instance

'''gostar de a amiga''' - &quot;to like the friend&quot;. This is incorrect. Squish 'de' and 'a' into one word - 'da'. We now have '''gostar da amiga'''.


3. The final thing we need to look at is the order of adjectives. Usually in English the adjective (or describing word) comes BEFORE the word it is describing. For example.

The YELLOW dog. The POLITE mother. 

However in Portuguese the opposite (usually) happens.

'''O cão amarelo''' - The yellow dog (literally, &quot;The dog yellow&quot;)

''' A mãe educada''' - The polite mother. (literally, &quot;The mother polite&quot;)

Adjectives can also be placed BEFORE the word they describe. This will cause their meaning to change slightly. However, we will deal with that situation a little later on.

That is all for Lesson 2. Have a little rest then see how you fare on [[Portuguese/Contents/L1/Lesson Three - What Are You Going To Do?|Lesson Three.]]

==Introduction==
[[Image:Perturbed_Energy_Spectrum.png|framed|Perturbed Energy Spectum]]
Perturbation Theory is an extremely important method of seeing how a Quantum System will be affected by a small change in the potential. And as such the Hamiltonian.

Perturbation Theory revolves around expressing the Potential as multiple (generally two) separate Potentials, then seeing how the second affects the system.

It allows us to get good approximations for systems where the Eigenstates are not all easily findable.

In the real life not many hamiltonians are exactly solvable. Most of the real life situations requires some approximation methods to solve their hamiltonians. Perturbation theory is one among them. Perturbation means small disturbance. Remember that the hamiltonian of a system is nothing but the total energy of that system. Some external factors can always affect the energy of the system and its behaviour. To analyse a system's energy, if we dont know the exact way of solution, then we can study the effects of external factors(perturbation) on the hamiltonian. For an example, we can study the elastic properties of a spring by the application of load on that. By this way, we can approximately predict the properties of the concerned systems. Perturbation applied to a system is of two types: time dependent and time independent and hence the theory.
We have to split the hamiltonian into two parts. One part is a hamiltonian whose solution we know exactly and the other part is the perturbation term. By this way we can solve the problems with a very good approximation. For an example of this method in quantum mechanics, we can use the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom to solve the problem of helium ion.

==First Order Corrections==
===Energy===
The first order correction to energy is given by
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n ^{(1)} = &lt;n|V|n&gt; = \int \Psi_n ^{(0)^\star}(x) \hat V(x) \Psi_n ^{(0)}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The first order correction to the wave function is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; C_k ^{(1)}= \frac{&lt;k|V|n&gt;}{\epsilon_n ^{(0)}-\epsilon_k ^{(0)} } &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Proof===
Let H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a Hamiltonian where all eigenstates are known.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat H_0 \Psi_n ^{(0)} = \epsilon _n ^{(0)} \Psi_n ^{(0)} \qquad n \in\mathbb N \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (\hat H_0 + \hat V) \Psi = \epsilon \Psi \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now represent &amp;Psi; as a linear combination of all its parts
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Psi = \sum c_m \Psi_m^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and put this into (2).

      <comment>/* Derivation of the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Quantum Mechanics/Page}}

Consider a particle confined to a one-dimensional box with impenetrable walls.
When you solve the Schrödinger equation for the wavefunctions you get two sets of solutions: those of positive parity, and those of negative parity: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{P=1} = A \cos \left[\frac{(2n+1) \pi x}{a}\right] &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{P=-1} = A \cos \left(\frac{2n \pi x}{a}\right), &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where ''n'' is any positive integer and ''A'' is a normalisation constant. Now, we can have all of these infinite states and if you've ever studied Fourier Analysis you may have noticed, with these states you can form any function you wish---that is, the wavefunctions are complete. So what have we learned? Well, a lot actually: we have discovered the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian which can be used to determine the particle's time dependance.

==Derivation of the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation==

We start with the general Schrödinger Equation, and use separation of variables. We have

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; H \Psi = \hat \epsilon \Psi &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We separate &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; into two functions:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Psi ( x , t ) = T ( t ) X ( x ) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

So now the Schrödinger Equation is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; H T X = \hat \epsilon T X &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

We know from [[../Operators and Commutators|earlier]] that the &quot;interesting&quot; part of the energy operator &lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a partial derivative with respect to time, and the &quot;interesting&quot; part of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a partial derivative with respect to position. As &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on position, it is not affected by &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not affected by &lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

So we have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; T H X = X \hat \epsilon T &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

We can multiply on the left by &lt;math&gt; T^{-1} X^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; to obtain

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; X^{-1} H X = T^{-1} \hat \epsilon T &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Note that the left side only depends on x, on the right side only depends on t. We have two functions which are totally indenpendent, but are somehow equal to each other. This is only possible if both functions are equal to a consant, which we call E.

i.e.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; X^{-1} H X = E&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T^{-1} \hat \epsilon T = E &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Naturally this implies

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; H X = E X &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; \hat \epsilon T = E T &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can then expand &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and solve this equation.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Solving Right Triangles==
In order to solve a right triangle using Trig, a simple acronym is used: SOHCAHTOA; SOH, standing for sine (opposite/hypotneuse), CAH, standing for cosine (adjacent/hypotneuse), and TOA, standing for tangent (opposite/adjacent).

This work is mainly done using a calculator, as there are no simple, analytical, formulas for the sine, cosine, and tangent functions.

To solve for angles of a right triangle, you would use the same method of SOHCAHTOA, except you use &lt;math&gt;sin^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (opp/hyp), &lt;math&gt;cos^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (adj/hyp) and &lt;math&gt;tan^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (opp/adj)

===Example Problems===
Example One: Finding the Missing Parts of a Right Triangle 

Find the missing angle and the sides in a right triangle with an acute angle of 38 degrees and an hypotenuse of 15 meters.

Solution:
::The other acute angle can be found by realizing that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore,
::180° = 38° + 90° + (m &lt; B) so (m &lt; B) = 52°. Using SOHCAHTOA, we see that 
::sin38° = opposite side length / Hypotenuse. Thus,sin38° = a/15 ==&gt; a = 15sin38° = 9.23 meters. To find the adjacent side 
::we use the cosine function and the formula cos38° = b/15 ==&gt; b= 15cos38° = 11.82 meters.

== Pythagorean Relationships ==
This is one step beyond the basic trig functions or ideas. It involves three equations that can be manipulated to suit the needs of the given problem. The three equations are as follows:

:sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
:1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
:1 + cot²θ = csc²θ

These can be easily manipulated to figure out a long range of complex problems. For this, we will use the example of 1 - sin²θ. When we look at the above equations, we see that it is very similair to the first one (sin²θ + cos²θ = 1). In fact, sin²θ has just been subtracted. Using this principle, we can thus solve the problem as cos²θ = 1-sin²θ. Easy, right?

=== Problems for Practice ===
Solve these equations using the Pythagorean relationships:

# tan²θ + 1 =
# sec²θ - 1 =
# csc²θ - cot²θ =
# sin²θ + cos²θ =
# sec²θ - tan²θ =
# sin²θ - 1 =

== Verifying More Complex Identities ==
We now move on to the more complex functions of the trigonometric world. To solve or prove these functions or equations, we have to use all of the math skills we learned before. We will need to use factoring, the Pythagorean relationships table, the inverse trig functions (sec θ = 1/cos θ, csc θ = 1/sin θ, cot θ = 1/tan θ ) and anything else we need to solve the problem.

This is very advanced math. To start this lesson off, lets look at an example:

Prove (make the right side look like the left without touching the left)

:sin θ /(sin θ + cos θ) = tan θ /(1 + tan θ)

We can see that tan θ is being divided by 1 + tan θ. To start the problem off, let’s get common denominators:

:tan θ /(cos θ/cos θ + sin θ/cos θ)

We can now combine the two equations on the bottom, so it looks like this:

:tan θ /((cos θ + sin θ)/cos θ)

To help simplify this down, put tan θ into terms of sin θ and cos θ:

:(sin θ/cos θ)/((cos θ + sin θ)/cos θ)

We can now multiply by the reciprocal to get rid of the bottom denominator:

:((sin θ/cos θ)*cos θ)/(((cos θ + sin θ)/cos θ)*cos θ)

Note that this is still being divided by sin θ + cos θ. When we multiply, the cos θ ’s will cancel each other out, so we are left with:

:sin θ/(sin θ + cos θ)

Which just happens to be the answer we were trying to prove!

While this may seem complicated, you only need to practice this more. Let's get an example that is a little more complicated: 

Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)

:(2 sin θ cos θ)/(sin²θ - cos²θ + 1) = cot θ

When we look at an equation like this, it may seem impossible. Lets go through the basics. When we look at the bottom, we see that we have a -cos²θ and a +1. When we look at the Pythagorean relationships table, 1 - cos²θ is equal to sin²θ:

:(2 cos θ sin θ)/(sin²θ + sin²θ)

We can then add the two sin²θ together:

:(2 sin θ cos θ)/(2 sin²θ)

We can then simplify this further into:

:cos θ / sin θ

We can do this because sin θ will cross out to have a single sin θ (2/2²=1/2, right?) and then the twos will cross out. That leaves with cos θ / sin θ, or cot θ !

=== Problems for Practice ===
# Prove (make the right side look like the left without touching the left side)
#: (1 - sin θ)/(cos θ) = cos θ /(1 + sin θ)
# Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)
#: (cot θ - tan θ)/(tan θ cos²θ) = csc²θ - sec²θ
# Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)
#: tan θ/(1 + sec θ) + (1 + sec θ)/tan θ = 2 csc θ
# Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)
#: tan²θ/(1 + tan²θ) = sin²θ

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Projectile Motion ==

Using the equations we derived in the last section, we can now use them to model the motion of a ''projectile''. A projectile is an object upon which the only force acting is gravity, which means that in all situations, the acceleration in the ''y'' direction, &lt;math&gt;a_y = -g&lt;/math&gt;. For simplicity, we will assume that the path of a projectile, also called its ''trajectory'', will always be in the shape of a parabola, and that the effect of air resistance upon the projectile is negligible. 

'''The Horizontal Motion'''

Since the only force acting upon the object is gravity, in the ''y'' direction, there is no acceleration in the ''x'' direction.

Let us assume that the projectile leaves the origin at time ''t'' = 0 and with speed ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then we have a vector '''v&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''' that makes an angle of &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with the ''x''-axis. Then, using a bit of trigonometry, we have the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_i = \frac{v_{xi}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_i = \frac{v_{yi}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging for the initial velocities, we get the initial ''x'' and ''y'' components of velocity to be

: &lt;math&gt;v_{xi} = v_i\cos \theta_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ v_{yi} = v_i\sin \theta_i&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = v \cos(\theta) t&lt;/math&gt;


'''The Vertical Motion'''

There is a constant acceleration down, g which is the force of gravity.  Accelecration is the instantaneous rate of change of velocity so:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = a = g&lt;/math&gt;
therefore we can integrate acceleration with respect to time to get velocity
: &lt;math&gt;\int dv = \int g dt&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v = gt&lt;/math&gt;
Velocity is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement so:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dd}{dt} = v&lt;/math&gt;
We can also integrate velocity with respect to time to get displacement
: &lt;math&gt;\int dx = \int v dt&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int dx = \int gt dt&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{1}{2} g t^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Future perfect==
The future perfect tense is used for an action that will have been completed in the future by the time something else has happened. 

English example: &quot;I '''will have seen''' the movie by the time it comes out.&quot;

To form the future perfect, take the perfect stem and add the future perfect endings:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-er&amp;#333;''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erimus''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-eris''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-eritis''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erit''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erint''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Note the similarities to the future tense of ''sum'', except for the third person plural ending ''-erint''&lt;ref&gt;''-int'' as an ending is rare; ''-erint'' and ''sint'' are two of the most common&lt;/ref&gt; in place of ''-erunt'', which serves as the perfect ending instead.

Hence: '''amāver&amp;#333;''', I will have loved; '''vīderitis''', you (pl.) will have seen


&lt;references/&gt;

==Pluperfect==
The pluperfect tense is used to describe something in the past that happened before another event in the past.

English example: &quot;I '''had graduated''' by the time I applied for a job.&quot;

To form the pluperfect, take the perfect stem and add the pluperfect endings:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-eram''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erāmus''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erās''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erātis''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erat''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erant''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Hence: '''amāveram''', I had loved; '''vīderātis''', you (pl.) had seen



==Examples==
''De Acutiliano autem negotio quod mihi '''mandaras''' ('''mandaveras'''), ut primum a tuo digressu Romam veni, '''confeceram'''.'' (Cicero, ''Ad Atticum'' 1.5)

:&quot;But as to the business of Acutilius that you had entrusted with me, I had already taken care of it when I came to Rome first thing after your departure.&quot; Note the relationship of the pluperfect verbs ''mandaras'' (''-aras'' is a common contraction for ''-averas'') and ''confeceram'' to the perfect verb ''veni''.

''Ego certe meum officium '''praestitero'''.'' (Caesar, ''De Bello Gallico'' IV)

:&quot;I certainly will have prevailed in my duty.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:verso250.gif|right|thumb|Reconstructing &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; with P52 Greek Fragment of John 18:37]]
'''Gospel of JOHN''' 


'''Chapter 1'''

==verses 1-10 (done)==
1 In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God.

2 The same was in the beginning with God.

3 All things came '''into being by Him''' and &lt;s&gt;by&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;'''through''' His creative power everything&lt;/s&gt; without him nothing was made that was made.

4 In Him was Life and that Life was the Light of the entire human race;

5 for even as the Light shines &lt;s&gt;on&lt;/s&gt; in darkness, the darkness has never overtaken it.

6 There appeared a man '''named John''', sent from God &lt;s&gt;'''as a witness''',&lt;/s&gt;

7 &lt;s&gt;sent for&lt;/s&gt; He came as a witness to testify concerning the Light &lt;s&gt;considering&lt;/s&gt; in order that that all might come to &lt;s&gt;&lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/s&gt; believe through Him.

8 John, himself, was not the Light, but &lt;s&gt;was sent&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;'''did come'''&lt;/s&gt; he came to bear witness &lt;s&gt;of&lt;/s&gt; concerning that Light.

9 &lt;s&gt;Yes,&lt;/s&gt; The true Light illuminating every person was, &lt;B&gt;then&lt;/B&gt;, coming into the world.

10 He was in the world&lt;s&gt;; He made the world,&lt;/s&gt; and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know Him.

==verses 11-20 (done)==
11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him,

12 though as many as would receive Him &amp;#8722; that is, to those who &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; in &lt;B&gt;the&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;His&lt;/s&gt; name &lt;B&gt;of Jesus&lt;/B&gt; &amp;#8722; He has given the right to become the children of God,

13 who are not born of blood, not born by physical urge, not born by the will of man, but are those reborn of God [read: the Word].

14 The Word became &lt;s&gt;flesh&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt; as man&lt;/B&gt; and lived for a time among us, so &lt;B&gt;full of grace and truth&lt;/B&gt; that we perceived His glory, glory as of the only born of the Father.

15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because He was in all things before me.’ ”

16 And from His abundance we have, every one of us, received grace upon grace.

17 For even though the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

18 While no one has ever seen God, the only Son by His very closeness to the Father has made Him known.

19 This is the testimony of John, when the leaders of Judea decided to send priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.

20 He had to confess and did not deny the truth, but avowed, “I am not the Messiah.”

==verses 21-30 (done)==
21 They said, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He responded, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, his voice gone, “No.”

22 They continued to ask him, “Who are you, that we may answer those that sent us? What do you say for yourself?”

23 “I am THE VOICE,” he replied, “OF ONE CRYING ALOUD IN THE DESERT, MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD” (Isa. 40:3).

24 A delegation of &lt;s&gt;the&lt;/s&gt; Pharisees was sent, also, 

25 And demanded of him, “Why do you baptize, then, if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?”

26 &quot;I baptize in water only,&quot; he replied, &quot;but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize.
 
27 He who comes after me is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to unlatch.&quot;

28 These events occurred in Bethany beyond the river Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29 The next day John saw Jesus coming his way and said, &quot;See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&quot;

30 &quot;This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man ranking ahead of me for He was in all things before me.'
==verses 31-40 (done)==
31 Even if, at first, I did not recognize Him, my purpose in coming was to baptize in water so that He might be revealed to Israel.&quot;

32 John testifying further said, &quot;I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and remain on Him;
 
33 I did not know who He was, but the One who sent me to baptize in water told me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
 
34 This I witnessed while coming to the realization that He is the Son of God.&quot;

35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
 
36 He looked upon Jesus as He walked by and said as before, &quot;See, the Lamb of God!&quot;

37 After hearing this, the two disciples followed Jesus.
 
38 Then, Jesus turned and seeing that they followed said, &quot;What is your need?&quot; Their reply, a &lt;s&gt;tentative&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;polite&lt;/B&gt;, &quot;Rabbi, (which is to say, Teacher) where are you staying?&quot; 

39 He said to them, &quot;Come and see.&quot; They went and saw where he stayed and remained there the rest of the day (for it was about four o'clock in the afternoon).

40 One of the two who followed Jesus after John spoke of the Lamb of God was Andrew, the brother of Simon. 
==verses 41-51 (done)==
41 Soon after the meeting with Jesus, Andrew found Simon and told him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (which is to say, the Christ); 

42 He then brought his brother to Jesus who gazing upon him intently said, &quot;You are Simon, son of Jona: You will be called Kepha,&quot; (meaning a rock, being tranalated Peter).

43 The following day Jesus decided to go to Galilee, and found Philip, and said to him, &quot;Follow Me.&quot; 

44 Now, Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 

45 Philip, in turn, found Nathana-el, and told him, &quot;We have found him, of whom Moses and the Prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot; 

46 Whereupon, Nathana-el said to him, &quot;Can any good &lt;s&gt;thing&lt;/s&gt; come out of Nazareth?&quot; Philip replied, &quot;Come and see.&quot;

47 Jesus saw Nathana-el coming and exclaimed, &quot;Look! An Israelite, not in name only, but true.&quot; 

48 Nathana-el asked, &quot;How do you know me?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;Even before Philip sought you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&quot; 

49 Nathana-el said, &quot;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot; 

50 Jesus answered &lt;B&gt;saying&lt;/B&gt;, &quot;&lt;s&gt;If&lt;/s&gt;&lt;B&gt; Because&lt;/B&gt; I said, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,' and you &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt;: What then? If you should see far greater things. 

51 In all truthfulness, I say that, hereafter, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Eschatology (from Greek, '''eskhatos''', last) is the term referring to the “doctrine of the last things.” The &quot;last things&quot; are important issues to Christian faith, although as a formal division of theology, eschatology is a relatively recent development.

==Theology==
Christian Eschatalogy is the study of Christian thought concerning biblical final events, including both individual destiny and the consummation of history based on God’s plan of redemption through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. The Christian view of world history involves the Church and the spread of the Gospel as the primary agent in the triumph of good over evil, according to the Creator's divine purposes. The predictive element of the Book of Revelation leads up to the final establishment of the rule of God. 

==Doctrinal Eschatology==
There are a variety of different beliefs regarding the end times in Christianity.

The general timeline:

* [[/The OT perspective/]]
* [[/The NT perspective/]] 
* [[/The Christian Hope/]]
* [[/Signs of the Times/]]
* [[/The Coming of Christ or Parousia/]]
* [[/The Resurrection/]]
* [[/The State of the Dead/]]
* [[/The Judgment/]]
* [[/Punishment/]]
* [[/The Millennium/]]
* [[/The New Creation/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The faith of Israel initially looked to its culmination in the covenant of Abraham and entering the promise land as the chosen people, its salvation; but the major prophets defined the final goal of God’s purpose in history as “the Day of the Lord.” On that day, according to prophetic writing, they expected a direct and universal act of God. The eschatological age of salvation was to follow this designated day of judgment in which (1) God’s will is without question. (2) All nations will serve the God of Israel, (3) and learn His will. (4) A time of peace and justice spreads over the world, (5) also, peace in nature.(6) God’s people are secure, (6) and prosperous. (7) and the law of God will be written on their hearts. Their several exiles, occupations and subsequent dispersion tested these beliefs and late prophecy in Israel elevates the Davidic king as God’s representative who will rule in righteousness at the last day and end the persecution of a proud nation.

: ''Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Dan. 9:24''

Although the book of Daniel is a minor read in the Hebrew Tanakh, it was written BC and the prophet does lay out belief in the Kingdom of God 

: ''And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Dan. 2:44''

and the expected resurrection of the dead

: ''And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. Dan. 12:2''

through the agency of the Messiah or Son of Man. The teachings of Jesus extend the faith of the Old Testament, flesh it out, so to speak. The Apostle Paul, Pharisee of Pharisees, explains in Acts 23 that the Pharisees (legalists) believe in the resurrection of the dead and angelology and the Sadducees (temple worshipping skeptics) do not. What else could be said, except that Roman domination of Israel just before the birth of Christ produced a period of heightened expectations of divine deliverance from oppression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== There is Hope ==

John, called the divine apostle, the beloved disciple receives a vision of the New Creation from Jesus, the author and the finisher of  that Christian faith outlined in the Book of Revelation consisting of the New Heaven and the New Earth featuring the holy city as the New Jerusalem, the focal point of all things made new. The Alpha and Omega declares it so. The most important object of [[../The Christian Hope/]] is not the millennium and the intricacies thereof but this New Creation where the Lamb's Book of Life is delineated as explained in Revelation 21 being interpreted by most believers, that for the people of God, Heaven is all health, peace, and love. Therefore, for those faithful, no wonder, in His time, He said, &quot;Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, Come, Lord Jesus.&quot; (Rev. 22:20)

      <text xml:space="preserve">From The New Testament - 
*Chapter of &quot;Hope&quot; (Romans 8: 10-28) (Modernity Version)
:10 Even though your body must die because of sin, if Christ is in you, your spirit has Life because of righteousness.
:11 And if the Holy Spirit is in you, He who raised up Christ from the dead will add to your mortal existence such abundant Life as comes with the indwelling of His Spirit.
:12 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are under no obligation to live a life ruled by our baser instincts.
:13 For if you follow that path, death is near; but under the powerful sway of the Spirit, when you put those inclinations aside, you will live.
:14 For all who are led by the Holy Spirit are children of God.
:15 You have not entered a state of bondage again as a slave to fear. But you are conscious of being among the children of adoption, and by this we cry out, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot;
:16 The Holy Spirit, attune to the spirit within us, bears witness to the fact that we are children of God;
:17 and if children, then heirs also&amp;#8722;heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ; if indeed we share in Christ's sufferings, we too may share in His glory.
:18 What we suffer now I count as nothing in comparison with the glory which is soon to be revealed in us.
:19 The world is waiting to see the manifestation of the children of God.
:20 Creation itself seems futile (not of its own choice, but by the will of Him who made it so).
:21 Yet with hope that in the end all Creation would be set free from the effects of death and decay to enjoy the liberty that will come to the children of God in their ultimate glory.
:22 For we know that the whole of Creation groans together in the pains of childbirth even to this very hour.
:23 And more than that, we ourselves, though we possess the Holy Spirit as a foretaste of bliss, do inwardly sigh, while we wait for full vestment as concerns the disposition of our bodies.
:24 In hope we have been saved. For an object of hope is such no longer when it is seen; a person does not hope for what he or she already sees.
:25 But if we hope for something which we do not see, then we wait patiently for it. 
:26 In the same way the Holy Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what prayers to offer nor in what way to offer them. Even the pleadings of the Spirit on our behalf are beyond words,
:27 yet, the Searcher of hearts knows what the Spirit's meaning is regarding the people of God, because spiritual intercession is in God's will.
:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, yes, to them who are called according to His divine purpose.

= =
*Titus 2 - &quot;Our Blessed Hope&quot;

:11 For the grace of God has come with saving power to all humankind, 
:12 teaching us to renounce all irreverence and worldly desires, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this present age,
:13 while we wait for the blessed hope&amp;#8722;the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ;
:14 who gave Himself for us to rescue us from any harmful activity and purify for Himself a people that are zealous for good works.

:Can you fill in the next five words of that old hymn? If you can, chances are you might just be a Baptist or some Christian group that believes the blood of Christ saves you from your sins. For those who don't know the hymn, the next five words are &quot;than Jesus' blood and righteousness.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Need contributors to Modernity translation/paraphrase on [[Christianity]] page. No details yet, except consider this Gospel-101 for believers.

Eureka, when the Chapters are set up, bordering on perfection, each chapter of Modernity has talk page for work on parallel version.[[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 02:14, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

The translation below is rather free. We are dealing here with the Word of God! Therefore explanations belong into a commentary, not into the text (that's not just my view, that's even a pre-Christian tradition). If the syntax requires words to be supplied that are not in the Koine, then they should be placed in brackets, e.g. &quot;creative power&quot; in Jn 1:3 - that's apart from missing in this verse the difference betweeen &quot;to come&quot; and &quot;to become&quot; (when a bus comes along, hurray, but it has been in existence before it came into view...), and changing a negative into a positive statement. In v. 6 the translator introduces an appearance but drops a pregnant sending. In v. 7 the sending itself replaces the more humble came - humble, since this time it is the bus-type coming, not the being created one. Next a Semitism, a tell-tale literary feature, has been eliminated: &quot;witness that he might witness&quot;. These few examples of liberties in the translation convince me that its value is limited to a literary exercise. The translator of the text below cannot be regarded as a servant of the original, I mean servant like doulos, you know: like Mary, like David, like in Isaiah?!!! [[User:Portress|Portress]] 22:36, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Great dialogue. I take free as a compliment. The Prologue is undertaken as a hymn, so certain liberties were entertained, call it rhythm, and being convinced that reduntant Semitism here (and only here) are unwarranted, the language must flow. Will incorporate your suggestions. Added &quot;being&quot; to verse 3, &quot;become&quot; is difficult, grammatically speaking, and The Living Bible did not put &quot;created&quot; in their verse 3 in brackets, whereas the word is literally &quot;generated&quot; (Strong's says, used with great latitude) and I wanted to present Jesus as the Word in His omnificence. So, witness to witness could be staircase parallelism in verse 6 and 7 (a new found rhythm), plus humbly using &quot;came&quot; in verse 8. Need 8 more people like Portress and David C. and Modernity can soar. In the quote on the [[Talk:Christianity|talk]] page, Weymouth, himself, said it is not necessary to be chained to literal translation from the original. The King James collaborators also took poetic license. Fond adieu.

On second thought &quot;came&quot; in verse 8 to &quot;did come,&quot; John the Baptist is presented as one of the least humble personages in the New Testament.

==Finalized==
Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* Primacy of John here, adds the introductory name of Jesus (v. 12) dictated by an Aramism. Otherwise, He might be construed as conventionally surnamed (v. 17) Christ, rather than Yeshua bar-Yowceph.
* The Law is prescriptive (v. 17), a prescription for daily living in the moral sense.
* Logos is declared (v. 18, UKJV) and He is no more, referring to this visitation, of course.
* Convention calls for the widely acceptable Jesus Christ, whereas all references to The Christ are rendered, the Messiah.
* Omnificence is extra-biblical, but so is Shekinah. One must combine two phrases (v. 14) to achieve &quot;tented glory.&quot;
* Though, by acknowledging that implied glory, the Epistle of James becomes a relational sidebar equal to the most illustrious of apostles, Peter and John, who rise to the top in Chapter One.
* Proposed, new order of N.T. canon: John, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, James, Peter, John (letters), Hebrews, Paul (letters), Jude, Revelation. The thematic &amp;#8722; Gospels (literary order) &amp;#8722; Epistles (historic order or closeness to Jesus) &amp;#8722; Apocalypse (Jude, Revelation). Why, even, if you save the best for last, then, Luke is the most beautiful story ever told and there is no Gospel without Paul. &amp;#913;&amp;#956;&amp;#951;&amp;#957; &amp;#945;&amp;#956;&amp;#951;&amp;#957;
* Astounding, Jesus may have been scripted, the two hour session (v. 39) could have outlined O.T. [http://religion.wikicities.com/wiki/Testimonia testimonia], which were written messianic anthologies, since some of Jesus' quotes do not match the older reference standards exactly.
* Aramaic primacy is not pushed, but it stands to reason, being a simple and poetic language employed by simple people who met something divine. Here, the lingua franca is introduced as sometimes containing lack of coherence and redundancy. If the Word of God leaped over five language barriers, who wins in the end?
* Guile (v. 47) is portrayed as a play on the name Jacob. The inspiration, well, nobody's perfect. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 00:25, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

'''Chapter 2'''

==verses 1-4 (done)==
1 Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there. 

2 Jesus and His disciples were also invited.
 
3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to her son, &quot;They have no wine.&quot; 

4 Jesus said, &quot;Dear woman, what is it to you or to me. My hour has not yet come.&quot;
==verses 5-8 (done)== 
5 His mother instructed the servants, &quot;Whatever He says, do it.&quot;

6 Six waterpots of stone were set out in the manner of Judean ceremonial washing, each about twenty gallons.

7 Jesus told the servants, &quot;Fill the pots with water.&quot; And they filled them to the brim.

8 Then He said, &quot;Now, take a portion to the table-master.&quot; And they did.
==verses 9-12 (done)==
9 When the master had tasted the water made wine without knowing the source, (albeit, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom: 

10 and said, &quot;The usual host at the very beginning serves good wine, and when the guests have drunk freely, then the inferior; but you saved the best until last.&quot;

11 Jesus performed this, the first of His [miraculous] signs, at Cana in Galilee; and as He revealed His glory, His disciples &lt;U&gt;believed&lt;/U&gt; in Him.

12 After Cana He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers, and His disciples; and they spent a few days there.
==verses 13-16 (done)==
13 Just about this time, the yearly Judean Passover was approaching and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14 In the temple He found the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves: and the moneychangers were also sitting there.

15 And when He had plaited a whip of rushes, He drove those selling oxen and sheep out of the temple, and poured out the changers' money, and overturned the tables. 

16 Then, He said to those who sold doves, &quot;Take these things away. Do not make My Father's house, a house of merchandise.&quot; 
==verses 17-20 (done)==
17 And His disciples remembered that it was written, “ZEAL FOR GOD'S HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME” (Ps. 69:9). 

18 But the Judean hierarchy issued a challenge, &quot;Give us a sign for doing such things.&quot; 

19 Jesus said, &quot;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&quot; 

20 The hierarchs replied, &quot;Forty-six years was this temple in building, and you will rebuild it in three days?&quot;
==verses 21-25 (done)== 
21 Though, here, He spoke of the temple of His body.
 
22 So when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they &lt;U&gt;believed&lt;/U&gt; the Scripture and the &lt;B&gt;[&lt;/B&gt;prophetic&lt;B&gt;]&lt;/B&gt; words of Jesus.

23 Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the &lt;s&gt;Festival&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Feast&lt;/B&gt; of the Passover, many became believers in Him through &lt;s&gt;watching&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;witnessing&lt;/B&gt; the miracles He performed.

24 Yet, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,

25 and did not need any &lt;s&gt;one's&lt;/s&gt; testimony concerning &lt;s&gt;a man&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;the people&lt;/B&gt;, for He of Himself knew what was in &lt;s&gt;the man&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;human nature&lt;/B&gt;.

|2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there ''not many days''.

|2:13 And the Jews' ''passover'' was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

|2:14 And found ''in the temple'' those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

|14 In the temple He found the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves: and the moneychangers were also sitting there.

|-
|2:15 And when he had made a ''scourge of small cords'', he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
|scourge &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cords&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;phi;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;epsilon;&amp;kappa; &amp;sigma;&amp;chi;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;iota;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4979)
|15 And when He had plaited cords into a whip, He drove those selling oxen and sheep out of the temple, and poured out the changers' money, and overturned the tables.
|&lt;small&gt;MK. 11:15-17&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things behind; make not my Father's house an ''house of merchandise''.

|16 Then, He said to those who sold doves, &quot;Take these things away. Do not make My Father's house, a house of merchandise.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Jerome: “majesty of Godhead gleamed”&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:17 And his disciples remembered ''that it was written'', The zeal of yours house has eaten me up.
|that being written&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;omicron;&amp;tau;&amp;iota; &amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;gamma;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;mu;&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (1125)
|17 And His disciples remembered that it was written, “ZEAL FOR GOD'S HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME” (Ps. 69:9).
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|2:18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, ''What sign'' show you unto us, seeing that you do these things?
|What sign&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;Tau;&amp;iota; &amp;sigma;&amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (4592)
|18 But the Judean hierarchy issued a challenge, &quot;Give us a sign for doing such things.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Gospel of John:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Book of Signs and no small miracle&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, ''Destroy this temple'', and in three days I will raise it up.
|Loosen the sanctuary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;Lambda;&amp;upsilon;&amp;sigma;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon; &amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;nu;&amp;alpha;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (3485)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;B&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&amp;nbsp;
|19 Jesus said, &quot;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Messianic authority:&lt;br&gt;An enigma to all&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, ''and will you'' rear it up in three days?
|and will you&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;kappa;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota; &amp;sigma;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/B&gt; (1473)
|20 The hierarchs replied, &quot;Forty-six years was this temple in building, and you will rebuild it in three days?&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Temple: begun 20 B.C.E.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: upstart&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:21 But ''he spoke'' of the temple of his body. 
|he had been speaking&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;kappa;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; &amp;delta;&amp;epsilon; &amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&lt;/B&gt; (3004)
|21 Though, here, He spoke of the temple of His body.
|&lt;small&gt;Sign language&lt;br&gt;for the uninitiated&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and ''they believed the scripture'', and the word (o. logos) which Jesus had said.
|they believed the scripture&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;pi;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon;&amp;upsilon;&amp;sigma;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu; &amp;tau;&amp;eta; &amp;gamma;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;phi;&amp;eta;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1124)
|22 So when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/font&gt; the Scripture and the [prophetic] words of Jesus.
|&lt;small&gt;Here: afterthought is forethought.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed ''in his name'', when they saw the miracles which he did.
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;into &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;name his [person&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma; &amp;tau;&amp;omicron; &amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha;&lt;/B&gt; (3686) &lt;B&gt;&amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/B&gt;                            
|23 Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the Feast of  the Passover, many became &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believers&lt;/font&gt; in Him through witnessing the miracles He performed. 
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;name&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;person&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Him&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he ''knew all men'',
|knowing all [people&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;gamma;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;omega;&amp;sigma;&amp;kappa;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (1097) &lt;B&gt;&amp;pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&amp;tau;&amp;alpha;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/B&gt;
|24 Yet, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|2:25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew ''what was in'' man.
|what [rare use&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;] was in&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;iota;&lt;/B&gt; (5101) &lt;B&gt;&amp;eta;&amp;nu; &amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt;

&quot;Voodoo&quot; is derived from Vodun, the indigenous African word, meaning spirit. Vodun is a way of life in which a number of spirits or deities are called upon and celebrated, including ancestors or elders in the spiritual world. Various forms of magic are used for the betterment of those who follow it. It works for those who believe it.

==An Introduction to Voodooism==
Voodoo differs from West African Vodun in that it integrates Catholicism, Christianity and Native American concepts. Voodoo was largely practiced by African and Indian slaves in the southern regions of the United States and the West Indies. 


==Vodun Around The World==
The Gullah, African descendants living in South Carolina and Georgia are prominent voodooist. Louisiana also retains a population of African, Creole and French descendants who practice voodoo. Marie Laveau was a renowned creole voodoo priest in New Orleans in the 17th century. Today, she still has mainly admirers and followers. Voodoo is the major religion of Haiti and very common in Jamaica, Brazil, Puerto Rico and less common but prevalent in Cuba. Of course it remains common in it's place of origin, Africa. From the western coast of Ghana across to Nigeria, Vodun and other religions synchronized with Vodun are prevalent.

==Category==
Theist Animist

==Beliefs==
Vodun recognises one God with many helpers called Orishas. A single divine Creator, called variously Mawu or Nana Buluku is an androgynous being who in one tradition bore seven children and gave each rule over a realm of nature - animals, earth, and sea - or else these children are inter-ethnic and related to natural phenomena or to historical or mythical individuals. The creator embodies a dual cosmogonic principle of which Mawu, the moon, and Lisa, the sun, are respectively the female and male aspects, often portrayed as the twin children of the Creator.

Vodouists believe in, Bondye (Creator). Bondye does not intercede in human affairs. Vodouists direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called Orishas and Loa. Every Loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life. Each Loa reflects the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside. In order to navigate daily life, vodouists cultivate personal relationships with the Orishas and Loa through the presentation of offerings, the creation of personal altars and devotional objects, and participation in elaborate ceremonies of music, dance, and spirit possession.  

==Controversy==
Vodou has often been associated in popular culture with Satanism, zombies and &quot;voodoo dolls&quot;. Zombie creation has been referenced, but is not a part of Vodoo or Vodun. Such manifestations fall under the auspices of the bokor or sorcerer, rather than the priest of the Orishas and Loa. The practice of sticking pins in voodoo dolls has history in folk magic. &quot;Voodoo dolls&quot; are often associated with New Orleans Voodoo and Hoodoo as well the magical devices of the poppet and the nkisi or bocio of West and Central Africa.

The general fear of Vodou in the US can be traced back to the End of the Haitian Revolution (1791). The US, seeing the tremendous potential Vodou had for rallying its followers and inciting them to action, feared the events at Bois-Caiman could spill over onto American soil. Fearing an uprising in opposition to the US occupation of Haiti, political and religious elites, along with Hollywood and the film industry, sought to trivialize the practice of Vodou. The elites preferred to view it as folklore in an attempt to render it relatively harmless as a curiosity that might continue to inspire music and dance.”[34]

Hollywood often depicts Vodou as evil and having ties to Satanic practices in movies such as The Skeleton Key, &quot;The Devil’s Advocate&quot;, The Blair Witch Project, The Serpent and the Rainbow, Child's Play, and Live and Let Die, and in children’s movies like The Princess and the Frog.

In 2010, following the 7.0 earthquake that devastated Haiti, negative attention to Vodou also followed. One of the more notable examples would be of televangelist Pat Robertson’s televised discourse on the subject. Robertson stated that the country had cursed itself after the events at Bois-Caiman because he claimed they had engaged in Satanic practices in the ceremony preceding the Haitian Revolution. &quot;They were under the heel of the French, you know Napoleon the third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.' True story. And so the devil said, 'Ok it's a deal.' And they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got something themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another&quot;

==Discipleship==
Following of Vodun is chiefly found in West Africa, Brazil, Southern United States and the Caribbean, particularly in Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Smaller minorities exist in Cuba and around the world. It is noted that more than 30 million people follow Voodooism worldwide, however the exact number is unknown.

==Voodooist Nations==
#Benin; state religion, 7 million.
#Ghana
#Nigeria
#Uganda
#Congo
#Togo
#Haiti
#Jamaica
#Dominican Republic
#Puerto Rico 
#Cuba
#Brazil
#Sects of Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana


==Chief Deities==
Bondye; Creator god; Haiti and Africa

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm slightly confused.  Why is there an Arrays page and an Arrays_content page?  Which is the primary page?  Should the link in the template be changed?  It seems that the content of Arrays is older, and Arrays_content is the primary... but I'm not positive.  --[[User:Jonatin|Jonatin]] 15:13, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

:The [[Data Structures/Arrays]] page merely &quot;#includes&quot; the Arrays_content page, like this: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Computer Science:Data Structures:Arrays content}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. Other than that, the page is basically empty. The purpose is to provide a Printer Friendly page that &quot;#includes&quot; all chapters in a single page and to provide a Navigation friendly view where the chapter navigation bars appear. There is a chance that when you view the Arrays page that the information will appear out of date. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:08, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Beer Bread 1.jpg|thumb|right]]

==Recipe==

===Ingredients===

* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]], warm is better
* 3¾ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 to 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] (amount depends on your desire for sweetness)
* Oil to line bread pan

===Procedure===

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
# Grease a 9x5x3 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|loaf pan]]
# Mix flour, salt, and baking powder and stir together well.
# Combine dry ingredients with beer and honey.
# Stir together until well mixed.
# Add more flour if necessary to make a good consistency.
# Spread batter in prepared pan.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 40-45 minutes or until browned and a toothpick comes out of the center clean.
# Serve warm.

==Tips, Notes and Variations==

* Beer with live yeast (bottle-conditioned) and carbonation will make the best rise.
* This bread can have a very hard crust, making it somewhat difficult to slice. One thing that works well is to begin by dividing the loaf lengthwise, then turning each half loaf onto the newly formed flat side and cutting neat smaller (half-sized) slices.
* Darker beers, such as porter and stout, will produce darker breads. Subsequently, lighter beers, such as Pilsner and lager, will produce lighter breads.
* If self-raising flour is used instead of all-purpose flour, the salt and baking powder may be omitted.

I am interested very much in the Wiki Process and shared public knowledge bases, especially in the topic area of emergency medicine (EM).

Note 206.180.152.3 was me, inadvertently not signed in... another story there- later KW

I am joining Paris Lovett in the development of OCTEM, the Wikibook textbook of emergency medicine.

*Chunks
In particular, I am interested in breaking down the structure of the knowledge of emergency medicine into small chunks (factoids ?) with extensive hyperlinks and multiple schemes of organization of the factoids. I am interested in the ultimate user perspective to rapidly get to the exact piece of information desired in the format/organization desired.

The structure of the wikibook must match an easily used, easily understood cognitive paradigm.

For example, current physical textbooks in EM typically have chapters of 20-50 pages, with several types of organization, controlled by a table of contents (TOC). The TOC may be presented in two levels of detail- first a one page summary with just chapter title, one or two lines and page number to get there. A second level of detail may go for 8 or 10 pages and show every section within the chapters and a page number (to get there).  An index is in the back of the book, where words and phrases are given in alphabetic order with page numbers and maybe short identifiers of the entry.

These are logical structures to emulate and keep current automatically.  Links are better than page numbers.
----
I believe there should be multiple Tables of Contents - super-structures to the OCTEM, using different organisational methods to point into the articles.

For example, one could start with diseses and break them down to groups and subgroups with treatments ultimately discussed.

Or one could organize a TOC of drugs, by large classes and sub classes and then by indications (diagnoses) and ultimately point to the many of the same terminal articles, ie leaf-pages in these two different logical trees.

A third tree might break cardinal symptoms into groups, subgroups of symptoms or micro-syndromes, and proceed to diseases and treatments.  This perspective, of the same knowledge ultimately, starts from the pragmatic context of how we handle a particular patient, fitting his/her symptoms into patterns of possible diagnoses, deciding upon tests to further clarify, and then decide treatments.
----
A paper text book typically has chapters which may be organized in one or more of the above structures, but the text can only exist in one chapter and the user is left to the index to find related sections.

Super index pages may help &quot;disambiguate&quot; where the user really wants to go when looking up &quot;chest pain&quot; by giving a brief but helpful few words to give the context and content of eack link to the phrase chest pain, when there will be many.

I believe very thoughtful design by those of us who understand both database structure and emergency medicine knowledge should lay out a structure and maintain it as many authors fill in the blanks, in a form that is ultimately clear and useful to many readers.

I expect there to be hundreds of users for each real contributor/writers and a few designers to plan for the layout of the many writers.

The ultimate design should optimize the readers' experience first and the contributors second.

----
Ultimately, I believe a real textbook of medicine must be stabilized and controlled somehow. I, as a physician reader, cannot look up information that may have just been edited in error by a malicious or ignorant writer.  I want the textbook to be a reliable source of details. Facts such as drug doses for various indications and patient circumstances therefore must be correct and will be correct when thay are viewed and corrected by many. As an emergency physician in practice, ( a reader-role) I want to be able to quickly type &quot;magnesium seizures pregnancy&quot; and land right in a context I can quickly verify is what I want and find doses and strategy to use and depend upon for a particular patient. There are many times this will be more reliable than my memory for situations which do not occur frequently in practice.

I believe we can evolve and design a process for allowing wide open contributions to the textbook and still also have an editor role, electronically-supported process where a small committee is assigned responsibility for selected articles.  These editorial committees would typically include EM residency faculty members.  Submissions from anyone would be approved or vetoed electronically by committee members individually, as an enhanced function analogous to WatchLists in standard Wiki use. There would be many committees linked to each juried article. Other sections may be visible or just visible within Talk or discussion areas, but clearly delineated and not certified by the above process.

I believe this can be done with simple extensions to the WIki registration and history-tracking system.

A mode may distinguish the editorially-controlled portions or tabs such as history and discussion tabs which might show changes not approved by editorial subcommittee yet or even those not approved for general inclusion.
----
I do believe the OCTEM will need to be extracted from the WIkibook.org system, using a separate server to modify the software and control the user registration somewhat.  The software is open source and the current model is compatible with changing ultimately to a controlled system, as the content as well as the wiki software are open source and may be taken and enhanced as I have suggested.

I've taken off my name, as well as Sylvia's, as our school year is over and I severely doubt that either of us will touch this page again.  I like having this page because it keeps record of who is currently working on the book (so one knows who to contact)...

      <comment>moved [[Surgical Procedures/Mandibular fractures]] to [[Surgical Procedures/Mandibular Fractures]]:&amp;#32;Title casing subpage.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The mandible or the lower jaw bone behaves as a ring. As much as you try, it is almost impossible to break a glass bangle (a ring-like object) in a single place - it always breaks at the diametrically opposite segment. Similarly, the mandible tends to break in two places when injured. When it does not break in two places, injury similar to a fracture has been absorbed by the temporomandibular joint, which compromises the joint and its function significantly.

The weak points on the mandible are where the nerves enter and leave its substance: at the entrance of the inferior alveolar nerve, and at the exit of the mental nerve. When the fracure passes through a tooth root, it is likely to be &quot;compound&quot; in nature, meaning that it communicates with the mouth. Here, the risk of infection is very high, and untreated fractures not only malunite, but may never unite, and lead to life threatening neck space infections.

Mandibular fractures require individualised treatment, dependant on the age of the patient, the dentition, the oral hygiene, and the timing of surgery (how distant to the injury).

Most fractures can be reduced and fixed in place (titanium plates and screws are employed, so there is no risk of &quot;rejection&quot;, and little risk of infection) from the inside of the mouth, avoiding any scars. However, those fractures that happen just below the head of the mandible(the subcondylar fractures) will require external approaches, as would certain other types of fractures.

Most patients will then be permitted soft, mushy food for 4 weeks, after which a fairly normal lifestyle may be resumed.

The defining factor of how well the procedure has been will be very obvious from the &quot;occlusion&quot; of the patient, which is the resting position of the jaws in relation to each other: the patient will be able to sens the return to normalcy soon after surgery.

__NOTOC__
'''Blender HotKeys''' - ''Relevant to Blender 2.37a&lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt; - Compiled from Blender Online Guides''

== Window HotKeys ==

Certain window managers also use the following hotkeys.
So '''ALT-CTRL''' can be substituted for '''CTRL''' to perform the
functions described below if a conflict arises.
: '''CTRL-LEFTARROW'''. Go to the previous Screen.
: '''CTRL-RIGHTARROW'''. Go to the next Screen.
: '''CTRL-UPARROW''' or '''CTRL-DOWNARROW'''. Maximise the window or return to the previous window display size.
: '''SHIFT-F4'''. Change the window to a Data View

== Universal HotKeys ==

The following HotKeys work uniformly in all Blender Windows, if the Context allows:
: '''CTRL-LMB'''. Lasso select: drag the mouse to form a freehand selection area.
** '''ESC.'''
** This key always cancels Blender functions without changes.
** ''or'': FileWindow, DataView and ImageSelect: back to the previous window type.
**  ''or'': the RenderWindow is pushed to the background (or closed, that depends on the operating system).
: '''SPACE.''' Open the Toolbox.
: '''CTRL-SPACE.''' Opens menu with manipulator type choices. (Press 2, 3, 4, or 5 to change the widget type) &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''ALT-SPACE.''' Opens menu with manipulator orientation choices. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''TAB.''' Start or quit EditMode.
: '''F1.''' Loads a Blender file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-F1.''' Appends parts from other files, or loads as Library-data. Changes the window to a FileWindow, making Blender files accessible as a directory.
: '''F2.''' Writes a Blender file. Change the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-F2.''' Exports the scene as a DXF file
: '''CTRL-F2.''' Exports the scene as a VRML1 file
: '''F3.''' Writes a picture (if a picture has been rendered). The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a File Select Window.
: '''CTRL-F3 (ALT-CTRL-F3 on MacOSX)'''. Saves a screendump of the active window. The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-F3.''' Saves a screendump of the whole Blender screen. The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a FileWindow.
: '''F4.''' Displays the Logic Context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).

: '''JKEY.''' Toggle the render buffers. Blender allows you to retain two different rendered pictures in memory.
: '''CTRL-O.''' Opens the last saved file.
: '''QKEY.''' OK? Quit Blender. This key closes Blender. Blender quit is displayed in the console if Blender is properly closed.
: '''ALT-CTRL-T.''' TimerMenu. This menu offers access to information about drawing speed. The results are displayed in a pop-up.
: '''CTRL-U.''' OK, Save User defaults. The current project (windows, objects, etc.), including UserMenu settings are written to the default file that will be loaded every time you start Blender or set it to defaults by pressing '''CTRL-X.'''
: '''CTRL-W.''' Write file. This key combination allows you to write the Blender file without opening a FileWindow.
: '''ALT-W.''' Write Videoscape file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.

: '''CTRL-Y.''' Redo. Mac users may use CMD-Y.
: '''CTRL-Z.''' Undo. Mac users may use CMD-Z.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-Z.''' Redo. Mac users may use SHIFT-CMD-Z

== Object Mode HotKeys ==

These hotkeys are mainly bound to the 3D Viewport Window, but many work on Objects in most other windows, like IPOs and so on, hence they are summarized here.
: '''HOME'''. All Objects in the visible layer are displayed completely, centered in the window.
: '''PAGEUP'''. Select the next Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEUP'''. Adds to selection the next Object Key.
: '''PAGEDOWN.''' Select the previous Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEDOWN.''' Adds to selection the previous Object Key.
: '''ACCENT.''' (To the left of the '''1KEY''' in US keyboard) Select all layers.
: '''SHIFT-ACCENT.''' Revert to the previous layer setting.
: '''TAB.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''ALT-E.'''
: '''AKEY.''' Selects/deselects all.
: '''CTRL-A.''' Apply size and rotation. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are assigned to the ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.). At first glance, it appears as if nothing has changed, but this can have considerable consequences for animations or texture mapping. This is best illustrated by also having the axis of a Mesh Object be drawn (EditButtons-&gt;Axis). Rotate the Object and activate Apply. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are 'erased'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-A.''' If the active Object is automatically duplicated (see AnimButtons-&gt;DupliFrames or AnimButtons- &gt;Dupliverts), a menu asks Make duplis real?. This option actually creates the Objects. If the active Mesh Object is deformed by a Lattice, a menu asks Apply Lattice deform?. Now the deformation of the Lattice is assigned to the vertices of the Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-A.''' This is the AddMenu. In fact, it is the ToolBox that starts with the `ADD' option. When Objects are added, Blender starts EditMode immediately if possible.
: '''BKEY.''' Border Select. Draw a rectangle with the LeftMouse; all Objects within this area are selected, but not made active. Draw a rectangle with the RightMouse to deselect Objects. In orthonormal ViewMode, the dimensions of the rectangle are displayed, expressed as global coordinates, as an extra feature in the lower left corner. In Camera ViewMode, the dimensions that are to be rendered according to the DisplayButtons are displayed in pixel units.
: '''SHIFT-B.''' Render Border. This only works in Camera ViewMode. Draw a rectangle to render a smaller cut-out of the standard window frame. If the option DisplayButtons-&gt;Border is ON, a box is drawn with red and black lines.
: '''CKEY'''. Centre View. The position of the 3DCursor becomes the new centre of the 3DWindow.
** '''ALT-C.''' Convert Menu. Depending on the active Object, a PopupMenu is displayed. This enables you to convert certain types of ObData. It only converts in one direction, everything ultimately degrades to a Mesh! The options are:
*** Font -&gt; Curve
*** MetaBall -&gt; Mesh The original MetaBall remains unchanged.
*** Curve -&gt; Mesh
*** Surface -&gt; Mesh

**'''CTRL-C.''' Copy Menu. This menu copies information from the active Object to (other) selected Objects.
*** ''Fixed components are:''
**** Copy Loc: the X,Y,Z location of the Object. If a Child is involved, this location is the relative position in relation to the Parent.
**** Copy Rot: the X,Y,Z rotation of the Object.
**** Copy Size: the X,Y,Z dimension of the Object.
**** DrawType: copies Object Drawtype.
**** TimeOffs: copies Object time offset.
**** Dupli: all Duplicator data (Dupliframes, Dupliverts and so on)
**** Mass: Real time stuff.
**** Damping: Real time stuff.
**** Properties: Real time stuff.
**** Logic Bricks: Real time stuff.
**** Constraints: copies Object constraints.
*** ''If applicable:''
**** Copy TexSpace: The texture space.
**** Copy Particle Settings: the complete particle system from the AnimButtons.
*** ''For Curve Objects:''
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Font Objects:''
**** Copy Font Settings: font type, dimensions, spacing.
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Camera Objects:''
**** Copy Lens: the lens value.
: '''SHIFT-C.''' CentreZero View. The 3DCursor is set to zero (0,0,0) and the view is changed so that all Objects, including the 3Dcursor, can be displayed. This is an alternative for '''HOME.'''
: '''DKEY.''' Draw mode menu. Allows to select draw modes exactly as the corresponding menu in the 3D viewport header does.
: '''SHIFT-D.''' Add Duplicate. The selected Objects are duplicated. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''ALT-D.''' Add Linked Duplicate. Of the selected Objects linked duplicates are created. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''CTRL-D.''' Draw the (texture) Image as wire. This option has a limited function. It can only be used for 2D compositing.
: '''ALT-E.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''TAB.'''
: '''FKEY.''' If selected Object is a mesh Toggles Face selectMode on and off.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Sort Faces. The faces of the active Mesh Object are sorted, based on the current view in the 3DWindow. The leftmost face first, the rightmost last. The sequence of faces is important for the Build Effect (AnimButtons).
** '''GKEY'''. Grab Mode. Or: the translation mode. This works on selected Objects and vertices. Blender calculates the quantity and direction of the translation, so that they correspond exactly with the mouse movements, regardless of the ViewMode or view direction of the 3DWindow. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a straight line.
** The following options are available in translation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL:''' in increments of 1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT:''' fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL:''' in increments of 0.1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Moving along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Moving along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Moving along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current translation to the X,Y or Z axis. Blender calculates which axis to use, depending on the already initiated mouse movement. Click MiddleMouse again to return to unlimited translation.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric
*** key directly. '''TAB''' will switch between values, '''ENTER '''finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS:''' These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Grabber can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER:''' move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC:''' everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY:''' starts Grab mode again.
**** '''SKEY:''' switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY:''' switches to Rotate mode.
: '''ALT-G.''' Clears translations, given in Grab mode. The X,Y,Z locations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-G.''' Translation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SHIFT-G.''' Group Selection
*** ''Children:'' Selects all selected Object's Children.
*** ''Immediate Children:'' Selects all selected Object's first level Children.
*** ''Parent:'' Selects selected Object's Parent.
*** ''Shared Layers:'' Selects all Object on the same Layer of active Object

** '''IKEY.''' Insert Object Key. A keyposition is inserted in the current frame of all selected Objects. A PopupMenu asks what key position(s) must be added to the IpoCurves.
*** ''Loc:'' The XYZ location of the Object.
*** ''Rot:'' The XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''Size:'' The XYZ dimensions of the Object
*** ''LocRot:'' The XYZ location and XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''LocRotSize:'' The XYZ location, XYZ rotation and XYZ dimensions of the Object.
*** ''Layer:'' The layer of the Object.
*** ''Avail:'' A position is only added to all the current IpoCurves, that is curves which already exists.
*** Mesh, Lattice, Curve or Surface: depending on the type of Object, a VertexKey can be added
: '''CTRL-J.''' Join Objects. All selected Objects of the same type are added to the active Object. What actually happens here is that the ObData blocks are combined and all the selected Objects (except for the active one) are deleted. This is a rather complex operation, which can lead to confusing results, particularly when working with a lot of linked data, animation curves and hierarchies.
: '''KKEY.''' Show Keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects. If all of them were already ON, they are all turned OFF.
: '''SHIFT-K.''' A PopupMenu asks: OK? Show and select all keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects, and all Object-keys are selected. This function is used to enable transformation of the entire animation system.
: '''LKEY.''' Makes selected Object local. Makes library linked objects local for the current scene.
** '''CTRL-L.''' Link selected. Links some of the Active Object data to all selected Objects, the following menu entry appears only if applicable.
*** ''To Scene:'' Creates a link of the Object to a scene.
*** ''Object IPOs:'' Links Active Object IPOs to selected ones.
*** ''Mesh data:'' Links Active Object Mesh data selected ones.
*** ''Lamp Data:'' Links Active Object Lamp data to selected ones.
*** ''Surf Data:'' Links Active Object Surf data selected ones.
*** ''Material:'' Links Active Object Material to selected ones.

** '''SHIFT-L.''' Select Linked. Selects all Objects somehow linked to active Object.
*** ''Object IPO:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's IPOs.
*** ''Object Data:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active  Object's ObData.
*** ''Current Material:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's current Material.
*** ''Current Texture:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing  active Object's current Texture.
: '''MKEY.''' Moves selected Object(s) to another layer, a pop-up appers. Use '''LMB''' to move, use '''SHIFT-LMB''' to make the object belong to multiple layers. If the selected Objects have different layers, this is ORed in the menu display. Use ESC to exit the menu. Press the &quot;OK&quot; button or '''ENTER''' to change the layer seting. The hotkeys ('''ALT'''-)('''1KEY, 2KEY''', ... - '''0KEY''') work here as well (see 3DHeader).
: '''CTRL-M.''' Mirror Menu. It is possible to mirror an Object along the X, Y or Z axis.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. The location, rotation and scaling of the active Object are displayed and can be modified.
: '''ALT-O.''' Clear Origin. The `Origin' is erased for all Child Objects, which causes the Child Objects to move to the exact location of the Parent Objects.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' If the selected Object is a Mesh toggles SubSurf onn/ off. '''CTRL-1''' to '''CTRL-4''' switches to the relative SubSurf level for display purpouses. Rendering SUbSurf level has no HotKey.
** '''CTRL-P.''' Make selected Object(s) the child(ren) of the active Object. If the Parent is a Curve then a popup offers two choices:
*** ''Normal Parent:'' Make a normal parent, the curve can be made a path later on.
*** ''Follow Path:'' Automatically creates a Follow Path constraint with the curve as target. If the Parent is an Armature, a popup offers three options:
*** ''Use Bone:'' One of the Bones becomes the parent. The Object will not be deformed. A popup permits to select the bone. This is the option if you are modeling a robot or machinery
*** ''Use Armature:'' The whole armature is used as parent for deformations. This is the choiche for organic beings.
*** ''Use Object:'' Standard parenting. In the second case further options asks if Vertex groups
should not be created, should be created empty or created and populated.
** '''ALT-P.''' Clears Parent relation, user is asked if he wishes to keep or clear parent-induced transforms.
*** ''Clear Parent:'' the selected Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent. since the transformation of the Parent disappears, this can appear as if the former Children themselves are transformed.
*** ''... and keep transform:'' the Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent, and an attempt is made to assign the current transformation, which was determined in part by the Parent, to the (former Child) Objects.
*** ''Clear Parent inverse:'' The inverse matrix of the Parent of the selected Objects is erased. The Child Objects remain linked to the Objects. This gives the user complete control over the hierarchy.
: '''SHIFT-P.''' Push/Pull Transformations. It is a bit like scaling, except that every element is moved the same distance toward or away from the center. The distance they move is controlled by moving the mouse toward you (pull away from center) or away from you (push toward center). &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''RKEY.''' Rotate mode. Works on selected Object(s). In Blender, a rotation is by default a rotation perpendicular to the screen, regardless of the view direction or ViewMode. The degree of rotation is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try moving around the rotation midpoint with the mouse. The rotation pivot point is determined by the state of the 3DWiewport Header buttons. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a C-shaped curve.
** The following options are available in rotation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 5 degrees.
**** '''SHIFT''': fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL''': in increments of 1 degree.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Rotating along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Rotating along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Rotating along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current rotation to the horizontal or vertical view axis.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''': These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Rotation can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY''': starts Rotate mode again.
: '''ALT-R.''' Clears Rotation. The X,Y,Z rotations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-R.''' Rotation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SKEY.''' Size mode or scaling mode. Works on selected Object(s). The degree of scaling is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try to move from the (rotation) midpoint with the mouse. The pivot point is determined by the settings of the 3D Viewport header pivot Menu. Alternatives for starting scaling mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a V-shaped line.
** The following options are available in scaling mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 0.1.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL''': in increments of 0.01.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Scaling along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Scaling along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Scaling along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the scaling to X, Y or Z axis. Blender calculates the appropriate axis based on the already initiated mouse movement. Click '''MMB''' again to return to free scaling.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains scaling to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''':These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** Scaling can be terminated with:
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old dimension.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': starts Size mode again.
**** '''RKEY''': switches to Rotation.
: '''ALT-S.''' Clears Size. The X,Y,Z dimensions of selected Objects are set to 1.0.
: '''CTRL-ALT-S.''' Scale Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''CTRL-SHIFT-S.''' To Sphere Transformations. An interactive version of the To Sphere tool, working both in Edit Mode (on all data types) and in Object Mode. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''SHIFT-S.''' SnapMenu:
*** Sel-&gt;Grid: Moves Object to nearest grid point.
*** Sel-&gt;Curs: Moves Object to cursor.
*** Curs-&gt;Grid: Moves cursor to nearest grid point.
*** Curs-&gt;Sel: Moves cursor to selected Object(s).
*** Sel-&gt;Center: Moves Objects to their barycentrum.
: '''TKEY.''' Texture space mode. The position and dimensions of the texture space for the selected Objects can be changed in the same manner as described above for Grab and Size mode. To make this visible, the drawingflag EditButtons-&gt;TexSpace is set ON. A PopupMenu asks you to select: &quot;Grabber&quot; or &quot;Size&quot;.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Makes selected Object(s) track the Active Object. Old track method was Blender default tracking before version 2.30. The new method is the Constrain Track, this creates a fully editable constraint on the selected object targeting the active Object.
: '''ALT-T.''' Clears old style Track. Constraint track is removed as all constrains are.
: '''UKEY.''' Makes Object Single User, the inverse operation of Link
** ('''CTRL-L''') a pop-up appears with choices.
*** ''Object:'' if other Scenes also have a link to this Object, the link is deleted and the Object is copied. The Object now only exists in the current Scene. The links from the Object remain unchanged.
*** ''Object &amp; ObData:'' Similar to the previous command, but now the ObData blocks with multiple links are copied as well. All selected Objects are now present in the current Scene only, and each has a unique ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.).
*** ''Object &amp; ObData &amp; Materials+Tex:'' Similar to the previous command, but now Materials and Textures with multiple links are also copied. All selected Objects are now unique. They have unique ObData and each has a unique Material and Texture block. 
*** ''Materials+Tex:'' Only the Materials and Textures with multiple links are copied.
: '''VKEY.''' Switches in/out of Vertex Paint Mode.
: '''ALT-V.''' Object-Image Aspect. This hotkey sets the X and Y dimensions of the selected Objects in relation to the dimensions of the Image Texture they have. Use this hotkey when making 2D Image compositions and multi-plane designs to quickly place the Objects in the appropriate relationship with one another.
: '''WKEY.''' Opens Object Booleans Menu.
: '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected? Deletes selected objects.
: '''ZKEY.''' Toggles Solid Mode on/off.
: '''SHIFT-Z.''' Toggles Shaded Mode on/off.
: '''ALT-Z.''' Toggles Textured Mode on/off.

== Edit Mode - General==

Again, Most of these hotkeys are useful in the 3D Viewport when in Edit Mode, but many works on other Blender Object, so they are summarized here. Many Object Mode keys works in Edit mode too, but on the selected vertices or control points; among these Grab, Rotate, Scale and so on. These hotkeys are not repeated here.
: '''TAB''' or '''ALT-E.''' This button starts and stops Edit Mode.
: '''CTRL-TAB.''' Switches between Vertex Select, Edge Select, and Face Select modes. Holding SHIFT while clicking on a mode will allow you to combine modes.
: '''AKEY.''' Select/Unselect all.
: '''BKEY-BKEY'''. Circle Select. If you press BKEY a second time after starting Border Select, Circle Select is invoked. It works as described above. Use NUM+ or NUM- or MW to adjust the circle size. Leave Circle Select with '''RMB''' or '''ESC'''.
: '''CTRL-H.''' With vertices selected, this creates a &quot;Hook&quot; object. Once a hook is selected, CTRL-H brings up an options menu for it.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. Simpler than the Object Mode one, in Edit Mode works for Mesh, Curve, Surface: The location of the active vertex is displayed.
: '''OKEY.''' Switch in/out of Proportional Editing.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' Toggles between Smooth and Sharp Proportional Editing.
: '''PKEY.''' SeParate. You can choose to make a new object with all selected vertices, edges, faces and curves or create a new object from each separate group of interconnected vertices from a popup. Note that for curves you cannot separate connected control vertices. This operation is the opposite of Join ('''CTRL-J''').
: '''CTRL-P.''' Make Vertex Parent. If one object (or more than one) is/are selected and the active Object is in Edit Mode with 1 or 3 vertices selected then the Object in Edit Mode becomes the Vertex Parent of the selected Object(s). If only 1 vertex is selected, only the location of this vertex determines the Parent transformation; the rotation and dimensions of the Parent do not play a role here. If three vertices are selected, it is a `normal' Parent relationship in which the 3 vertices determine the rotation and location of the Child together. This method produces interesting effects with Vertex Keys. In EditMode, other Objects can be selected with CTRL-RMB.
: '''CTRL-S.''' Shear. In EditMode this operation enables you to make selected forms `slant'. This always works via the horizontal screen axis.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and can be returned to via UKEY. Mesh Objects have better Undo, see next section.
: '''WKEY.''' Specials PopupMenu. A number of tools are included in this PopupMenu as an alternative to the Edit Buttons. This makes the buttons accessible as shortcuts, e.g. EditButtons-&gt; Subdivide is also `WKEY, 1KEY'.
: '''SHIFT-W.''' Warp. Selected vertices can be bent into curves with this option. It can be used to convert a plane into a tube or even a sphere. The centre of the circle is the 3DCursor. The mid-line of the circle is determined by the horizontal dimensions of the selected vertices. When you start, everything is already bent 90 degrees. Moving the mouse up or down increases or decreases the extent to which warping is done. By zooming in/out of the 3Dwindow, you can specify the maximum degree of warping. The CTRL limiter increments warping in steps of 5 degrees.

== EditMode - Mesh ==

This section and the following highlight peculiar EditMode Hotkeys.
: '''CTRL-NUM+.''' Adds to selection all vertices connected by an edge to an already selected vertex.
: '''CTRL-NUM-.''' Removes from selection all vertices of the outer ring of selected vertices.
: '''ALT-CTRL-RMB.''' Edge select.
: '''CKEY.''' If using curve deformations, this toggles the curve Cyclic mode on/off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. &quot;Extrude&quot; in EditMode transforms all the selected edges to faces. If possible, the selected faces are also duplicated. Grab mode is started directly after this command is executed.
: '''SHIFT-EKEY.''' Crease Subsurf edge. With &quot;Draw Creases&quot; enabled, pressing this key will allow you to set the crease weight. Black edges have no weight, edge-select color have full weight.
: '''CTRL-EKEY.''' Mark LSCM Seam. Marks a selected edge as a &quot;seam&quot; for unwrapping using the LSCM mode.
: '''FKEY.''' Make Edge/Face. If 2 vertices are selected, an edge is created. If 3 or 4 vertices are selected, a face is created.
: '''SHIFT-F.''' Fill selected. All selected vertices that are bound by edges and form a closed polygon are filled with triangular faces. Holes are automatically taken into account. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession.
: '''ALT-F.''' Beauty Fill. The edges of all the selected triangular faces are switched in such a way that equally sized faces are formed. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession. The Beauty Fill can be performed immediately after a Fill.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Flip faces, selected triangular faces are paired and common edge of each pair swapped.
: '''HKEY.''' Hide Selected. All selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Hide Not Selected: All non-selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''ALT-H.''' Reveal. All temporarily hidden vertices and faces are drawn again.
: '''ALT-J.''' Join faces, selected triangular faces are joined in pairs and transformed to quads
** '''KKEY.''' Knife tool Menu.
*** ''Face Loop Select:'' ('''SHIFT-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Face Loop Cut:'' ('''CTRL-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (exact):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges are cut at intersections with mouse line. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (midpoints):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges intersecting with mouse line are cut in middle regardless of true intersection point. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an unselected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''CTRL-L.''' Select Linked Selected. Starting with all selected vertices, all vertices connected to them are selected too.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Opens a popup asking for the axis to mirror. 3 possible axis group are available, each of which contains three axes, for a total of nine choices. Axes can be Global (Blender Global Reference); Local (Current Object Local Reference) or View (Current View reference). Remember that mirroring, like scaling, happens with respect to the current pivot point.
: '''ALT-M.''' Merges selected vertices at barycentrum or at cursor depending on selection made on pop-up.
: '''CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Outside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `outward'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Inside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `inward'.
: '''ALT-S.''' Whereas '''SHIFT-S''' scales in Edit Mode as it does in Object Mode, for Edit Mode a further option exists, '''ALT-S''' moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, hence effectively shrinking/fattening the mesh.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Make Triangles. All selected faces are converted to triangles.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and all subsequent changes are saved on a stack. This option enables you to restore the previous situation, one after the other.
: '''SHIFT-U.''' Redo. This let you re-apply any undone changes up to the moment in which Edit Mode was entered
: '''ALT-U.''' Undo Menu. This let you choose the exact point to which you want to undo changes.
** '''WKEY.''' Special Menu. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Subdivide:'' all selected edges are split in two.
*** ''Subdivide Fractal:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced randomly.
*** ''Subdivide Smooth:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced along the normal.
*** ''Merge:'' as '''ALT-M.'''
*** ''Remove Doubles:'' All selected vertices closer to each other than a given threshold (See EditMode Button Window) are merged '''ALT-M.'''
*** ''Hide:'' as '''HKEY.'''
*** ''Reveal:'' as '''ALT-H.'''
*** ''Select Swap:'' Selected vertices become unselected and vice versa.
*** ''Flip Normals:'' Normals of selected faces are flipped.
*** ''Smooth:'' Vertices are moved closer one to each other, getting a smoother object.
*** ''Bevel:'' Faces are reduced in size and the space between edges is filled with a smoothly curving bevel of the desired order.

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Vertices:'' all vertices are deleted. This includes the edges and faces they form.
*** ''Edges:'' all edges with both vertices selected are deleted. If this `releases' certain vertices, they are deleted as well. Faces that can no longer exist as a result of this action are also deleted.
*** ''Faces:'' all faces with all their vertices selected are deleted. If any vertices are `released' as a result of this action, they are deleted.
*** ''All:'' everything is deleted.
*** ''Edges and Faces:'' all selected edges and faces are deleted, but the vertices remain.
*** ''Only Faces:'' all selected faces are deleted, but the edges and vertices remain.
: '''YKEY.''' Split. This command splits the selected part of a Mesh without deleting faces. The split parts are no longer bound by edges. Use this command to control smoothing. Since the split parts have vertices at the same position, selection with '''LKEY''' is recommended.

== EditMode - Curve ==

: '''CKEY.''' Set the selected curves to cyclic or turn cyclic off. An individual curve is selected if at least one of the vertices is selected.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Curve. A vertex is added to the selected end of the curves. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is executed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the end of two curves. These two curves are combined into one curve.
: '''HKEY.''' Toggle Handle align/free. Toggles the selected Bezier handles between free or aligned.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Set Handle auto. The selected Bezier handles are converted to auto type.
: '''CTRL-H.''' Calculate Handles. The selected Bezier curves are calculated and all handles are assigned a type.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve.

: '''ALT-T.''' Clear Tilt. Set all axis rotations of the selected vertices to zero.
: '''VKEY.''' Vector Handle. The selected Bezier handles are converted to vector type.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for curves appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices.
*** Switch direction. The direction of the selected curves is reversed. This is mainly for Curves that are used as paths!

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''Segment:'' a curve segment is deleted. This only works for single segments. Curves can be split in two using this option. Or use this option to specify the cyclic position within a cyclic curve.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== EditMode - Metaball ==

: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.

== EditMode - Surface ==

: '''CKEY.''' Toggle Cyclic menu. A PopupMenu asks if selected surfaces in the `U' or the `V' direction must be cyclic. If they were already cyclic, this mode is turned off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. This makes surfaces of all the selected curves, if possible. Only the edges of surfaces or loose curves are candidates for this operation. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is completed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the ends of two curves. These two curves are combined into 1 curve.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected together with all vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-R.''' Select Row. Starting with the last selected vertex, a complete row of vertices is selected in the `U' or `V' direction. Selecting ''Select Row'' a second time with the same vertex switches the `U' or `V' selection.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for surfaces appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices
*** Switch direction. This will switch the normals of the selected parts.
*** Mirror. Mirrors the selected vertices

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following choices:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== VertexPaint Hotkeys ==

: '''SHIFT-K.''' All vertex colours are erased; they are changed to the current drawing colour.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. This undo is `real'. Pressing Undo twice redoes the undone.
: '''WKEY.''' Shared Vertexcol: The colours of all faces that share vertices are blended.

== EditMode - Font ==

== EdgeSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT-CLICK.''' Selects an Edge Loop.

== FaceSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT-CLICK.''' Selects a Face Loop.
: '''TAB.''' Switches to EditMode, selections made here will show up when switching back to FaceSelectMode with TAB.
: '''FKEY.''' With multiple, co-planar faces selected, this key will merge them into one &quot;FGon&quot; so long as they remain co-planar (flat to each other).
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked UVs. To ease selection of face groups, Select Linked in UV Face Select Mode will now select all linked faces, if no seam divides them.
: '''RKEY.''' Calls a menu allowing to rotate the UV coordinates or the VertexCol.
** '''UKEY.''' Calls the UV Calculation menu. The following modes can the applied to the selected faces:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Blender 2.36 HotKeys ==

Ok, I converted this Hotkeys from official [http://www.blender.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=documentation&amp;file=index Blender PDF] file. Please use official Hotkeys names in your articles! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 14:21, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== ideas for organization ==

I'd like to start a discussion about how this book should be organized.  Perhaps the organization should be changed, or maybe it should stay the way it currently is.  Here's an idea:

Create a page for each shortcut.  The URL would be formatted very specifically; for example:

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Edit Mode/EKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Vertex Paint Mode/VKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Object Mode/SHIFT-DKEY]]

This way there could be very detailed information about each of the shortcuts in the different modes.

Then on the Mode Pages, for example the Edit Mode page, the shortcuts could be listed by function....

'''Edit Mode'''

'''''Mesh Modeling'''''

A

*AKEY - select all

E

*EKEY - extrude

etc...

: It's good idea to explain more detailed information about every HotKey, maybe even with examples or links to tutorial examples, but I think that is also good to have all HotKeys in one place (as it is) and from here links to more detailed explanations as you said [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]]. I would like to see here also keyboard drawing with color marked HotKeys large enough that can be printed and used on actual keyboard. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:30, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:: I just learned something using Template:whatever and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, let me try it out, I think this will help. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:28, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Check this out.  Follow the subpages I've created and take a look at the way these &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; work.  We can then embed the same hotkey instructions on any Blender book page anywhere in wikibooks using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Check it out: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_HotKeys/new

: Cool! This looks nice and useful! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:59, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Blender 2.37a HotKeys Update ==

New HotKeys are marked with &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:21, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">www.cg-files.com is huge resource of cg files and tutorials. On CG Files you can download free 3D models, 3D Max Tutorials, Photoshop Tutorials, Flash Tutorials, Collection of Textures, Blueprints, HDRI, News, and much more.

== To Do ==

* Probably is good idea to mark author, quality, version, level, format (pdf, flash, java)...etc of tutorials somehow. UTF-8 caracters are useful, but problem is that Window$ IE usually don't show them all.

Here are some useful UTF-8 caracters for this purpose:
: ✓ ✗ ☺ ☹ ✩ ✐ ❀ ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ ❻ ❼ ❽ ❾ ❿

or we could have Window$ safe caracters:

: !? - ok, but probably not the best
: ! - good
: !! - excellent
: ***** - five stars for the best
: 2.36 - Blender version compatibility

One other is for the old blender doc, but the one at the top (which i kept) is linking to a page -&gt; linking to all official docs. Either we remove the two second links (again), or add all the links on the &quot;official docs&quot; page which the first link is reffering to.

As you may be aware, '''[[Wikipedia:Blender (program)|Blender]]''' is the first and only fully integrated 3D graphics creation suite allowing modeling, animation, rendering, post-production, realtime interactive 3D, and game creation and playback with cross-platform compatibility - all in one tidy package.

This '''Blender MemoBook''' is part of my personal Memo Ssschratchhhh WikiBook. Maybe you will find it useful. You can edit it if you already have your own MemoBook, tip or proper link to add@this level! This level means that you can find this MemoBook useful after you went carefully thru Blender [http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/ch03.html Interface] for the very first time and you want something nice to render or animate with your Digital Studio Masterpiece - Blender! This Blender MemoBook doesn't want to be YaBt (Yet another Blender tutorial), but more like MemoBook with references to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Tutorial Links List|tutorial links]] (to support short HOWTOs) and tips which related tutorials maybe didn't include or are worth repeating. I want to keep this MemoBook as compact as possible, but still smooth and friendly enough to be read.

Also don't worry if [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Introduction|you want to edit]] this MemoBook, feel free and welcome, [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/ MediaWiki] has all history backed up. MediaWiki is quite easy to install. How? Read [[Starting and Running a Wiki Website|this]] WikiBook.

== Ok, let's do it! ==

I didn't work in ''real'' 3D for many years (I've used Cubicomp and Topas in my professional past) and even with all my 3D experiences using Blender doesn't look like easy task... But anyway, you will never know how to swim if you don't jump into the water, as someone said, so I'll try to make a beautiful Staunton chess set for my first Blender lesson. Hard &amp; original task, huh? :)

'''Before you start''', it's a good idea to set home paths for textures, fonts, render, yfexport, python, texplugins, sounds, seqplugins, and tmp ''(be careful: default /tmp is deleted after reboot, it's better to set it somewhere else, like /home/blender/render)''. These options are quite hidden. You can find and set them if you drag top edge of Blender's menu ''(File; Add; Timeline, ...)'', there you will find also some other useful settings. I find it useful if it's '''MMB''' ''(middle mouse button)'' set to '''Pan View''' instead the default '''Rotate View'''. I also prefer '''Dolly''' rather than '''Continue''' View Zoom. After these changes you can save default scene with '''CTRL-U'''.

For the reference image I've downloaded some proper Staunton set photos from the net. You can use photos as references in Blender too, but for the Blender SVG import test I will use [[Wikipedia:Inkscape|Inkscape]] for the 2D chess set render.

=== Staunton chess set ===

First I will make a pawn. Why? Heh, because it's the greatest piece! You don't believe me? Well, the pawn can be promoted to any piece except the king, can't it? So... :)

Ok, I can't say that Blender 2.35 doesn't read Inkscape SVG, but the import is not perfect yet, so it looks that I will have to wait for perfect import till some next Blender release.

I didn't want to make a 2D pawn polygon again, so I repaired the broken Inkscape SVG in Blender 2.35 version also can't read open SVG polygons which are needed for my pawn...

I used Blender basic Mesh Tool [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Basic_Mesh_Tools#Spin_and_SpinDup Spin], which is probably not the best option if you want to have huge number of objects made that way. For such purpose is better to use [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/c3127.html#mesh_modeling_subsurf Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces] because of Subdivision Surfaces control, but for this very first test was ok.

Ok, I did it! Staunton Pawn is born. Not bad for the first try! I had problems with merging doubled points ('''Edit mode &gt; WKEY &gt; Merge'''); &lt;s&gt;maybe it is better to leave them doubled&lt;/s&gt;. There must be easier way to delete them. I'll check this with the next piece - bishop, zebra, robot, house, or mouse. You can download chess set from [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Blender_3D:_ActionBook/Verse here]. ''(You can remove doubles if you select all vertices &amp; ('''Edit mode &gt; WKEY &gt; Remove Doubles'''), but you need to be careful that you start to build at center '''SHIFT-CKEY''')''.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Materials ====

* The '''plastic pawn''' is without texture and the scene has two lights, one ''omni'' (omnidirectional) light for better ambient light and one stronger spot light which casts shadows. Shadows in this scene were made with ''Buf. Shadow'' setting (Lamp buttons) where you have good control over shadow softness.

* For the '''rusty pawn''' I've used the same scene with two lights and a rust texture map (I've made a larger tile 2400x3200 px texture in [[Wikipedia:GIMP|Gimp]], but I found it later that is better to use ''power of 2'' sizes for textures: 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, ... etc.) from [http://www.mayang.com/textures/index.htm www.mayang.com] where you can find a lot of free, large &amp; useful textures for your models. '''Map input''' setting for this rust texture is ''cube''; settings for '''map to''' are ''col'' and ''nor'', this stands for using colors and normals (bump mapping). This stage went without problems, but I needed a lot of experimenting with settings. I found it out that you need to rotate texture through 90 degrees in Blender if you want to have original texture position!! (Blender ver. 2.35).

* The '''Amber pawn''' is made using Subdivisions instead of '''SPIN''' command. It stands in the same scene but there is more lights and background curved plane. For this material I've used ''reflection mapping'' '''F5 &gt; World buttons; F5 &gt; Material buttons &gt; Mirror Trans''' and ''Ramp Shader''. Do you know how many lights are used for the Amber pawn?

* The '''Glass pawn''' stands in the same scene but is rendered with '''Yafray''' renderer which finally works in Blender 2.35, but still not by default(!!). For this you have to switch off the '''xml''' button '''Scene (F10) &gt; Render &gt; Yafray &gt; xml'''.  Results with Yafray are good, but it's a large time consumer - read slow. For Yafray rendering I needed to set different light settings to those in the previous scene because the Yafray render is much darker than the default Blender renderer. This you can correct a bit in the same menu as is ''xml'' button with ''Gam'' and ''Exp'' sliders (Gamma correction and Exposition), but probably you will need to add more energy to lights too. I set ''Exp'' to 4.0 and the spot light ''Energy'' to 5.5 (in the previous scene was 1.4 for the same lighting arrangement). This glass pawn is without texture, but I added one photon spot light from the same direction but little lower. Photon light doesn't shine as normal light but traces light photons through material refraction. You can see results on the background surface and on model itself. I set the pawn material refraction to 1.5 '''Shading (F5), Material buttons &gt; Mirror Transp &gt; IOR''' which is the value for glass as you can see in [[#Material Refraction Values Table|Material Refraction Values Table]]. I found good tutorials about this topic on [http://www.blender3d.com/cms/Materials.247.0.html www.blender3d.com].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

[[Image:Staunton_set4.jpg|700px|Staunton chess set]]&lt;br&gt;''Completed Staunton chess set, prepared for a good [[NeoRandom Chess]] game!''&lt;/div&gt;

* All chess pieces were made with the same subsurface principle: '''SPACE &gt;&gt; Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Cylinder''' and '''EKEY''' for extrude, but the difference is in the number of vertices. The pawn is started with 4 vertices, the knight with 8, bishop with 16, king with 8, queen with 10, and the rook with 12. Four vertices for the pawn is not enough for a rounded bottom (read about this problem [[#Other FAQ|here]]). The knight was made with the extrude function '''EKEY''' and with some tweaked vertices. I also added two additional Face Loop Cuts '''KKEY &gt; Face Loop Cut''' for head details. The bishop was made the same way. Here I also used the knife function '''KKEY &gt; Knife (Exact)''' for the bishop head cut. The rook could be started with 18 vertices for a better result on the parapets (the upper part of the rook). Material for this chess set was taken from [[#Staunton chess set|amber pawn]], the only change is color hue.

=== Cobra ===

Did you expect to find here '''Queen''' or '''Zebra'''? Oh no, my friend. Here is '''Cobra''', or the so-called '''Shelby Cobra Blueprint''' which is needed to build your new Cobra 3D car model. One day I was looking for a good Cobra Car Blueprint, but I found only one with a small resolution, so I decided to draw a Cobra Blueprint in SVG format with another great 2D vector software package [[Wikipedia:Inkscape|Inkscape]]. You can download the '''Cobra Blueprint''' SVG files [http://openclipart.org/search/?query=shelby here] at '''Openclipart.org'''.

[[Image:Shelby Cobra 260.jpg|center|700px|Shelby Cobra 260, by Igor Križanovskij]]

There are quite a lot of car tutorials around, but best so far that I found is a tutorial for a [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/speedtiti/tutoriels.htm Porsche 550] made by '''Speedtiti''' ''(sometimes you can find him on [irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderchat IRC])''. I missed some details in his tutorial, but I think his approach to car modeling is right one. In the picture above you can see my Cobra progress so far. Perhaps as you are building your car model you will need some of these [[Blender_3D: Tutorial Links List#Cars|tutorials]] and also [http://www.3dcar-gallery.com/tutorial/less02.htm this], as well as one about car lights at '''3dcar-gallery.com'''.  Check  [http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21382 this] tutorial at '''elYsiun.com''' for some custom Cobra 3D logo designs. Finally there is an excellent site with tons of blueprints [http://www.suurland.com/ online]!

: ''Have fun with building '''Cobra''' and don't forget to make some useful entries in the Memo Book!''

=== Face of Gilbert ===

The '''Face of Gilbert''' was my first try to make an organic form with '''Blender'''. I didn't use any reference pictures. The main reason for this is that almost every tutorial uses reference pictures and I wanted to see what I could do without them.  
[[image:Face01.jpg|right|350px|Gilbert]]
What did I learn from this exercise? Well, '''Blender''' is very strong modeling tool compared to software that I had used before. [http://www.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/c3127.html#mesh_modeling_subsurf Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces] is an excellent tool for organic forms and gives you precise control over surface curves, but you have to be careful about two things: '''First''', when you model the front side of the model you have to be careful about the back side vertices at the same time! Why? Because if you start with box modeling like I did in this exercise, you will have a flat backside full of vertices in the same plane after you finish the front side face modeling and this is rather difficult to change later. The same is true for the left and right side of the model. Only later I found a very [http://www.subdivisionmodeling.com/forums/showthread.php?t=907 useful topology thread], so check it out, you might need it at this point! '''Second''', if you want to model some exact shapes, especially rounded circles, don't start with a Box but try with a Tube or use command [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/x2868.html SPIN]. Read more about this problem [[#Other FAQ|here]]. In my case it was also a good idea to control surfaces from inside of the model, especially when modeling concave slopes like ears. Thru processing I didn't delete any vertices and I've used mainly these commands for modeling: '''KKEY''' for loop cut, '''EKEY''' for extrude (in my case used only for the ear), '''GKEY''' for editing vertices and '''SKEY''' for scale ''(with the SKEY you also control symmetrization of vertices)''. You can check [http://www.enricovalenza.com/makebongo.html this] tutorial for the basic idea how I've made Gilbert.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0;text-align:center;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Victor_Render_4.jpg|350px|Victor the Brave]]&lt;br&gt;''Holly smoke! I think I can fly!''&lt;/div&gt;
The scene and material for this model are quite simple. I have used two lights: one spot and one omnidirectional. I have also included a grey-blue back plane for an additional 3D effect. Face material is made with [http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Ramp_Shaders.348.0.html Ramp Shaders] ('''F5 &gt; Ramps'''). I didn't care much about materials this time, but I will try [http://www.dedalo-3d.com/index.php?filename=SXCOL/experiments/ss_scattering_python.html SSS python script] for this purpose later. This face is made with '''Blender 2.36''' but it will be even easier to do it with the additional features in Blender's next release 2.37! ''Yesss!!''

=== Victor the Brave ===

Yes, '''Blender 2.37a''' is even more enjoyable for modeling than the previous versions. At this point I can tell you for sure that Blender is really a Big Software Bundle. This also means that you will never be able to master ''all'' of Blender's finest filigree features and options unless you are hmm, God? With integrated Python there's just too many options... and there's still more and more to come!

I've made the '''Victor The Brave''' character for the purpose of learning animation, and pure fun of course! What did I learn? I found another of Blender's Modeling Golden Rules! '''Less is More, but Optimal is the Best!''' So when you model have in mind that less vertices you use, the closer to perfection you will be, but don't forget to press Optimal button from time to time ('''F9; Mesh; Optimal''' :)

I also found it out that is '''VERY''' important how you start modeling your model if you want to finish it with a good, smooth &amp; optimal mesh ''(this is also important for composition)''. There are many ways to finish your model, but only few that are optimal. Victor the Brave'' (all his body parts)'' was started from one and only one sphere, yes sphere.

Unfortunately there is no single way to model optimally. Different models, different approaches. The ''[[#Face of Gilbert|Face of Gilbert]]'' was started from a box (8 vertices), but was hard for me to control the shape of the whole head. So I started to model ''Victor'' from sphere with 8x8 vertices. I'm satisfied with this result also because of the quite short render times which will be important in the next stages. On the other hand, the model of the ''[[#Cobra|Cobra]]'' was started from circle (not a sphere) with 8 vertices. Optimal? Did I say that my way is optimal? :) I used a tool [http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/ch09s04.html Taper] for the snake-like form. In this scene there are seven lights (one spot light) with two contrast colors (cold, warm). Materials involved experimenting with [http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/ch10s04.html Ramp Shaders] and [http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/ch20.html Particle System]. You can check out the nice smoke tutorial by [http://www.centralsource.com/blender/smoke/ Liubomir Kovatchev] and [http://www.androidblues.com/howto.html Steven Stahlberg's] excellent tutorials. Anyway, if you still have some questions about how this works we can use this Blender MemoBook [[Talk:Blender 3D: MemoBook|talkpage]].

Well, '''Blender 2.4''' is on its [http://www.blender3d.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=18&amp;sid=e4450b93f2b288aac496845c643eea49 way]! With a big jump! In the next Blender release we can expect a lot of great new features! First and most important for my next step in this MemoBook is new armature system. We'll be able to animate more comfortably with it. Then I have to congratulate '''[irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderclasses timmeh]''' for embedding IRC &amp; additions in Blender. I also keenly waiting on [http://www.ntoken.de/p_fluid.html Fluid Dynamics]. On the horizon is also and interesting project [http://blender.org/modules/verse/ Verse], which will hopefully be able to join together many, many users in one ''real time'' working team. I just have a feeling that Blender will be in every single school &amp; elsewhere around the globe very soon.

: ''Second option:'' Select face(s) and press '''PKEY''' (separate). That way you will separate face(s) from mesh.
: ''Third option:'' Select edge and press '''VKEY'''. That way you will make hole in the edge. ''(new feature)''
* '''How to separate faces from a mesh?'''
: Select faces and press '''PKEY'''.
* '''How to join separated meshes?'''
: Select meshes and press '''CTRL-JKEY'''.
* '''How to join vertices?'''
: Select vertices and press '''WKEY''' &gt;&gt; '''Merge'''.
* '''How the heck do I edit those Bézier Curves already?'''
: You can add points to the curve by selecting one of the two endpoints, then holding '''CTRL''' and clicking '''LMB''' 
: ''Curve Modes:'' '''HKEY, VKEY, SHIFT-H; CKEY''' (close) or Read [http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/ch09.html#section_bezier here].
* '''How to move 3D cursor in center XYZ (0,0,0)?'''
: '''SHIFT-CKEY''' is the answer.
* '''How to move center of the object?'''
: Under Editing (press '''F9'''), Curve and surface - New Center 
* '''How to rotate 2D polygon around one axis and make object that way?'''
: Draw open(!) polygon; Convert it into a mesh (press '''ALT-C''' in Object Mode); Select all vertices (press '''AKEY''') and check on top bar for number of vertices (this is important for deleting this polygon later); Switch to top view ('''NUM 7''') (you can't do this in other views!); Select one verticle; The cursor should be placed along the center of the polygon profile, and snapping the cursor to that location with '''SHIFT-S''' &gt;&gt; Cursor -&gt; Selection.; Press '''[http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/x2868.html SPIN]''' button (don't forget to set 360 degrees rotation and proper steps number - around 36); Annoying part is removing double vertices:  To merge (weld) two vertices together, select both of them by holding '''SHIFT'''  and '''RMB''' on them. Press '''SKEY''' to start scaling and hold down '''CONTROL''' while scaling to scale the points down to 0 units in the X,Y and Z axis. '''LMB''' to complete the scaling operation and click the &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; button in the EditButtons window. Alternatively, you can press '''WKEY''' and select &quot;Merge&quot; from the appearing Menu. You can then choose in a new menu if the merged node will have to be at the center of the selected nodes or in the location of the cursor. The first choice is better in my case.
* ''' How do I force camera to track an object?'''
: Select camera in object mode then hold '''SHIFT''' and select object; press '''CTRL-T'''.
* ''' How do I un-force camera to track an object?'''
: Under menu '''Constraint (F7)''' press button ('''x''') delete, ''(I didn't have luck with shotcut) :/ ''
* '''Holy smoke, there are no shadows?!'''
: You will not see [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/x5779.html shadows] casting by [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/x5524.html lights] if you do not switch the Ray button on (Scene ('''F10''') - Render Menu - Ray); you also have to check if you set object material to receive shadows (Shading ('''F5''') - Shaders - Shadow) ; another option is to use Buffer Shadow, this option is very value sensitive.
* '''How to Redo?''' 
: '''CTRL-Y'''. Redo. Mac users may use ''CMD-Y''.; '''SHIFT-CTRL-Z'''. Redo. Mac users may use ''SHIFT-CMD-Z''; You can even use '''ALT-U''' ''(Global Undo History List)''.
* '''How to switch to the reverse side view?'''
: Press '''CTRL + Numpad Number'''.
* '''How to align view to selected?'''
: Select face(s) &amp; press '''SHIFT-VKEY'''.

==[[wikipedia:RJ11,_RJ14,_RJ25|RJ-11 (Registered Jack 11)]]==
'''RJ-11''' is a physical interface often used for terminating telephone wires. 
It is probably the most familiar of the registered jacks, being used for single line [[Network_Plus_Certification/Media_and_Topologies/Wide_Area_Networks#POTS_.28Plain_Old_Telephone_Service.29|Plain Old Telephone Service]] (POTS) telephone jacks in most homes across the world.

'''RJ-14''' is similar, but for two lines, and '''RJ-25''' is for three lines.  The telephone line cord and its plug are more often a true RJ-11 with only two conductors.

      <comment>/* The SPC's communication routine */ IPL ROM isn't copied to RAM; it's just mapped over RAM temporarily</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial, we will create a ROM that initializes the SPC700 to play a song captured from another SNES game.

= Introduction =
To produce a sound on the SNES, the registers of the DSP need to be set to appropriate values.  This means that to play a song on the SNES, you need a program for the SPC700 that manipulates the DSP, and you need code for the 65816 that transfers the SPC700 program to the SPC700.  Fortunately, there are thousands of programs for the SPC700 freely available online in the form of SPC files, solving half our problem.

= SPC files =
SPC files contain the state of the SPC700, typically at the very beginning of a song in an SNES game.  By restoring the state in an SPC700 and DSP emulator -- a.k.a. an SPC player -- you can listen to the song without the SNES ROM.  We can likewise use SPC files to restore the SPC state inside of the SNES to play the song.  You can get SPC files either by capturing them yourself using an SNES ROM and emulator or by downloading one of the thousands online at [http://www.snesmusic.org/v2/ SNESMusic.org].

= Extracting SPC700 state from an SPC file =

The SPC700 file contains the SPC hardware state as well as a variety of additional information, such as title, game name, author, capturer, etc.  An in-depth description of the format can be found at [http://www.snesmusic.org/files/spc_file_format.txt SNESMusic.org], but the relevant fields for our purposes are:

{| width=&quot;80%&quot;
| ''Offset'' || ''Size'' || ''Description''
|-
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;border-top:1px solid grey;&quot; |
|-
|00025h || 2 bytes || Program counter (PC) register
|-
|00027h || 1 bytes || A register
|-
|00028h || 1 bytes || X register
|-
|00029h || 1 bytes || Y register
|-
|0002ah || 1 bytes || Program status ward (PSW) register
|-
|0002bh || 1 bytes || Stack pointer (SP) register
|-
|00100h || 10000h bytes || 64k RAM
|-
|10100h || 128 bytes || The contents of the 128 DSP registers
|}

We need to get this data from inside an SPC file and put it into our ROM.  You ''could'' write a script to extract this data from the SPC file and turn it into a text file of assembly data directives, and &lt;tt&gt;.include&lt;/tt&gt; in your assembly file.  However, the &lt;tt&gt;.incbin&lt;/tt&gt; directive in the WLA assembler makes this process much simpler, since it allows us to include pieces of binary files directly into our ROM.  Here is how we include the above data:

 ; The SPC file from which we read our data.
 .define spcFile &quot;test000.spc&quot;
 
 dspData:  .incbin spcFile skip $10100 read $0080
 audioPC:  .incbin spcFile skip $00025 read $0002
 audioA:   .incbin spcFile skip $00027 read $0001
 audioX:   .incbin spcFile skip $00028 read $0001
 audioY:   .incbin spcFile skip $00029 read $0001
 audioPSW: .incbin spcFile skip $0002a read $0001
 audioSP:  .incbin spcFile skip $0002b read $0001

Notice that we have not included the SPC RAM data in the data definitions above.  Because the SPC RAM data (64k) is larger than the SNES's ROM bank size (32k), we need to break it in half and store it in two banks of its own, separate from the rest of our code and data:

 ; The first half of the saved SPC RAM from the SPC file.
 .bank 1
 .section &quot;musicData1&quot;
 spcMemory1: .incbin spcFile skip $00100 read $8000
 .ends
 
 ; The second half of the saved SPC RAM from the SPC file.
 .bank 2
 .section &quot;musicData2&quot;
 spcMemory2: .incbin spcFile skip $08100 read $8000
 .ends

= The Main Program =

We use most of the code from the SNES Initialization Tutorial for our main program:

 Start:
     ; Initialize the SNES.
     Snes_Init
 
     jsr     LoadSPC
 
     ; Set the background color to green.
     sep     #$20        ; Set the A register to 8-bit.
     lda     #%10000000  ; Force VBlank and set brightness to 0%.
     sta     $2100
     stz     $2121
     lda     #%11100000  ; Load the low byte of the green background color.
     sta     $2122
     lda     #%00000000  ; Load the high byte of the green background color.
     sta     $2122
     lda     #%00001111  ; End VBlank, setting brightness to 100%.
     sta     $2100
 
     ; Loop forever.
 Forever:
     jmp Forever

We have added a line to call a subroutine to load the SPC data, just before the graphics code from the initialization tutorial.  The advantage of including this graphics code is that it does something on the screen after the music loads.  Thus, when we execute the ROM, it tells us visually either that the music was loaded successfully or that execution halted somewhere in the music code.

The SNES and the SPC700 communicate via four byte-wide channels, which we will call Audio0, Audio1, Audio2, and Audio3.  On the SNES side, these are represented by the memory-mapped registers $2140-$2143, while the SPC represents them as $00f4-$00f7.  Although there are four channels, there are actually eight values being stored behind the scenes -- four bytes for the channels from the SNES to the SPC and four bytes for the channels from the SPC to the SNES.  For example, when the SNES writes a value to its Audio0, it is saved in one location so the SPC can read it from its Audio0.  Likewise, when the SPC writes a value to its Audio0, it is saved in another location so the SNES can read it from its Audio0.  Thus the value that is read from a channel's memory-mapped register may not be the value that was last written there.

== The SPC's communication routine ==

When the SNES is reset, the SPC maps a 64-byte chunk of ROM -- called the &quot;IPL ROM&quot; -- to locations $ffc0-$ffff and executes it. While it's mapped there, reads come from this ROM rather than normal RAM. It performs the necessary initialization of the SPC:

* Set the stack pointer to $01ef.
* Zero memory locations $0000-$00ef.
* Wait for data from the SNES.

The IPL ROM routine is capable of copying blocks of data from the SNES into SPC memory and then starting execution at a given location.  The documents of the SNES Devkit at [http://snescentral.edgeemu.com/Development SNES Central] are somewhat confusing regarding the exact communication protocol of the SPC.  You can view the routine by disassembling the IPL ROM bytecode included in the source code of SNES or SPC emulators or in SPC files themselves.  Here, however, is a summary of the algorithm the SPC uses:

# Initialization:
#* Set AudioOut0 to $aa and AudioOut1 to $bb.
#* Wait until AudioIn0 is $cc.
# Prepare to copy a block:
#* Read the 16-bit destination address from AudioIn2 (low byte) and AudioIn3 (high byte).
#* Copy AudioIn0 to AudioOut0.
#* If AudioIn1 is zero, start execution at the destination address.
# Copy a block:
#* Wait until AudioIn0 is zero.
#* Set a byte-sized counter to zero.
# Copy a byte:
#* Wait while the counter is greater than AudioIn0.
#* If the counter equals AudioIn0:
#** Copy a byte from AudioIn1 to the memory location.
#** Increment the counter and the memory location.
#** Go to Step 4.
#* Otherwise (when the counter is less than AudioIn0), go to Step 2.

A particularly astute and/or paranoid programmer will observe that when the SPC's byte-sized counter rolls over (increments from $ff to $00), it becomes less than the value in AudioIn0, which may cause an error: Unless the SNES updates AudioIn0 in time, the SPC routine may think the block has ended, while the SNES is still sending data.  When this happens, the SNES and SPC may end up waiting for each other in different parts of the protocol, freezing the system ''(this may be incorrect -- see note on discussion page)''.

To prevent a lockup, then, the SNES must update Audio0 as fast as possible.  This means pre-copying the data to the fastest memory available and disabling interrupts whenever using the IPL ROM's protocol.  Alternatively, you could restrict yourself to copying blocks of less than 255 bytes so that the counter never rolls over, or you could install a better communications routine in SPC RAM and use that instead.

== The SNES's communication routine ==

Now that we have examined the protocol from the SPC's side, we need an SNES routine to interface with it.  First, we will examine a routine similar to the one used in open-source demos (and, presumably, actual SNES games).  Then, we will make a slight modification to it that simplifies our code.

Here is the general algorithm used in open-source demos:

# Wait until Audio0 is $aa, signifying that the SPC has completed its initialization.
# Initialize a byte-wide counter to $cc.
# If there are no more blocks to send:
#* Send the 16-bit execution address to Audio2 and Audio3.
#* Send $00 to Audio1.
#* Send the counter to Audio0.
#* Wait until the counter value is echoed on Audio0.
#* End routine.
# Otherwise:
#* Send the 16-bit destination address to Audio2 and Audio3.
#* Send $01 to Audio1.
#* Send the counter to Audio0.
#* Wait until the counter value is echoed on Audio0.
#* Reset the counter to zero.
# If there are bytes left in the current block:
#* Send the current byte to Audio1.
#* Send the counter to Audio0.
#* Wait until the counter value is echoed on Audio0.
#* Move on to the next byte.
#* Increment the counter.
#* Go to step 5.
# Otherwise:
#* Add $03 to the counter.  If the counter is now zero, add $03 again.
#* Move on to the next block.
#* Go to step 3.

(Note: there's nothing magical about the value $03.  We can add almost any value to the counter -- the important thing is that the counter value the SNES sends needs to be greater than the value the SPC expects it to be, which is how the SPC knows the block has ended.)

This routine sends all the blocks at once.  It would be nice, however, if we had a routine that just copied one block so that we could do other things between transferring blocks.  If we tried to modify the above routine to do this, though, we would either need to know the address of the next block ahead of time or we would need to save the terminating byte of the previous block and send it with the next one.  A simple solution to this problem is to send exactly one block, then give the start of the communications routine ($ffc9) as the address at which to begin execution.  This resets the protocol state, so that we do not need to store any information between sending blocks.

=== The communications routine in assembly ===

This section describes in detail our assembly routine to copy a block of memory from SNES RAM to SPC RAM.

First, we need to consider the parameters to our routine.  We will need to pass the source location, the destination location, and the length of the block to copy.  Since there is 64k of SPC RAM, the destination and length will fit in 16-bit variables, so we can pass those in the X and Y registers.  The source memory location, on the other hand, is 24 bits long, since we will be reading from the expanded RAM block from $7f:0000-$7f:ffff.  Thus, we define a location in the zero page where we can store the three bytes of a pointer to our source data:

 .define musicSourceAddr $00fd

While we are at it, we can define the values of the audio ports and CPU flags, so that our code uses recognizable identifiers instead of hex values:

 .define AUDIO_R0 $2140
 .define AUDIO_R1 $2141
 .define AUDIO_R2 $2142
 .define AUDIO_R3 $2143
 
 .define XY_8BIT $10
 .define A_8BIT  $20

While writing the routine, we frequently will be waiting for the SPC to echo back the value we just sent to the Audio0 register.  Rather than write this code repeatedly, we can put it in a macro, and the assembler will make the necessary substitutions:

 .macro waitForAudio0M
 -
     cmp     AUDIO_R0
     bne     -
 .endm

With these initial definitions out of the way, we can write our routine.  Here is the initialization phase, which waits until the SPC is ready to accept data, then sends the destination address.  Note that we can send the two bytes of the destination address with a single 16-bit write to Audio2.

 CopyBlockToSPC:
     ; musicSourceAddr - source address
     ; x - dest address
     ; y - count
 
     ; Wait until audio0 is 0xbbaa
     sep     #A_8BIT
     lda     #$aa
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Send the destination address to AUDIO2.
     stx     AUDIO_R2
 
     ; Transfer count to x.
     phy
     plx
 
     ; Send $01cc to AUDIO0 and wait for echo.
     lda     #$01
     sta     AUDIO_R1
     lda     #$cc
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Zero counter.
     ldy     #$0000

Here is the communication routine's main loop, which sends a byte and waits for the SPC's response, then updates the memory and counter values.  Note that we can swap the high and low bytes of ''a'' with the ''xba'' operation, even though ''a'' is in 8-bit mode at the time.  Again, we use the trick of writing a 16-bit value to send to Audio0 and Audio1 in a single operation.

 CopyBlockToSPC_loop:
     ; Load the high byte of a with the destination byte.
     xba
     lda     [$fd],y
     xba
     
     ; Load the low byte of a with the counter.
     tya
 
     ; Send the counter/byte.
     rep     #A_8BIT
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     sep     #A_8BIT
 
     ; Wait for counter to echo back.
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Update counter and number of bytes left to send.
     iny
     dex
     bne     CopyBlockToSPC_loop

Finally, we end the block and tell the SPC to start execution at the beginning of the SPC's communication routine, resetting the protocol:

     ; Send the start of IPL ROM send routine as starting address.
     ldx     #$ffc9
     stx     AUDIO_R2
     
     ; Clear high byte.
     xba
     lda     #0
     xba
 
     ; Add a value greater than one to the counter to terminate.
     clc
     adc     #$2
 
     ; Send the counter/byte.
     rep     #A_8BIT
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     sep     #A_8BIT
 
     ; Wait for counter to echo back.
     waitForAudio0M
 
     rts

== Sending the SPC state ==

The SPC state consists of three parts:

* The memory
* The DSP registers
* The CPU registers

The hardest thing to restore is the CPU state, since it changes just by executing the SPC communications routine.  Also, restoring the program counter means that the SPC then will be executing the stored code, not the communications routine, so we can't send anything else after we have restored the program counter.  Thus, we need to restore the CPU state last, after we have set up everything else.  Whether we restore the memory or DSP registers first doesn't matter too much, but it will turn out to be convenient to restore the memory first.

=== Sending memory state ===

Earlier we noticed that the SPC communications routine could freeze if the SNES doesn't send data fast enough.  This means that any data we send needs to be stored in RAM; it can't be directly copied to the SPC from its original location in ROM.  Thus, we use the following routine to assemble the two 32k banks of ROM containing the SPC memory state into one 64k segment in SNES RAM:

 CopySPCMemoryToRam:
     ; Copy music data from ROM to RAM, from the end backwards.
     rep   #$XY_8BIT        ; xy in 16-bit mode.
     ldx.w #$7fff           ; Set counter to 32k-1.
 -   lda.l spcMemory1,x     ; Copy byte from first music bank.
     sta.l $7f0000,x
     lda.l spcMemory2,x     ; Copy byte from second music bank.
     sta.l $7f8000,x
     dex
     bpl -
     rts

Now, we can use the macro we wrote earlier to transfer the SPC memory state:

     ; Copy RAM between 0x0002 and 0xffc0.
     sendMusicBlockM $7f $0002 $0002 $ffbe

We do not transfer the first two and last sixty-four bytes of memory because they are used by the communications routine:  the last sixty-four bytes contain the routine itself and the first two bytes are used during the routine to store the destination address.

Most SPCs will not overwrite the communications routine, so we will simply not restore that section of memory.  It is quite possible, on the other hand, that an SPC will use the first two bytes of RAM, since they are in the zero page and easy to access.  Therefore, we will set those bytes when we restore the CPU state, taking care not to overwrite them in the SNES RAM until then.

Note that because we are overwriting the block $f0-$ff, we actually write to a number of memory-mapped registers.  This has the effect of restoring the timer state, as well as one DSP register.  It also manipulates the Audio0-3 ports, but this doesn't seem to interfere with the memory transfer process, probably because the SNES is only listening for a certain value on Audio0.

=== Sending DSP state ===

To set the value of a DSP register, you first need to write its number to address $f2 of the SPC's memory, then you need to write its value to address $f3 of the SPC's memory.  Because these addresses are right next to each other, we can restore a DSP register value by using our memory-copying routine to send a block of two bytes to $f2.  We repeat this process for each of the 128 DSP registers:

 InitDSP:
     rep     #XY_8BIT            ; x and y in 16-bit mode
     ldx     #$0000              ; Reset DSP address counter.
 -
     sep     #A_8BIT
     txa                         ; Write DSP address register byte.
     sta     $7f0100             
     lda.l   dspData,x           ; Write DSP data register byte.
     sta     $7f0101             
     phx                         ; Save x on the stack.
 
     ; Send the address and data bytes to the DSP memory-mapped registers.
     sendMusicBlockM $7f $0100 $00f2 $0002
 
     rep     #XY_8BIT            ; Restore x.
     plx
 
     ; Loop if we haven't done 128 registers yet.
     inx
     cpx     #$0080
     bne     -
     rts

=== Sending SPC initialization routine ===

Our SPC initialization routine restores the parts of the SPC state that would be altered just by running the SPC's communications routine.  We will pass the SPC's control to the initialization routine after we are done copying everything, and the routine, as its final step, will jump to the saved program counter location.  Here are the things our initialization routine needs to do:

* Restore the first two bytes of RAM.
* Restore the stack pointer (S).
* Push the restored PSW register onto the stack.
* Restore the A register.
* Restore the X register.
* Restore the Y register.
* Pop the PSW register value into its register.
* Jump to the saved program counter location.

We'll write the routine starting at (arbitrary) memory location $7f0000.  Since we'll be needing the first two bytes at that location (that we have been careful thus far not to overwrite), we will first save these on the stack.  Since we'll restore the first byte first, we push it last:

 MakeSPCInitCode:
     sep     #A_8BIT
 
     ; Push [01] value to stack.
     lda.l   $7f0001
     pha
 
     ; Push [00] value to stack.
     lda.l   $7f0000
     pha

Next, we write the code to restore the first byte.  Looking up the ''mov dp,#imm'' opcode in an SPC reference, we see that the opcode byte is $8f, so we write that, followed immediately by the first argument byte (imm -- the value to restore), then the second argument byte (dp -- the address to which to write the byte):

     ; Write code to set [00] byte.
     lda     #$8f        ; mov dp,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0000
     pla
     sta.l   $7f0001
     lda     #$00
     sta.l   $7f0002

We do the same thing for the second memory byte:

     ; Write code to set [01] byte.
     lda     #$8f        ; mov dp,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0003
     pla
     sta.l   $7f0004
     lda     #$01
     sta.l   $7f0005

As there is no opcode to write a value to S directly, we first move the stack value into X -- ''mov x, #imm'' ($cd) -- then we move X into the stack register -- ''mov sp, x'' ($bd).

     ; Write code to set s.
     lda     #$cd        ; mov x,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0006
     lda.l   audioSP
     sta.l   $7f0007
     lda     #$bd        ; mov sp,x
     sta.l   $7f0008

Now we write code to push the program status ward (PSW) register value onto the stack, so that we can pop it later.  We need to push the value before we restore the other registers because we overwrite X in the process of pushing the value.  We can't pop the value until after the other registers are restored, since the ''mov'' instruction that we use to restore them changes the PSW register.

     ; Write code to push psw
     lda     #$cd        ; mov x,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0009
     lda.l   audioPSW
     sta.l   $7f000a
     lda     #$4d        ; push x
     sta.l   $7f000b

Here we write the code to restore the registers:

     ; Write code to set a.
     lda     #$e8        ; mov a,#imm
     sta.l   $7f000c
     lda.l   audioA
     sta.l   $7f000d
 
     ; Write code to set x.
     lda     #$cd        ; mov x,#imm
     sta.l   $7f000e
     lda.l   audioX
     sta.l   $7f000f
 
     ; Write code to set y.
     lda     #$8d        ; mov y,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0010
     lda.l   audioY
     sta.l   $7f0011

Writing the code to restore PSW from the stack is fairly straightforward:
     ; Write code to pull psw.
     lda     #$8e        ; pop psw
     sta.l   $7f0012

Finally, we write the code to send control to the saved program counter position:

     ; Write code to jump.
     lda     #$5f        ; jmp labs
     sta.l   $7f0013
     rep     #A_8BIT
     lda.l   audioPC
     sep     #A_8BIT
     sta.l   $7f0014
     xba
     sta.l   $7f0015
     rts

After this routine is called, then, the region $7f0000-$7f0015 contains the initialization routine, so sending it using our communications routine is fairly straightforward.  We must, however, have somewhere in the SPC RAM to put it.  Here, we gamble that the region of memory just before the IPL ROM code is not in use:

 ; The address in SPC RAM where we put our 15-byte startup routine.
 .define spcFreeAddr $ffa0

Calling the routine:

     ; Build code to initialize registers.
     jsr     MakeSPCInitCode
 
     ; Copy init code to some region of SPC memory that we hope isn't in use.
     sendMusicBlockM $7f $0000 spcFreeAddr $0016

= Starting SPC execution =

Now that we have restored the memory and DSP state, and we have written an initialization routine to complete restoration, all we need to do is to tell the SPC to begin execution at our initialization routine.  We do this by modifying our communications routine to send no blocks, but rather immediately start execution at the given address:

 StartSPCExec:
     ; Starting address is in x.
 
     ; Wait until audio0 is 0xbbaa
     sep     #A_8BIT
     lda     #$aa
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Send the destination address to AUDIO2.
     stx     AUDIO_R2
 
     ; Send $00cc to AUDIO0 and wait for echo.
     lda     #$00
     sta     AUDIO_R1
     lda     #$cc
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     waitForAudio0M
 
     rts

At this point, the SPC should start playing the music originally stored in the SPC file.

= Analysis =

This technique is really only good for playing one song on a ROM; after you start playing an SPC file, it is hard to stop it, upload another song, or play a sound effect.  This is because the code in the SPC only understands the communications protocol of the game from which it is captured.  To discover the protocol, you would have to reverse-engineer the code of either the SPC state or the original SNES ROM, and even then there is no guarantee that the protocol would support whatever you wanted to do.  Writing a custom protocol for the audio in a game would be a good subject for a future tutorial.

== Problems ==

There are a number of reasons why the SPC state, restored in the manner described here, would refuse to play:

* The original SPC program used either the IPL ROM area or the area where we stored our initialization code.  If it used the initialization area, we can write the code to another location, and this should allow the SPC to play.  Restoring the IPL ROM region is harder because you need a communications routine somewhere else in SPC memory to allow you to do this.  In either case, we can't get away from the fact that some space in RAM is needed for initialization and will not match the original RAM.

* The state of the SPC when control is passed to the original code does not exactly match the state when it was captured, since the DSP and timers begin updating their values immediately upon restoration.  If the SPC was waiting for some state change, like a timer or DSP value, then it may miss it and lock up.

* It is possible for the SNES to play music entirely by sending values to the SPC in real-time.  For instance, it could modify the DSP registers as we did when we were restoring them, except it would modify them over time so as to produce music, much as other SPC code would.  In this way, the SPC could produce music with the IPL ROM communications routine as the only code in its memory.  Such SPC files would not even play in a player, since they rely on the SNES for information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{World History resources}}

The masters of the Renaissance regarded their era as a golden age, and looked back on the previous age as &quot;dark&quot; by comparison.  Thus it is considered to be the &quot;middle&quot; transitional period between late antiquity and the modern world. It had feudal and manorial systems as socio-economic forms. Feudalism generally describes the relation held between a lord and his vassal. Manorialism placed significant emphasis upon self-sufficiency of manors, the underlying structure of economic establishment.

In addition to new socio-economic forms and models, new agricultural methods also came into existence, including the moldboard plow, which allowed a greater arriation of crops, and the three-field system, a manner in which one-third of available farmland was left fallow (unplated) to reduce the risk of soil erosion or over-usage.

==Early Middle Ages==

===Rise of the Germanic Kingdoms===

Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes became the dominate force in Europe. The greatest of these was the Frankish Empire. The earliest Frankish king was King Clovis (481 - 511). Clovis was known for the Salic Law, which listed out crimes and their various punishments.

The Frankish Empire relied on dukes to defend the borders of the empire and the Mayor of the Palace to run much of the daily business of the Empire. By 640, the Mayor of the Palace was the de facto ruler of the empire. In 751, Mayor of the Palace Pipin was appointed king of the Franks by the Pope.

===Age of Charlemagne===

Pepin's son, Charlemagne, was the greatest of the Frankish kings. He expanded the Frankish empire to northern Italy and Spain as well as to parts of Germany. In 800, the Pope appointed Charlemagne Holy Roman Emperor in return for some help putting down a riot in Rome. Charlemagne also took an interest in art and education, opening a palace school at Aix-la-Chapelle.

Another important advancement made by Charlemagne was in the area of justice. At the time, conpurgation was the common practice. In conpurgation, a group of witnesses would gather to swear a defendant's innocence. If that wasn't sufficient, trial by fire, water, or combat was employed. Charlemagne set up a board of judges to listen to testimony and decide the verdict.

Charlemagne's empire didn't last long after he died. His son, Louis the Pious, lost land to Muslims in the south, Vikings in the north, and Slavs to the east. When Louis died in 840, his three sons battled for the throne. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the empire between them. Lothar received the Rhine river valley and the Frankish holdings in the Alps and Italy. The other brothers received the land to the east and west. By 870, the holdings were simply East and West Frankland.

===Viking Raiders===

The Vikings (also known as Norse or Northmen) were Germanic Scandinavian seafarers who raided and settled many regions of Northern Europe during the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries.  Norse settlers founded communities and maintained important trade routes all the way from Greenland east to the heart of Russia, and developed a fearsome reputation as warriors and plunderers.  Their descendants played crucial roles in the later history of France, England, Ireland and the Russian principalities, and they were the first Europeans to visit and settle in North America.

Denmark and Scandinavia had lain well outside the borders of the Roman Empire.  By the end of the eighth century, the region contained many small tribal kingdoms.  Farming and fishing comprised most of the economy. Growing populations and limited fertile land were probably the cause of a Norse movement to find new homes across the sea.  The first major Viking raid was recorded in 793 when raiders sacked the wealthy monastery at Lindisfarne on the Yorkshire coast.  As the 9th century wore on, Francia and Anglo-Saxon England came under yearly attack by Vikings whose swift ships appeared without warning off the coast, landing warriors whose skill and ruthlessness prompted the prayer, &quot;from the fury of the Northmen, protect us, o lord.&quot;  

By the 860s Danish Vikings had implanted themselves to stay in northeast England.  After a series of wars against the Anglo-Saxon kings, the two sides agreed to a truce where the country was divided and the &quot;Danelaw&quot; area of Viking control recognized, if not formally ceded.  The 10th century saw similar developments in Francia; there the Norse settlement -- ''Normandie'' -- was on the Channel coast between Le Havre and the Cotentin Peninsula.  

==Feudalism in Europe==

Each lord had, more or less, complete control over his lands. However, weaker lords would become vassals of the stronger lords. A lord would protect his vassal. In return vassals were expected to supply soldiers in time of war and serve his lord in times of peace.

===Medieval Society===

When people think of the Middle Ages, the knight is one of the first things that come to mind. Most noblemen became knights. The path to knighthood began by serving a knight as a page. Pages had to learn to battle, ride a horse, be polite to ladies, sing, dance, and play chess. Once he learned to do this, he became knighted by another knight and blessed by a priest. Knights did not do common work. When they weren't fighting, they often hunted.

Medieval ladies were expected to run their house and tend to the ill. In their leisure time, they enjoyed falconry, chess, checkers, and dice. They were also very interested in fashion.

Besides what has been mentioned above, entertainment mostly consisted of banquets. The feasts were elaborate and lasted hours at a time. After everyone had eaten, jesters or minstrels would entertain the guests.

=== The Manor System ===
The manor or estate system refers to life on a manor, it could be said that it was the logical evolution of the continuing fractioning of land rights and government, something that was already common, even if under a somewhat distinct system, for instance the [[w:Roman villa|Roman villa]].

Each manor had a lord who ruled over it, by hereditary rights, concession or payment. The people who worked on the manor were serfs. Serfs were responsible for tending the lord's fields as well as doing maintenance on the manor's buildings, they were bound to the land, forced to work there for their entire lives. Unlike slaves, serfs could not be bought or sold individually, they had freedom of movement but due to having no land of their own (and at time no right to acquire it) or any other means of surviving independently, they were forced into servitude. 

The manor system quickly became common during the Middle Ages, but the system adapted to changes in legal rule and society, thought the European expansion to the Colonial age, the United States of America plantations and to the large landowner in Brazil, the system has survived in some form or other until today.

==The Church in Medieval Life==

===Monasteries and Convents===

Monasticism became quite popular in the Middle Ages, with religion being the most important force in Europe. Monks and nuns were to live isolated from the world to become closer to God. Monks provided service to the church by copying manuscripts, creating art, educating people, and working as missionaries. Convents were especially appealing to women. It was the only place they would receive any sort of education or power. It also let them escape an unwanted marriage.

During the rule of Pope Innocent III (1198 - 1216), the two most famous monastic orders were founded. They were called the medicant, or begging, orders because they begged for the food and clothes. They would usually travel in pairs; preaching, healing the sick, and helping the poor. Francis of Assisi founded the Franciscans, who were known for their charitable work. The Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic, focused on teaching, preaching, and suppressing heresy.

===Papal Supremacy===

The Pope, through the church, was as powerful as any nation and more powerful than most. The church taught that the only way to get to Heaven was through the sacraments that the Catholic church provided. The sacraments had to be paid for, which accounted for part of the church's vast wealth. Other reasons were that everyone paid the church ten percent of their income and no one taxed church property.

One dramatic example of the Pope's power was the Investiture Controversy. In 1076, Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV attempted to take the power to give a bishop the symbols of his office. Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Henry. Henry begged for forgiveness for three days and was forced to accept Gregory's terms.

The ultimate display of power by the medieval papacy was the crusades. From 1096 to 1272, no less than twelve crusades took place. Any man who participated was promised forgiveness for any sins committed before or during the crusade. As a mission to put Jerusalem under Christian control, the crusades were a failure. Jerusalem was in Christian control for less than 50 years. However, the crusades put the people of Europe in contact with the Muslim world. They were exposed to new ideas and developed a taste for new products. In this capacity, something good came from the crusades.

[[Image:CookbookPlacentaBroccoli.jpg|right|thumb|192px]]
This is a tasty dish that the whole family will love. It might go well served with rice, especially if the rice is loose and firm.

You'll need about 1/2 the placenta of a 6.2 pound baby, or 1/3 the placenta of a 9.3 pound baby. Chopped and packed, this is just a bit more than 1/3 cup. (but like any raw meat, you don't exactly chop it &amp;mdash; try sniping away at it with a kitchen scissors)

==Ingredients==
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] chopped fresh human [[Cookbook:Placenta|placenta]]
*2/3 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] whites
*1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]

==Procedure==
#Wash the placenta well, in a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], then shake it to drain. (it will still leak juices)
#Stir the egg whites with a fork until they are without lumps.
#Mix all ingredients well, squishing them by hand.
#Add a decent amount of oil to a suitable frying pan.
#Set a burner to high heat, and put the pan on it.
#Start frying, stirring as if stir-frying or scrambling an egg.
#The small amount of liquid (seeping from the placenta, plus the egg whites) will come to a boil. You might turn down the heat slightly at this point.
#Let the liquid boil away and/or solidify onto the broccoli and placenta.
#When it looks yummy, serve it.

==Warning==
As with any meat from uncontrolled sources (such as hunting or scavenging) people should be cautious of risks involved. Certain blood borne diseases can live in blood and tissue outside the body for some time. Be sure that sensible precautions have been taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">how do the notes in harmonics on frets 5,7, and 12 get lower sounds, yet theyare going up the neck, which usually has a higher sound?
:When you pluck a guitar string it oscillates, but not as a pure, single-frequency sine wave (as the picture might lead you to believe).  Rather, we get the fundamental, plus all its harmonics (i.e., double frequency, triple frequency, quadruple frequency, etc).  I hope this doesn't cause confusion, but in physics, the word harmonic is used to indicate the relationship between frequencies.  So when I say &quot;harmonic&quot; here, I'm not talking about the technique described on this page, but rather, I'm talking about frequencies.  

:Back to plucking an open string.  Suppose we pluck the A string.  If the guitar is tuned so that A is 440 Hz, plucking the A string will generate 440Hz, 880Hz, 1320Hz, 1760 Hz, etc.  Each of these are the harmonics of 440 Hz (i.e., 1x440, 2x440, 3x440, 4x440, etc).  Each frequency will be at a different loudness though (generally each harmonic is a bit quieter than the one that came before).  This combination of frequencies is what gives any instrument its tone.

:Now suppose you touch the string over the 12th fret and pluck it.  None of the odd-numbered harmonics can be made.  It knocks out the 440 and 1320Hz components, because the &quot;touched&quot; portion of the string has to move for these sounds to be created, only it can't because your finger was in the way and dampened it out.  However, the even harmonics can still be made, because the center of the string doesn't need to move to make those frequencies.  Said differently, you will cancel out all the harmonics that are not a multiple of two.  It might help to look at the picture again:
[[File:Guitar Open String and 12th Fret Harmonic Oscillation.png|thumb|400px|right]]
:See how the middle of the string isn't moving in the lower picture?  When you move to a different fret, you will cancel a different set of harmonics.  If you touch the string one third of the way from the nut to the bridge, it's exactly the same as if you touch the string one third of the way from the bridge to the nut.  In either case you will cancel out the fundamental plus all the harmonics that are not divisible by three.  Touch it a quarter of the way to the nut or the tail, and you cancel out all the harmonics that are not multiples of 4.  Since there are fewer harmonics that are divisible by 4 than there are that are divisible by two, touching the string there will be quieter (you've dampened out more of the harmonics).  

:If you touch the string at a distance one fifth from the nut (or two fifths, or three fifths, or four fifths), you cancel everything that is not a multiple of five.

:Sorry for the bad explanation.  Maybe someone else can explain it better. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:33, 25 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

&quot;Ala ma - this sounds least natural. There is a tendency in Polish to drop the subject rather than the object and rarely you know the object but not the subject. If the question was &quot;Kto ma kota ?&quot; (who has a cat ?), the answer should be &quot;Ala&quot; alone, without a verb.&quot;

I do not agree with this opinion. For question &quot;kto ma kota?&quot; (who has a cat) you can answer &quot;Ala&quot; as well as &quot;Ala ma&quot;. Both answers are correct. How do I know that? I am Polish.

'''Introduction:'''
'''Prasadam'''
Krishna consciousness is sometimes called the 'kitchen religion'. Since the movement's founder, Srila Prabhupada, first cooked for his young disciples in New York, the movement has gone on to become famous for its delicious, pure vegetarian food.

In Vaisnavism, food is more than just food; it is prasadam, the Lord's mercy. In keeping with the philosophy of offering everything to God, Krishna, devotees offer everything they eat before they eat it. In this way the food is considered sanctified.

'''What kind of food?'''
Vaisnavas follow a strict vegetarian diet; no meat, fish or eggs. Onions, garlic, and mushrooms are also avoided due to their adverse effects on the consciousness of the eater.


'''How do we offer our food?'''
The most important ingredient in any offering is the devotion of the cook and of the person doing the offering (this may of course be the same person). It is also important that the persons offering the food are in good consciousness. This is helped by such considerations as making sure the kitchen is clean, the ingredients are pure, and that the cook is wearing clean clothes. It also helps to have peaceful music or chanting going on during the preparation of the meal. As the idea is that we are cooking for Krishna it is very important that no-one else tastes the preparation before it is offered.

A simple offering can be made by placing the food on a plate (preferably one that is only used for this purpose) in front of a picture of Krishna and chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra a few times while asking Krishna to please accept this humble offering.

A slightly more elaborate offering can be made by chanting each of the following prayers three times while ringing a small bell.
Prayer to Srila Prabhupada, (or your own guru)

nama om visnu-padaya krsna-presthaya bhu-tale
srimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine
namas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine
nirvisesa-sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine
Prayer to Lord Caitanya

namo maha-vadanyaya
krishna-prema-pradaya te
krishnaya krishna-chaitanya-
namne gaura-tvishe namaha
Prayer to Lord Krishna

namo brahmanya-devaya
go-brahmana-hitaya ca
jagad-dhitaya krsnaya
govindaya namo namah
Chant Maha Mantra

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare

But remember, the most important part of a successful offering is the devotion!

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. 
CC Adi 7.4, Purport: As preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting this Pañca-tattva mantra; then we say Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañca-tattva mantra, namely, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahā-mantra (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare), we must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Pañca-tattva mahā-mantra, and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. That will be very effective.</text>

== Set Questions / Examples ==

In all the high school physics \ mathematics we should add examples questions and such like.. 
when i have time i will try and add some.

== Making This Article More Like A Text Book  ==
yes, the standard abbreviation for hour is ''h'', it should be edited.

and by the way, this article in form and template is much similar to the articles of wikipedia. indeed the opening paragraph of this article is a verbatim copy of wikipedia article on kinematics. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics see for yourself.] We need lots of drawing and diagrams and much talk and talk and talk to make it more like an elementary physics text.

=Measuring Instruments=
==Ammeters==
Ammeters are devices that measure current. Current in electronics is usually measured in mA which are called milliamperes, which are 1/1000s of an ampere.&lt;br/&gt;..... Basically an ammeter consists of a coil that can rotate inside a magnet, but a spring is trying to push the coil back to zero. The larger the current that flows through the coil, the larger the angle of rotation, the torque (= a rotary force) created by the current being counteracted by the return torque of the spring.&lt;br/&gt;..... Usually ammeters are connected in parallel with various switched resistors that can extend the range of currents that can be measured. Assume, for example, that the basic ammeter is &quot;1000 ohms per volt&quot;, which means that to get the full-scale deflection of the pointer a current of 1 mA is needed (1 volt divided by 1000 ohms is 1 mA - see &quot;Ohm's Law&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;..... To use that ammeter to read 10 mA full-scale it is ''shunted'' with another resistance, so that when 10 mA flows, 9 mA will flow through the shunt, and only 1 mA will flow through the meter. Similarly, to extend the range of the ammeter to 100 mA the shunt will carry 99 mA, and the meter only 1 mA.

==Ohmmeters==
Ohmmeters are basically ammeters that are ''connected to an internal battery, with a suitable resistance in series''. Assume that the basic ammeter is &quot;1000 ohms per volt&quot;, meaning that 1 mA is needed for full-scale deflection. When the external resistance that is connected to its terminals is zero (the leads are connected together at first for calibration), then the internal, variable, resistor in series with the ammeter is adjusted so that 1 mA will flow; that will depend on the voltage of the battery, and as the battery runs down that setting will change. The full scale point is marked as zero resistance. If an external resistance is then connected to the terminals that causes only half of the current to flow (0.5 mA in this example), then the external resistance will equal the internal resistance, and the scale is marked accordingly. When no current flows, the scale will read infinity resistance. The scale of an ohmmeter is NOT linear.Ohmmeters are usually useful in checking the short circuit and open circuit in boards.

==Multimeters==
[[Image:Multimeter.jpg|thumb|A digital multimeter]] 
Multimeters contain Ohmeters, Voltmeters, Ammeters and a variety of capabilities to measure other quantities.  AC and DC voltages are most often measurable.  Frequency of AC voltages.  Multimeters also feature a continuity detector, basically an Ohmmeter with a beeper if the multimeter sees less than 100&amp;nbsp;Ω then it beeps otherwise it is silent.  This is very useful for finding whether components are connected when debugging or testing circuits.  Multimeters are also often able to measure capacitance and inductance.  This may be achieved using a Wien bridge.  A diode tester is also generally onboard, this allows one to determine the anode and cathode of an unknown diode.  A LCD display is also provided for easily reading of results.

=Electronics Laboratory Instruments=

==Oscilloscope==
The instrument is used to view AC waveforms.  For better explanation of the oscilloscope.

==Spectrum Analyzer==

==Signal Generator==
This instrument is used to generate low voltage AC signals.  Most common signal generators can create sinusoidal(sine), triangular and square waves of various frequencies.  They are used in conjunction with the oscilloscope to test analogue circuits.

==Logic Probe==
This instrument generates high and low logic states to test digital circuits. If a logic probe is not available a square wave through a signal generator can be used.  Square waves can also be used to test the response time of a digital circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Free monoid spanned by a set==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space and &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; be a basis of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Given any vector space &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and any elements &lt;math&gt;w_1,\ldots,w_n \in W&lt;/math&gt;, there is a linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\varphi : V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}, \, \varphi(v_i) = w_i&lt;/math&gt;. One could say that this happens because the elements &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; of a basis are not &quot;related&quot; to each other (formally, they are linearly independent). Indeed, if, for example, we had the relation &lt;math&gt;v_1 = \lambda v_2&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (and then &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; wasn't linearly independent), then the linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; could not exist.

Let us consider a similar problem with groups: given a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; spanned by a set &lt;math&gt;X = \{x_i : i \in I\} \subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; and given any group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and any set &lt;math&gt;Y = \{y_i : i \in I\} \subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;, does there always exist a group morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi : G \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall i \in I, \, \varphi(x_i) = y_i&lt;/math&gt;? The answer is no. For example, consider the group &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which is spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;X = \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the group &lt;math&gt;H = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with the adition operation) and the set &lt;math&gt;Y = \{2\}&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists a group morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi : \mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = 2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n2 = n \varphi(1) = \varphi(n \, 1) = \varphi(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is impossible. But if instead we had choose &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, then such a group morphism does exist and it would be given by &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = 2t&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, given any group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;y \in H&lt;/math&gt;, we have the group morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = y^t&lt;/math&gt; (in multiplicative notation) that verifies &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = y&lt;/math&gt;. In a way, we can think that this happens because the elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X = \{1\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (that spans &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) don't verify relations like &lt;math&gt;nx = 1&lt;/math&gt; (like &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;) or &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt;. So, it seems that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a group more &quot;free&quot; that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Our goal in this section will be, given a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, build a group spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that it will be the most &quot;free&quot; possible, in the sense that it doesn't have to obey relations like &lt;math&gt;x^n = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt;. To do so, we begin by constructing a &quot;free&quot; monoid (in the same sense). Informally, this monoid will be the monoid of the words written with the letters of the alphabet &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, where the identity will be the word with no letters (the &quot;empty word&quot;), and the binary operation of the monoid will be concatenation of words. The notation &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; that we will use for the element of this monoid meets this idea that the elements of this monoid are the words &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are letters of the alphabet &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Here is the definition of this monoid.

'''Definition'''  ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set.''
# ''We denote the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_i \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''We denote &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''We denote by &lt;math&gt;FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{x_1 \ldots x_n : n \in \mathbb{N}, x_i \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''We define in &lt;math&gt;FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; the concatenation operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x_1\ldots x_m * y_1\ldots y_n = x_1\ldots x_m y_1\ldots y_n&lt;/math&gt;.''

Next we prove that this monoid is indeed a monoid. It's an easy to prove result, we need to show associativity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;1*x=x*1=x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proposition''' ''&lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid with identity &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Proof''' The operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is associative because, given any &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_m,y_1 \ldots y_n,z_1 \ldots z_p \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(x_1 \ldots x_m * y_1 \ldots y_n) * z_1 \ldots z_m&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m y_1 \ldots y_n * z_1 \ldots z_m&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m y_1 \ldots y_n z_1 \ldots z_m&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m * (y_1 \ldots y_n z_1 \ldots z_m)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m ( y_1 \ldots y_n * z_1 \ldots z_m)&lt;/math&gt;.

It's obvious that &lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt; has the identity &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;1 * x_1 \ldots x_n = x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; by the definition of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Following the idea that the monoid &lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt; is the most &quot;free&quot; monoid spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we will call it the free monoid spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We denote the free monoid spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Examples'''
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;FM(X) = \{1,x,xx,xxx,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and, for example, &lt;math&gt;xx * xxx = xxxxx&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x,y,z\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;1,x,y,z,xxx,yxz,xyzzz \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; and, for example, &lt;math&gt;xxx * yxz = xxxyxz&lt;/math&gt;.

==Free group spanned by a set==

Now let us construct the more &quot;free&quot; group spanned by a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, what we will do is insert in the monoid &lt;math&gt;FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; the inverse elements that are missing in it for it to be a group. In a more precise way, we will have a set &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; equipotent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, choose a bijection from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; and in this way achieve a &quot;association&quot; between the elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the elements of &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt;. Then we face &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in X&lt;/math&gt;) as having the inverse element &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1},\ldots,\overline{x_n} \in X&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in X&lt;/math&gt; is is associated with &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1} \ldots \overline{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Let us note that the order of the elements in &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;reversed&quot; because the inverse of the product &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n = x_1 * \cdots * x_n&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;x_n^{-1} * \cdots * x_1^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;x_1^{-1},\ldots,x_n^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1},\ldots,\overline{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;. The way we do that &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; be the inverse of &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; is to take a congruence relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that identifies &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and pass to the quotient &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt; by this relation (defining then, in a natural way, the binary operation of the group, &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u * v]_R&lt;/math&gt;). By taking the quotient, we are formalizing the intuitive idea of identifying &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, because in the quotient we have the equality &lt;math&gt;[x_1 \ldots x_n \overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;. Let us give the formal definition.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. Let us take another set &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; equipotent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and disjoint from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow \overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a bijective application.''
# ''For each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; let us denote &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;, for each &lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; let us denote &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and for each &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \in FM(X \cup \overline{X})&lt;/math&gt; let us denote &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1 \ldots x_n}&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be the congruence relation of &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \overline{X})&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;G = \{(u * \bar u,1) : u \in X \cup \overline{X}\}&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of all the congruence relations in &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \overline{X})&lt;/math&gt; wich have &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as a subset. We denote the quotient set &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \overline{X})/R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;.''


Frequently, abusing the notation, we represent an element &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; simply by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the operation &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u * v]_R&lt;/math&gt; that we want to define in &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)/R&lt;/math&gt; is defined using particular represententes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[u]_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[v]_R&lt;/math&gt;, a first precaution is to verify that the definition does not depend on the chosen representatives. It's an easy verification.


'''Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. It is well defined in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u_r * v_r]_R&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the congruence relation of the previous definition).''

'''Proof''' Let &lt;math&gt;u,u',v,v' \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any elements such that &lt;math&gt;[u]_R = [u']_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[v]_R = [v']_R&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;uRu'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;vRv'&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence relation in &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;u*vRu'*v'&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;[u*v]_R = [u'*v']_R&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


Because the definition is valid, we present it.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We define in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u_r * v_r]_R&lt;/math&gt;.''


Finally, we verify that the group that we constructed is indeed a group.


'''Proposition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is a group with identity &lt;math&gt;[1]_R&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;\forall [u]_R \in FG(X), \, {[u]_R}^{-1} = [\bar u]_R&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Proof'''
# &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is associative because &lt;math&gt;\forall [u]_R,[v]_R,[w]_R \in FG(X), \, ([u]_R \star [v]_R) \star [w]_R = ([u * v]_R) \star [w]_R = [([u]_R * [v]_R) * w]_R =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;[u * (v * w)]_R = [u]_R \star [v * w]_R = [u]_R \star ([v]_R \star [w]_R).&lt;/math&gt;
# Let us see that &lt;math&gt;[1]_R&lt;/math&gt; is the identity &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any element. We have &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [1]_R = [u * 1]_R = [u]_R&lt;/math&gt; and, in the same way, &lt;math&gt;[1]_R \star [u]_R = [u]_R&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any element and let us see that &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [\bar u]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [\bar u]_R = [u * \bar u]_R&lt;/math&gt; and, by definition of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u * \bar u R 1&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;[u * \bar u]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [\bar u]_R  = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt; and, in the same way, &lt;math&gt;[\bar u]_R \star [u]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


In the same way that we did with the free monoid, we will call free group spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the more &quot;free&quot; group spanned by this set.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We call free group spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt;.''


'''Example''' Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us choose any set &lt;math&gt;\bar X = \{y\}&lt;/math&gt; disjoint (and equipotent) of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow \bar X&lt;/math&gt; be any (in fact, the only) bijective application of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt;. Then we denote &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and we denote &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar y&lt;/math&gt;. We regard &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as inverse elements. Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be the congruence relation of &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;G = \{(1,1),(x \bar x,1),(xx \bar x \bar x,1),\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;FG(X) = FM(\{x,\bar x\})/R&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &quot;words&quot; written in the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{[x]_R,[\bar x]_R\}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;[1]_R,[x]_R,[\bar x]_R, [xx\bar x xx]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

We have &lt;math&gt;G \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; and, for example, &lt;math&gt;(xx \bar x,1) \in R&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;(x\bar x,1) \in G \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; (therefore &lt;math&gt;x \bar x R 1&lt;/math&gt;) and because &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence relation, we can &quot;multiply&quot; both &quot;members&quot; of the relation &lt;math&gt;x \bar x R 1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and obtain &lt;math&gt;xx \bar x R x&lt;/math&gt;. We see &lt;math&gt;x \bar x R 1&lt;/math&gt; as meaning that in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; We have &lt;math&gt;xx \bar x = x&lt;/math&gt; (more precisely, &lt;math&gt;[xx \bar x]_R = [x]_R&lt;/math&gt;), and we think in this equality as being the result of one &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &quot;cut out&quot; with &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;xx \bar x&lt;/math&gt;.

Given &lt;math&gt;u \in FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt;, let us denote the exact number of times that the &quot;letter&quot; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; appears in &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|u|_x&lt;/math&gt; and let us denote the exact number of times the &quot;letter&quot; &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; appears in &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|u|_\bar x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &quot;cutting&quot; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'s with &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;'s it remains a reduced word word with &lt;math&gt;|u|_x - |u|_\bar x&lt;/math&gt; times the letter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;|u|_x - |u|_\bar x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let us us consider that there aren't any letters &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and remains &lt;math&gt;-(|u|_x - |u|_\bar x)&lt;/math&gt; times the letter &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;). Let us denote &lt;math&gt;|u|_x - |u|_\bar x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt;. We have
# &lt;math&gt;[u]_R = [v]_R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x} = |v|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt;\forall [u]_R,[v]_R \in FG(X), \, |uv|_{x - \bar x} = |u|_{x - \bar x} + |v|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt;.
In this way, each element &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the integer number &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt; and the product &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; of two elements &lt;math&gt;[u]_R,[v]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; correspondent to the sum of they associated integers numbers &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|v|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, it seems that the group &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;similar&quot; to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+)&lt;/math&gt;. indeed &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorph to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+)&lt;/math&gt; and the application &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|_{x - \bar x} : FG(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a group isomorphism.


==Presentation of a group==

Informally, it seems that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the  &quot;free&quot; group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; imposing the relation &lt;math&gt;nx = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Let us try formalize this idea. We start with a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that spans a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that que want to create and a set of relations &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (such as &lt;math&gt;x^n = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;xy = yz&lt;/math&gt;) that the elements of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; must verify and we obtain a group &lt;math&gt;G/R&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and that verify the relations of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, we write each relation &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt; in the form &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt; (for example, &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt; is written in the form &lt;math&gt;xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;) and we see each &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as a &quot;word&quot; of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have to be a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we can not consider the quotient &lt;math&gt;FG(X)/R&lt;/math&gt;, so we consider the quotient &lt;math&gt;FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt;, we will have &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1}N = 1N&lt;/math&gt;, which we see as meaning that in &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; the elements &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; are the same. In this way, &lt;math&gt;FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt; will verify all the relations that we want and will be spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (more precisely, by  &lt;math&gt;\{xN : x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;). Let us formalize this idea.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. We call presentation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and denote by &lt;math&gt;&lt; X:R &gt;&lt;/math&gt;, to a ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(X,R)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a set, &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G \simeq FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Given a presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:R&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, we call spanning set to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and set of relations to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.''


Let us see some examples of presentations of the free group &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; and the groups &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m \oplus \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;. We also use the examples to present some common notation and to show that a presentation of a group does not need to be unique.


'''Examples'''
# Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:{\emptyset}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;FG(X) \simeq FG(X)/\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x\}:\emptyset &gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+) \simeq FG(\{x\})&lt;/math&gt;, more commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x:\emptyset&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. Another presentation of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x,y\}:\{xy^{-1}\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, more commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y:xy^{-1}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, in the presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y:xy^{-1}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; we insert a new element &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the spanning set, but we impose the relation &lt;math&gt;xy^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as having not introduced the element &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and have stayed by the presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;x:\emptyset&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:\{x^n\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x^n = x \star \cdots \star x \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times) is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;\{x^n\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;N = \{\ldots,\bar{x}^{2n},\bar{x}^n,1,x^n,x^{2n},\ldots\} \simeq n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;FG(X) \simeq \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \simeq FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt;. Is more common to denote &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x\} : \{x^n\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x : x^n&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; distinct) and &lt;math&gt;R = \{xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:R&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, what we do is impose comutatibility in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, obtaining a group isomorph to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It's more usually denote &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x,y\} : \{xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y : xyx^{-1}y^{-1}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R = \{xyx^{-1}y^{-1},x^m,y^n\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X,R&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, what we do is impose comutability in the same way as in the previous example, and we impose &lt;math&gt;x^m = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^n = 1&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; instead &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It's more common denote&lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x,y\}:\{xyx^{-1}y^{-1},x^m,y^n\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y:xyx^{-1}y^{-1},x^m,y^n&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{a,b,c\}:\{aa,bb,cc,abac,cbab\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, more commonly written &lt;math&gt;&lt;a,b,c:a^2,b^2,c^2,abac,cbab&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, the group of the permutations of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; with the composition of applications. To verify this, one can verify that any group with presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;a,b,c:a^2,b^2,c^2,abac,cbab&gt;&lt;/math&gt; as exactly six elements &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ac&lt;/math&gt;, and that the multiplication of this elements results in the following Cayley table that is equal to the Cayley table of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;. Just to give an idea how this can be achived, a group with presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;a,b,c:a^2,b^2,c^2,abac,cbab&gt;&lt;/math&gt; as exactly the elements &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ac&lt;/math&gt; because none of this elements are the same (the relations &lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = abac = cbab = 1&lt;/math&gt; don't allow us to conclude that two of the elements are equal) and because &quot;another&quot; elements like &lt;math&gt;bc&lt;/math&gt; are actually one of the previous elements (for example, from &lt;math&gt;cbab = id&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;cb = ab&lt;/math&gt;, and taking inverses of both members, we have &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}c^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which, using &lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = id&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;a = a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, results in &lt;math&gt;bc = ba&lt;/math&gt;). Then, using the relations of the presentation, one can compute the Cayley table. For example, &lt;math&gt;a (ab) = b&lt;/math&gt; because we have the relation &lt;math&gt;a^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Another example: we have &lt;math&gt;b(ac) = a&lt;/math&gt; because we can multiply both members of the relation &lt;math&gt;abac = id&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and then use &lt;math&gt;a^2 = id&lt;/math&gt;. One could have suspected of this presentation by taking &lt;math&gt;a = (1 \ 2)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = (1 \ 3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = (2 \ 3)&lt;/math&gt; and then, trying to construct the Cayley table of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, found out that it was possible if one know that &lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = abac = cbab = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

It's natural to ask if all groups have a presentation. The following theorem tell us that the answer is yes, and it give us a presentation.


'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;(G,\times)&lt;/math&gt; be a group.''
# ''The application &lt;math&gt;\varphi : FG(G) \rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\varphi([x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_n]_R) = x_1 \times \cdots \times x_n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in G&lt;/math&gt;) is an epimorphism of groups.''
# ''&lt;math&gt;&lt;G:\textrm{ker} \, \varphi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;(G,\times)&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Proof'''
# &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is well defined because every element of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; as a unique representations in the form &lt;math&gt;[x_n] \star \cdots [x_n]_R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in G&lt;/math&gt;, with the exception of &lt;math&gt;[1]_R&lt;/math&gt; appears several times in the representation, but that doesn't affect the value of &lt;math&gt;x_1 \times \cdots \times x_n&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;[x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_m]_R,[y_1]_R \star \cdots \star [y_n]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any elements, where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_m,y_1,\ldots,y_n \in G&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;\varphi(([x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_m]_R) \star ([y_1]_R \star \cdots \star [y_n]_R)) = (x_1 \times \cdots \times x_m) \times (y_1 \times \cdots \times y_n) =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varphi([x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_m]_R) \times \varphi([y_1]_R \star \cdots \star [y_n]_R)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism of groups. Because &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in G, \, \varphi ([x]_R) = x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a epimorphism of groups.
# Using the first isomorphism theorem (for groups), we have &lt;math&gt;FG(G)/\textrm{ker} \, \varphi \simeq \varphi(G) = G&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;&lt;G:\textrm{ker} \, \varphi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;(G,\times)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


The previous theorem, despite giving us a presentations of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, doesn't give us a &quot;good&quot; presentation, because the spanning set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is usually much larger that other spanning sets, and the set of relations &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ker} \, \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is also usually much larger then other sufficient sets of relations (it is even a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(G)&lt;/math&gt;, when it would be enough that it span an appropriated normal subgroup).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the &quot;emulated&quot;/&quot;actual&quot; console categories are kind of silly, in that all are &quot;actual&quot; consoles, and all will probably be emulated at some point, and in fact emulators already exist for the Playstation, Game Cube, and Dreamcast.  Maybe a chronological/alphabetical list would be better?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INKEY$==
Getting real time information from the user is a little more difficult.  To do so, we will use the INKEY$ command, which checks to see if a user typed a key and provides the keypress to the program.  

Look at this code and then we will look at it in depth:

  DO
    LET k$ = INKEY$
  LOOP UNTIL k$ &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
  SELECT CASE k$
    CASE &quot;q&quot;
      QuitProgram
    CASE &quot;c&quot;
      MakeCircle
    CASE &quot;s&quot;
      MakeSquare
  END SELECT

The first part is the DO-LOOP which constantly polls INKEY$ for a return value.  In the basic use, INKEY$ returns an empty string if no keys are being pressed and continues with the program.  Once a key is pressed, INKEY$ will return that key immediately.   

== The keyboard buffer == 

What is INKEY$ doing and how does it work?

While the INKEY$ command looks like it returns the key currently being pressed, this is not the case. It is used by the program to answer the question, &quot;What is IN the KEYboard buffer?&quot;   To understand this you will need to understand what a basic buffer is and why it is used.

In older systems (not necessarily the IBM PC) a single chip processed keyboard input, and controlled the LED lights for caps lock and number lock.  Because a computer does many things at once (e.g., take input from the mouse, crunch numbers, call subroutines, display new information on the screen), it needs to be able to remember what was pressed on the keyboard while it is busy.  This chip contained some memory (called a buffer) that allow keeping track of a limited number of keypresses. 

Within the Dos platform under IBM PCs, the hardware has changed slightly.  Instead of a hardware buffer, pressing or releasing a key will interrupt the running program to add a keystroke to a software buffer located in the BIOS.  This procedure is usually unnoticed by the user and has minimal impact on system performance.  However, this buffer allows for 15 characters - attempting to overflow it when the computer is busy will cause a short beep and drop any further characters. 

The INKEY$ command uses this buffer as a FIFO (First In First Out) buffer.  As an example let's say you have a game that has a bouncing ball on the screen and a paddle at the bottom.  The computer program constantly has to update the screen to show the movement of the ball.  While it does this the program passes by an INKEY$ command to see what value is returned.  If the user has pressed a key since the last time the command was invoked it will return that key.   Let's say the ball is moving over to the right and the user needs to press the &quot;R&quot; key to tell the program to move the paddle right.  Since the program is busy moving the ball and updating the screen, it does not instantaneously notice that the user has pressed the key.  Instead, the key press is stored in the keyboard buffer, and retrieved a few milliseconds (or microseconds) later when the INKEY$ command is used.  

In many programs (as above), INKEY$ will appear nested in a loop.   It is requested over and over again.    This allows the program to get user input one character at a time.   Using our example above, the user may need to press R over and over again until the paddle is under the ball.  On the other hand, the user may press R too many times and need to press L to move it left.   Because the INKEY$ command is using a FIFO buffer it will always retrieve the keys pressed in the same order as they where typed.

In summary, the INKEY$ command will always return and remove the first character in the keyboard buffer.   Generally speaking, it is used over and over to retrieve every key that has been pressed, and to allow a user to interact with a program in a close approximation to &quot;real time.&quot;  If there is no key in the keyboard buffer, INKEY$ it will return an empty string (no character).

== Scancodes ==
Some keypresses are not associated with an ASCII character.  When one of these keys is pressed, INKEY$ returns a string with two characters = the first character is a null (ASCII code 0), and the second is the raw scan code for the keyboard.  A full listing of the scancodes can be found within the QBASIC help file - you can also determine the scan codes by examining the results of INKEY$ as you press those keys in question.

{{NOTE|Some keys cannot be directly detected by INKEY$.}}

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
== Dialogue 3==
'''Ricardo''': Olá! Como vai? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Bem, obrigado. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Bem. O que vai fazer no sábado? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Eu vou passear com a minha mãe. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Vou ao cinema. &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Não gosta de nadar? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Não, eu e a minha esposa não gostamos de nadar. &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Eu e a minha família gostamos de nadar.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In this dialogue João and Ricardo are talking about what they are going to do. What day? Well, let's have a look at the days of the week before we go any further.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;
 align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#e4efed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Os
dias da semana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wednesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;segunda-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;ter&amp;ccedil;a-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;quarta-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;quinta-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;sexta-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;s&amp;aacute;bado&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;domingo&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Note: If it's clear that you are talking about days of the week, you don't actually have to say 'feira'. 

So Ricardo says

'''Ricardo''': Olá. O que vai fazer no sábado?

Olá of course means 'hello'. 

'''O que você vai fazer (no sábado) ?'''

This is a very useful phrase that basically means 'What are you going to do (on Saturday)?' You can of course replace the 'sábado' with whichever day you want to use. 'No' is a contraction of 'em' (in) and 'o' ('the', masculine). Weekend days are masculine, whereas week days are feminine, so you'll say 'no domingo' (on Sunday) but 'na segunda(-feira)' (on Monday).

The answer will be something along the lines of:

'''(Eu) vou (fazer, nadar, comer)'''

This means 'I am going'. 'Vou' is one part of the word 'ir' which means 'to go' in Portuguese. Just like in English, we say what we will do by saying 'going to', in Portuguese we can use the verb 'ir' (which, as a verb, changes for each person that it refers to, like 'estar' and 'ser') to talk about the future. First we need to look at how to conjugate (change for each person) the verb 'ir'. Remember the tree analogy? 'Ir' is called the ''infinitive'' - the trunk - of the verb. We can't just simply use it, we have to change it.

 '''IR - Present Indicative Tense'''
 '''Eu vou''' - I go
 '''Tu vais''' - You (familiar) go
 '''Você vai''' - You (informal) go
 '''Ele/Ela vai ''' - He/She goes
 '''Nós vamos''' - We go
 '''Vocês vão''' - You (plural) go
 '''Eles/Elas vão''' - They (group of males or mixed) / They (group of females) go

You need to memorize the conjugations for this verb because it is IRREGULAR - it has no pattern to it.

You may also recognize a word from the dialogue. Ricardo asked João, 

'''Como vai?''' - How are you doing (literally &quot;How are you going?&quot;)

This is another way to ask how someone is. Do you remember '''Como está?''' from the first lesson? Remember that '''como''' means &quot;how&quot;. So '''como vai?''' literally means &quot;How are you going?&quot;. It can be replied to exactly like &quot;Como está&quot;.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EED2EE&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt; '''PRONUNCIATION TIP''' &lt;/center&gt;
You may be asking how the word '''vão''' is pronounced. Whenever an accent has a tilde (that's the squiggly thing above the &quot;a&quot;) you ''nasalize'' the vowel.  This may be the hardest phonem for a non-native to pronounce. What this means precisely is very difficult to explain. If you speak French you will know how that (in French) the word ''marron'' is pronounced without the 'n' on the end. Instead the sound of the &quot;o&quot; comes out of your nose rather your mouth. With any luck we will be able to get some sound files up soon to show you this difficult pronunciation
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Now that we know how this verb conjugates for every person, we can use it to say what someone is going to do.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;559&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Eu vou&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;I am going...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;307&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;nadar- &lt;i&gt;to swim&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
falar com um amigo - &lt;i&gt;to talk with a friend&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;beber - &lt;i&gt;to drink&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;ir ao cinema - &lt;i&gt;go
to the cinema&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;247&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt; N&amp;oacute;s vamos&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;We are going...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Of course you can use any of the conjugations we have learned, not just '''eu vou''' and '''N&amp;oacute;s vamos'''.

Try out the following exercise

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

Fill in the following phrases using the appropriate form of the verb 'ir'.

1. '''Vocês ______ beber.''' - ''You (plural) are going to drink''

2. '''Eu ______ comer no domingo.''' = ''I am going to eat on Sunday.''

3. '''Ricardo e João ______ ___________''' - ''Ricardo and João are going to swim''. {Hint: Which type of conjugation is the phrase &quot;Ricardo and João&quot;?)

4. '''____ vais falar com um amigo''' - ''You are going to talk with a friend''

5. '''Ela ______ ler na terça-feira.''' - ''She is going to read on Tuesday.

6. '''__ ______ ________ fazer ____ ________?'' ''What are you going to do on Thursday?

7. '''______ _______ ____ ________ ____ ____________''' - You (use você) are going to go to the cinema on Friday.

Answers

1. vão

2. vou

3. vão nadar

4. tu

5. vai

6. O que vais fazer na quinta-feira?

7. Você vai ao cinema na sexta-feira.

''If you got the last sentence right, well done! You have successfully translated your first sentence from English to Portuguese''

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt;

The infinitive forms of verbs - like '''gostar''', '''ser''' and '''ir''' - are used quite a bit in Portuguese - but usually only when there is another verb before them. For instance, we know that we use the infinitive after the verb 'ir'.
We also know how to say &quot;I like something&quot;. But how do we say &quot;I like to do something&quot;?
This is nearly as simple as saying &quot;I am going to do something&quot;. Except here we use the verb '''gostar''' (remember, this means ''to like'') instead of '''ir''' - and we slip the word '''de''' in as well.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;559&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Eu gosto de&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;I like&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;307&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ler - &lt;i&gt;to read&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
falar - &lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;dormir - &lt;i&gt;to sleep&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;ir ao cinema com um amigo - &lt;i&gt;to go
to the cinema with a friend&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

If someone ends up doing thing this page; please only introduce numbers up to twenty...the other will come later on.

==Error==

I think this is wrong
f)São vinte para as quatro. is labled as 4:40. Whereas what the portuguese phrase says is vinte (twenty) to (quatro) four

*It should be f)São vinte para as cinco. [[User:152.78.126.18|152.78.126.18]] 18:12, 11 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a Watchdog Timer? ==
A watchdog timer is a device that triggers a system reset if it
detects that the system has hung. A program running on the system
is supposed periodically to service the watchdog timer by writing a
&quot;service pulse.&quot; If the watchdog is not serviced within a particular
period of time, the watchdog assumes that the system has hung, and
triggers a system reset.

== What is Softdog? ==
Usually, watchdog timers are implemented as add-on cards, or as on-chip
peripherals within microcontrollers. But if there is no hardware
watchdog, the Linux kernel can provide a software watchdog implemented
using kernel timers.

== Linux Watchdog Mechanism ==
In Linux, the watchdog driver provides a character driver interface to
the user space. When some data is written to the watchdog driver, the
watchdog driver services the watchdog hardware. The user space
application periodically writes some data to the watchdog driver,
depending upon the watchdog timeout period. If for some reason the user
space application hangs, the watchdog device does not get serviced and
hence triggers a system reset.

Usually the application that writes to the watchdog driver is a
watchdog daemon which monitors processes in the system, as well as 
other parameters such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, and so on.

== How Softdog Works ==
When the softdog driver is opened, softdog schedules a kernel timer to
expire after a specified timer margin. When some data is written to
the driver, the softdog driver re-schedules the timer. The user space
watchdog daemon periodically writes to the driver, and the timer is
continuously rescheduled and hence the timer callback is never
called. If the watchdog daemon stops writing to the driver, the timer
expires and the callback is called. In the timer callback, the system
is restarted.  Here's a link to an article on [http://techthoughts.typepad.com/managing_computers/2007/10/how-to-use-a-wa.html  ways to use a watchdog timer effectively].

== Source files ==

In the 2.6 kernel the softdog driver is located in
&lt;code&gt;drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c&lt;/code&gt;. [http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c?v=2.6.11 Here's a link to the softdog driver on LXR]

== Initialization ==
 static int __init watchdog_init(void)
 {
         int ret; 
 
         /* Check that the soft_margin value is within it's range ; 
            if not reset to the default */
         if (softdog_set_heartbeat(soft_margin)) {
                 softdog_set_heartbeat(TIMER_MARGIN);
                 printk(KERN_INFO PFX &quot;soft_margin value must
                      be 0&lt;soft_margin&lt;65536, using %d\n&quot;,
                        TIMER_MARGIN);
         } 
 
         ret = register_reboot_notifier(&amp;softdog_notifier);
         if (ret) {
                 printk (KERN_ERR PFX &quot;cannot register
                                                reboot notifier (err=%d)\n&quot;,
                         ret);
                 return ret;
         }
         
         ret = misc_register(&amp;softdog_miscdev);
         if (ret) {
                 printk (KERN_ERR PFX &quot;cannot register miscdev
                                                             on minor=%d (err=%d)\n&quot;,
                         WATCHDOG_MINOR, ret);
                 unregister_reboot_notifier(&amp;softdog_notifier);
                 return ret;
         }
 
         printk(banner, soft_noboot, soft_margin, nowayout);
        
         return 0;

A classic dessert, with a light texture and a mild flavor.  This recipe is for &quot;boiled&quot; custard, but ironically, as Mrs. F.L. Gillette said in ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13923/13923-h/13923-h.htm The Whitehouse Cookbook]'', &quot;it must ''not'' boil or it will curdle.&quot;  See more on custard in general [[Cookbook:Custard|here]].

== Ingredients ==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] or 500 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/4 to 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
*1 [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
*1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] (optional)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (optional)

== Procedure ==  
# Heat milk and salt (if using) in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] until bubbles form around the edges.
# Beat eggs with sugar until uniform.
# Gradually mix approximately 1/2 cup hot milk into the egg mixture to [[Cookbook:Tempering|temper]] it.
# Slowly stir egg mixture into remaining hot milk.
# Optionally, mix cornstarch and water and stir into custard.
# Stir over heat until thickened (should coat the spoon), ''without'' bringing to a boil.
# Remove from heat, and continue stirring to dry the custard slightly.
# Stir in vanilla before the dish has cooled completely.
# Serve warm or chilled.

==Variations==
*Replace vanilla extract with almond or maple extract, [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]] or grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon zest]].

*Stir 1/2 cup of sugar in a small frying pan until it becomes liquid and just begins to smoke. Stir it into the hot milk before adding the egg mixture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cookwork|Modify recipe to use fresh ingredients, closer to a real quiche recipe than this Americanised version}}
{{recipesummary|French recipes|6|75 minutes|2|Image=[[Image:Quiche Lorraine.jpg|300px]]}}

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|Cuisine of France]]

A '''quiche''' is a [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|unsweetened]] [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]] [[Cookbook:Dessert#Pies, Tarts|pie]], often made with savory fillings.  Originally served in Germany, quiche was adopted by neighboring France and is now considered a traditional French dish.  The French (and now English) word ''quiche'' comes from a dialectal form (''Küchle'') of the German word for [[Cookbook:Dessert#Cakes, cupcakes|cake]] (''Kuchen'').  Quiche became popular in Britain after World War II and in the United States during the 1960s and 70s.

==Ingredients==
*5 chicken [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*1 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (320 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (approximately 30% [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|fat]])
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] chopped ''fresh'' [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Dash|dash]] ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1 prepared frozen pie crust
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) freshly-grated [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375&amp;deg; Fahrenheit]] (190&amp;deg; Celsius)
#Place the eggs, cream, tarragon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]; blend ''as briefly as possible'' until they form a homogeneous mixture
#In the pie crust, create alternating layers of the shredded cheese and the mixture from the blender until the crust is full
#Bake the quiche for 35-40 minutes; a toothpick or fork inserted into its middle should come out &quot;clean&quot;
#Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Use nutmeg sparingly.
*Fresh tarragon will be better than dried tarragon.
*Placing a very hot pan in under the quiche will give it greater volume.
*Try making quiches with [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, sautéed [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], and shredded sharp [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]]; feel free to experiment.

==Warnings==
*The quiche mixture may drip over the edge of the pie crust while cooking; place it on a cookie sheet or place foil on the oven rack below it.
*The quiche will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven; be careful not to overcook it or cut it before it has had a chance to set.
*[[Cookbook:Half and Half|Half-and-half]] (cream with approximately 12% fat) can be substituted for regular cream to make this dish less fattening; however, be cautious of using milk because low-fat dairy products curdle more easily.

* It's ok for me to vote for my own book, right?  Anyways, the book has been very beneficial to Blender hopefuls, and it is listed first above all the other tutorials on the official Blender 3D site ( see http://blender3d.org/cms/Tutorials.243.0.html ).  I get emails all the time thanking me for putting this together:

&quot;Thanks for your time and effort on the Blender guide on WikiBooks. I've used many 3d packages(Maya, 3ds) but have wanted better understanding,.. quickly of Blender. Your guide has been instrumental in this act, and in several hours I'm really starting to get a feel for what Bender is capable of.&quot;

&quot;Im completely new to 3D imaging on the computer. Your tutorial was clear and easily understood. Just at the right level for me, explaining the basics without being patronising. Perfect, Thanks.&quot;

... and so my (obviously biased) vote goes to [[Blender 3D/Noob to Pro]].  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 12:37, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

* Yes! This is a great book. I've tried using the so-called &quot;manual&quot; for B3D but this is a lot easier to use. [[User:MeMoria|MeMoria]] 16:06, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

** Thank you! If you actually look at this Wikibook, you can read totally through it in about 3 minutes. I can't see how four ''actual'' people could have ''honestly'' voted for this when all the other nominations are so much more deserving. While I admit to being a [[w:Wikipedia:Sock_puppet|sockpuppet]], I think Starandstripe and Starfish77 need to admit to it too. For both, their first (and sometimes only) edits were votes and praise for this contentless Wikibook. --[[User:Sockpuppet3|Sockpuppet3]] 12:39, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
** I think I'll have to agree with Sockpuppet3. He does look like the third sockpuppet. Not only are [[Special:Contributions/Starfish77|Starfish77's]] and [[Special:Contributions/Starandstripe|Starandstripe's]] contributions only their votes, but Starfish77's vote came just four minutes after Charlie123's (the primary author) last edit of the day--a comment giving further praise to his book. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 18:36, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

&quot;Depression is a mood disorder&quot;, so start many descriptions of the illness.  That is a gross understatement.
Depression does indeed seriously affect your mood, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  A clinical
depression can be an incapacitating illness, affecting your ability to perform tasks that require concentration
and rendering you unable to work. 

By writing this document we hope to provide you with the knowledge everyone should have about their
mental well-being. Depression is not an unavoidable fate.  It is physical.

The good news is that you can recover and yes, even learn to be happier
than you have ever been before.

== Introduction ==

In order to begin any explanation of the nature of depression, it is advisable to begin by establishing some common terms, distinctions, and popular definitions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But most of all what must be stressed are the meanings and differences between them.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;

The volume of misconceptions, stereotypes and prejudices that the vast majority of people have concerning the topic of depression in the medical sense is truly astounding. &lt;br&gt;

To begin, we must make a very clear distinction between Depression and Clinical/Bipolar Depression. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Colloquially, they are used indiscriminately.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Anyone who has experienced Clinical/Bipolar Depression will tell you that the two are absolutely nothing alike. &lt;br&gt;

*&quot;&lt;b&gt;Depression&lt;/b&gt;&quot; (used in a non medico-legal sense) as the word is commonly used in day to day jargon refers to momentary bouts of the blues or melancholy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(and this meaning/understanding is not for any form of medico-legal related fields.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
**Every human being experiences this from time to time, it is completely normal and after a little while without need of medical intervention you will be back to normal. 
*&lt;b&gt;Unipolar/Bipolar Depression&lt;/b&gt; (using as in medico-legal sense) is not anything remotely similar to plain old &quot;&lt;b&gt;Depression&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; &lt;br&gt;

Clinical/Bipolar Depression is a medical condition as true as diabetes &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(DM Type-II) &lt;/font&gt; or cancer &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(e.g. breast cancer, testicular cancer etc.)&lt;/font&gt;. 

&lt;u&gt;&quot;Normal&quot; depression is psychological&lt;/u&gt; whereas &lt;u&gt;Clinical/Bipolar Depression is both psychological and physiological&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;i&gt;it is well documented that drastic alterations occur in the brain as well as other changes occur in the rest of the body.&lt;/i&gt;

The importance of these distinctions is paramount &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(most important)&lt;/font&gt;, you cannot gain an understanding of these conditions without it. 

I will urge people who are reading this and who are fortunate not to have experienced  clinical/bipolar depression, to keep this distinction clear in your minds while reading the rest of this book, any related material, and most of all when interacting with those who are diagnosed.

&lt;b&gt; Please pay Attention! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
For the remainder of this document &lt;u&gt;for the sake of simplicity when the word &quot;depression&quot; is used it will refer to the medical condition of Clinical or Bipolar Depression&lt;/u&gt;, and the term &lt;u&gt;&quot;normal depression&quot; will refer to the everyday non diagnosed human experience&lt;/u&gt;. 

Now that the most important distinction and definitions are out of the way lets establish some others. 

There are two major types of medical depression
#Clinical Depression 
#Bipolar Disorder 

&lt;i&gt;Clinical Depression is an outdated term but is still commonly used. Similarly Bipolar Disorder(BD) was formerly referred to as Manic Depression, but Manic Depression is still widely used to refer to it.&lt;/i&gt;

The correct terms to use as accepted by the medical community are: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Major Depressive Disorder(MDD)&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Unipolar Depression&lt;/b&gt; instead of Clinical Depression, and &lt;b&gt;Bipolar disorder&lt;/b&gt; instead of Manic Depression.

As I said before there are two major kinds of medical Depression, MDD and Bipolar Disorder. &lt;br&gt;
What's the Difference? 

In a nut shell &lt;b&gt;Bipolar Disorder&lt;/b&gt; is the same as &lt;b&gt;MDD&lt;/b&gt; except that it has two alternating phases; Depression and Mania. 

The experiences are usually the same symptoms that occur with MDD, except that they alternate with Manic Symptoms. 

Without going into too much detail at the moment, for our purposes now just think of Mania as the opposite of Depression or an extremely good mood. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The phrase extreme highs and lows sums it up quite nicely for our purposes. We'll go into a little bit more detail about mania later but I don't want to leave you thinking the Mania is all fun and games. Even though you do have an elevated mood there are some very negative symptoms that also come along with Manic periods which will be explained latter. &lt;/i&gt;

While there are some documented differences between MDD and the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder, for our understanding they are not relevant and will not be addressed in this book. Both MDD and Bipolar depression are more similar than not, have the same basic symptoms and are usually treated in a similar fashion. Unless otherwise specified when the term depression is used it refers to both Major Depressive Disorder and the Depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder. 

If you've noticed I said that MDD and BP are the two major kinds of medical depression. There is another milder but still medically relevant form of depression known as &lt;b&gt;dystimia&lt;/b&gt; which we'll touch upon briefly later. 

Perhaps then some assume that:

Statistics point out that approximately one out of every six people will have a depression (with varying
degrees of seriousness) at least once in their lifetime.  The magnitude of this number is all the more
shocking if one confronts it with the general ignorance about the problem.  Even people
well-informed about other health issues will often be caught totally by surprise by a depression.
I know, I was one of them.  Since our early school years we get tons of information about healthy
eating, on the perils of smoking and heavy drinking, on avoiding sunburn, etc., etc.  But mental
health, largely because of the prejudice surrounding any kind of mental illness, is to a large
extent ignored.  This is more of a tragedy if one realises how far-reaching are the implications
for a person's life and productivity, and most importantly, how depression could be avoided altogether
if only people knew how to recognize the early symptoms.

As you read through this document, please always bear in mind that
whenever the term ''depression'' is used it refers specifically to the physical illness more properly
described as ''[[w:en:clinical depression|clinical depression]]''.  One also finds the very same word ''depression'' used
in the context of other mental disorders (such as ''[[w:en:manic-depression|manic depression]] ''[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/bipolar.cfm]) of which this document does not cover.  It is '''very important''' to keep this distinction in mind.  As an example,
consider the people who suffer from bouts of melancholy all through their lives.  They often describe
their subjective feeling as that of being ''depressed''.  However, when one takes a closer look
at more objective indicators, they may not show the symptoms of a clinical depression.  This document
does not apply to them.


One of the enduring myths about clinical depression is that you can cure it simply by convincing a depressed person that life is good and worth living. Likewise, a depressed person will not be magically cured if all of their problems are suddenly solved.  In fact, it was my experience (and that of many others) that the factors which contributed to the depression were long past and resolved.  However, they had their physical toll in the brain, and that could not be suddenly undone.

Our misuse of language compounds the problem.  All too often a perfectly healthy person (brain-wise, of course)will say that they feel depressed when really all they're experiencing is a passing case of the blues. It is far from my intention to dictate how people should use language, but this example illustrates my case. Curiously, one of the tell-tale symptoms of clinical depression is the inability to have strong emotions, including sadness and the blues.

Another important aspect to remember about depression is that it is not an on/off condition. There is a continuum between a perfectly healthy brain and one from a severely depressed person.  I estimate that in modern society, those who could be classified as in perfect mental health are probably the minority.  Moreover, just like physical fitness goes through ups and downs throughout a lifetime, the mental health of a typical individual will also fluctuate.  It is only when the fluctuation dips significantly low for an extended period that the diagnosis of a depression is typically made.  Elaborating further on this note, the good news is that a very large number of people who strictly speaking are not depressed and have largely satisfactory lives, could still feel better and happier if they took better care of their brains. The advice herein contained is also for them.

You may wonder why I have bothered to write such a lengthy description of depression if I advise people to seek professional help anyway.  In a sense, you are asking for a ''rationale'' for this document.  Well, I would not have written it if I thought it was irrelevant, dangerous, or simply superfluous- Quite the contrary. I see good reasons that justify it, as follows.

*The focus of the document is an objective description of clinical depression, explaining the physical illness which progressively takes its toll on the brain. If more people were aware of this fact, they would not be as complacent when the first symptoms appear. Moreover, they would feel less stigmatised and reluctant about seeking professional help.

*By being better informed, people would realise the importance of seeking '''competent''' help.  Many General Practitioners and even Psychologists are not properly informed about depression, and they can even inadvertently give their patients plenty of bad advice. Worst of all, the situation can worsen dramatically before the patient even realises what is wrong with the advice they are given.  This happens frequently, believe it or not. The only solution is for people to be better informed and able to spot whether or not their GP is competent enough to treat them.

*The enormous cost of health care in affluent societies often translates into health insurers pressuring for the cheaper solution of relying solely on antidepressants.  In countries where the GP stands as the ''gate-keeper'' for specialised treatment, people may find it difficult to convince their GP to send them to a specialist.  The result is treatment based largely on medication, with little or no coaching.

*Lifestyle plays a large role in the development of depression.  Again, by better understanding the problem from an objective perspective, people will more easily assimilate the need to take good care of their sleep and to avoid overloading their brains.

The remainder of this instalment is structured as follows.  I will begin by explaining what exactly is a depression and how the problem develops in the first place.  Special attention will be given to a description of the most typical symptoms which accompany each stage of
the illness.  The next step is more personal: it describes the lifestyle changes I had to make to help my brain recover instead of sinking deeper into the illness.

== What is Depression? ==

Depression is a very real medical condition that involves both psychological and biological factors. It is not simply something that is &quot;in your head&quot;. Numerous studies have shown significant changes occur to the anatomy of the brain during the course of depression. Further Depression is a whole body illness not only affecting the brain. Those with depression experience a wide variety of physical and mental symptoms. Strong emphasis should be placed on the fact that depressed mood is only one symptom of many involved in an illness that encompasses many.

According to &lt;b&gt;World Health Organization (W.H.O)&lt;/b&gt;
Depression is a &lt;i&gt;common mental disorder&lt;/i&gt; that presents with &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

=== The Stress System: Adrenaline and Cortisol ===
[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Stress_Compensation.png|right|frame|Figure 4: Chronic stress can diminish your maximum normal capacity.]]


The stress system relies on two key hormones: ''adrenaline'' and ''cortisol''.
In short, adrenaline works in the short term, while cortisol has large momentum and works
in the long term.  (Adrenaline is also known as ''epinephrine'' in North America.
To be exact, the terms ''noradrenaline'' and ''norepinephrine'' are used to refer
specifically to the neurotransmitter as opposed to the hormone, since they are different molecules.
Moreover, there are many other neurotransmitters involved: check reference [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7] for details.
The purists will excuse my exclusive use of the word ''adrenaline'' throughout the text).

It is important to realise that the stress system can also be activated if your brain
perceives danger or any kind of threat.  In the first stage, this triggers the release
of adrenaline into the bloodstream to prepare the body for action. As a result,
your heart beats faster, you begin to sweat, your breath becomes shallower, and your
senses become more acute [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28medicine%29].
This is the so-called ''fight or flight'' response to the stressor event, and
was quite adequate during most of our evolution, when these events were quite
specific and usually short-term: escaping from a lion, chasing away a rival gang, or
facing up to the impudent adolescent trying to woo your mate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response].  Problems with
chronic stress arise because in a modern society we cannot escape easily from the stressor,
be it an overbearing boss, crowded cities, or traffic jams.  Furthermore, no matter
how hard we try to delude ourselves with the pretence of civilisation, at heart we
are still primates, and consequently, factors such as social status also play an important
role as sources of stress.  Moreover, primates have evolved the capacity to stress up the
body in ''anticipation'' of a possible danger [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7].  Again, this was
an advantageous adaptation in the context where it evolved, but nothing but trouble for
the modern human.

The effect of the stress hormones on the brain is curious and not what you might expect.
The initial surge of adrenaline can make you feel good. 

[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Cortisol.png|right|frame|Figure 2: The relationship between adrenaline and cortisol.]]
Just as your levels of adrenaline start coming down, so rises the amount of cortisol flowing
through your veins.  Moreover, cortisol has a much larger momentum than adrenaline, which
means that even though it builds up slowly, it also takes a long time to go back to normal.
And should you constantly be engaging in activities which require adrenaline, so will your
levels of cortisol slowly increase.  In a sense, you can think of cortisol as a measure of
the weighted average of your recent levels of adrenaline.  I have tried to capture this
feature in Figure 2.

Together with the rise of cortisol and the decrease of adrenaline, come the nasty side-effects
of the stress hormones.  It is at this moment that you feel bad, anxious, and
having lots of negative thoughts.  And this is perhaps one of the critical features
of stress which flies against common sense: you only feel its bad aspects
when your body is ''stressing down'' and progressing towards a more relaxed state.
When you are building up on adrenaline, in effect ''stressing up'', you might
even be feeling good!  This explains what is popularly known as the ''adrenaline rush''
and the consequent ''adrenaline crash''.

Having too much cortisol flowing through your veins has another nasty side-effect:
the recovery time from any adrenaline surge increases.  In a sense, the relation
between adrenaline and cortisol goes both ways: the adrenaline curve influences
the cortisol curve, and vice-versa.  Figure 3 tries to capture this reaction effect
by showing the adrenaline response curve for three individuals subjected to the
same physical exercise.  Notice how the more serious the depression (which translates
into higher levels of cortisol, as you will soon understand), the longer it
takes for the body to go back to normal.

[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Adrenaline_Response.png|none|frame|Figure 3: The adrenaline response curve for various degrees of depression.]]
   


On the speculation front, recent findings may have implicated neuron death as the physical
underpinning of depression.  Furthermore, it seems that the opposite process, termed
''neurogenesis'', is crucial for the recovery, and happens naturally in healthy individuals [3,6].
Furthermore, evidence indicates that sleep is fundamental for neurogenesis to take place.

[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Buildup.png|right|frame|Figure 5: In the last stages of clinical depression, the maximum capacity is virtually nil, and the adrenaline (anxiety) transforms itself into a 'fire'.]]

At this stage you are in possession of all the ingredients necessary to understand how
depression develops.  The negative effect of the stress hormones on the maximum normal
capacity is the key to comprehend the ''buildup'' process that makes a depression
feed on itself, like a [[w:en:positive feedback|positive feedback]] mechanism.

Let us go back to [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Stress_Compensation.png|Figure 4]].  Imagine that you would chronically go over your limits, thus forcing your body to constantly rely on the stress hormones to compensate for the lack of serotonin.  On the long term, your maximum capacity would therefore be reduced, making it much more likely that you would have to resort to the stress system to compensate.  And thus the feedback begins: your maximum capacity is diminished, forcing you to use the stress system all the time; and because of all the stress hormones flowing through your veins, your brain has no chance of recovering, and your maximum capacity diminishes even further.

This may sound very mechanical, but I would say that it is '''the key element
that leads to the development of a full-blown clinical depression'''.
Alas, it is also something that most doctors fail to realise.  And if you are still
clinging to &quot;psychological&quot; notions about the illness, it is time you put them
into perspective.  Psychology plays a role in the factors that lead to the initial
dip of your work capacity, but after a certain stage the problem just feeds on itself,
and it is crucial to understand that to avoid falling prey of this downward spiral.

Even though the graphs might give the impression that this is a phenomenon that
happens very quickly, in reality the process typically takes many years to
develop.  Moreover, the progressive increase of the levels of stress hormones
in your body provide a very good advance warning, if only you know how to read them.
I will now provide a basic description of what to expect (and what to do!) at
each stage of the process.  Beware that different people have different symptoms,
so your mileage may vary.

==Early stages==
In the very early stages, a depression will not feel like a depression at all. The small amounts of stress hormones could in theory be measured&amp;mdash;your blood pressure would be slightly higher than otherwise&amp;mdash;but in practise it would be difficult &quot;to extract the signal from the noise&quot;.  Subjectively, you might feel a bit down and tired, especially during those periods when you are ''crashing down'' from the adrenaline, but most people would still not say that they feel depressed.  Also, you would start sleeping a bit less than usual, and not feeling quite as fresh when you wake up.

The problem is not very serious yet, and I think that most people could recover on their own if they were to simply take a long holiday and to make sure that they sleep well.  There is some evidence that '''if done properly''' moderate amounts of aerobic exercise might help at this stage.  However, be sure to read [[../The Role of Sports/]] section before you decide to embark on any
exercise routine.  In fact, I would rather advise people not to begin exercising than to risk having them over do it and making their condition worse. I know this flies against some commonly held beliefs, but '''sports alone can worsen a depression'''.  If you do not believe now, read carefully both installments of this document and you might understand what I mean.

What a great explanation of depression.

==Elevated stress hormones==
As the amount of stress hormones increases, you will start feeling some of their
nasty side-effects.  This is largely person-dependent, but most people start
having problems with their digestive system, headaches, and having more frequent
nightmares.  Since stress depresses the immune system, people also tend to fall
sick with infections more often [http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~hanko/Bio/stress.html].  Only a minority of people suffer from sleep
paralysis [http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~acheyne/S_P.html], but it is also a good indicator of elevated stress hormones.
An objective measure such as blood pressure should be controlled: it will definitely
be higher than normal, and a good doctor would not fail to recognise it.  At this
stage you are very clearly sleeping less than normal, waking up early in the morning,
feeling tired and &quot;lazy&quot; about getting up.  Subjectively, you should notice that you
do not feel things quite as intensively as you used to: you feel empty, morose, and
definitely &quot;depressed&quot; most of the time.  Other subjective indicators include loss
of appetite and sex-drive, feelings of guilt, lowered self-esteem, and detachment
from hobbies or friends [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Depressionmenu.cfm].

At this stage you should not be complacent about the problem.  '''The best thing
you can do is to go see your doctor'''.  Take also into consideration that you
have been putting too much pressure on your brain.  Really do give it a rest: take
a long holiday, make sure you sleep well, and be careful not to get any extra
responsibilities.  Antidepressants are very effective at this stage, especially
if combined with minor lifestyle changes. '''(And yet another reason why
you should see your doctor!)'''

==Problem aggravates==
As the ''buildup'' towards a depression continues, you get to the point
where it is impossible not to notice that there is something definitely wrong.
At this point, most people start having serious problems with anxiety, stress,
panic attacks, hyperventilation, bouts of psychosis, etc.  Your sleep will
definitely be a mess, your blood pressure will be high, and your ability to
focus at work seriously compromised.

'''One should definitely seek professional help at this stage'''. In particular, do not make the assumption that your GP will be qualified to treat you.  They may, or they may not.  Unfortunately, many doctors still do not quite understand what is going on.  My experience in this area was
quite bad: I spent more than one year jumping from doctor to doctor, with the problem constantly aggravating, and getting all kinds of bad
advice.  In short, '''you need to stop'''. Your maximum capacity will probably be so low that you cannot even work full time.
Also, specifically ask your doctor for antidepressants.  In the country where I live, the Netherlands, this is bit of a taboo subject, so depending on where you live, you might need to convince your doctor not to be stingy and stubborn. Should they suggest that you start exercising, '''just ignore that advice'''. It is a very good indicator that they do not have a clue of what is going on. Also, you will need to make changes to your lifestyle. The [[../Recovery Guide/]] section describes one author's personal experience in that regard.

==Last stages==
In the last stages, the maximum capacity is practically nil, and the level of
stress hormones so high that people cease to be able to function.  The stage
of a clinical depression is very difficult to describe in words, but I will
do my best.  The anxiety transforms itself into a &quot;fire&quot; which constantly
burns inside your head; you will feel desperate, much more than you ever
felt in your life, as if you could never be happy again; and you will definitely
be suicidal, to the point of actually planning suicide or even attempting it
(with success in many cases, tragically).  During this stage, people can
barely sleep, if at all.

To an outsider, the fact that a clinically depressed person is pretty much
confined to bed is often misinterpreted.  People often think that a clinical
depression is a simply a state of apathy.  Quite on the contrary: remember
that the blood pressure and heart rate of a depressed person are extremely
high.  Rather than apathy, depression is an overwhelming fire which will not
subside and burns you from the inside.

Unfortunately, it is only at this stage that many people finally concede
that they need professional help to treat them.  Needless to say, you will
need to make drastic changes to your lifestyle if you want to recover.
You should also be very patient: it will take a long time before things go
back to normal.
'''Most important of all, a clinical psychiatrist is the proper
specialist to accompany you during this period.'''

== Recovery Guide ==

There are plenty of people with depression who are not being properly
treated.  Antidepressants revolutionized medicine's approach to the treatment of depression,
and even though they are generally effective and an indispensable tool, sole reliance on drugs
neglects valuable lifestyle advice.  This is important consideration for those with all levels of depression.

The first step tried in recovering from depression should be telling someone and then getting help from a doctor if possible.

In order to recover from a depression, one must first understand the problem.

The following three sections cover the different aspects of the lifestyle changes.
The first category deals with general advice which one should always have present.
I The next section deals with the daily routine.  Even though more flexible in nature, I quickly realized
that there were good reasons behind my counselor's insistence that I followed
its guidelines.   At last, the third section focuses on tips for good sleep.
These are by no means specific to a clinical depression.

=== General Lifestyle Advice ===

These are just the general tips that might help with depression.
It might take a while to get used to them, but in time they will become second nature.  Moreover, remember that
depression is not an on/off condition: this same advice is also useful for healthy people who wish to remain
that way.  Obviously, a healthy person does not need to follow them very strictly, but they remain nevertheless
good lifestyle advice.



*'''Try to avoid stress'''

Stress may exasperate depression

*'''Exercise'''

*'''Get Sunshine'''

*'''Do things you enjoy'''

*'''Practice relaxation exercises'''

Yes, I am referring to stuff like meditation and yoga.  They actually work, despite all
the silly new-age nonsense that surrounds them.  If you cannot stand the airy-fairy aspects,
try to find a good expert who does not preach them.

Personally, I found that one of the most relaxing things you can do is to lie in the sunshine.
This might not be an option if it is winter and/or you happen to live in a cold country,
but if you can, do it as much as is safely possible.  (But take into account the usual advice
concerning the dangers of catching too much sun, obviously!  Like in all things, moderation is the key).

'''Make a conscious effort to do things with pleasure'''

This could take a fair amount of brainwashing, but the idea is that before each activity, no matter
how small, you think ''I love doing this'' or ''I order myself to feel good, right now''.  For best results, say it loudly.  Also, only do
things when you really feel pleasure in doing them, and do them only for as long as that pleasure
remains.  Should you lose interest or feel tired, then stop.

'''Take appropriate medication'''

If your gut reaction is that antidepressants are evil, consider informing yourself properly.
The truth is that modern drugs are quite effective and generally safe (I am referring in
particular to SSRIs and more recent classes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor]). They do have side-effects,
but these are usually mild and quite bearable compared with the illness itself.  For best
results, have a clinical psychiatrist prescribe them to you: they are generally well informed of the
different side-effects and can choose the drug best suited to your case.  Also, remember that
antidepressants usually require around three weeks before they have an effect.  Three weeks
are an eternity for someone with a depression, but do not stop taking them just because you
do not see an immediate result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Demystifying Depression navbar|[[../Tips for Good Sleep/]]|[[../General Lifestyle Advice/]]}}

=== Daily Routine ===

I will now make a brief description of the typical daily routine.  This advice assumes that the person
is in a serious condition, but there are still a few good pointers to extract even for mildly depressed
individuals.  Also, as the condition improves, one does not need to be as rigorous as in the early stages.

*'''Take your time to do the morning activities'''

You surely do not want to rev up your body immediately after waking up!  Take your time to get up,
to shower, to get dressed, and to breakfast.  If it takes you less than one hour and
a half to perform these activities, then you are doing them too quickly.

*'''Take a walk in the morning'''

The idea is to have a ''qualitative walk''.  Pay attention to the colours around you,
to the smells, the sounds, the shapes, the people, etc.  This will help to diffuse your
thoughts, and to avoid the obsessive thinking that accompanies depression.  Also, since
you must limit physical activity, walking every morning is important for your body to
burn excess sugar.  Walk for about half an hour, and do not forget: lie down for another
half an hour afterwards!  (Remember [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Adrenaline_Response.png|Figure 3]]: your body will take longer than usual to
get back to normal).

*'''Find an activity that gives you pleasure'''
Like gardening,
painting, or bird-watching.

*'''Eat properly and avoid heavy meals'''

Digestion is also quite demanding on your body, and therefore it is better to have
more meals rather than bigger meals.  Also, a depression is really a bad time to
be thinking of diets.  Eat well and make sure you get all your nutrients.

Some people also swear by the importance of drinking water regularly during the day.
The rationale is that dehydration is a stress event, thus triggering the physiological
reaction we aim to avoid.

*'''Have a ''siesta'''''

Even if you cannot sleep, it is important that you lie down for a while until your body
is (relatively) rested.  We all have a natural dip after lunch, and it is a pity that
some modern societies have lost the ''siesta'' habit.

=== Tips for Good Sleep ===

To conclude, I will present just a few tips on how to get a good night's sleep.
These are especially important during a depression, but again, they also apply
to anyone.

*'''No activities before going to sleep'''

You must avoid at all cost any adrenaline coming into your system before sleep time.
Be especially careful of anything exciting or stressful.
Yes, this includes most of television and even reading!
Avoid also any physical exercise less than an hour before going to sleep.  Always
have in mind that a person with a depression will need longer than normal for
the body to recover from any physical effort.  Even healthy individuals
should avoid doing sports at least a couple of hours before going to bed.

*'''Follow a steady sleep routine'''

Try going to bed always at the same time everyday.  We all know how working in shifts
and jet-lag affect sleep: do not emulate them by going to bed at random times each day!

*'''Give your body time to crash down'''

You cannot fall asleep while there is too much adrenaline running through your veins.
It can take a while (even hours) before you crash down, and often people lie awake in
bed waiting for sleep to come.  The problem is that after a while it is very easy to
start obsessing about not sleeping, which is a sure way of keeping yourself awake.

The idea is to only get ready for sleep once you have crashed down and feel tired.
Before you actually get into bed, just lie there for a while (even with your clothes on),
until you feel relaxed and tired.

*'''Go to bed early'''

There are several reasons why this is a good practise: foremost to be able to wake naturally
rather than with an alarm clock; but also to avoid being out of sync with the solar cycle,
and to give your body time to crash down.

*'''Make your bedroom your sanctuary'''

Do not have an office in the same room as where you sleep.  Dedicate one room
simply for sleeping, and make it as uncluttered as possible.

*'''Sleeping Medication'''

Sleep is the most important part of your day.  If all other methods and tips on how to get a good night's sleep fail; talk to your doctor about taking a low dose sleeping medication.

== The Recovery Process ==

Depending on your age, your general health status, how serious the depression was, and how well the recovery
progresses, it typically takes between two months and two years before you can be fully recovered.  Do not despair,
however, because this certainly does not mean that during all this period you will feel as bad as in the beginning.
The first few months are the hardest, but after that things will slowly improve, and little by little you will get
your happiness and normality back.  Moreover, remember that you only feel the nasty aspects of a depression
when you go over your limits: you just have to be patient and to realise that your limits will indeed be very
short during an extended period.

As the recovery progresses, you will feel not only that you can perform more concentration intensive
activities and during longer periods, but also that your subjective mood improves.  At some point
you will be able to start working again, only for a couple of hours each day in the beginning, but
increasingly more until you can work full time again.  Finally, your mood should start approaching
normality towards the later stages of the recovery: you should regain the feelings of ''fullness'',
vibrancy, and what is sometimes called the ''elan vital''.

== Conclusion ==
The moral of the story is fairly straightforward: depression is a physical illness which should
be taken seriously and be treated as soon as the first symptoms arise.  Like most other ailments,
it feeds on ignorance and complacency, which is all the more tragic if one considers that we
have the medical knowledge and the means to make it a thing of the past.  Humanity has been
tormented too much already.

* Just because wikibooks can be edited by anybody, doesn't mean they are.  (The graphs are totally bogus.) by 128.119.165.135
:That disclaimer was definitely a good one. Although the author warns the reader at some points about following conjecture, it feels like most of this book is conjecture, fuzzy logic, and the result of a nonprofessional. The author scolds professionals, as if those who have made a career out of psychology don't know their subject; yet the author himself seems to have little experience. If he could back up his statements by citing his sources, I would be more impressed. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 05:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== This book is not a good source of information ==
Let me make this clear right now: The majority of this book was written by one person (Name of Feather), a person who is not a professional, has not cited any articles from scientific journals. In fact, his sources are all secondary, and they all suck ([[#invalid_sources|Really, they do]]). '''There is no indication that this guy has any idea what he's talking about'''. He talks big, as if he knows the subject. But where's the proof? This entire book is just one rambling speech after another about what he ''thinks'' depression is. Where is the proof that any of this bull is true? He speaks about all this brain chemistry mumbo-jumbo, and acts as if it instantly means that all his conclusions are accurate. But he backs up almost NONE of his claims with evidence.

Do not listen to this guy. Listening to this guy would be equivalent to taking medical advice about your broken leg from a Janitor who says he took a biology course in high school. Although Name of Feather may act like he knows the subject, it sure as hell seems he doesn't. If he had any actual professional experience, instead of just deciding that he'd go on the internet and spew whatever he decides is right, he'd have evidence and actual statistics, he'd have '''objective evidence''' and not just anecdotes about his own personal version of &quot;the truth&quot; about depression.

If you are depressed, do  not make decisions about what to do off of this book. There's no evidence that the author understands the subject any more than you do. The author just *thinks* they understand the subject, but that doesn't mean anything. Go to an actual doctor, an actual professional; or if you're not into quacks, who have spent years studying this stuff, at least don't listen to this nut who thinks he has &quot;all the answers&quot; because he uses fancy words like &quot;serotonin&quot; and &quot;neurogenesis.&quot; I don't care if he read a news article or two about it. I don't care if he took some course in psychology ten or twenty years ago. You should listen to actual professionals, or to many different people who have had depression. But don't let some stranger from the internet, who has not shown that his ideas are valid in any way, tell you what to do with your life.--[[User:Monk|Monk]] 06:21, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

I agree. I am wondering if large portions of this book need removed until they can be written properly. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 08:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I agree, and would have said it if nobody else had.  But in defence of the author, depression is a very individual thing.  I was diagnosed with depression as a child and I am now over 60.  It didn't stop me working.  My story would be very different.  The other day I looked at a book by an English sufferer.  His story was very different again, and just as irrelevant to mine.  Depression is not capable of precise description like a broken leg or an infection.  I have yet to come up with a formal definition of it.

===On the subject of rants===
Hey Monk, before you &quot;contribute&quot; any further, would you mind counting the number of times
that readers are advised to seek professional help if they think they have a depression?
I go as far as advising them to seek a competent professional (i.e. a psychiatrist) instead
of being treated only by their (cheaper) GPs.

That being said, show the advice herein contained to a modern psychiatrist.
They will not disagree with it.

:'''On the subject of proof, by Monk'''

:You seem to be very confused as to where the burden of proof lies here. It's not my job to disprove the contents of your book to show that the contents are untrustworthy. It's your job to prove the contents of your book to show that they're trustworthy in the first place. You can't just put any content up here and expect everyone to treat it as authoritative and the truth until they can get an expert to vouch against it. You need to back up your statements with proof. Doing that is your job, not mine. If you cannot provide good proof for your scientific statements, you can not expect others to treat anything you say as scientifically reputable.

:Secondly, I don't give a damn if you advise readers to see a professional a hundred times, that doesn't make your knowledge any more professional. You are not qualified to &quot;inform&quot; people about the subject to any degree, because as far as I'm concerned, you may know nothing about it. You may just be making this up. You may just be &quot;remembering it&quot; from some casual chat you had with a few psych doctors months ago, but that means essentially nothing as to qualifications. You have shown NO qualifications to educate others on the subject. Normally, qualifications are irrelevant as long as you can back up your claims with objective evidence, but so far you have not actually backed up your claims with anything but a vague hand-motion to a few mainstream-level science magazines, and some other worthless sources.

:Depression is a sensitive subject. I think I'm justified in warning other people when you go around telling them what to do with their lives without providing any evidence that you know what you're talking about. I don't care if you throw in &quot;Oh, but you should really see a doctor&quot; at the beginning, you're still instructing them on something that you may know nothing about. If you have enough evidence to support the claims you make in this book, that's great, but you have to show that evidence, and it has to be valid evidence. Every claim has to be supported by previously collected data, proof, and scientific papers, rather than be anecdotal.

: Irrelevant of whether the book is designed to appeal to the masses, the information within is of a sensitive scientific subject, and should be scientifically accurate. Like any scientific piece, although it may be up to others to investigate whether your evidence and data is valid and whether it supports or does not support your conclusion (something I have done, and in this case I have found that it's mostly invalid evidence), it's up to you to prove your arguments in the first place. You have failed to do that. If you can not support your claims about depression, you are not qualified to speak on the subject, and you are not qualified to tell people how to live their lives when under such a mentally precarious condition. 

:I don't need to prove you wrong for your claims to be dubious. If you can not prove that you are correct in the first place, your claims are automatically put into doubt. Until you can back your claims up, and ''back them up well'', this book is an unreliable source of information. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

&lt;div id='invalid_sources' \&gt;

I am male, and in Australia.  I have had depression for 45 years, but I still don't take an hour and a half to get up in the morning.  I am sure that what Name of Feather has written agrees with his experience, and no doubt, what he has written is what a psychiatrist would say to him.  It is good if it gets men to acknowledge that they can be depressed, too.  But it is not of general application.  On the ordinary Wikipedia, it would be labelled &quot;weasel words&quot; - putting the author's views forward as general knowledge (although I hate the expression itself.)  How does he know that a modern psychiatrist would not disagree with his advice?  Is he a psychiatrist, or so familiar with psychiatric thought generally?  He hasn't quoted the basis of this statement, just as with any of his others.  I have already mentioned one area where I would receive different advice.

What worries me is that advice to wrap oneself in cotton wool, as he recommends, is exactly the wrong treatment for depression.  It depends on the depth of depression involved, and I was lucky enough to keep working.  But so many depressed people are sitting patiently waiting for a cure, and doing nothing with their lives in the meantime.  Depression is an interaction of brain chemistry, circumstances and attitude.  Change any one, and you change the other two.  Although &quot;positive thinking&quot; or &quot;counting our blessings&quot; often achieves nothing against depression, nevertheless attitude is still within our control.  Depression practically wipes me out for about 3 days every month, but like a woman with periods that are just as disabling, I don't let it stop me the rest of the time.  I try to look on it as a disability, rather than an illness.

I find the term &quot;a depression&quot; strange.  I suppose that it is legitimate like &quot;a cancer&quot; or &quot;an AIDS&quot;.  It must be a local thing.  We don't use it here. - [[Douglaid]]

===Sources suck because....===
His sources suck, and here's why -- The author has only supported his statements with the following references:
*created a few haphazard links to a &quot;science news&quot; website, and a page which reprints a &quot;science news&quot; magazine. Where &quot;science news&quot; refers to a magazine that reformats, rewrites, and rewords science knowledge as to make consumable for easy reading by the public.
*created a few links to wikipedia articles
*created a link to a student's assignment at a college (Not an authoritative source in any way!).
*The only possibly valid reference he uses is [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/depression.cfm This NIMH] site, and you would be better off reading that page than this &quot;book&quot;.
This guy only cites one good source, but his book doesn't even reflect the contents of that source. All the other sources are either secondary or meaningless. Looks like he has no idea what he's talking about.

===Exercise only for 'mild' depression?===

My psychiatrist told me that regular aerobic exercise is as good for moderate depression as an SSRI, according to studies.  This book states the
proper role of exercise is much more limited, without seeming to back that
up with proper research.  

[[User:207.34.148.245|207.34.148.245]] 19:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Todo ==
*Change the tone of the book, especially the first person perspective.
**Agreed.

== Retitle? ==

I think that a title like ''Introduction to Depression'' would serve this book better and bring it more inline with the textbook nature of wikibooks. What does everyone else think? [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 07:17, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:'''Change Title''' The title ''Introduction to Depression'' is less marketing-pitch and honest. One more vote for this, and I'll move the title if nobody else does. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 05:41, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Retitle plus other suggestions ==

Concerning the retitle, that is fine by me!

Some other suggestions (for now):

* I will make proper figures out of the ASCII art.  I know how they should look like, so I should do it.
* Merge parts 1 and 2.

Later on there are other things that could be done:

* Create a section for each of the available treatments (meds, etc)
* Add information on the existing antidepressants (though Wikipedia already has quite a lot)

== New navigation template ==

I created a prototype navigation template and put it on the first two pages of this book. Here it is as an example:

{{User:Triddle/wip|[[Demystifying Depression:Normal Neuron Communication|Normal Neuron Communication]]|[[Demystifying Depression:Introduction|Introduction]]}}

What does everyone else think? [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 20:22, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Template ==

Using a template is a good idea, of course.

About the particular format of the template, I would suggest
that all links use the same font size.  Also, &quot;First Page&quot;
should be renamed &quot;Top&quot;, as that is the standard nomenclature
used by most tools (eg. tex2html).

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:21, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Communication between editors ==

I personally find the use of the talk page a very limited
form of communication.  What about creating a mailing list
(a yahoo group or something) for the purpose of synchronising
the editing process?

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Concerning the title ==

Well, I am not adamant about it, but perhaps we should
leave the title as it is.  It has already picked up
some &quot;brand recognition&quot;... :-)

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:44, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Namespace ==

Looking at the [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] page, we should move
all pages back to the original &quot;Demystifying Depression/Section Name&quot;.
That is the preferred format for new books.

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:54, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:After reading the Naming Conventions page and [[Wikibooks:Hierachy_naming_scheme]] it seems that using : is going to be easier for this project than using /. Why? The | trick will be of great use when creating links to pages inside the book. Quick overview of how links work:

* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - links to Foo
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo|Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo but displays Bar
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo:Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo:Bar
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo:Bar|Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo:Bar but only displays Bar (note trailing |)
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo/Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo/Bar
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo/Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo/Bar but displays Foo/Bar, can't use trailing /
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo/Bar|Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo/Bar but displays Bar

Now think of the difference between 

{{User:Triddle/wip|[[Demystifying Depression:What Is Depression|What Is Depression]]|[[Demystifying Depression]]}}

and

{{User:Triddle/wip|[[Demystifying Depression/What Is Depression|What is depression]]|[[Demystifying Depression]]}}

As well as the other benefits listed by [[Wikibooks:Hierachy_naming_scheme#Real_custom_namespaces]]. It really seems to me that setting this up in its own namespace is the way to go. [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 16:32, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't know it was possible to create custom namespaces.  In that case, it is definately the way to go!
[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 08:53, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Announce book ==

I think it is time to announce the book and add it to the bookshelves, don't you agree?

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 11:03, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I do not agree due to the huge amount of unsupported and perhaps false information.[[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 09:10, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I ran this program on all the articles to update the old style reference notation. I hope someone else can find it useful in the future. [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 06:56, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

This is about the reference links throughout the book. What about adding article/page titles to the tooltips?

I am very impressed with the book. Thanks for a useful and real discussion.


== Calvinism ==

The references to Calvinism probably need better explanation. [[User:220.253.24.254|220.253.24.254]] 01:54, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

== Before you make changes... ==

Being a wikibook and all that means that one expects people
to make changes/corrections as they see fit.  However, if not
for anything else at least for the sake of politeness, it
would be very much appreciated if radical changes were first
proposed in this talk page.  (See the history for an example
of what I'm referring to).

Thank you,

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 18:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Radical changes are however needed to this book please make them.[[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 08:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I think some doctor should put some specific counter arguments against some of the specific the book is claiming. I sense that the author of this book deeply believes what he or she wrote, so he or she deserves some scientific arguments.  May be those sections that can not be proved or were just made up should be marked as that are controversial. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

== What should be done with this book? ==

I think that this book needs almost completely rewritten and reorganized as an introduction to depression. Or it needs to be removed from wikibooks.
My reason for this is it contains large amounts of unsighted or original research and information based on individual experience. According to the &quot;What Wikibooks is not&quot; section of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] large parts of this book do not qualify for being part of a Wikibook. At the vary least it needs removed from the completed books book shelf. What are other peoples opinions [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 09:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I would not remove this book. The claims it is making could be true, based on 'individual experience'.  If scientifically proven that the book claims are incorrect then I would remove it. In the meantime it could be moved to a controversial state. There are some precedence, where 'individual experiences' were strongly rejected and eventually turned out to be true. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

== I'd move to remove... ==

I read this book with some care.  I see very little merit in it and much potential for disseminating misconceptions and unfounded speculation about a very important subject.  Does the nature of wiki mean that we have no reponsibility to try to ensure good quality information?  Despite the caveats, this book is seriously likely to misinform people including sufferers about a potentially very dangerous illness.

== Unfortunately not a 'wikibook' ==

I personally think that this work has its merits in giving a new public perspective (as far as I am aware) on depression. Upon reading the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], however, I do not think that it qualifies unless properly cited or founded, as it is certainly not a textbook, rather an interesting essay. Simply put, I do not think that this is the place for the book; but I do think that it should be part of a public reading list somewhere on depression (I assume somewhere on Wiki), if not simply for the debate it causes.

== My editing spree ==

In case any one noticed I went through and just destroyed everything I though was obviously wrong or does not fit the guidelines for what should be on wiki books. I realize this was not the most democratic method but it needed done and I was in the mood. The whole book still need restructured perhaps in the form of three major sections What is Depression, Treatments, Other Issues. It also all needs cited. If disagree with any of my changes feel free to revert. The book is currently a mess with many pages now blank in need of deletion but I could not figure out how to do that so perhaps some one more knowledgeable can help with that. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 11:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
: I do not agree all the deletions. Deleting something because being in the mood is the definitation of vandalism. I think a warning on the discussion page before deletion is the wiki policy we should follow.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 16:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I understand revert anything you feel is actually within the guide lines of things that should be on wiki books. Relize however the most of the information I deleted was in direct confrontation with much higher quality article on wikipedia. It just seemed to me that there had been a consensus for a while for deletion but no one had done anything. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 17:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== If this stays it is certainly inappropriately indexed ==
As a psychiatrist, and a wikipedia member I must say that the inclusion of this book under Health is completely unfair to to people seeking high quality information. It does provide one person's perspective without scientific data or sources, and it may have some value in shedding light on the publics viewpoint. However, this is not a book about Health. At best this should fall under Self-Help or perhaps Editorial. I refrain to get into the argument about whether this should be completely removed or not, but it certainly has no place whatsoever within the category of health.
[[User:Slippy007|Slippy007]] March 30, 2007

== VfD ==

I personally feel that this book had some good information before it was mostly all deleted by Lonjers.  However, if the requirements for inclusion here are the same as Wikipedia, than original research is not welcome and thus this book should be outright deleted.  I don't know why it hasn't been put up for deletion given the general consensus.  However, there is a [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy|deletion policy]] in effect here.  As I do not believe it should be deleted I'm not going to put it up myself, but there you have it. [[User:Spoom|Spoom]] ([[User talk:Spoom|talk]]) 18:17, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

== I am depressed and THIS IS THE BEST PIECE OF INFORMATION I FOUND ==

I am depressed for years. Due to traumas and ongoing personal issues... I am educated person and read everything I could find about depresion ... I am went to therapy - 8 different highly qualified medical professionals and 2 MD who gave me meds. Results? -traditional medical community has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING USEFULL for me. I just learn to copy not to recover.
So I think they should even post here.

== The Controversy about Antidepressants ==

This is largely country-dependent: in some countries their use is widespread and generates little
discussion; in others, many factors contribute to making them practically taboo words.  The country
where I live, the Netherlands, tends towards the taboo end of the spectrum.  The reason has a lot
to do with the prevalent (and backwards if you ask me) Calvinist mentality.  I know that in
other places, such as most of North America and Southern Europe they are much more readily
accepted.  Your mileage may vary.

The controversy is typically framed in the following ways: doctors nowadays over-prescribe
antidepressants, instead of following the psychotherapy route; antidepressants are just
a ploy from the evil pharmaceutical multinationals; our societies are drifting towards
a &quot;Brave New World&quot; scenario where drugs are used to keep the populace happy and unable
to rebel.  Well, my personal opinion is that there is some substance to some of these
worries, but they are largely exaggerated and fail to acknowledge one very important
fact: antidepressants are very effective in treating clinical depression.  This is not
a matter of opinion: it has been demonstrated in several double-blind clinical trials.

First, on the issue of over-prescription.  I would say that they are both over-prescribed
and under-prescribed.  The problem is that most doctors do not understand depression well,
and will prescribe drugs to people whose brains are healthy, and fail to provide them
to people who could actually benefit from them.  Take people who are mourning, for example.
In most cases, these people do not have a depression.  Grief is something perfectly normal,
and its onset is all too sudden to cause a depression (remember that a depression typically
takes ''years'' to develop).  Likewise, consider giving antidepressants to very young
people: the brain of a child or even a teenager has such a fantastic ability to repair
itself that it takes quite a pounding for a depression to develop.  In these cases,
antidepressants and all their unavoidable side effects are more likely to hurt than to help.
On the other hand, there are people who have minor problems with stress and anxiety,
or whose blood pressure is above normal for no apparent reason.  They are often simply
told that they should watch out for salt in their diets, or to take up yoga or meditation.
This advice might help, but only to a certain degree.  I suspect that a course of an
antidepressant would have a stronger and more lasting effect.

Moving on to the subject of side-effects.  Modern antidepressants are generally well-tolerated
and safe to use.  They do have side-effects, which depending on the drug and the person can
be significant enough that people discontinue taking the medication.  However, this is yet
another issue where proper handling by a competent professional will make a huge difference.
What one often finds is that people are given the wrong drug for their case.  Imagine for example
an overweight patient being given an antidepressant which increases appetite, or someone
who has a satisfactory sex life and is given a drug which upsets their libido.
What is required is matching the profile of the patient with the expected side-effects of
the drug.  Granted, there is plenty of variation among individuals, but the overall
pattern is still strong enough that we can categorically say what will be the most likely
side-effects of a given antidepressant.  A straightforward discussion with a good professional
will go a long way towards finding a drug tuned to your particular case, thus minimising
the negative side-effects and decreasing the chances of premature discontinuation.

Finally on to the subject of psychotherapy.  As someone who had a depression, I can assure
you that there is nothing more patronising and irritating than people who bring up
the &quot;psychological help&quot;.  A depressed person will definitely need professional help,
but mostly for a proper explanation of the problem, to learn relaxation techniques,
to know how to listen to their bodies, and to be coached in the lifestyle changes
required for giving their brains a chance to recover.
Once they are recovered, perhaps some therapy might be needed to make sure
that whatever behavioural patterns which contributed to the development of the illness
will not recur.  However, and I cannot stress this enough, therapy is not a
substitute for medication, and &quot;psychological help&quot; is a misunderstanding.

== Slicker? ==

:&quot;While KDE's interface is normally considered slicker and more polished to that of GNOME possibly due to the underlying Qt toolkit, GTK is a very popular toolkit for Linux and so most apps have better integration with GNOME.&quot;
Hmmm... how can we say this in a less-biased way? --[[User:Jcarroll|Jcarroll]] 05:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== Task Bar ==

:&quot;GNOME takes the Mac OS X approach, placing the task bar on top of the screen and a separate bar for currently-open applications (the Task Bar).&quot;

Isn't this is entirely under the control of the user?  I'm pretty sure that it is, since I've configured my gnome/ubuntu install to have a single combined windows-style task bar at the bottom of the screen.</text>

== Panoramic Renderings ==

=== This Article is Out Of Date ===

Panoramic features were changed somewhere between 2.37a and 2.42. More information, including how to actually use panorama, can be found in this thread in the forums: http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?p=797886

=== Building the Example Scene ===

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaA.png|thumb|300px|right|The example scene, see from above]]

Ever wondered how that cool looking 360 degree panoramas that you see on some websites are made?  Well, I don't know either, so someone else will have to tell about that. What I found out though is how to make Blender output a 360 degree panoramic image - quite probably this at least is the first step when making something like on those websites.

Now, let's try to progress like in a tutorial, as in the other pages of this Wikibook. So, fire up Blender, and look at the well known initial box scene. Or rather, change it somehow. Assuming you have read the book in order, it shouldn't be hard to get something like in the picture.

{{clr}}

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaB.png|thumb|300px|right|The example camera, seen from the side]]

I placed the camera and the light both above the origin, deleted the cube, and added 8 cylinders, all around the origin. One way to do this is to place one cylinder, then duplicate and rotate it around the origin. For this to work, set the rotation center to the 3D-cursor (with the Pivot button), and position the 3D cursor at the origin (use '''SHIFT+S''' to make the 3D cursor snap to the grid).Place the first cylinder using '''GKEY''' and then holding '''CTRL''' while moving the mouse. Change to object mode, then use '''SHIFT+D''' to duplicate it. Next, press '''RKEY''' to rotate it, then hold '''CTRL''' while rotating it by 45 degrees. Repeat the same for the remaining cylinders. Use '''G''' to move the light. Use '''NKEY''' to enter the camera values like shown, so it looks parallel to the ground.

{{clr}}

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaC.png|thumb|300px|right|The complete scene with a ground cylinder]]

Speaking of ground, lets also add a ground. I added another cylinder, below the other ones, as shown. It's easy to add by switching to front view ('''NUM1'''), duplicating a cylinder ('''SHIFT+DKEY'''), and then moving it holding '''CTRL''' pressed again, so it snaps to the grid. To scale it, use the '''SKEY''' , but hit '''SHIFT+ZKEY''' to lock the z scaling, and hold '''CTRL''' pressed while scaling in x and y direction so you can snap to the exact size you want.

Now, to have a complete scene, we need some colors. I made the ground cylinder green, the 8 example cylinders gray, and also added a noise normal to the ground. This doesn't really matter here though, just needed some example scene for the 360° camera.

{{clr}}

Something more interesting is the sky texture, because Blender's sky can be made to seamlessly wrap around with 360 degree. Belows is a screenshot of the sky settings I used. To get there, click on the Shading button, then select World.

[[Image:BlenderButtonsShadingWorld.png|The Shading-&gt;World Button]]

To change the texture, click the textures button or press '''F6''', then add a new texture with the small button with two arrows, and select the type (e.g. &quot;Marble&quot; or &quot;Clouds&quot;) instead of &quot;None&quot; for the texture. Go back to the World pane, and enable the Real and Blend buttons. And don't forget to use nice colors, I used blue and white. Now it looks a bit like white clouds in a blue sky.

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaD.png|The example sky]]

[Maybe should add here more details? What is important so you don't get a seam at the 0 - 360 degree point? How do you map pre-made sky textures?]

And we are already done, this is the example scene. All that is left to do is to render it as a panorama.

{{clr}}

=== Panoramic Rendering ===

Go to the render settings ('''F10'''), and click the Pano button. Change the Xparts value to 4. The value in Xparts will tell how many times the camera will 'turn' horizontally when rendering. The Yparts value would do the same vertically. Each part (Xparts or Yparts) will render the size of the whole image you set. To make things easier, make the output image size quadratic and set both X and Y Aspect to 100. E.g. make your image size 600x600, but not 800x600, otherwise the following will not work.

[[Image:BlenderCameraSettings.png|right|The camera settings]]

If you want a seemless 360 degree view, it is important to know how many degrees one single image spans. For example, if you know one image is 90 degree, then you can set Xparts to 4, and the result will be a single panoramic picture, and with the right panorama viewer, you can spin around in it endlessly.

But, how do you make a single picture 90 degree? The angle a picture spans is called field of view (FOV). And it is a property of the camera. To change it, select your camera, then click the edit button (or hit '''F9'''). Make sure you haven't set your camera to orthographic (the &quot;Ortho&quot; button), since FOV only exists with a normal camera.

You can directly enter the FOV in Blender's camera settings (as of version 2.42) - Toggle the 'D' button on, next to the parameter called '''Lens'''. Type in 90 to get a 90 degree FOV. Now hit '''F12''' to render our test image.

If you want, you can also try it out with any other scene. Place the camera somewhere in the middle with a good view all around, set the camera's '''Lens''' to 90, and go into the render settings ('''F10'''). Set '''Xparts''' to 4, enable '''Pano''', and render. You should get an image 4 times as wide as a normal image, and the left and right edges should fit together seemlessly. Also note that Blender doesn't know if it should apply the FOV as horizontal or vertical viewing angle, but we always want it to be the horizontal angle. Therefore just make the single images of the panorama quadratic, as mentioned above - then horizontal and vertical FOV is the same and Blender gets it right.

This is the resulting panoramic image:

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaE.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Panorama with 4 parts.]]

'''Warning: Didn't convert following lens settings to the new possibility with the 'D'-button for passing the FOV value directly.'''
One problem remains, the image will be quite distorted. This is because a FOV of 90 degree is too high. Let's try with 45 degree and 8 XParts instead. As you will have noticed when playing around with the Lens parameter before, setting Lens to 8 instead of 16 will not achieve this, it will make the FOV even bigger. Setting it to 32 looks better, but definitely is not 45 degree. The picture to the right explains how FOV and Lens relate to each other:

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LensAndFOV.png|thumb|150px|right|The '''Lens''' parameter of the Blender camera.]] --&gt;

The camera is at the bottom, the red angle is our desired FOV, and the length of the green line is what the Lens parameter represents in Blender. Therefore, the formula to calulcate Lens when we know FOV:

:&lt;b&gt;Lens&lt;/b&gt; = 16 / tan(&lt;b&gt;FOV&lt;/b&gt; / 2)

For a FOV of 45 degree, we therefore get a Lens of 38.627. Now, write that into the Lens field in the camera settings, and render with 8 XParts. This time it will render an output image which is 8 times as wide as a normal output image, and again it will be a seamless 360 degree all around panorama of your scene. And this time with less distortion. With the above formula, you can now use any number of XParts you want - just divide 360 by the number of parts, and calculate the Lens parameter for the resulting FOV. Note that you also need to take the Aspect settings into account, unless you set it to 100 and create a quadratic output, as we did.

Some Lens settings:

* 4 parts: 16
* 8 parts: 38.627
* 16 parts: 80.437

The output with 8 parts can be seen below.

==Overview of Blood==
The primary function of blood is to supply oxygen and nutrients as well as constitutional elements to tissues and to remove waste products. Blood also enables hormones and other substances to be transported between tissues and organs. Problems with blood composition or circulation can lead to downstream tissue malfunction. Blood is also involved in maintaining homeostasis by acting as a medium for transferring heat to the skin and by acting as a buffer system for bodily pH.

The blood is circulated through the lungs and body by the pumping action of the heart. The right ventricle pressurizes the blood to send it through the capillaries of the lungs, while the left ventricle re-pressurizes the blood to send it throughout the body. Pressure is essentially lost in the capillaries, hence gravity and especially the actions of skeletal muscles are needed to return the blood to the heart.

[[Image:Heart-and-lungs.jpg‎|thumb|right|Blood circulation from the heart to the lungs.]]
===Gas Exchange===
'''Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is the most immediate need of every cell and is carried throughout the body by the blood circulation.  Oxygen is used at the cellular level as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain (the primary method of generating ATP for cellular reactions). Oxygen is carried in the blood bound to hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. Hemoglobin binds oxygen when passing through the alveoli of the lungs and releases oxygen in the warmer, more acidic environment of bodily tissues, via simple diffusion.

'''Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is removed from tissues by blood and released into the air via the lungs. Carbon dioxide is produced by cells as they undergo the processes of cellular respiration (particularly the Kreb's Cycle). The molecules are produced from carbons that were originally part of glucose. Most of the carbon dioxide combines with water and is carried in the plasma as bicarbonate ions. An excess of carbon dioxide (through exercise, or from holding ones breath) quickly shifts the blood pH to being more acidic (acidosis). Chemoreceptors in the brain and major blood vessels detect this shift and stimulate the breathing center of the brain (the medulla oblongata). Hence, as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels build up and the blood becomes more acidic, we involuntarily breathe faster, thus lowering CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels and stabilizing blood pH. In contrast, a person who is hyperventilating (such as during a panic attack) will expire more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than being produced in the body and the blood will become too alkaline (alkalosis).

==Blood Composition==

'''Blood''' is a circulating tissue composed of fluid plasma and cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets). Anatomically, blood is considered a connective tissue, due to its origin in the bones and its function. ''Blood'' is the means and transport system of the body used in carrying elements (e.g. nutrition, waste, heat) from one location in the body to another, by way of blood vessels. 


Blood is made of two parts:

# Plasma which makes up 55% of blood volume.
# Formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells, and platelets) which combine to make the remaining 45% of blood volume. 

===Plasma makeup===
'''Plasma''' is made up of 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains bloods osmotic integrity, others clot, etc), 1% carbon-dioxide, and 1% elements in transit. One percent of the plasma is salt, which helps with the pH of the blood.  The largest group of solutes in plasma contains three important proteins to be discussed.  There are: ''albumins'', ''globulins'', and ''clotting proteins''.

''Albumins'' are the most common group of proteins in plasma and consist of nearly two-thirds of them (60-80%).  They are produced in the liver.  The main function of albumins is to maintain the osmotic balance between the blood and tissue fluids and is called ''colloid osmotic pressure''.  In addition, albumins assist in transport of different materials, such as vitamins and certain molecules and drugs (e.g. bilirubin, fatty acids, and penicillin).

''Globulins'' are a diverse group of proteins, designated into three groups:  gamma, alpha, and beta.  Their main function is to transport various substances in the blood.  Gamma globulins assist the body's immune system in defense against infections and illness. 

''Clotting proteins'' are mainly produced in the liver as well.  There are at least 12 substances, known as &quot;clotting factors&quot; that participate in the clotting process.  One important clotting protein that is part of this group is ''fibrinogen'', one of the main components in the formation of blood clots.  In response to tissue damage, fibrinogen makes fibrin threads, which serve as adhesive in binding platelets, red blood cells, and other molecules together, to stop the blood flow.  (This will be discussed in more detail later on in the chapter.)

''Plasma'' also carries Respiratory gases; CO2 in large amounts(about 97%) and O2 in small amounts(about 3%), various nutrients(glucose, fats), wastes of metabolic exchange(urea, ammonia), hormones, and vitamins.

===Red Blood Cells===


====Overview====

'''Red blood cell (erythrocyte)''' also known as &quot;RBCs&quot;. RBCs are formed in the '''myeloid tissue''' or most commonly known as red bone marrow, although when the body is under severe conditions the yellow bone marrow, which is also in the fatty places of the marrow in the body will also make RBCs. The formation of RBCs is called '''erythropoiesis''' ( ''erythro / red; poiesis /'' ''formation''). Red blood cells lose nuclei upon maturation, and take on a biconcave, dimpled, shape. They are about 7-8 micrometers in diameter. There are about 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells. RBCs live about 120 days and do not self repair. RBCs contain hemoglobin which  transports oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, such as to the muscles, where it releases the oxygen load.The hemoglobin gets its red color from their respiratory pigments.


'''Shape'''

RBCS have a shape of a disk that appears to be “caved in” or almost flattened in the middle; this is called ''bi-concave''.  This bi-concave shape allows the RBC to carry oxygen and pass through even the smallest capillaries in the lungs. This shape also allows RBCs to stack like dinner plates and bend as they flow smoothly through the narrow blood vessels in the body. RBCs lack a nucleus (no DNA) and no organelles, meaning that these cells cannot divide or replicate themselves like the cells in our skin and muscles. RBCs have a short life span of about 120 days, however, as long as our myeloid tissue is working correctly, we will produce about 2-3 million RBCs per second. That is about 200 billion a day! This allows us to have more to replace the ones we lose. 


'''Main Component'''

The main component of the RBC is '''hemoglobin''' protein, of which there are about 250 million per cell. The word hemoglobin comes from &quot;hemo&quot; meaning blood and &quot;globin&quot; meaning protein. Hemoglobin is composed of four protein subunits: polypeptide globin chains that contain anywhere from 141 to 146 amino acids. Hemoglobin is responsible for the cell’s ability to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin, iron, and oxygen interact with each other, forming the RBCs' bright red color. You can call this interaction by product '''oxyhemoglobin'''. Carbon Monoxide binds with hemoglobin faster than oxygen, and stays bound for several hours, making hemoglobin temporarily unavailable for oxygen transport. One red blood cell contains about 200 million hemoglobin molecules. If all this hemoglobin was in the plasma rather than inside the cells, blood would be so &quot;thick&quot; that the heart would have a difficult time pumping it through. The thickness of blood is called viscosity. The greater the viscosity of blood, the more friction there is, and more pressure is needed to force blood through.

====Functions====
The main function is the transportation of oxygen throughout the body and the ability of the blood to carry out carbon dioxide which is called '''carbamino – hemoglobin'''. Maintaining the balance of blood is important. The balance can be measured by the acid and base levels in the blood. This is called '''pH'''. Normal pH of blood ranges between 7.35-7.45; this normal blood is called '''Alkaline''' (less acidic then water). A drop in pH is called '''Acidic'''. This condition is also called '''Acidosis'''. A jump in pH higher then 7.45 is called &quot;'''Alkalosis'''&quot;. To maintain the homeostasis (or balance,) the blood has tiny molecules within the RBC that help prevent drops or increases from happening.

[[Image:Red White Blood cells.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right diagram of '''Erythrocyte, Thrombocyte, and Leukocyte]]

'''Destruction'''

Red blood cells are broken down and hemoglobin is released. The globin part of the hemoglobin is broken down into amino acid components, which in turn are recycled by the body. The iron is recovered and returned to the bone marrow to be reused. The heme portion of the molecule experiences a chemical change and then gets excreted as bile pigment (bilirubin) by the liver. Heme portion after being broken down contributes to the color of feces and your skin color changing after being bruised.

===White Blood Cells===

'''Shape'''

White blood cells are different from red cells in the fact that they are usually larger in size 10-14 micrometers in diameter. White blood cells do not contain hemoglobin which in turn makes them translucent. Many times in diagrams or pictures white blood cells are represented in a blue color, mainly because blue is the color of the stain used to see the cells. White blood cells also have nucleii, that are some what segmented and are surrounded by electrons inside the membrane.

====Functions====

'''White blood cells (leukocytes)''' are also known as &quot;WBC's&quot;. White blood cells are made in the bone marrow but they also divide in the blood and lymphatic systems. They are commonly amoeboid (cells that move or feed by means of temporary projections, called pseudopods (false feet), and escape the circulatory system through the capillary beds. The different types of WBC's are '''Basophils''', '''Eosinophils''', '''Neutrophils''', '''Monocytes''', '''B-''' and '''T-cell lymphocytes'''. Neutrophils, Eosinophils, and Basophils are all '''granular''' leukocytes. Lymphocytes and Monocytes are '''agranular''' leukocytes.  Basophils store and synthesize histamine which is important in allergic reactions.  They enter the tissues and become &quot;mast cells&quot; which help blood flow to injured tissues by the release of histamine. Eosinophils are chemotoxic and kill parasites. Neutrophils are the first to act when there is an infection and are also the most abundant white blood cells. Neutrophils fight bacteria and viruses by ''phagocytosis'' which mean they engulf pathogens that may cause infection. The life span of a of Neutrophil is only about 12-48 hours. Monocytes are the biggest of the white blood cells and are responsible for rallying the cells to defend the body. Monocytes carry out phagocytosis and are also called macrophages. Lymphocytes help with our immune response. There are two Lymphocytes: the B- and T- cell. B-Lymphocytes produce antibodies that find and mark pathogens for destruction. T-Lymphocytes kill anything that they deem abnormal to the body.

WBCs are classified by phenotype which can be identified by looking at the WBCs under a microscope. The Granular phenotype  are able to stain blue. The Agranular phenotype are able to stain red. Neutrophils make up 50-70% of Granular cells Eosinophils make up 2-4%, and Basophils 0-1%. Monocytes make up 2-8% of Agranular cells. B and T Lymphocytes make up 20-30%.   As you can see, there is a great deal of differentiation between WBCs. These special cells help our bodies defend themselves against pathogens. Not only do they help our immune system but they remove toxins, wastes, and abnormal or damaged cells. Thus, we can say that WBCs' main function is being Phagocytic which means to engulf or swallow cells.

===Platelets===
[[Image:Platelet blood bag.jpg|thumb|150px|A 250 ml bag of newly collected platelets.]]
Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are membrane-bound cell fragments. Platelets have no nucleus,they  are between one to two  micrometers in diameter, and are about 1/10th to 1/20th as abundant as white blood cells. Less than 1% of whole blood consists of platelets. They result from fragmentation of large cells called Megakaryocytes - which are cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. Platelets are produced at a rate of 200 billion per day. Their production is regulated by the hormone called Thrombopoietin. The circulating life of a platelet is 8–10 days. The sticky surface of the platelets allow them to accumulate at the site of broken blood vessels to form a clot.  This aids in the process of hemostasis (&quot;blood stopping&quot;).  Platelets secrete factors that increase local platelet aggregation (e.g., Thromboxane A), enhance vasoconstriction (e.g., Serotonin), and promote blood coagulation (e.g., Thromboplastin).

==Hemostasis (Coagulation or Clotting)==

Hemostasis is the natural process of stopping blood flow or loss of blood following an injury. (''hemo'' = blood; ''stasis'' = standing). It has three stages: (1) vascular spasm, vasoconstriction, or intense contraction of blood vessels, (2) formation of a platelet plug and (3) blood clotting or coagulation. Once the flow of blood has been stopped, tissue repair can begin. 

'''Vascular spasm or Vasoconsriction:'''
In a normal individual, immediately after a blood vessel has been cut and endothelial cells are damaged, vasoconstriction occurs, thus slowing blood flow to the area. Smooth muscle in the vessel wall goes through spasms or intense contractions that constrict the vessel. If the vessels are small, spasms compress the inner walls together and may be able to stop the bleeding completely. If the vessels are medium to large-sized, the spasms slow down immediate outflow of blood, lessening the damage but still preparing the vessel for the later steps of hemostasis. These vascular spasms usually last for about 30 minutes, long enough for the next two stages of hemostasis to take place.

'''Formation of a Platelet Plug:'''
Within 20 seconds of an injury, coagulation is initiated. Contrary to popular belief, clotting of a cut on the skin is not initiated by air or drying out, but by platelets adhering to and activated by collagen in the blood vessels endothelium. The activated platelets then release the contents of their granules, which contain a variety of substances that stimulate further platelet activation and enhance the hemostatic process. 

When the lining of a blood vessel breaks and endothelial cells are damaged, revealing collagen proteins in the vessel wall, platelets swell, grow spiky extensions, and start clumping together. They start to stick to each other and the walls of the vessel. This continues as more platelets congregate and undergo these same transformations. This process results in a platelet plug that seals the injured area. If the injury is small, a platelet plug may be able to form and close it within several seconds. If the damage is more serious, the next step of blood clotting will take place. Platelets contain secretory granules. When they stick to the proteins in the vessel walls, they ''degranulate'', thus releasing their products, which include ADP (adenosine diphosphate), serotonin, and thromboxane A2. 

'''A Blood Clot Forms:'''
If the platelet plug is not enough to stop the bleeding, the third stage of hemostasis begins: the formation of a blood clot. First, blood changes from a liquid to a gel. At least 12 substances called ''clotting factors'' take part in a series of chemical reactions that eventually create a mesh of protein fibers within the blood. Each of the ''clotting factors'' has a very specific function. We will discuss just three of the substances here: prothrombin, thrombin, and fibrin. Prothrombin and fibrinogen are proteins that are produced and deposited in the blood by the liver. 

*''Prothrombin'': When blood vessels are damaged, vessels and nearby platelets are stimulated to release a substance called ''prothrombin activator'', which in turn activates the conversion of ''prothrombin'', a plasma protein, into an enzyme called ''thrombin''. This reaction requires calcium ions. 

*''Thrombin'': ''Thrombin'' facilitates the conversion of a soluble plasma protein called ''fibrinogen'' into long insoluble fibers or threads of the protein ''fibrin''.

*''Fibrin'': Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to form its active form, &quot;fibrin.&quot;  Fibrin threads wind around the platelet plug at the damaged area of the blood vessel, forming an interlocking network of fibers and a framework for the clot. This net of fibers traps and helps hold platelets, blood cells and other molecules tight to the site of injury, functioning as the initial clot. This temporary fibrin clot can form in less than a minute, and usually does a good job of reducing the blood flow. Next, platelets in the clot begin to shrink, tightening the clot and drawing together the vessel walls. Usually, this whole process of clot formation and tightening takes less than a half hour.

The use of adsorbent chemicals, such as zeolites, and other hemostatic agents, are also being explored for use in sealing severe injuries quickly.

==ABO Group System==

The '''ABO blood group''' is represented by substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). These substances are important because they contain specific sequences of amino acid and carbohydrates which are antigenic. As well as being on the surface of RBCs, some of these antigens are also present on the cells of other tissues. A complete blood type describes the set of 29 substances on the surface of RBCs, and an individual's blood type is one of the many possible combinations of blood group antigens.  Usually only the ABO blood group system and the presence or absence of the Rhesus D antigen (also known as the Rhesus factor or RH factor) are determined and used to describe the blood type. Over 400 different blood group antigens have been found, many of these being very rare. If an individual is exposed to a blood group antigen that is not recognized as self, the individual can become sensitized to that antigen; the immune system makes specific antibodies which binds specifically to a particular blood group antigen and an immunological memory against that particular antigen is formed. These antibodies can bind to antigens on the surface of transfused red blood cells (or other tissue cells) often leading to destruction of the cells by recruitment of other components of the immune system. Knowledge of a individual's blood type is important to identify appropriate blood for transfusion or tissue for organ transplantation.

===Surface Antigens===
 
Several different RBC surface antigens stemming from one allele (or very closely linked genes) are collectively labeled as a blood group system (or blood group). The two most important blood group systems were discovered during early experiments with blood transfusion, the ABO group in 1901 and the Rhesus group in 1937 . These two blood groups are reflected in the common nomenclature A positive, O negative, etc. with letters referring to the ABO group and positive/negative to the presence/absence of the RhD antigen of the Rhesus group. Development of the Coombs test in 1945 and the advent of transfusion medicine led to discovery of more blood groups.

'''Blood Group AB''' individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood serum does not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen. Therefore, a individual with type AB blood can receive blood from any group (with AB being preferable), but can only donate blood to another group AB individual. AB blood is also known as &quot;Universal receiver.&quot; 

'''Blood Group A''' individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the B antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can only receive blood from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals of groups A or AB. 

'''Blood Group B''' individuals have the B antigen on their surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can only receive blood from individuals of groups B or O (with B being preferabe), and can donate blood to individuals of groups B or AB. 

'''Blood group O''' individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, but their blood serum contains IgM antibodies against both A and B antigens. Therefore, a group O individual can only receive blood from a group O individual, but they can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (ie A, B, O or AB). O blood is also know as &quot;Universal donor.&quot;

===Inheritance===

Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene with three alleles: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. 

IA gives type A,
IB gives type B,
i give types O

IA and IB are dominant over i, so ii people have type O, IAIA or IAi have A, and IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes because A and B  are codominant, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. Thus, it is extremely unlikely for a type AB parent to have a type O child (it is not, however, direct proof of illegitimacy): the cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.

'''Rh Factor'''

Many people have the Rh Factor on the red blood cell. Rh carriers do not have the antibodies for the Rh Factor, but can make them if exposed to Rh. Most commonly Rh is seen when anti-Rh antibodies cross from the mothers placenta into the child before birth. The Rh Factor enters the child destroying the child's red blood cells. This is called Hemolytic Disease.

===Compatibility in Blood/Plasma Transfusions ===

Blood transfusions between donor and recipient of incompatible blood types can cause severe acute immunological reactions, hemolysis (RBCT destruction), renal failure, shock, and sometimes death. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.

A patient should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction. If time allows, the risk will further be reduced by cross-matching blood, in addition to blood typing both recipient and donor. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's blood with a sample of the donor's blood and checking to see if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. Blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope, and if it occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. Blood transfusion is a potentially risky medical procedure and it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so in cross-matching labeling is standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.

When considering a plasma transfusion, keep in mind that plasma carries antibodies and no antigens. For example you can't give type O plasma to a type A, B or AB, because a person with type O blood has A and B antibodies and the recipient would have an immune response. On the other hand an AB donor could give plasma to anyone, since they have no antibodies.

The table to the right is for plasma transfusions, and it's just the opposite for RBC transfusions. It doesn't take the Rh factor into effect, though, because most people don't have antibodies for the Rhesus factor (it only happens upon exposure).


====Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn====

Often a pregnant woman carries a fetus with a different blood type to herself, and sometimes the mother forms antibodies against the red blood cells of the fetus, leading to low fetal blood counts, a condition known as hemolytic disease of the newborn.

Hemolytic disease of the newborn, (also known as HDN) is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus when the IgG antibodies produced by the mother and passing through the placenta include ones which attack the red blood cells in the fetal circulation. The red cells are broken down and the fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. The fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe and fetal death from heart failure - hydrops fetalis - can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe many erythroblasts are present in the fetal blood and so these forms of the disease can be called erythroblastosis fetalis.

Before birth, options for treatment include intrauterine transfusion or early induction of labor when pulmonary maturity has been attained, fetal distress is present, or 35 to 37 weeks of gestation have passed. The mother may also undergo plasma exchange to reduce the circulating levels of antibody by as much as 75%.

After birth, treatment depends on the severity of the condition, but could include temperature stabilization and monitoring, phototherapy, transfusion with compatible packed red blood, exchange transfusion with a blood type compatible with both the infant and the mother, sodium bicarbonate for correction of acidosis and/or assisted ventilation.

Rh negative mothers who have had a pregnancy with or are pregnant with a Rh positive infant, are given Rh immune globulin (RhIG) also known as Rhogam, during pregnancy and after delivery to prevent sensitization to the D antigen. It works by binding any fetal red cells with the D antigen before the mother is able to produce an immune response and form anti-D IgG. A drawback to pre-partum administration of RhIG is that it causes a positive antibody screen when the mother is tested which is indistinguishable from immune reasons for antibody production.

==Diseases of the Blood==
===Von Willebrand Disease===

The most common inherited bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease affects both men and women equally.  Von Willebrand disease is similar to hemophilia in that it involves a definciency in the ability of blood to clot properly.  Those affect by von Willebrand disease will have one or more of the following- low levels of von Willebrand factor (a protein that helps the blood to clot), and/or their von Willebrand factor doesn't work properly.  While it is mostly an inherited disease (with factors contributed by both parents), von Willebrand disease may be an aquired syndrome in rare cases. 

There are three types of von Willebrand disease: Type 1, which is the mildest and most common form of the disease; Type 2, which has four subtypes (2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N) and ranges from mild to moderate in severity; and finally, Type 3, which is very rare and is the most severe form.

;Type 1:
In type 1 von Willebrand disease, there is a low level of von Willebrand factor. The level of factor VIII may also be lower than normal. This is the mildest and most common form of the disease. About 3 out of 4 people diagnosed with von Willebrand disease have type 1. 

;Type 2:
In type 2 von Willebrand disease, a defect in von Willebrand factor causes it to not work properly. Type 2 is divided into 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. Each is treated differently, so knowing the exact type is important.

People with type 1 and type 2 von Willebrand disease may have the following mild-to-moderate bleeding symptoms: easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums after a dental procedure, heavy menstrual bleeding in women, blood in their stools or urine (from bleeding in the intestines, stomach, kidneys or bladder), excessive bleeding after a cut or other accident or surgery.

;Type 3:
People with type 3 von Willebrand disease usually have no von Willebrand factor and very low factor VIII. Type 3 is severe and very rare.

Symptoms of type 3 von Willebrand disease might include any of the symptoms of types 1 and 2, and also include severe bleeding episodes for no reason, which can be life threatening if not treated immediately. Bleeding into soft tissues or joints (hemarthrosis), causing severe pain and swelling, is another symptom.

;Treatment:

Many people with von Willebrand disease do not require treatment to manage the disease.  However, if treatment is ncessary, it may include a range of different interventions depending on the severity.  These involve medicine to increase the level of von Willebrand factor in the blood (DDAVP), medicine to prevent the breakdown of clots (called antifibrinolytic drugs), medicine to control heavy menstrual bleeding in women (often birth control pills), or injection of clotting factor concentrates (containing von Willebrand factor and factor VIII).

===Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation===

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), also called consumptive coagulopathy, is a pathological process in the body where the blood starts to coagulate throughout the whole body. This depletes the body of its platelets and coagulation factors, and there is a paradoxically increased risk of hemorrhage. It occurs in critically ill patients, especially those with Gram-negative sepsis (particularly meningococcal sepsis) and acute promyelocytic leukemia.

===Hemophilia===

Hemophilia is a disease where there is low or no blood protein, causing an inability to produce blood clots. There are two types of Hemophilia: Type A, which is a deficiency in factor VIII and Type B, (Christmas disease) a deficiency on factor IX. Because people with hemophilia do not have the ability to make blood clots, even a little cut may kill them, or the smallest bump or jar to the body could cause severe bruising that doesn't get better for months. 

Hemophilia is passed down from mothers to their sons.  Hemophilia is sometimes known as the &quot;Royal Disease&quot;. This is because Queen Victoria, Queen of England (1837-1901), was a carrier of hemophilia. The hemophilia disease was passed down to her son Leopold who ended up dying at age 31. Queen Victoria also had two daughters who were carriers. These daughters passed hemophilia into the Spanish, German, and Russian royal families. One of the most famous stories is that of the Russian royal family. Alexandra, granddaughter to Queen Victoria, married Nicholas (Tsar of Russia in the 1900s). Alexandra was a carrier of the disease and passed the disease to their first son, Tsarevich Alexi, who was heir to the throne of Russia. The family tried to keep their son's secret from the people, but Alexi suffered with serious bruises and extreme pain. The family found help from a monk named Rasputin.  He kept their secret and gained a great deal of power over the family, making them think he was their only hope. During this time of great turmoil in Russia,  Nicholas and Alexandra spent most of their attentions on their son, and not on the people. It wasn't long before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 began.



===Factor V Leiden===

The opposite of Hemophilia, Factor V Leiden is the name given to a variant of human factor V that causes a hypercoagulability disorder. In this disorder the Leiden variant of factor V, cannot be inactivated by activated protein C. Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability disorder amongst Eurasians. It is named after the city Leiden (The Netherlands), where it was first identified in 1994 by Prof R. Bertina et al.  Those that have it are at a slightly higher risk of developing blood clots than those without.  Those that test positive for factor V should avoid (oral contraceptives, obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure.)

===Anemia===

Anemia (AmE) or anaemia (BrE), from the Greek (Ἀναιμία) meaning &quot;without blood&quot;, refers to a deficiency of red blood cells (RBCs) and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, causing hypoxia.  Since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.

The three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective hematopoiesis). In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production.

===Sickle cell=== 

[[Image:Sicklecells.jpg|right|framed|Image of RBC's with Sickle Cell mutations.]]

Sickle-cell disease is a general term for a group of genetic disorders caused by sickle hemoglobin (Hgb S or Hb S). In many forms of the disease, the red blood cells change shape upon deoxygenation because of polymerization of the abnormal sickle hemoglobin. This process damages the red blood cell membrane, and can cause the cells to become stuck in blood vessels. This deprives the downstream tissues of oxygen and causes ischemia and infarction. The disease is chronic and lifelong. Individuals are most often well, but their lives are punctuated by periodic painful attacks. In addition to periodic pain, there may be damage of internal organs, and/or stroke. Lifespan is often shortened with sufferers living to an average of 40 years. It is common in people from parts of the world where malaria is or was common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa or in descendants of those peoples. 

Genetics:
Sickle-cell disease is inherited in the autosomal recessive pattern, depicted above.  The allele responsible for sickle cell anemia is autosomal recessive. A person who receives the defective gene from both father and mother develops the disease; a person who receives one defective and one healthy allele remains healthy, but can pass on the disease and is known as a carrier. If two parents who are carriers have a child, there is a 1-in-4 chance of their child developing the illness and a 1-in-2 chance of their child just being a carrier.

===Polycythemia===
Polycythemia is a condition in which there is a net increase in the total circulating erythrocyte (red blood cell) mass of the body. There are several types of polycythemia.

;Primary Polycythemia:
In primary polycythemia, there may be 8 to 9 million and occasionally 11 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood (a normal range for adults is 4-5 million), and the hematocrit may be as high as 70 to 80%. In addition, the total blood volume can increase to as much as twice as normal. The entire vascular system can become markedly engorged with blood, and circulation times for blood throughout the body can increase up to twice the normal value. The increased numbers of erythrocytes can increase of the viscosity of the blood to as much as five times normal. Capillaries can become plugged by the very viscous blood, and the flow of blood through the vessels tends to be extremely sluggish.

As a consequence of the above, people with untreated Polycythemia are at a risk of various thrombotic events (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), heart attack and stroke, and have a substantial risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis). The condition is considered chronic; no cure exists. Symptomatic treatment (see below) can normalize the blood count and most patients can live a normal life for years.

;Secondary polycythemia:
Secondary polycythemia is caused by either appropriate or inappropriate increases in the production of erythropoietin that result in an increased production of erythrocytes. In secondary polycythemia, there may be 6 to 8 million and occasionally 9 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood. A type of secondary polycythemia in which the production of erythropoietin increases appropriately is called physiologic polycythemia. Physiologic polycythemia occurs in individuals living at high altitudes (4275 to 5200 meters), where oxygen availability is less than at sea level. Many athletes train at higher altitudes to take advantage of this effect — a legal form of blood doping. Actual polychthemia sufferers have been known to use their condition as an athletic advantage for greater stamina.

Other causes of secondary polycythemia include smoking, renal or liver tumors, or heart or lung diseases that result in hypoxia. Endocrine abnormalities, prominently including pheochromocytoma and adrenal adenoma with Cushing's Syndrome, are also secondary causes. Athletes and bodybuilders who abuse anabolic steroids or erythropoietin may develop secondary polycythemia.

;Relative polycythemia:
Relative polycythemia is an apparent rise of the erythrocyte level in the blood; however, the underlying cause is reduced blood plasma. Relative polycythemia is often caused by fluid loss i.e. burns, dehydration and stress polycythemia.

===Leukemia===                                   

Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal proliferation of blood cells, usually white blood cells (leukocytes). It is part of the broad group of diseases called hematological neoplasms. Damage to the bone marrow, by way of displacing the normal marrow cells with increasing numbers of malignant cells, results in a lack of blood platelets, which are important in the blood clotting process. This means people with leukemia may become bruised, bleed excessively, or develop pin-prick bleeds (petechiae).

White blood cells, which are involved in fighting pathogens, may be suppressed or dysfunctional, putting the patient at the risk of developing infections.
The red blood cell deficiency leads to anaemia, which may cause dyspnea. All symptoms may also be attributable to other diseases; for diagnosis, blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy are required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whenever trying to evaluate data that has been collected, often patterns appear, such as a -1 slope when making a scatter plot of &lt;math&gt;1/d_i=1/f-1/d_o&lt;/math&gt; in ray optics. It may often be the goal to find a mathematical function that &quot;fits&quot; the data. That is to say a function whose values are close to the data values at the corresponding values and independent values. This is often referred to as the &quot;least squares&quot;, and the reason for which is explained later.

==Sales Example==
A store sells whatsits at P=3.49 each and the average number of whatsits sold (the volume) per day is V=100. Therefore the total money received T=P times V=349.00 ..... If the price is reduced then, maybe, more whatsits will be sold, but T may be more or less. Obviously if P=0 then T will also be zero. The following was the result:

         P          V           T
       2.99        130        388.70
       3.29        123        404.67
       3.49        100        349.00
Obviously the &quot;best&quot; price is somewhere between 2.99 and 3.49. 
..... [[Curve fitting]] provides an equation for T versus P for each of the many models that are available for comparison.
===Linear model===
The linear model is based on &lt;u&gt;the &quot;best&quot; straight line&lt;/U&gt;. Using a calculator that can do [[regression]], we find for the above data that the closest line of the graph showing T versus P is
:T=605.268605263 - 68.9289473684 * P, and the correlation is shown as about 60% for this model.

Let us examine it in more detail:

Adding the differences, we find that their sum is nearly zero, indicating that it is the &quot;best&quot; linear model. Squaring a negative number always gives a positive number. so that the '''SUM OF SQUARES''' will give us an indication of the '''GOODNESS OF FIT'''. Here the '''SUM OF SQUARES''' is 1041.60796053, and we can compare the different models, selecting finally the model that has the '''LEAST SQUARES'''.

====Calculation of the least square line to fit the given points:====
LOOKING FOR a and b in the equation of the straight line y=a+b*x:

We have, in the above example:
     x       x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;      y       y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;             xy

   3.49  12.1801  349.00  121801        1218.01
   ----  ------- -------  -----------   ---------
   9.77  31.9443 1142.37  436646.4989   3711.5873

We have:
n = number of points = 3&lt;br/&gt;ax=average of x=9.77/3=3.25&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ay=average of y=1142.37/3=380.79&lt;br/&gt;x1=sum of x=9.77&lt;br/&gt;x2=sum of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=31.9443&lt;br/&gt;y1=sum of y=1142.37&lt;br/&gt;y2=sum of y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=436646.4989&lt;br/&gt;s1=sum of xy=3711.5873&lt;br/&gt;z1=s1-(x1*y1/n)=3711.5873-(9.77*1142.37/3)= -8.731&lt;br/&gt;z2=x2-(x1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/n)=31.9443-9.77&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3=0.12&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b=z1/z2=-68.9289473682

a=ay-b*ax=380.79-(-68.9289473682)*3.25&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;=605.268605263

 Thus we have y=605.268605263-68.92894736828*x as the best line to fit the given points of this example.

===Parabolic Model===
If we have n points, then a polynomial of (n-1) degree will fit these n points exactly. We are given in this example 3 points, and a polynomial of the 2nd degree (parabola) should give us an exact fit. The calculator provides the equation&lt;br/&gt;(-663.1666666653)x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4217.91999999x-6294.10448332, giving us
    &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;Actual T&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;u&gt;Calculated T&lt;/u&gt;       &lt;u&gt;Difference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   2.99   388.70   388.6999999956      4.4E-9 = zero plus rounding error
   3.29   404.67   404.6699999951      4.9E-9 = zero plus rounding error
   3.49   349.00   348.999999995       5.0E-8 = zero plus rounding error
That is a perfect fit, with the '''LEAST SQUARES''' indicating that this model be used.

===Other models===
Some of the many other models are based on the exponential function, logarithms, and various manipulations of the independent and/or the dependent variable(s). The &quot;best fit&quot; is usually the one that provides the '''LEAST SQUARES'''. Also weighting of the data could be used when some points on a graph are more important than others (such as, maybe, end points, for example).
:Caution: Some calculators may require for Curve fitting consecutive, equally spaced, independent variables. Always compare the original graph with the &quot;fitted&quot; graph.

'''Gravlax''' is [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] that is cured in salt and sugar. It is a common dish throughout Scandinavia. Gravlax is easy to make and makes a festive dish that is an excellent to serve at parties with many people. The process of curing fish in salt and sugar (''grava'') is not limited to salmon and works fine with any fatty fish although salmon is definitely the most common choice. Gravlax has been particularly popular and common in the northern regions of Scandinavia whose cold and fresh waters produce salmon of excellent quality. The basic recipe here has been used for generations and has its origins in the northernmost part of Sweden. Gravlax can be used either as a main dish or as an appetizer.

== Ingredients ==
* 8 hg of fresh [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] file
* 30 ml of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 30 ml of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 45 ml of [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
* 30 cl of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits|gin]] (optional)
* 5 ml of whole or crushed [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]] seeds
* 20-40 g of [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Gravlax1.jpg|thumbnail|Thawed salmon with the required ingredients.]]
[[Image:Gravlax2.jpg|thumbnail|Apply salt and sugar.]]
[[Image:Gravlax3.jpg|thumbnail|Apply pepper and juniper berries.]]
[[Image:Gravlax4.jpg|thumbnail|Cover with dill.]]
[[Image:Gravlax5.jpg|thumbnail|Place one piece on top of the other.]]
[[Image:Gravlax6.jpg|thumbnail|Seal the salmon in a plastic bag and refrigerate.]]
[[Image:Gravlax7.jpg|thumbnail|Serve thin slices of the cured salmon.]]

Use the thick part of the salmon filet found towards the head, it should be approximately 2-5 cm (about an inch) thick. Cut the filet into two equally sized parts (if you are making gravlax for many people it is fine to use two filets instead). Don't use the part closest to the tail, since it is not thick enough. Now freeze the salmon for at least four days at -18C or colder to kill any parasites.

After deep freezing the salmon remove it from the freezer and let it thaw, preferably overnight in the refrigerator. The salmon does not have to be completely thawed for the next step.

Place the salmon, skin down, on a table. Rub the salt and sugar mix onto the pieces, then apply the juniper berries and pepper. Finally cover with dill. 
Put one piece on top of another and place in a plastic bag. Toss any leftover &quot;ingredients&quot; into the bag along with the gin. Seal the bag and place it in the refrigerator. Now let the salmon cure in the mixture, turning the bag over once, preferably twice, a day; for four days.

After four days the salmon is ready to serve. If you are not going to eat it immediately (it lasts a couple of days) move it to a fresh plastic bag or jar, removing the salty liquid that have formed in the original bag. If you keep it in the original bag the risk is that it may be too salty once you are about to serve it.

Use a sharp knife to slice thin slices from the salmon at an angle. During slicing also remove any leftover bones. The larger the piece of salmon the larger the angle and the larger surface area for the produced slices. Large slices looks better when served.

As a main dish, serve with [[Cookbook:Potato Stew|potato stew]], boiled potatoes and [[Cookbook:gravlax sause|gravlax sause]] or in a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]. As an appetizer serve on crispbread or [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]].

Potato stew with some additional [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] is excellent addition to gravlax.

== Variations ==
The gin can be substituted for the acids in lemons or limes (like a ceviche).

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

#'''Support''' - This book, while it has a German title, and was written in German, already has a paragraph by paragraph translation of most or all of the text.  What we really need to do here is clean it up, remove the German text, and move the book and chapters to English titles, and we'll have a very nice Wikibook to show off.

===[[Introduction to Philosophy]]===

#'''Support''' - This book is a little underdone and could be easily edited by many. As a major part of the humanities area it should be one of our larger books. [[User:Serge|Serge]]  07:44, 27 Jun 2005 (EST)
#[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 03:16, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
#'''Support''' Much need be considered when building this book, much of which has been excluded from it. I would like to see more persons working on this collaboration. It is sad to see something that many people are trying to push fall short. I see this as a keystone to many young minds, and the way it is being formed is ridiculous. It needs much support from the WikiBooks community. Consequently, I am forced to vote for it as a collaboration of the month canidate, not for the fact that it is well-formed, but for the fact it need be seen and helped.

#[[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 14:21, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) (support). Following rejection of this book from &quot;Book of the month&quot;, due to its lack of content, why not make it a collaboration and therefore solve this problem? This is also the first travel book for Wikibooks.

Hi N.O.F.,

It is standard practice to sign your comments when ever you make a change to a talk page. With out this it makes it hard to figure out who is adding what comments. You do this with 4 tilde like &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it looks like this: [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 01:35, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Now, to our usual dialogue.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
== Dialogue ==
'''Ricardo''': Que horas são, João?&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Agora, são dez para as seis.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': A sério? Minha mulher e eu vamos ao cinema às seis e cinco.&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': A que horas começa o filme?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Às seis e dez.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In Portuguese, the way you tell the time is similar to English. You first say the hour number, then the word '''e''' and finally the minute number. Ex: '''São sete e vinte.''' - It's seven twenty. 
For half an hour, you say '''e meia''' in the place of &quot;and a half&quot; or '''e trinta''' as in thirty and in case the minute number is very close to the full hour (bigger than 30), it is more common to say the remaining time to the next hour, using the structure: São + remaining time in minutes + '''para a(s)''' + next hour. Ex: '''São duas e meia.''' - It's two and a half. '''São cinco para as quatro''' - It's five to four.
Also, there are synonyms for midnight and midday in Portuguese: '''meia-noite''' and '''meio-dia''', respectively. These words are used the same way. Ex: '''É meio-dia.''' - It's midday.

Now, let's do some exercises:

1)Tell the times below in Portuguese:

a)10:30 PM&lt;br&gt;
b)8:55 AM&lt;br&gt;
c)3:15 AM&lt;br&gt;
d)7:25 AM&lt;br&gt;
e)1:00 PM&lt;br&gt;
f)4:40 PM&lt;br&gt;
g)12:50 PM&lt;br&gt;
h)11:55 AM&lt;br&gt;

Answers:

1)&lt;br&gt;
a)São dez e meia.&lt;br&gt;
b)São cinco para as nove.&lt;br&gt;
c)São três e quinze.&lt;br&gt;
d)São sete e vinte e cinco.&lt;br&gt;
e)É uma hora.*&lt;br&gt;
f)São vinte para as cinco.&lt;br&gt;
g)São dez para uma.&lt;br&gt;
h)São cinco para meio-dia.&lt;br&gt;

*Note that since one hour is singular, the verb '''ser''' is in the singular form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
The audio components of a robot are those parts that allow it to make sounds, either for entertainment purposes or to convey information.

This can be done through simple sound chips: cheap integrated circuits which allow certain sounds to be played with very few external components. These are commonly used in toys.

Other means are memory chips storing samples, a DAC and an amplifier, an MP3 player or voice synthesiser software on a portable PC.

==The Theoretical Edge==
Generating simple sounds is easy. All you need is an oscillator in the range 20 to 20.000Hz, an amplifier and a speaker. Such a circuit can generate any tone that a human can hear. By changing the frequency of the oscillator you change the emitted tone. Qbasic has a command that does just this: sound. Sound lets you specify a few parameters, with the most important being the frequency. By changing this frequency over time simple sound effects could be produced.

A better way to generate sound is sampling:

A sound wave has an intensity that varies over time. A microphone (with preamplifier) can convert this intensity to an electric signal with the same shape. An Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) can then convert this electric signal in a digital number. This is, however, not a continuous process but a discrete process, this means that every x ms the amplitude (voltage or current) of the signal is measured and converted to a digital number. This results in a digital approximation of the original signal. How good this approximation is depends on how frequently the signal is sampled. Of course more samples means more memory space is consumed and also more expensive hardware is needed. The price of an ADC depends on precision (how many bits represent the sample) and how many samples it can take per second (there are more parameters, but those are pretty much out of scope for this book).

Now you have an array of numbers. Of course now you want to turn this array back into sound. This is done with a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). This part converts a digital value back into an electric signal. After this DAC there is a filter to smooth the wave, an amplifier and a speaker. Feed the array sample by sample to the DAC at the same rate as they were sampled and you hear the original sound back.

The advantage of this approach is it's (relative) simplicity. The disadvantage is its enormous memory consumption.

More advanced methods would be storing encoded sound (e.g. MP3). This is more tricky since it needs a decoder, yet these days integrated circuits with complete mp3 decoders exist, which makes this an interesting method to look for.

==The Different Components==
''this section should cover some basic info on these circuits and ICs''

===Preamplifier===
A preamplifier is used when a signal with very small amplitude has to be amplified. Preamplifiers are very linear (they cause very little distortion in the signal) but are very inefficient with power. They amplify a signal, coming from e.g. a microphone, which commonly has an amplitude of 1mV or less to a more useful amplitude of 100mV and up. Since they are so inefficient preamplifier circuits aren't used for power amplifiers.

===Amplifier===
Amplifiers allow a low power signal to be outputed through a speaker with significant power. Amplifiers commonly allow some distortion of the signal in order to preserve power. (except for class A amplifiers which consume a lot of power, but have little distortion).

Amplifiers can be built with ICs, discrete components or bought as a module.

===Analog to Digital Converter ADC===
An analog to digital converter (short: ADC) converts an analog signal to a digital value. ADCs have a certain accuracy, expressed in ''bit'', e.g. 8bit, 10bit and 16bit. This means that the ADC will have a binary number with 8, 10 and respectively 16 bits. The highest value represented by this binary number correspondents to the reference voltage put on a special input of the ADC. e.g. If we have an 8bit ADC and we put on this special input 5V, then the value 255 means 5V. It's precision will be 1/255 * 5 V or 0.02V. Each time we add 1 to the binary number, the represented voltage increases by 0.02V.&lt;BR&gt;
A second point about ADCs is their timing. ADCs take some time to do a conversion. The faster they are, the more accurate they digitalise the signal (or in other words the higher the frequency of a signal can be), and the more expensive they are.

===Digital to Analog Converter===
The DAC converts a digital value into a voltage level. The work either with a reference voltage or &quot;rail-to-rail&quot;, which means that their highest digital input value represents a voltage level (almost) equal to the DACs supply voltage. 
Simulare to the ADC the DAC has a certain accuracy in ''bit'' and requires some time to make a conversion.

===Oscillators===
An oscillator generates a repetitive signal. This can be of pretty much any shape you want, but most common shapes are sine, square, saw-tooth and triangle waves and many different forms of pulses.

===Dedicated sound Chips===
There are many ICs specially designed for producing sound effects.

*Oscillators: These output a signal with a user definable frequency. By varying the frequency you can make different sound effects.
*Sound chips: These output particular sound effects (e.g. motor sounds). These can't be changed.
*Sound recording and playback chips: These can record sounds for a short period of time (some can record several different samples) and can play these back afterward.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do I clone maintenance records from one xymon to the other one ? ==
The front-end web GUI is to collect information and  in the end send out bb command with &quot;disable&quot; syntax.
=== Found out the maintenance status of a host ===
* bb xymon-server-name &quot;hobbitdboard color=blue fields=hostname,testname,disabletime,dismsg&quot; 
=== Disable a host ===
* bb xymon-server-name &quot;disable hostname.testname $timeframe $REASON&quot;
=== Enable a host ===
* bb xymon-server-name &quot;enable hostname.testname&quot;


=== Enable All hosts with blue record that in maintenance mode ===
Why ?, Useful when you need to populate the records from hobbit server A to B.

# NAME
#      bluesync.sh  - A shell script to replicate Primary Xymon Serverblue record
#                     to Secondary standby Xymon server.
#
#
# REVISION HISTORY
#      07/12/2009    Base on getblue.sh and putblue.sh by Ralph Mitchell &lt;ralphmitchell (at) gmail.com&gt;
#                    http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/2009/07/msg00214.html
#      10/19/2009    T.J. Yang merge two scripts into one for Xymon  High Availability setup.
#
# USAGE
#      This script is tested on Solaris 10 OS.
#      put this shell script in hobbitlaunch.cfg as section like following.
#
# [bluesync]
# #     DISABLED
#       ENABLE
#       ENVFILE /etc/opt/hobbitserver42/hobbitserver.cfg
#       CMD /opt/hobbitserver42/ext/bluesync/bluesync.sh
#       LOGFILE $BBSERVERLOGS/bluesync.sh.log
#       INTERVAL 5m
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Xymon keep its blue(maintenance) in memory, not in a file. This script
#     is to copy the blue records from primary Xymon A server into Xymon B secondary one.
#     This script is for use when running Active-Active type of Xymon server
#     High Availability setup. Xymon B is same as Xymon A except
#     the alerting function is disabled. There is another script running on Xymon B to
#     detect the outage of Xymon A and enable Xymon B to become primary one.
#
#
# Algorithems:
# 1. Pull blue records from Xymon1 and dump them into Xymon2's ext/bluesync directory.
# 2. Process the lifetime fields' value
#     if lifetime is -1 and greater then zero
#       then run &quot;bb hobbit2.test.com &quot;disable hosname.test lifetime message&quot;
#            to keep the blue record.
#     if  liftime =0
#       the run &quot;bb hobbit2.test.com &quot;enable  hostname.*d&quot;  to enable this host blue record
#           since it is expired or was enabled on xymon1 server.
#

# RETURN CODE
#       SUCCESS (=0) - script completed sucessfully
#       ERROR   (=1) - error... bad things happened
#       WARNING (=2) - warning... something's not quite right, but it's

== How to have pca work with xymon ? ==
[http://www.par.univie.ac.at/solaris/pca/ pca] is a perl script that can report and install patch missing patches from Sun's patches databases for all versions of Solaris OS.

There are two ways to integrate pca with xymon monitoring tool.

=== Server side patch analysis ===
Run &quot;showrev -p&quot; and &quot;pkginfo -x&quot; on xymon client and run pca.pl on xymon server to analyze missing patch for all the clients.

=== Client side patch analysis ===
Run pca.pl on xymon client for missing patches analysis and send in lists of missed patch to xymon server.
* pca software and its dependent software need to be deployed as part of xymon client package.
* pca.pl need to be configure to query internal Solaris patch database reside on xymon server.
* Need to set up a local pca proxy server to store all the patch zip files and main solaris patch database.
* use pca command to update missing patch after getting approvals to update the missing patches.

=== Pros and Cons for Server and Client side methods ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; width: 100%;&quot;
|-
! Integration approach
! Server side analysis
! Client Side analysis
|-
! Client changes needed
| Modify -sunos.sh to send in &quot;showrev -p&quot; and &quot;pkginfo -x&quot; output.
| Run &quot;pca -L&quot; and more HTML code correction in wrapper script or run &quot;pca -M&quot; (with a patch change to pca.pl) on Xymon client as a client side ext module.
|-
! Server side change needed
| Write a server side module to process the data of &quot;showrev -p&quot; sent from clients.
| Xymon server will create a &quot;pca&quot; column with missed patch send from Xymon client.
|-
! Load on Xymon server
| This will add the missing patch calculation time for all clients on the Xymon server.
| Load to xymon server is minimum because the calculation task is done on Xymon clients.
|-
! pca script changes
| No pca.pl script change is needed. We only update the new pca.pl one time on the Xymon server.
| &quot;pca -L&quot; won't generate Xymon client compatible HTML code. We need to either correct this in the wrapper script or patch the pca perl code.
|-
! client to server traffic
| The raw data output of &quot;showrev -p&quot; will be sent every 5 minutes!
| The message size is only the missed patches list, not the whole output of &quot;showrev -p&quot; and every 5 minutes.
|-
! Administration Cost

Here, I (Stewart L) will explain the steps I went through to get a Linux server joined to our Active Directory 2003 infrastructure and to authenticate users against the domain without them being required to enter credentials.

As I said, this is against an AD 2003 structure. If you are operating in a 200 or NT domain, this might not work for you, but it should point you on your way.

I'll make a few assumptions at this point for the example.
* You are setting up a webserver to be named web1.example.com.
* Your domain is called EXAMPLE and your kerberos Realm is named EXAMPLE.COM
* You have a domain account named EXAMPLE\Bob that is authorized to add machines into the domain.
* Your Domain controller is dc1.example.com.

=== Install Packages ===
You obviously need apache installed. You will also need the mod_auth_kerb package to authenticate against the domain. It is also much easier if you use the system-config-authentication tool in the authconfig-gtk package.

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;yum -y install mod_auth_kerb authconfig-gtk&lt;/source&gt;

=== Join the Machine to the Domain ===
Before you can join a machine to a domain, you must have a few items taken care of...
* The hostname (excluding the domain) should be 15 characters or less.
* The system clocks should be synchronized. Use NTP for this.
* Your /etc/hosts file needs to be properly set up. You should have a localhost entry pointing to 127.0.0.1 and an entry that has your fully-qualified host name pointing to its assigned IP address.

With that out of the way, we can begin configuring authentication.

# Run system-config-authentication as root.
# On the Authentication tab, Enable Kerberos and Winbind
# Configure Kerberos.
##REALM = EXAMPLE.COM
##Check the boxes for using DNS to resolve hosts to realms and locate KDCs.
##KDC and Admin Sevrer can be left blank
##Click ok.
#Configure Winbind
##Domain = EXAMPLE
##Security Model = ads
##ADS Realm = EXAMPLE.COM
##Domain Controllers = dc1.example.com
##Click ok
#Edit your /etc/samba/smb.conf file and make sure that your netbios name is the same as your hostname. This should be the host part only, not the domain.

=== Join the Domain ===
As the root user, run the following commands. You will have to enter a password for Bob after both commands.
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
kinit EXAMPLE\Bob
net ads join -U EXAMPLE\Bob
&lt;/source&gt;
That's it! You're on the domain now. By default you have to have a local account on the box to authenticate against AD, meaning if there is not a bob account on web1.example.com, bob cannot log in with his domain password.

=== Configure an AD User ===
This is where things become a little convoluted. We are going to create a user account in AD that the web server will use for authentication. There are a number of different versions and service packs out there for Windows Server 2000 and 2003. I got a lot of my information from http://grolmsnet.de/kerbtut/ so check there if you have problems with this part.

*Create a user in AD named http_web1.
*Set this account so that the password never expires.
*On the command line of the Domain Controller, run this line
:&lt;source lang=dos&gt;ktpass -princ HTTP/web1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM -mapuser EXAMPLE\http_web1 -crypto DES-CBC-MD5 -ptype KRB5_NT_SRV_HST -pass * -out c:\temp\http_web1.heytab&lt;/source&gt;
*This will create a keytab file in C:\temp that you need to move to your webserver and place in /etc/http.

=== Configure Apache ===
Your configuration should look something like this...
&lt;code&gt;
   &amp;lt;Location /&amp;gt;
   AuthName &quot;Welcome to EXAMPLE&quot;
   AuthType Kerberos
   Krb5Keytab /etc/httpd/http_web1.keytab
   KrbAuthRealm EXAMPLE.COM
   KrbMethodNegotiate On
   KrbSaveCredentials off
   KrbVerifyKDC off
   Require valid-user
   &amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Naturally, you can change the Authname to whatever you like. Check http://modauthkerb.sourceforge.net/ for more info on specific configurations

=== Configure Firefox (Optional) ===
#Type about:config in the URL bar
#Modify the following &quot;Preference Name&quot;
#*network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris - Example.com
#*network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris - Example.com
#*network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris - Example.com

== How do I prevent red/purple alert storm from Xymon server ? ==
=== What ===
*red alert storm:
** caused by death of a few switches and bad bb-hosts configuration that missing router dependency directive.
** human error on configuring fping access control list.
*purple storm: 
** caused by Xymon server went into very high CPU load itself that prevent itself from running the Xymon daemon themselves properly thus all machines went into purple due lack of message update within 30 minutes.

=== How to fix ===
* Deploy mail filter to restrict the volume of alerts Xymon  server can send out.

== How do I update xymon client's configuration file from xymon server ? ==
=== Why ? ===
* To make global variable changes on all hobbit clients.
** Examples: To configure all your clients to send hobbit messages from one  to two Xymon servers. This will need to modify hobbitclient.cfg on all clients. If you have small pool of clients, manually editing by login into each machines is ok. but for a pool at size of 3000 clients, this change is better done via clienudpate or cluster shell plus rsh approach.
** This wiki page is to verify if xymon's clientupdate really work for this need.

=== What need to be done ? ===
* Update hobbit-client.cfg on hobbit clients with new hobbit-client.cfg locate in central hobbit server. The new hobbit-client.cfg contain new configuration to send hobbit messages to two hobbit server.
** diff of old and new hobbit-client.cfg file.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-2.05$ diff hobbitclient.cfg hobbitclient.cfg.new
3,4c3,4
&lt; BBDISP=&quot;hobbit.test.com&quot;         # IP address of the Hobbit server
&lt; BBDISPLAYS=&quot;&quot;                   # IP of multiple Hobbit servers. BBDISP must be &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;.

bash-2.05$
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Make sure/Modify all the scripts in ext directory send messages to BBDISPLAYS.
** temperature module.

else
        $BB $BBDISP &quot;$LINE&quot;                     # SEND IT TO BBDISPLAY

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== RTFM first ===
* http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/man1/clientupdate.1.html
* Looks feasible from about manpage.

=== Procedures ===
To manage updating clients without having to logon to each server, you can use the clientupdate utility. This is how you setup the release of a new client version.
# make sure the xymon client external scripts send  message to &quot;BBDISPLAYS&quot;, not just &quot;BBDISP&quot; variable.
## this require the review of external(home-grown) script got deployed to be modified to send messages to two xymon servers.
# Create the new client: Setup the new client $BBHOME directory, e.g. by copying an existing client installation to an empty directory and modifying it for your needs. It is a good idea to delete all files in the tmp/ and logs/ directories, since there is no need to copy these over to all of the clients. Pay attention to the etc/ files, and make sure that they are suitable for the systems where you want to deploy this new client. You can add files - e.g. extension scripts in the ext/ directory - but the clientupdate utility cannot delete or rename files.
# Package the client: When your new client software is ready, create a tar-file of the new client. All files in the tar archive must have filenames relative to the clients' $BBHOME (usually, ~hobbit/client/). Save the tarfile on the Hobbit server in ~hobbit/server/download/somefile.tar. Dont compress it. It is recommended that you use some sort of operating-system and version-numbering scheme for the filename, but you can choose whatever filename suits you - the only requirement is that it must end with &quot;.tar&quot;. The part of the filename preceding &quot;.tar&quot; is what Hobbit will use as the &quot;clientversion&quot; ID.
# Configure which hosts receive the new client: In the client-local.cfg(5) file, you must now setup a clientversion:ID line where the ID matches the filename you used for the tar-file. So if you have packaged the new client into the file linux.v2.tar, then the corresponding entry in client-local.cfg would be clientversion:linux.v2.
# Wait for hobbitd to reload client-local.cfg:   hobbitd will automatically reload the client-local.cfg file after at most 10 minutes. If you want to force an immediate reload, send a SIGHUP signal to the hobbitd process.
# Wait for the client to update:  The next time the client contacts the Hobbit server to send the client data, it will notice the new clientversion setting in client-local.cfg, and will run clientupdate to install the new client software. So when the client runs the next time, it will use the new client software.

=== Getting started with clientupdate ===


* find out the hobbiclient version, we are running 4.2.0 from output of &quot;clientupdate --level&quot;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 bash-3.00$ ./bbcmd
 2009-01-28 20:50:39 Using default environment file /etc/opt/hobbitclient42/hobbitclient.cfg
 bash-3.00$ ./clientupdate --level
 4.2.0
 bash-3.00$
 &lt;/pre&gt;
** or catout the version from clientversion.cfg.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00$ cat  clientversion.cfg
4.2.0
bash-3.00$
&lt;/pre&gt;
* do the update but no new version on server side.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00$ ./clientupdate
2009-01-28 20:53:25 No new version string!
bash-3.00$
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Error messages from clientupdate ===
* core dump because we didn't run bbcmd first. clientupdate.c need to be udpated to avoid the coredump.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00$ ./clientupdate
2009-01-28 20:49:13 xgetenv: Cannot find value for variable ETCBBHOME
Segmentation Fault (core dumped)
bash-3.00$

&lt;/pre&gt;
* &quot;--suid-setup failed: No such file or directory&quot;, no xymon server side configuration at all.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-2.05$ ./clientupdate --update=4.2.1
tar: blocksize = 0
2009-01-28 16:03:39 exec() of clientupdate --suid-setup failed: No such file or directory
bash-2.05$
&lt;/pre&gt;

== How do I configure sudo to empower hobbit client to gain limited root privilege ? ==

== How can I create a hobbit client custom test script? ==
{{main|System Monitoring with Hobbit/HOWTO/Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit}}
Anything that can be automated via a script or a custom program can be added into Hobbit. A lot of extension scripts are available for Big Brother at the www.deadcat.net archive, and these will typically work without modifications if you run them in Hobbit. Sometimes a few minor tweaks are needed - the Hobbit mailing list can help you if you dont know how to go about that.

But if you have something unique you need to test, writing an extension script is pretty simple. You need to figure out some things:

* What name will you use for the column?
* How will you test it?
* What criteria should decide if the test goes red, yellow or green?
* What extra data from the test will you include in the status message ? 

A simple client-side extension script looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh
 
COLUMN=mytest	# Name of the column
COLOR=green		# By default, everything is OK
MSG=&quot;Bad stuff status&quot;

# Do whatever you need to test for something
# As an example, go red if /tmp/badstuff exists.
if test -f /tmp/badstuff
then
   COLOR=red
   MSG=&quot;${MSG}

   `cat /tmp/badstuff`
   &quot;
else
   MSG=&quot;${MSG}

   All is OK
   &quot;
fi

# Tell Hobbit about it
$BB $BBDISP &quot;status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date` ${MSG}&quot;

exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

You will notice that some environment variables are pre-defined: BB, BBDISP, MACHINE are all provided by Hobbit when you run your script via hobbitlaunch. Also note how the MSG variable is used to build the status message - it starts out with just the &quot;Bad stuff status&quot;, then you add data to the message when we decided what the status is.

To run this, save your script in the &lt;code&gt;~hobbit/client/ext/&lt;/code&gt; directory (i.e. in the &lt;code&gt;ext/&lt;/code&gt; directory off where you installed the Hobbit client), then add a new section to the &lt;code&gt;~hobbit/client/etc/clientlaunch.cfg&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;~hobbit/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg&lt;/code&gt; on the server) file like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[myscript]
   ENVFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg
   CMD $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/ext/myscript.sh
   LOGFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/logs/myscript.log
   INTERVAL 5m
&lt;/source&gt;

Optionally you may want to add a description for the new column your custom script creates.
On the hobbit *server* edit the file &lt;code&gt;$BBHOME/columndoc.csv&lt;/code&gt; adding a line like:
&lt;pre&gt;
myscript;The &lt;b&gt;myscript&lt;/b&gt; column shows the status of my custom script.;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== How to write server side module ? ==
Server-side scripts look almost the same as client-side scripts, but they will typically use the bbhostgrep utility to pick out hosts in the bb-hosts file that have a special tag defined, and then send one status message for each of those hosts. Like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh

BBHTAG=foo           # What we put in bb-hosts to trigger this test
COLUMN=$BBHTAG	# Name of the column, often same as tag in bb-hosts

$BBHOME/bin/bbhostgrep $BBHTAG | while read L
do
   set $L	# To get one line of output from bbhostgrep

   HOSTIP=&quot;$1&quot;
   MACHINEDOTS=&quot;$2&quot;
   MACHINE=`echo $2 | $SED -e's/\./,/g'`

   COLOR=green
   MSG=&quot;$BBHTAG status for host $MACHINEDOTS&quot;

   #... do the test, perhaps modify COLOR and MSG

   $BB $BBDISP &quot;status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`

   ${MSG}
   &quot;
done
 
exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that for server side tests, you need to loop over the list of hosts found in the bb-hosts file, and send one status message for each host. Other than that, it is just like the client-side tests.

This script is saved in ~/hobbit/server/ext/my_script.sh, and you add its description in ~hobbit/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[foo]
   ENVFILE $BBTHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
   CMD $BB/ext/my_script.sh
   LOGFILE $BB/logs/myscript.log
   INTERVAL 5m
&lt;/source&gt;

The service can now be added to the bb-hosts file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
127.0.0.1 my_server # foo
&lt;/source&gt;

=== How can I test a custom script before adding it to the running agent ? ===
Before activating a new custom script it is useful to check its functionality and output on stdout.

To run a script on the command line, you have to load all the xymon environment and replace the $BB command by &quot;echo&quot;.

You can easily do this on-the-fly by inserting this code snippet and then test your script by running it on the command line:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
TEST=1 ./my_script.sh
&lt;/source&gt;
 
There is nothing you have to change in your script if you want to add it to your hobbitlaunch.cfg after testing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh
...
# Test-Mode ?
# TEST=0 =&gt; works in cooperation with Xymon agent (default)
# TEST=1 =&gt; for testing, results to stdout (run &quot;TEST=1 ./bb-testname.sh&quot; on cmd-line)
# TEST&gt;1 =&gt; for testing, but sending results to Xymon server without activating script in hobbitlaunch.cfg
TEST=${TEST:-&quot;0&quot;}
if [ &quot;$TEST&quot; -gt &quot;0&quot; ]
then
  BBHOME=&quot;$HOME/xymon/server&quot;
  . $BBHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
  BBQUERYCMD=$BB
  [ &quot;$TEST&quot; = &quot;1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; BB=&quot;echo&quot;
fi
...
&lt;/source&gt;

This works for client-scripts as well as for server side scripts.

Of course you have to change the path settings to your environment.

* Check that the data arrives in Hobbit server.

== Use a Big Brother script without converting it to hobbit==

Run the latest Big Brother client on your hobbit server.  Execute the desired script from this client, it will report to hobbit.
e.g. using the latest &quot;bb-mrtg.pl&quot; script to monitor your mrtg graphs

== Add Custom Graphs ==

Read the man page for hobbitd_rrd

== Add support for a database backend ==

I haven't done it, but it will be very, very easy to implement. For
reporting you just want to know what status changes have occurred, so
you simply need to come up with a Hobbit &quot;worker module&quot; that receives
messages from the Hobbit &quot;stachg&quot; channel, and stores them in your
database.

Worker modules can be written in whatever language you fancy, although
I'd advise against shell-scripts for performance reasons. Perl,
Python, C, C++, Java ... pick your favourite programming tool.

All the module needs to do is read the messages off it's standard
input filehandle, and store them in the database. Each message is
formatted like this:

  @@stachg|timestamp|sender|origin|hostname|testname|expiretime|color|prevcolor|changetime
  &lt;new status message&gt;
  @@

So it is very easy to pick out the first line and grab all of the
information you will normally need from that.

There's a sample module provided with the Hobbit sources, see the
&quot;hobbit-4.0-RC4/hobbitd/hobbitd_sample.c&quot; file which illustrates how
to build a worker module in C.

== Installing Hobbit as client with a BB server ==

There are a few gotchas if you want to use Hobbit as client
with a BB server: the Hobbit client usually gets its configuration
from the server, and the standard protocol is different. To make
it backwards compatible requires a few workarounds on hobbit client side.

Example for Debian Unix OS, adjust as required otherwise.

Start as root
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  apt-get install gcc make
  apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
  useradd -m hobbit
  su - hobbit
&lt;/source&gt;
We are hobbit!
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  tar zxfv .../hobbit-4.2.0.tar.gz
  cd hobbit-4.2.0
  ./configure --client
&lt;/source&gt;  
:Answer client
:Answer hobbit
:Answer /home/hobbit
:Answer 10.0.4.5 (replace with the IP address of your BB server)
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  make
  make install
  cd
  chmod +w client/runclient.sh
  vi client/runclient.sh
&lt;/source&gt;
:Add MACHINEDOTS=&quot;f.q.d.n&quot;, i.e. the client's fqdn
:Add --local on the line that starts hobbitlaunch
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;  vi client/etc/hobbitclient.cfg&lt;/source&gt;
:Add BBMAXMSGSPERCOMBO=1
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;  exit&lt;/source&gt;

We are root again!

Create /etc/init.d/hobbit as:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  #!/bin/sh
  su hobbit -c &quot;/home/hobbit/client/runclient.sh $1&quot;
  
  chmod +x /etc/init.d/hobbit
  update-rc.d hobbit defaults
  
  /etc/init.d/hobbit start
&lt;/source&gt;

== Monitor Hobbit clients in a DMZ using reverse SSH tunnels ==

''Note: Other methods for doing this type of thing are documented on the [[System_Monitoring_with_Xymon/Administration_Guide#Encryption_and_Tunnelling|System_Monitoring_with_Xymon/Administration_Guide]] page.''

Operating system:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
&lt;br&gt;
Hobbit version:  Hobbit 4.2.0

In some scenarios you may want to monitor Hobbit clients that are seperated from the Hobbit server by a firewall (e.g. Hobbit clients located in a DMZ) and where you cannot open port 1984 inbound from the Hobbit clients to the Hobbit server.  An alternative would be to use reverse SSH tunnels, using [http://xymonton.org/addons:ssh_tunnel Padraig Lennon's ssh_tunnels.sh script].

Note that for the purpose of this document, the hobbit user's home directory is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/hobbit&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Passwordless SSH Authentication ===

For the hobbit user, set up passwordless SSH authentication between the Hobbit server and the Hobbit clients.

On the Hobbit server, generate a private/public keypair with an empty password:
&lt;pre&gt;
# su - hobbit

$ ssh-keygen -t dsa

Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa):
Created directory '/usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  &lt;-- Ensure that you create an empty passphrase, i.e. just hit Enter.
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x:xx:xx hobbit@servername
&lt;/pre&gt;

This should create the following files in the .ssh directory located in the hobbit user's home directory:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ls -ld /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
drwx------ 2 hobbit hobbit 4096 Aug 14 12:16 /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh

$ ls -lR /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
/usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh:
total 12
-rw------- 1 hobbit hobbit  668 Aug 14 12:14 id_dsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 hobbit hobbit  603 Aug 14 12:14 id_dsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;
If for some reason the creation of the keypair fails, try manually creating the .ssh folder in the hobbit user's home directory before generating the keypair.  Ensure that the folder is owned by the hobbit user and group, and that its permissions are correct:
&lt;pre&gt;
# chown hobbit:hobbit /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
# chmod 700 /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now you want to copy the generated public key (id_dsa.pub) to the Hobbit client.  Ensure that the .ssh folder exists for the hobbit user on the Hobbit client with the same permissions as above, and then copy id_dsa.pub to the Hobbit client:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa.pub hobbit@hobbitclient:/usr/lib/hobbit/
&lt;/pre&gt;
On the Hobbit client:

Rename the public key copied from the Hobbit server from &quot;id_dsa.pub&quot; to &quot;authorized_keys&quot;:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mv /usr/lib/hobbit/id_dsa.pub /usr/lib/hobbit/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;
Move the authorized_keys file to the hobbit user’s .ssh directory:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mv /usr/lib/hobbit/authorized_keys /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/
&lt;/pre&gt;
Check that the authorized_keys file has the correct permissions (chmod 644):
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ls -l /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw-r--r--  1 hobbit hobbit 603 Aug 14 12:20 /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;
From the server, SSH to the client.  You should add the client's host key to the server's known_hosts file when prompted, but should not be prompted for a password.

=== Configure the Hobbit client ===

Add the following line to /usr/lib/hobbit/client/etc/hobbitclient.cfg on the Hobbit client:
&lt;pre&gt;
BBDISP=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Configure /etc/default/hobbit-client as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
HOBBITSERVERS=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart the hobbit-client service on the Hobbit client.

=== Configure the Hobbit server ===

Copy the ssh-tunnels.sh script to the following location on the Hobbit server, and make sure that its permissions are correct (chmod 755):
&lt;pre&gt;
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5469 Aug 14 12:30 /usr/lib/hobbit/server/ext/ssh-tunnels.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;
Modify /etc/hobbit/hobbitlaunch.cfg:
&lt;pre&gt;
[ssh-tunnel]
    ENVFILE /usr/lib/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
    CMD $BBHOME/ext/ssh-tunnels.sh
    LOGFILE $BBSERVERLOGS/ssh-tunnels.log
    INTERVAL 1m
&lt;/pre&gt;
Add entries for the Hobbit clients to the /etc/hobbit/bb-hosts file (use &quot;noconn&quot; if pings aren't allowed from server to client):
&lt;pre&gt;
xx.xx.xx.xx    clientname       # noconn ssh-tunnel
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the Hobbit clients' names cannot be resolved by the Hobbit server, add entries for those clients to the Hobbit server's /etc/hosts file:
&lt;pre&gt;
xx.xx.xx.xx    clientname
&lt;/pre&gt;

As of ssh-tunnel.sh version 0.0.3 you can specify a non-standard ssh port to connect to. Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
xx.xx.xx.xx    clientname       # noconn ssh-tunnel:2222
&lt;/pre&gt;


You could also create a DNS entry for the client, whichever is easier.

As the hobbit user, manually SSH to each Hobbit client at least once, and when prompted add the Hobbit client's host key to the Hobbit server's known_hosts file:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh clientname
The authenticity of host 'clientname (xx.xx.xx.xx)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x:xx:xx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart the hobbit service on the Hobbit server:
&lt;pre&gt;
# service hobbit restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Confirm functional ===
Consult /var/log/hobbit/ssh-tunnels.log for any error messages, e.g.
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh: clientname: Name or service not known
&lt;/pre&gt;
Solution:
Ensure that the Hobbit server can resolve the Hobbit client's name, e.g. add an entry for the Hobbit client to the Hobbit server's /etc/hosts file.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host key verification failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Solution:
Manually SSH to the Hobbit client from the Hobbit server at least once and add the Hobbit client's host key to the Hobbit server's known_hosts file when prompted.

You can verify that the ssh tunnels have been successfully created:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ps -ef | grep ssh
hobbit    2187     1  0 Aug14 ?        00:00:02 ssh -fnNR 1984:hobbit:1984 clientname
hobbit    2805     1  0 Aug14 ?        00:00:02 ssh -fnNR 1984:hobbit:1984 clientname2
&lt;/pre&gt;
You should also see a new column called &quot;ssh-tunnel&quot; generated in the Hobbit server's web interface.

== Mobile phone clients ==

If you want to check your hobbit / Xymon-Status from your mobile phone you can use the following apps:

=== Android ===
XyMon by dot knowledge: http://www.dot-knowledge.de/Home/android/xymon-monitor (There you find a link to the Android market place)

Xydroid by Rune B. Broberg: http://mihtjel.dk/xydroid/ - a recent project of delivering Xymon statuses on Android phones.

*Previously known as &quot;Techniscope&quot;
*THX 1138 was shot in Techniscope.
*Natively 2.35:1 aspect ratio
*Uses half as much film as 4-perf
*Is difficult to find cameras and telecine facilities
*The cut for 4:3 TV is radical because there's no top and bottom to expand into
*The new, fine-grained stocks make 2-perf very attractive
*Be very careful about hairs in the gate and lens flare because there's almost no frame line
*Tough to optically print but it can be done (e.g. Multivision235)

'''Kung Pao Chicken''' (Gong Bao in Mandarin) is a spicy Sichuan recipe made with diced chicken, chili peppers and peanuts, named after a court official. It is a popular dish served at Chinese restaurants throughout the United States and the UK.

==Ingredients==

====Chicken/Marinade:====
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]]. Boneless, skinless, uncooked. Cut into a 1-inch dice. 
* 2 T. oyster sauce
* 2 T. sherry or rice wine
* 1 t. cornstarch

====Spices:====
* 4 T. cooking oil 
* 1/2 cup shelled peanuts
* 5 to 10 dried small red chili peppers
* 1/4 t. crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 t. crushed garlic

====Vegetables:====
* 1 green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
* 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
* 1 can (5-oz) sliced bamboo shoots, drained (optional)
* 3 stalks cut celery

* 4 green onions, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, including tops

====Sauce:====
* 2 T Soy Sauce
* 2 T rice vinegar
* 4 T Chicken broth
* 1 t garlic powder
* 1 t sugar
* 1 t cornstarch
* 1 t sesame oil
*2 teaspoon Hoisin sauce

==Procedure==
#Measure and prepare all ingredients before cooking.
#Mix all '''Chicken/Marinade''' ingredients in a bowl, stir well and allow to marinate for 1/2-hour.
#Mix '''Sauce''' ingredients in another bowl and set aside until needed. Stir out any lumps.
#Heat wok or large frying pan until water drops bead up and dance on the hot surface.
#Add cooking oil to wok. Wait a few seconds for oil to heat up.
#Add remaining '''Spice''' ingredients to wok and stir fry for 30-seconds.
#Add '''Chicken/Marinade''' to wok and stir fry for about 4-minutes (until chicken is cooked through).
#Add '''Vegetables''' to wok and stir fry for about 2 or 3-minutes.
#Stir '''Sauce''' and add to wok. After the sauce comes to a boil, cook for about 1-minute (until sauce thickens).
#Stir to coat other ingredients with thickened sauce.
#Pour onto large platter and serve immediately.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Serve with steamed or [[Cookbook:Fried rice|fried rice]].

==Warnings==
* Don't eat the dried, small red chili peppers unless you like spicy-hot foods. They are mainly used to season the pot and are not usually eaten.
* Use care in handling the raw chicken. Wash hands and utensils that come into contact with raw chicken. Don't allow raw chicken or its juices to come into contact with other foods, unless they are to be cooked afterwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The questions posed in Chapter 2. Plant cells are discussed further on this page. Remember, some questions are intended to be thought-provoking and more than one answer may be &quot;correct&quot;. Students and contributors are encouraged to expand upon the discussions here.

 1. Can you think of reasons why macroscopic organisms are multicellular? 

We know that building any structure from small, similar or identical units will confer advantages on that structure over a similar structure molded in one piece, despite the fact that the former approach is likely to be more time consuming to undertake. Consider building a house out of clay (mud), something that is done in many parts of the world where the climate is dry. Typically the mud is attached to other structural elements (called wattle) of sticks or even grasses. In time the mud dries and hardens, forming a shelter that lasts, so long as it is not permitted to get too wet for too long. Yet, such structures have also been built for centuries in very wet places like London and New York.  However, the problem of the dried clay returning to soft mud in a heavy downpour was solved by dividing the clay into small units that could be fired in a kiln to a dryness and hardness that completely resisted rewetting.  We call these units bricks. Using bricks (small units) for construction of walls provided many benefits to the resulting structure: the units could receive special treatment so the resulting structure could be made stronger (and thus taller) and very resistant to weathering.  Constructing from small units meant materials could be made elsewhere, then transported and assembled on the site.  Structures could be designed to be identical to other structures, for more efficiency in construction and use.

Although multicellular organisms are not exactly like brick houses, think of how the advantages of building structures out of bricks can be advantageous properties for an organism as well.   

We believe that life arose as contained chemical reactions in very small structures that reproduced. It is hard to imagine that anything else would be regarded as &quot;living&quot;. Chemical reactions in an open environment, although more or less identical with the reactions carried out within a cell, simply lack permanence or continuity: the reactions run their course until reactants are used up. Our definition of life requires control over such chemical reactions, and the complexity of reactions involved in living systems requires boundaries that separate the life reactions from the outside environment. However, with a membrane (a separating boundary) the area enclosed cannot efficiently increase in size indefinitely.  The larger the volume inside (the bigger the &quot;cell&quot;), the further from the membrane reactions near the middle become. Since reactions inside require access to substances in the environment outside and perhaps removal of useless or harmful substances from inside to outside, a living cell cannot just grow to a large size.

5 pirates of different ages have a treasure of 100 gold coins. On their ship, they decide to split the coins using this scheme: the oldest pirate alive will propose how the coins will be distributed among the pirates, and all pirates remaining will vote for or against it. If more than 50% of the pirates vote for it, then the coins will be distributed as such. Otherwise, the pirate proposing the scheme will be thrown overboard, and the process is repeated with the pirates that remain.

Assuming that all 5 pirates are extremely intelligent, rational, greedy, and do not wish to die, (and are rather good at math for pirates) what will happen?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The eldest pirate will propose a 97, 0, 1, 0, 2 split. 

Working backwards, splits in terms of younger to older:

2 Pirates:  Pirate two splits at 100, 0.  Otherwise, and perhaps even then, pirate 1 (the youngest) votes against him and over he goes!

3 Pirates:  Pirate three splits at 0, 1, 99.  Pirate 1 (the youngest) is going to vote against him no matter what (see above), but this way, pirate 2 will vote for him, to get at least one gold out of it.

4 Pirates:  Pirate four splits of 1, 2, 0, 97.  This way, pirate 1 will vote for him, and so will pirate 2 - they're getting more than they would under 3 pirates.

5 Pirates:  Pirate five splits of 2, 0, 1, 0, 97.  This way, pirate 1 will vote for him, and so will pirate 3 - they're both getting better than they would under 4.

As described by Turing, the test consists of an AI and a human being siting in separate rooms. A researcher sits separate from both of them in a different room. The researcher does not know which room houses which entity, yet he can communicate freely with both the AI and the human. If the researcher is incapable of differentiating between the human and the AI, then the AI has &quot;passed&quot; the Turing Test.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;small&gt;&lt;&lt; [[Botany#Contents|Contents Page]] |  [[Botany/Magnoliophyta|Chapter 15]] | &lt;/small&gt;Chapter 16&lt;small&gt; | &lt;/small&gt;
----
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 16. Magnoliophyta (II)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
----

The '''Class Liliopsida''' constitutes the monocotyledonous angiosperms and includes some of the largest plant families such as the orchids with some 20,000 species and the grasses with perhaps 15,000 species. In the previous [[Botany/Magnoliophyta|chapter]] we learned how to separate the two major flowering plant groups: the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons, and covered a number of dicot families.  In this chapter, we shall do the same by considering representative monocot families.

The liliopsids are considered to form a monophyletic group evolved from an early dicot. The oldest fossils presumed to be monocot remains date from the Early Cretaceous (Herendeen &amp; Crane, 1995). Features that are generally common to monocots include vascular bundles that are irregularly distributed (in cross-section of the stem), leaves with parallel venation, and flower parts in multiples of three. Although true secondary growth is absent, most growth habits are found in the group including floating and submerged aquatics, lianas, trees, epiphytes, and forbs of all sizes (Hahn, 2005).

== Grasses ==
[[Image:Pennisetum_setaceum-Guinther.jpg|right|400px]]

The second largest (to Orchidaceae) and one of the most successful of families of monocotyledons is the grass family, classified as the '''Family Poaceae''' (or Gramineae) and comprising nearly 10,000 species distributed more widely than any other angiosperm family. This family is also the most important economically, providing species that are the world's staple food supply. The grasses have reduced floral structures compared with most angiosperms for the reason that grasses are almost exclusively pollinated by wind. Therefore, these plants have had no cause to evolve floral structures that are attractive to insect (or other animal) pollinators.  The grasses also have a fairly specific body plan that is immediately recognizable and very successful for colonizing seasonally dry landscapes, yet modifiable to suit a wide range of ecological conditions.
Bor (1960) stated: 
:The amazing diversity of shapes, sizes, texture and so on in the various parts that make up the vegetative and the reproductive shoot is alike the admiration and exasperation of the taxonomist.  It can be said... that in no other family of monocotyledons, or dicotyledons for that matter, has a relatively simple structure been so altered in the process of evolution as to produce the amazing wealth of forms known to us.  It is as if Evolution, in an excess of exuberance, had added this, subtracted that, enlarged this, suppressed that, in fact tried out every possible combination and permutation of characters to produce a family as complicated and as difficult [taxonomically] as, if not more difficult than, any other.

=== Anatomy ===
Grasses have fibrous roots and three kinds of stems: culms, rhizomes, and stolons. The '''culm''' is the main aerial shoot to which leaves and flower head are attached. The culm is a rounded or slightly flattened stem with one or more solid joints known as ''nodes''. The leaves are attached at the nodes and if the stem is not simple but branched, branches arise only at nodes. Roots may also develop from a node where the node comes into contact with the ground (as in decumbent and prostrate stems).  The portion of the stem between the nodes is called the ''internode'', and is usually hollow in temperate zone grasses and solid in tropical grasses (Rotar, 1968). All or a portion of an internode may be surrounded by the basal part of the leaf known as the ''sheath''.  

A '''rhizome''' is a modified stem that grows underground. Rhizomes are jointed (thus distinguishable from roots) with bladeless leaves (''scales'') arising from the joints. Rhizomes enable the grass plant to spread horizontally as new culms develop vertically from the joints. Thus, grasses with extensive rhizome development will form a turf rather than distinct tufts or bunches.

A '''stolon''' is a stem that creeps across the surface of the ground, and is really a basal branch of the culm that will develop roots and shoots from some or all of its nodes. Like a rhizome, a stolon results in a spreading or turf forming grass plant.

[[Image:Ruwbeemdgras Poa trivialis ligula.jpg|right|thumb|270px|''Poa trivialis'' showing membranous ligules pressed against culm]]
Grasses display two types of leaves: (1) green leaves consisting of a sheath and blade, and (2) reduced leaves consisting of only a sheath. With but a few exceptions, the green leaves arise at nodes alternately up the culm.  Leaves that are concentrated near the base where the internodes are very short are termed ''basal leaves''; leaves arising at nodes along an elongated culm are ''cauline leaves''. These vegetative leaves typically surround the culm as a ''sheath'', then diverge outward (at the &quot;collar&quot;) as a long narrow ''blade'' with longitudinal parallel venation. If the veins are conspicuous, the leaf is striate; if the veins are raised, the leaf is ribbed.
  
The '''sheath''' of the leaf surrounds and protects the shoot. In some species, the sheath extends beyond the next node, so that consecutive leaf sheaths overlap, hiding the nodes. The longitudinal edges of the sheath may overlap, completely surrounding the culm, or the sheath may be tubular (the margins connate).  The upper end of the sheath, known as the sheath mouth is the collar on the lower (outer) surface that may be produced into short appendages called ''auricles''. On the inner, upper surface of the leaf, between the sheath and the blade, is an outgrowth called a ''ligule''. This may be a flap of membranous tissue or simply a fringe of hairs, an inconspicuous rim, or even absent all together, marked only by dark tissue.

Although there is variation in leaf '''blade''' shape, most grasses have linear-shaped leaves that are many times longer than wide, with margins that are parallel then taper to a point at the apex. Grasses that grow in shady places may have lanceolate or even ovate leaf blades. 

Flowers of grasses are borne in an inflorescence or flower head which terminates the culm and other branches of the stem.  Smaller units of the inflorescence are called '''spikelets''' and these are arranged on one or more branches in a wide variety of different ways to which the standard terminology for inflorescences can be applied, but using the spikelet instead of the individual flower. Thus:

* In a '''panicle''', spikelets are carried on branches of the axis.
:The panicle can be either open or dense and crowded, with the branches so short that they are concealed by the spikelets, forming a ''false spike''. 
* In a '''spike''', the spikelets are carried, unstalked, directly on an unbranched axis, called a ''rachis''.
* In a '''raceme''' some or all of the spikelets are attached to the rachis by stalks called ''pedicels''.

===  Neuron Communication===

Communication between neurons relies on molecules called neurotransmitters.  Without
going into the details of this process, it suffices to say that for a neuron to transmit
information to another neuron, it must release a neurotransmitter in the small gap between
the two neurons, called a synapse.

More than 300 different neurotransmitters are known to be used in one role or another
by the human brain.  Three of them in particular, ''serotonin'', ''dopamine'', and, ''norepinephrine'' have
been identified as playing a major part in the physiology of clinical depression although others may also be important.

In a variety of clinical trials it has been shown that the use of drugs that mimic or affect how neurotransmitters are produced, destroyed, and moved in the brain can have verifiable effects on depression.

For example many popular anti-depressants are SSRIs. They decrease the amount of serotonin that neurons remove from synapses.

Although the effective use of these drugs shows that depression can be affected by physical changes in the Brain no one is sure exactly how these medication are effective.

Depression affects the area of the brain responsible among others for memory, learning,
and tasks that require concentration and organisation [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7].

== Suicide ==
&quot;Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem&quot;.  There is much wisdom to this sentence, and it is probably the best advice you can give a depressed person.  Unfortunately, during that critical stage is difficult for them to visualise the temporary nature of the problem, and suicide is not uncommon.  If you a have a friend or a loved one going through that stage of a depression, do take the possibility seriously and do what you can to prevent it from happening.  In particular, make sure they are being handled by a competent professional. Fortunately, especially if people are young, this stage will not last very long, typically just a few days or weeks.

== The Role of Sports ==

The role played by sports and physical exercise in depression is far more complex than either
the ''sports good'' and ''sports bad'' mantras would lead one to assume.  Moreover,
I would say that this is one area where our current understanding of depression is sorely
incomplete.  Consequently, beware that much of the material in this section is conjectural.
I am well aware that most people's gut  will be to dismiss my conjectures as pure rubbish,
since &quot;everyone knows that sports are good for you&quot;.  A couple of years ago I would have
whole-heartedly agreed with them, but I have learnt otherwise in the meantime.  Furthermore,
read carefully and you will see that I do not deny that sports can be good for you.  I simply
add a poignant ''however'' to the issue of sports and depression.

This issue is complex enough to warrant a number of subsections.  I will first make
a distinction between the temporary improvement of mood brought by sports, versus
the long-term actual improvement of the depression.  Second, I will put forth the
tentative mechanism of why moderate amounts of exercise can help to recover from
depression.  Third, I will describe the caveats of doing exercise to recover from
a depression. At last, I will describe a real-world example of how sports can be
used to make people be more active during a depression, with the drawback that
recovery takes longer.

Sports or exercise is challenging for people experiencing depression primarily because of the engagement of mind, body and spirit. For example, persons depressed as a result of sexual trauma have spent an unknown length of time separated intellectually from their body(ies). One exercise that allows for a kind of autonomy while truly strengthening the body and connecting mind and body is lap swimming. Here an individual can focus on breathing as one would while engaged in meditation. There are also various kinds of disguises involved in swimming starting with swim goggles. The combination of the &quot;mask&quot; and the single swim lane results in a safe environment. 

Swimming requires regular participation. The outcomes (for me) are still being recognized, but the main effort to connect or to reconnect the mind and the body through a concentrated routine of swimming for exercise are being realized.

=== Feeling Good vs. Actual Improvement ===

''Sports alone can lift up a depression'', says one of the most common pieces of advice about
the illness.  Unfortunately, this statement is grossly incomplete, often tragically so.  If you
have properly understood the roles played by adrenaline and cortisol (take a look again at
the section on [[../The Stress System/]]
to refresh your memory), you already have a glimpse
of why this is such misleading advice.  Exercise can indeed momentarily ''lift up'' the
subjective feeling of a depressed person, but that is all caused by adrenaline.  It is
therefore critical to make the distinction between the momentary mood improvement caused
by exercise (which is undisputed), and whether it translates into an actual improvement
of the underlying depression.

Please refer back to [[../The Stress System/]].
There I have speculated on recent findings
which indicate that a process known as ''neurogenesis'' (&quot;neuron birth&quot;) is implicated
in recovery from depression.  This process takes about three weeks to occur*, which also
happens to be the average time required for antidepressants to have an effect.  This
coincidence has led some to hypothesise that antidepressants work by stimulating neurogenesis
[http://www.biopsychiatry.com/newbraincell/].  The point of this digression is to emphasise that anything which has
a positive effect on recovery from depression is likely to require at least three weeks to work and will often take longer to be noticeable. One should therefore be a bit suspicious of any cure which seems to work instantly, as is the
case of exercise.

Now the question is: does exercise also have a long-term positive effect on depression,
or is it all a short-term illusion?

=== Why Moderate Exercise May Sometimes Help ===

A '''moderate''' amounts of
aerobic exercise seem to help many depressed and healthy individuals.


At last, a word of advice.  '''If you think you have a depression, you should seek professional
help'''.  It might be tempting for some people to try to exercise their way out of a depression,
but chances are you might actually be making your condition worse.  See next section for details.

=== Caveats of Treating Depression with Exercise ===

Looking back on [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Cortisol.png|Figure 2]] from
[[../The Stress System/]],
some people might suggest that a person with a severe
depression could avoid the ''crashing down'' simply by exercising every single day.
In a sense, as soon as your body begins to crash, you simply do more exercise to rev it
up again.  You could therefore reap the positive temporary effects of exercise, and hopefully
avoid the negative side.  This routine &quot;sort of&quot; works, but is also extremely dangerous,
as I will proceed to explain.

The major problem is that having too many stress hormones flowing through veins has a
negative effect on sleep.  And sleep is crucial for recovery.  So people with more
severe depressions who exercise every day will not sleep as much as they should,
and the recovery will therefore take longer (see [[../A Real World Example|next section]] for a real world example).
More seriously, if the amount of
exercise is too high, they might even regress.  Even more seriously, if the underlying
depression worsens, people might be tempted to increase the amount of exercise
to compensate, which will quickly lead them into a very dangerous downwards spiral.
In a sense, advising a seriously depressed person to exercise is like telling a drunken
individual that the best way to avoid a hangover is to keep drinking; or advising a heroin
addict that the best way to avoid the withdrawal symptoms is to keep injecting the drug.

This is unfortunately not widely known, but even healthy individuals who exercise
too much can develop the symptoms of a depression.  This is sometimes referred
to as the ''athletic overtraining syndrome'' [http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~acheyne/S_P.html], and by now
you should have understood the basic mechanism of why it arises.

=== A Real World Example ===

At last I will provide you a real world example which illustrates the caveats
of doing sports during depression.  Some companies here in the Netherlands
rely on a sports-intensive routine to put people back to work sooner.  In basic terms,
the routine involves running every single morning for a period between one hour and one
hour and a half.  The running is performed under controlled conditions, to prevent
the heart rate from ever going over 130 beats per minute.   If you understood the role
of sports in depression, you will also realise just how this scheme works: it
basically gets their brains running on adrenaline.  This is not entirely harmless,
as during the recovery period the people will have elevated heart rate and stress hormones
flowing through their veins.  Also, with all that adrenaline
in their systems, they will not sleep as much as they could, which makes a full
recovery last much longer, ''up to three years''.
The advantage of this scheme?  Well, they do begin working (part-time of course)
much sooner than otherwise.

At this point you might be wondering how they do not realise what is really happening.
Remember that adrenaline is an insidious hormone, which makes one feel good even
as it revs up the body, and this scheme requires them to exercise ''every single day without exception''.
Obviously, the idea is to keep them from crashing down from all that adrenaline, and therefore to
prevent them from realising their true status.  Also, there is widespread ignorance
about depression among Dutch GPs, which makes it all the more unlikely that
someone will realise that there is something fishy going on.  Personally, I find
this scheme to be utterly mad.  But then, I am not a Calvinist.

Should you be thinking that this scheme is also a perfectly viable alternative way of curing
a depression&amp;mdash;one which takes longer, is potentially harmful to the general health, '''but'''
does allow one to become active sooner rather than later&amp;mdash;I would even be tempted to agree
with you.  '''However''', I still think that the ultimate choice should reside
with each individual person.  It is their health we are talking about, after all.  These
people should be properly informed of all possible alternatives and the implications of
each one.  This is currently not happening.
