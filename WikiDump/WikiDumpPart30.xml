      <text xml:space="preserve">Cool things in blender that aren't that obvious. Useful tips and tricks in Blender.

==Attribution==

Many of The Following Tips and Tricks have been contributed by members of the [http://www.cgsociety.org/ CGsociety.org], a Public Society for Digital Artists. The tips have been extracted from a [http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=52560&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15 CGsociety thread].
They have been roughly edited to improve readability.

==File Browser Functions==

===Delete, Move, Rename, and Make Directory===

When you are inside a file browser for loading or saving something and you want to create a new directory, just add the name to the path on top of the window and confirm 'Makedir'.

you can also delete(x), move(m), or rename(n) a file. you can do action on multiple files by seling with right click

===Preview images when loading them as a texture===

Whenever you are loading images as a texture, you can hold down '''Ctrl''' while clicking on the 'load'

===Trick for Creating Quick File Revisions===

After you have saved a blend file or an image you can then save it in progression that is:

car .blend. or car .JPG

Next time do &quot;Save As&quot; then press the + (plus) key which will advance the blend file by 1 every time it's pressed. example: car .blend becomes car 1.blend. press again car 2.blend and so on.

The - (minus) key will subtract one. I've gotten into the habit of saving frequently. Yeah I know there is now the undo feature but I like this better because it gives you a history in case you need to back a few levels of a build. You get a saved version at the level you choose.

Note: Blender automatically detects the number... meaning it does not need to be in any position. For instance: If you have a file named 001starport.png or .blend or whatever, pressing the + (plus) key will automatically name it 002starport.png. If you want to name it starport1.png, it will change it to starport2.png.

Two rules:
The filename has to have a number. It can be 0, or 1, or 3.141569.

If the file number is a negative, pressing + (plus) key will increase the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the negative number. I may have used magnitude wrong, if so, I mean pressing the + (plus) key will make -0.04 drop to -0.05. The - (minus) key will bring you only to 0, and then it will start to eat itself up.

===Open Recent===

Control O

==Object/Vertex Manipulation==

===Constrain Movement to one Axis or to a plane===

when moving objects/vertices or set of objects/vertices ('''[G]''' key) if you move in the direction of the global X axis (Up/Down) and then press the '''MMB''', movement will be constrained to only move in the X axis, or if you move the vertices in the direction of the Y axis and then press '''MMB''' it will be constrained to move only in the Y axis. The same is true of the Z axis.

You can achieve the same effect by using the X, Y or Z keys while in grab mode. You simply have to press X key, Y or Z, once to lock to X Y or Z global axis,*

To Constrain the Movement to two axes (a plane):
Press '''Ctrl+X''' to move in the Z-Y-Plane. '''Ctrl+Z'''=XY, '''Ctrl+Y'''=XZ.* 

Alternatively, Select scaling mode and select the axis not to scale with the selecting button at the same time as you hit '''Shift'''.

*in every case You can hit the X,Y or Z button again to constrain movement to a different set of axes. Normally this different set of axes is local. However you can change the identity of this set to  global, local, normal, or view by pressing '''Alt+Space'''. which cycles through the different identites.

Note: All of these shortcuts work with scaling and Rotating as well

===Shrink/fatten mesh in direction of vertex normals===

When you're mesh-editing, '''Alt+S''' will shrink/fatten the mesh selection in the direction of the vertex normals.


===Vertex Parenting===

You can parent object to a Mesh, in that case you are parenting to the center of the mesh.. BUT if the mesh is translated somehow (let's say by an armature''''[S]''' pose) the center remains in the same spot, and thus the child object doesn't receive any transformation at all.

To solve this, you can parent the child object to a vertex (or a face) within the mesh, and any transformation that the vertex receives is passed to the child.

There are only 2 options, to parent to any 3 vertex within the mesh or to parent to just one vertex. If you parent to 1 vertex then only location information is passed, with 3 vertex all transformations (rotation, location and size) are passed to the child.

How to do it? Starting out of edit mode select the child(ren), hold '''Shift''' and select the parent, enter edit mode, select one or three vertex, press '''Ctrl+P'''. That's it!

===Work around to welding Verts===

For Edge loop (Verts) position both loops together as close as possible then hit W then 4 (not on numkey pad). You can adjust how far the effect of collapse can go in the Edit window (a button on the right labeled Limit: ***, where * is a number).

As for individual Verts, e.g. Two vertices welded to become one, select both Verts, scale until they are very close then hit W then 4.

you can also do this with the snap combo

select the vertex you want to weld together
'''Ctrl+S''', Cur -&gt; Sel
'''Ctrl+S''', Sel -&gt; Cur
'''[W]''', Remove Doubles

Also, whenever Blender pop up a menu with different options, you can just type in a number to choose one of the options (use the numbers not on the '''NumPad''')

===Make individual objects the camera and Change them back===

If you select certain objects and press '''Ctrl+0(zero)'''it will make them the camera. I use it all the time to align spotlights.

Select your camera and hit '''Ctrl NumPad 0''' to make it the active camera again

===Ordering Meshes in Vertex Groups===

If you are preparing to skin your meshes and you are ready to create the vertex groups, you should pay attention to the order in which you create them, because once they are created there is no way to re-arrange them on the vertex-group list.

That means that if you are a ultra-by-the-book person and you would like the vertex group alphabetically ordered on the list them you must create them in alphabetical order.

.. Or, if you would like them to be ordered according to their function (shoulders, then arms, then forearms, then palms, etc. you must create them in that order.

This may all sound like a stupid thing to care about, but If you have a character with 39 vertex groups you may quickly find that when one of them needs fixing it is a little difficult since they were randomly created.

=== Position and scale along face normal,===

-'''Shift V''': Position camera along face normal,
'''Alt S''': scale selected vertices along face normal 


===Using Fake Users===

pressing '''Shift+F4''' will turn the window into a ¨Data Select Window¨ where you can assign and unassign fake users to almost everything by selecting the name and pressing the F key 

Creating a fake user allows you to keep useful data blocks (materials, textures, base meshes) at hand even if they are not linked to an object.
You can use it to set a default material that would have the shader you like best.

===Align a selection of vertices on a plane===

If you want to perfectly align a selection of vertices on a plane, you just have to follow these little steps:

1.) Before you are selecting the vertices you want to align, position your 3D cursor in the plane that you want to align to (you could select the 4 vertices of a big plane and hit '''Shift+S''' / Cursor-&gt;Selection for example, but you can position it anywhere)


2.) Now select those vertices you want to align

3.) Choose &quot;3D Cursor&quot; under &quot;Rotation/Scaling Pivot&quot;

4.) Now with the '''[S]'''-key start scaling mode, hit the key of the axis you want to move the vertices on (X,Y,Z)

5.) Holding down the '''Ctrl-Key''', you can now move the vertices in one line towards the cursor, until the value for the chosen axis is 0.000. Alternatively, just enter, using the keyboard, the scale factor you want (0 in this case) .

6.) Hit LMB. The vertices are perfectly aligned along a plane through the 3D cursor.

This even works very well while in perspective view mode, so you can align on the fly and don't have to switch to front/side/top view all the time.

===Welding Vertices===

You can weld vertices by selecting them in edit mode and pressing '''Alt+M'''.


===View wireframe of hidden Verts===

to view the wireframe of hidden Verts, make sure you are in WIREFRAME MODE and then turn SubSurf on and change the level to 0
If you already knew about this then 

===Select a true loop===
shortcut is '''Shift + Alt + right Button''' of the mouse, serves to select true loop, in vertices as in edges like in faces.

===Selecting one object from a single mesh comprised of multiple objects===

If you have more than in Edit Mode, you can place your mouse cursor next to one of the Verts in the desired object, then press the &quot;L&quot; key to select all of the Verts linked to that one. &quot;Alt+L&quot; reselects in the same manner.

===Precise Zoom and Select/Deselect===

Selecting: If you Hold down the '''Ctrl+LMB''' (left mouse button) and drag the mouse, it will allow you draw a selection as opposed to using the B button which gives you a square.

Deselecting:To draw an area to deselect, Hold down the '''Ctrl+ Shift+ LMB'''(left mouse button) and drag the mouse,

Zooming:Hold down the '''Ctrl+MMB'''. Move your mouse vertically to can get a more controlled zoom versus scrolling the Mouse wheel.

This feature may not be present in 2.37 or earlier versions.


===Mouse Gestures===

Left click and draw:

*a straight line - moves the selected object.
*a circle - rotates the selected object (note: this must be drawn fairly circle-like).
*a V - scales the selected object.

===Selecting Obscured or Hidden Objects===

Say you are in front or side view and you want to select an object, but it is obscured or hidden behind other objects. If you press '''Alt RMB''' over a group of objects, a menu will be displayed in the 3D window allowing you to pick the object you wish to select.
===Select or Deselect Multiple Vertices===

In Edit mode, when you click the '''RMB''' near a vertex that vertex (face or edge)will be selected, '''RMB''' again will reselect. By holding the '''Shift''' key this will allow you to add each selected vertex (face or edge) in that highlighted group.

Pressing the U key (Undo in Edit mode) will also remove the last selection you made.

Alternatively, you can Press B and then draw a box with '''MMB'''. Anything caught in the box will be deselected. Also works with BB and the draw selection. Draw with '''MMB''' and you reselect.


===Selecting multiple items===

You can hold '''Shift''' and use right mouse button to select multiple items to append.

===Measuring, length, distance on an object.===

Hit &quot;F9&quot; (editing), you should have split (2) windows. One &quot;3d&quot; the other &quot;buttons&quot;
go to the Mesh Tools 1 panel and press the Edge Length, Edge Angles and the dimensions will appear on your selections in the 3d view.

===Adding Connected Vertices===

In Edit Mode, if only one vertex is selected, pressing &quot;E&quot; will add a vertex, on a freely defined place, connected 
to the selected one. As will holding '''CTR'''L and left clicking the mouse where you want the new vertex to be positioned.

Note: It must be an Image texture and in wireframe mode to be visible.

(2.37a)


===Recalculate Normals===

'''Ctrl + N''' = Recalculate normals outside (you might have to select faces before doing so)
'''Shift + Ctrl + N''' = Recalculate normals inside

These two hotkeys are useful when you extrude some edges and see a kind of seam in between (due to normals pointing in different directions).

Then, after selecting an edge, '''Ctrl + NumPad(+)''' selects the face associated with this edge. '''Ctrl + NumPad(-)''' deselect the face.


===Create a Quad from two Tris===

'''Alt + J''' when having two Tris selected makes a Quad.

===Remove Doubles===

To Remove Doubles use hotKey: W. You can adjust the &quot;limit&quot; option so that &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; has more or less tolerance. This option is located in editing window under the mesh tools panel, (i.e. weld vertices that are further?)

===Combine edit levels on a mesh.===

When in Edit mode for a mesh (TAB key) you can choose the level that you wish to edit at. At the bottom of the 3D window, there are four buttons. Vertex, edge, face &amp; back-face cull.

By default the vertex level is selected, if you hold '''Shift''' and press the edge button, you can use both at once.


===Change Select Mode===

to change select mode (vertex, edge or face) you can press '''Ctrl+Tab'''. But this way you can't use the Ctrl+Key to ADD the select modes.. Still could be useful, if you don't have a header for the window you're working in..

===Precision Warping===

When using the warp tool ('''Shift+W''') you may find that there are times when you have trouble perfectly closing a 360-degree loop. This is because Blender will warp based on the total width of the selection, which may not necessarily be what you want. 


Getting around this is simple, just select two verts to denote the new endpoints, duplicate them ('''Shift+D'''), scale the two verts times two, so they are just twice as far apart. Then select what you want to warp plus those two marker verts, and warp 720 degrees. 


When done, click a vert on your mesh and type '''L''' to select everything linked to it. Then type '''H''' to hide it. Once you've hidden all of your mesh, all that remains are the two marker verts. Do a Select All ('''A''') and type '''X''' to delete them. Now unhide your mesh using '''Alt+H''' and you have just the warped mesh, extra guide verts are all cleaned up.

===Precision Cutting===

The Knife Tool can actually be quite precise if you take advantage of the snap feature. Press '''K''', choose '''&quot;Knife(Exact)&quot;''' and then hold the '''Ctrl''' key while choosing where you wish to cut and you will find that the path to be cut will now snap to nearby vertices. 


Keep in mind that the vertices being snapped to don't have to be the ones you are cutting. Say you want to cut the midsection out of a UV sphere and you want the cut to be two grid units in height. While viewing the side of the sphere, add a plane, and scale it to be two grid units tall, and wide enough so that it extends beyond the sphere. Now select the vertices of the sphere (because what we have selected is what gets cut) and when you cut it, snap to the four verts of the plane. Now hit '''Enter''' to apply your perfect cut. 


Using guide geometry such as a plane to cut other geomery &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; style can be extremely useful when accuracy is needed. Remember to align your view before cutting, since your view will determine the angle from which the geometry is cut.

==Working  with Meshes==


===Turning Sub-Surfed Mesh into Normal Mesh===

If you have a sub-surfed mesh you can turn THAT sub-surf mesh into a normal mesh.
Just select the sub-surfed mesh and press '''Alt+C''' (Conversion).

===How to remove (numb) black spots on a Mesh===

If a Sub-Surfed mesh becomes (numb) black on some places, that's because of the normals. Select all and press '''Ctrl+n''' and then confirm. now it should look prettier!

if the above solution does not work , save your Blend file, Quit Blender then restart. Use '''Ctrl O''' to open the last file and your mesh will have returned to correct shaded state.

===Select all holes in a mesh and fill them===

'''Shift+M'''* selects all Non-manifold edges/vertices (holes) in a mesh **. Then all you have to do is hit '''Ctrl+F''' to auto-fill those holes with &quot;beauty fill&quot;. 

*
'''Shift+M '''is an alternative shortcut for 'Select Non-manifold'. You'll find this in the select menu when in mesh edit mode. The listed short cut there is '''Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M'''. '''Shift M''' is obviously a lot more comfortable on the fingers though!
** 
Although 'Non-manifold' usually refers to holes in your mesh, it is not necessarily only holes e.g., an edge with three faces coming out of it is also a non-manifold edge!



===Fill in four or fewer vertices===

Select the vertices and press '''[F]''', this will fill in the empty space around them.

To clean up a filled in space, select all the vertices for the area, and press '''[F]'''. Choose OK to make FCon.
For example: add a plane in wireframe mode, extrude it several times, select all vertexes, then hit '''[F]'''.



==Animation==

===Animation  Preview in all windows at the same time===

It is well known that '''Alt+ a''' is for previewing an animation on the 3D window. But that's not all of it. Divide your screen into multiple 3D Windows, each from a different point of view.

Press '''Alt + Shift + a'''

Enjoy!!!

If you have an Action/Ipo Window and 3D windows open, and you issue the '''Alt + Shift + a''' command from the Action (or the Ipo) window, it will animate both (the action and the 3D) in sync!! Great for visualization of Ipo's effect on your model.

===Choose animation mode, Convert mouse movements to IPO===

-T in IPO window: Choose animation mode, i.e., linear, bezier, constant
-'''[R]''' in IPO window: Record mouse movements, and convert to IPO


===Animate procedural textures===

To animate procedural textures, press 'i' with the mouse pointer in the materials window, and select the type of Key-Frame you wish to set in the pop up menu. advance a few frames, tweak your materials, and set another key frame.

==UV Mapping, Particles and Texturing==

===Blender color picker===

Blender has a PhotoShop-esque color picker. Simply click on the color preview next to the sliders to use it. Hit enter when you have the color you want.


===Saving your face groups selections===

Regarding UV mapping and Face Groups Selections there seems to be the general misconception that you can't save your face groups selections on Blender.

Most people already know that from within the Face Select Mode (Potato Mode) you can switch into Edit Mode and whatever selection you do while in Edit Mode is passed back to Face Select Mode when you exit the Edit Mode.

Well, Did you ever wonder why Material Index Groups (that are nothing more than face groups with a common material on them) have those little 'Select' and ´Deselect' buttons there? Sure they come handy for later modification of the material index but that is not all about them.

Do this: Before starting the UV unwrapping job, cut your mesh by creating as many material indexes as you need, you can even assign each one a different color so you can be sure that there is no face orphan. Once you have the mesh all cut and sliced (so to speak) you enter in Face Select Mode, then switch into Edit Mode, select the index containing the faces you want to unwrap, press 'Select', leave Edit Mode and Voile! You now have an entirely useful face group waiting for you to unwrap. No more manual (and imprecise) face selection is needed.

If you later need to change the mapping of those faces, don't fear. Just make sure there isn't any face selected on Potato Mode, do as you did first (enter edit mode, select the index, exit edit mode) and there are your very same faces selected again with the UV mapping you already assigned to them.

Note: Another benefit of have precise face selection groups is that, initially, you don't have to worry about UV coordinates overlapping, since you know have the way to select ONLY the faces you want to. For example, you unwrap all your faces by groups and when you are done you can start thinking about scale and position within the texture map, not like before when you have to solve those things as you go.



===Bulk Texture Change===

Consider a scenario in which you have a scene with a 100 mesh objects, and 50 of them have one texture and 50 of them have another.

If you want to change the texture of the first 50, but don't want to change each individually, do the following. Add a Plane out of the view of the camera. Add your new texture (Material) to the plane. Then use the “Copy to material Buffer” button in the header of the Material buttons.
Select one mesh object of the same sort that you want to change, open Material buttons and Paste from Material Buffer.

All the mesh objects with the same texture will now have the new texture.

Alternatively, If you have a material that you want to apply to a lot of objects at once:

1. Select all the objects you want to apply the material to.
2. Apply a material. (this only applies to the last selected object)
3. press '''Ctrl+L''' &gt; Materials. (this links the material of the last selected object to all the other objects)


===Negative Meta-Balls===

Add&gt;Metaball as usual. Exit EDIT mode and Add&gt;Metaball. This time before you exit EDIT mode, hit the Negative button in the EDIT buttons window. Then leave edit mode.

If you move the negative Metaball around, you can see the effect it has on the positive metaball.

Be careful though, as negative metaballs are not displayed in the same manner as positive metaballs, you will only see the Pivot point not a meta-mesh.

This is a little test you can try to see the amazing effects negative metaballs can produce.

Make 1 Metaball, make it big.
Place three spheres (UV) inside, make them emit particles, one 100, one 200, one 300 particles.
Parent three negative metaballs, one to each sphere, and use dupli-vert on each sphere.
Make the 100 duplicate metaball quite big, the 200 medium and the 300 small. Hit '''Alt A''' to run animation in 3D window.

===Maintain the UV layout when moving/scaling/rotating UV co-ords.===

When you have the UV image/editor window open and have loaded an image you want to UV map to a mesh, click on the UV tab in the header bar and turn off 'Snap UV to pixels'.

This will help to maintain the UV layout when moving/scaling/rotating UV co-ords.

==Rendering==

===Tricks, related to the view ports and the render buffers===

First. Switching among screens

So you have your screen made off the 3D window, the buttons window and the info window... but you are doing some fine tunning to the mesh in two places simultaneously, and they both need to zoom in the 3D window. You could scroll or zoom out, translate the view and zoom in again. None of them an elegant solution.

Another situation. You are working on a model and are using an image for reference. You are not tracing over the photo, just take a look at it often to make sure you don't deviate to much from the concept. So you open the photo in a 2D program and keep switching back and forth from Blender.. or you have the photo open in an image window and keep maximizing and minimizing the window... another hassle

Worry no more!!! Blender can handle multiple virtual screen (ala Linux) and you can come and go from them with just one key stroke.

Just press '''Ctrl+Left Arrow''' or '''Ctrl+Right Arrow''' (for all of you OS X users, add a '''Shift''') and you are switching screens. Go ahead! By default EVERY .blend file comes with 3 screens ... and of course you can add/delete as many as you see fit.

the magic button to add or delete screens is right beside the Tools menu, up there in the info window.

===Using the render buffers===

Ok, so you set your scene and press RENDER, a nice window comes up and you see your hard work coming to existence (that's the default behavior, if your change it on the display buttons then this may not work for you).

Do you realize that the window containing your render image is also a render buffer? Actually they are 2 buffers for your to play with. Whenever the render window is open (and you can re-open it by pressing F11 without having to wait again for the render) if you press the J key you can switch from Buffer A and B. (the last active one is what you save when you press F3). You can even switch buffers in the middle of a rendering (but I advice against that when rendering very complex scenes, you have been warned!)

The cool thing about having two separate render buffers is that you can have instant before-and-after images for things that you change in the scene. For example you are searching the perfect position for a light source in a scene, you place it and do a render, place the light in another position, switch to the second buffer and do a new render. Now, with the render window open, just press J to see how the change on the light's position influence your scene and that makes your decision easier.

By the way, the render window can be zoomed (by the normal ways or by pressing Z ) to do a closer inspection of the image.

===Render window Tricks===

To zoom into the render window, use the '''ZKEY'''. 

To find out what the (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) values of rendered image are, left click and hold the button of your mouse.this will reveal the RGBA values of the pixel below the mouse cursor. i.e. R 127, G 255, B 13, A40. The values will appear in the bottom left corner of the render window. You can also hold the button and drag the mouse around. This will display the values of the pixels your mouse pointer passes over.

With the render window open, you can press '''AKEY''' to view an alpha version of the image. Press '''AKEY''' again to go back to the normal colour view.

To do a before/after comparison after making a change, hit '''JKEY''' to switch render buffers, then hit '''F12''' to render. In the render window, use '''JKEY''' to alternate between the previous render and the current one, so you can easily see the differences.

===Working while you Render===

If you use a X/X11 based window manager, you do not need to watch blender while it renders, go to a different virtual desktop. Blender doesn't have to keep X informed of what's going on and rendering speed may increase.

===Border Rendering===

In the rendering buttons find the buttons marked &quot;Border&quot; and &quot;Crop&quot;. If you depress &quot;Border&quot;, you can get a rendering of any part of what the camera sees. Just do the following : 

Go into a camera view using '''NumPad 0''', press '''Shift+B'''.
Then, mark the limits of the rendering as you want them using LMB.
Next, render the usual way and the section you marked will be rendered first, then it will be integrated to the complete rendering. If you wish that *only* the chosen section would be rendered then click on the button marked &quot;Crop&quot; also.

===Creating a cluster of particles which takes little time to render===

Render some particles, and make the picture into an alpha mapped tga in GIMP or whatever graphics editing application you use. 

Load the image onto a plane.
Adjust the alpha settings accordingly. 
Parent the plane to the emitter. 
Press dupli-verts.

You now have a cluster of particles which takes relatively little time to render. Of course it doesn't have to be an alpha map of particles. That's entirely up to you.

===Alpha from render view===

When cut &amp; pasting stuff from render window to {insert your favorite image editor here} using '''Alt+ PrtScr''', cut and paste the render first, come back to render window and press &quot;A&quot;. It changes the view to alpha and you get black &amp; white mask to cut the background nicely in the {again, favorite image editor}.
Nice when you do testing in low res.


===View alpha texture as wire.===

'''Ctrl+d''' in 3d
very usefully for preview without rendering.

Also, if you have an object (works best on a mesh plane) with an image texture, you can use '''Alt+V''' key outside edit mode. This will adjust the object's size values so that the image won't be stretched when projected.

==Miscellaneous==

===Restoring your “lost” work.===

If you go to the temp folder where you have Blender save its temp .Blend files, reload the most recent one and this will save you losing the whole of your work. You don't even need to save a .Blend file for this to work. You can change the settings for this in the tool window at the top of the Blender screen.

===Built in Hot-Key List===

Since the few last versions (since 2.28 I think) blender has a built-in all inclusive hot-key list.
Just open a text-editor window, and right besides the option to create a new text-buffer there is a menu option called ¨KEYLIST.intrr¨. Select that option and the full list is loaded in memory

--Edit: There may be many hot-keys missing, especially the newest ones, like M to mirror a mesh, K for the Knife tool, '''Alt+Z''' for textured view... but the list is a good start at least.

===Un-compiled PlugIns ===
Blender can load plug-ins for texturing, sequence editor, etc. . However, Blender comes with a few of such PlugIns un-compiled.

In Linux they are located on the plug-ins sub-directory of the default Blender install, and all that you need is a Make command to compile them. I don't know how to compile them in Windows, but there they are, just waiting for you to awake them!!!

===Blender “Easter Eggs” (Weird things included in blender)===

All Publisher versions of Blender have been shipping with a Monkey mesh called Suzanne. Just open the main tool box ('''Space Bar''') -&gt; Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; and right below the other primitives you'll see the Monkey.

Why/What it is for? Only NaN programmers know*. It is supposed to be a private joke among the blender developing team. Since then, its considered as a sort of mascot for blender. However, it is incredibly useful as a quick complex object for testing textures, shaders, etc..

By the Way, Suzanne isn't the only joke included... but I won't spoil the surprise. You will bump with them on your daily work, that is for sure.

*NaN was the company that originally developed Blender

Try this: run blender with the -Y argument (open the command prompt/terminal, go to your blender executable file folder, and type blender -Y)

===Weird Error Message===

Sometimes, when trying to use a boolean on a tri-based mesh, Blender gives the prompt:
&quot;Wanna Crash?&quot;
&gt;Yes Please!

but clicking it doesn't crash.
This is because Blender is a lot more stable now compared to when that 'crash' request was coded. It also used to appear when using beauty fill after face fill. ('''Ctrl+F''' in edit mode)

Blender 2.37 now has a 'widget', which replicates the red/blue/green axis symbol in 3DSMax in the 3d windows. Rotation scaling and movement of objects/Verts/faces etc., can be manipulated using the widget, or in the usual manner of earlier versions of Blender.


===Turn your blender animation into a screen-saver (Windows)===

to turn your blender animation Windows binary file into a Windows screen saver, rename the EXE file into SCR and right click it and install !


===Discover the FPS rate of a Window===

If you hit '''Ctrl+Alt+T''' key in a window, Blender will tell you how much time it takes to render a single frame of that window, in milliseconds. Valuable Benchmark


==???==

using construction widget press '''Shift''' to get precision mode for fine tuning. Release left mouse button (LMB) and holding '''Shift''' down press it again, then you'll get moving along another axis.

==Sculpt Mode Hotkeys==

* F: an interactive brush resize
* Shift F: an interactive brush strength adjuster
* Ctrl F: in interactive texture angle adjuster for your brush.
* Shift B: a rectanglular zoom selection for close-up work
* Alt B: hides all but selected rectangle
* A: toggles airbrush
* S: smooth
* D: draw
* G: grab
* L: layer
* I: inflate
* P: pinch
* V: toggles add and subtract in draw mode
* Use X, Y and Z to toggle axis mirroring.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Confusing Chart ==

The chart under &quot;where is this language spoken&quot; is a little to much information, i was quite confused by it at first look. This confusion was compounded by the fact that the foot notes are in portuguese. Prehapes we can simplify it in some way (having 2 columns, one with percent, the second with numbers, then having translations of the nations names into english)?
[[User:N1person|N1person]] 13:45, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

== How about a tongue twiser? ==

&quot;Três tristes tigres&quot;
Fun for all trying to learn the language. [[User:Jdos2|Jdos2]] 19:33, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Add pronunciations? ==

How hard would it be to include proper pronunciations?  Ideally, pronunciation could be indicated by sound files (I think Wiki-oriented articles like .ogg files), or at least by including the IPA notation.

Hi I made a fairly major edit but forgot to log in.

*I removed the &quot;confusing chart&quot; because it was not necessary for the scope of this page - it was also in Portuguese which wasn't very helpful.  

*I redid the &quot;where&quot; section - how many children know what &quot;assimilate&quot; means?

*I also changed the history section to make it more readable.

*I changed the links beneath the flags to point to the English Wikipedia article rather than the Portuguese one.

If someone added the pronounciation (not IPA - again how useful is this to children) to the phrases it would help.  I would but I don't speak Portuguese.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PDAS FOR SUPPORTING DYSLEXIC STUDENTS
People with dyslexia have difficulty with words as the brain process deals with language differently than non dyslexic sufferers.  Dyslexic people often lack the skills required when learning how to read and write.  Students with dyslexia often have problems with spelling, keeping appointments and managing their time which can be very stressful particularly around exam times.  For further details please visit The British Dyslexic Association - http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/extra329.html.  One tool on the market for Dyslexic students is a Personal Digital Assistant (P.D.A.).  A PDA is a personal organiser usually of pocket size that come or (can be purchased) with a variety of software programs that will aide dyslexic students overcome some of their difficulties that they encounter when studying. As technology advances so do PDA’s with many on the market now having wireless network facilities allowing easy access to the Internet and email facilities. This article will provide an account of how this tool can be used for students with dyslexia in their everyday lives and what features are specifically useful to them rather than a description of the technological capabilities of a PDA.

PDA’s provide some easy options for organising and planning your work.  The built in organiser functionality is an electronic diary that will allow the user to set reminders similar to using post-it notes and have screen savers with alarm setting using built in sound devices.  Dyslexic sufferers are often prone to short term memory loss and this is just one of the features that will help them.  Students can record lesson and exam timetables and even include locations as the Organiser has a scheduling option similar to Microsoft Outlook.  If the user is familiar with using Microsoft Office applications this software can also be installed and used on a PDA.

Using a PDA for taking notes is extremely useful as they come with a built in keyboard.  You can use a Stylus (electronic pen) to tap in your notes; however, there are several keyboards available that can be attached to the PDA if the user plans to input a lot of information.  The note taking and word processing software come with spell checker functionality which will be invaluable to the dyslexic student.  Dyslexic suffers often have difficulty with organising their thoughts clearly and if students like creating ideas using images then using mind maps is a useful tool to aide them.  Mind-mapping software is readily available on the market and can be installed on a PDA.

One major advantage of using a PDA is its synchronisation capability.  Synchronisation allows the user to update information from a PDA to a Personal Computer keeping it current and making it easily accessible wherever and whenever required.  Synchronisation is an easy way to install programs and transfer files from one device to the other thus making it quicker and avoids duplication.

In conclusion, PDAs have a lot of valuable features that will help Dyslexic suffers to overcome some of the difficulties they face when studying.  If you would like further details on products and how students can use PDA’s please visit the Dyslexic website on http://www.dyslexic.com/database/articles/pdas.html.

== Lesson 3 ==

''In this lesson you will learn how to say phone numbers and ask what someone else's phone number is in Japanese, and learn how to talk about your age.''


=== 電&lt;sup&gt;でん&lt;/sup&gt;話&lt;sup&gt;わ&lt;/sup&gt;番&lt;sup&gt;ばん&lt;/sup&gt;号&lt;sup&gt;ごう&lt;/sup&gt;・Phone Numbers ===



例&lt;sup&gt;れい&lt;/sup&gt;一


* 電話番号は何&lt;sup&gt;なん&lt;/sup&gt;ですか？・でんわばんごうはなんですか？
** ５５５の５５５５です


Translation:


* Question: Denwa bangou wa nan desu ka? - (What is your phone number?)
** Answer: _ _ _ no (の) _ _ _ _ desu (です). - (Phone number)
 
           
'''Example:''' With the phone number, 987-6543, one could appropriately respond to the question, &quot;Denwa bangou wa nan desu ka?&quot; by saying, &quot;&lt;u&gt;Kyuu&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;hachi&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;nana&lt;/u&gt; no (acts as a dash) &lt;u&gt;roku&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;go&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;yon&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;san&lt;/u&gt; desu.&quot;


'''NOTES:''' Always use the word ''yon'' for four and the word ''nana'' for seven in phone numbers. Zero can be either zero - ゼロ (in a Japanese accent) or maru - まる (丸&lt;sup&gt;まる&lt;/sup&gt; - circle). If one would like to ask another's cellphone number add keitai infront of the denwa. ex. 携&lt;sup&gt;けい&lt;/sup&gt;帯&lt;sup&gt;たい&lt;/sup&gt;電話番号は何ですか？・けいたいでんわばんごうはなんですか？
Often times, Japanese will use Kuu(くう） instead of Kyuu（きゅう） for nine（九） because of superstition.

=== 年&lt;sup&gt;ねん&lt;/sup&gt;齢&lt;sup&gt;れい&lt;/sup&gt;・Age ===

''Saying age in Japanese follows a consistant pattern, as demonstrated below.''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

例二


* 何歳ですか？・なんさいですか？
** 二十歳です。・はたちです。


Translation:


* '''Question:''' Nan sai desu ka? - (How old are you?)
** '''Answer:''' &lt;u&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;your age&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt; sai desu. - (I am ___ )



例三


* お幾&lt;sup&gt;いく&lt;/sup&gt;つですか？・おいくつですか？
** 八十三歳です。・はちじゅうさんさいです。

** '''Answer''' &lt;u&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;your age&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt; sai desu. - (I am ___ )


'''PRACTICE:''' Repeating these questions outloud with different ages will help ones memory of the numbers, questions and ages.

: いいてんきですね。 — Nice weather, isn't it?
: 昨日、天気が寒かったです。 — Yesterday, the weather was cold.}}

== Grammar Patterns ==

;&quot;~ですね。&quot;
: When &quot;ね&quot; is added after &quot;です&quot;, it translates similarly to &quot;isn't it?&quot;, or &quot;eh?&quot;.
;そうですね。
: A phrase that usually translates to &quot;it is, isn't it&quot; in this context.

* [[Japanese/Lessons/Na-adjectives]]}}

There are two types of adjectives in modern Japanese: な- and い-adjectives. Both are descriptive and modify nouns. They describe nouns and form predicates differently.

The い-adjectives (形容詞, けいようし) are fairly simple creatures. Any い-adjective will end on an &quot;い&quot; in it's basic form and they behave very regularly. The only problem in differentiating between い- and な-adjectives comes from the fact that some な-adjectives also end on &quot;い&quot; (e.g. きれい and ゆうめい) or a syllable in the い-row (e.g. げんき).

== Grammar ==

When they stand alone, い-adjectives don't take the copula, but when modifying nouns, they do. Otherwise they don't change.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

== Setup ==

Start with the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Beginning Tips|default scene]]: it should contain a selected cube. Delete this cube by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} &amp;rarr; ''Delete''.

[[Image:Blender_3D-cursor.png|right]]
Put the 3D cursor at the scene center by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|C}}.
:'''''Note:''' after deleting the cube you must be in ''Object Mode''. If not, switch with {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}.''

{{Clear}}


== Creating the body ==
[[Image:Blenderpenguin1.gif|right|Z-scaled sphere]]

'''Noob note:''' to ensure that you don't become confused, make sure that your viewport is set up in the same direction you see in these pictures. The colored arrows are red, green, and blue and they control the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes, respectively.)

* We start by creating our main body from a sphere. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}} to switch to top view, and then {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} ''&amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; UVSphere'', then choose 16 segments and 16 rings.
**'''''Note:''' You have to manually switch to the ''Edit Mode'' after creating the sphere; do this by pressing ''TAB'' (In older versions of Blender before 2.45, Blender automatically switches to the ''Edit Mode''. This is OK, since we will start editing the mesh now.)''&lt;br&gt;There was a report that in 2.61 it didn't have a pop up unless the {{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}} key was hit immediately after placing the sphere

We're going to make it look like a penguin body:
* press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}} to switch to the front view,
* with all the vertices selected (if not, {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), choose the scale tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}),
* restrict scaling to the Z-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}),
* and move the mouse away from the 3D cursor while holding down the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key (this snaps the scale values to whole numbers),
** '''''Note:''' Make sure the mouse cursor is not too far away from the sphere when hitting the {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} or else you may not be able to reach a 2.000 scale value. The scaling steps are proportional to the distance from the 3D cursor when calling the scale tool.
* the current scale shows in the lower left corner of the viewport, click when you've reached 2.000 {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}).
** '''''Note:''' You can also do this by typing in 2 after starting the scale and restricting movement to the Z-axis''

This is our main body!

== Shaping the head ==

We’re going to shape the penguin head from the top of the sphere.

[[Image:Blender3D Limit selection to visible.png|right|200px]]
Start by selecting the top-most single vertex as well as the top two smallest circle segments.
:'''''Note:''' selection has been explained in a [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Modeling a Simple Person|previous tutorial]]. Here, the easiest methods are either box selection {{B3D:N2P/Do|BKEY}}) in the front view {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and ''Limit selection to visible'' off, or lasso selection ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}) in the top view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}) and ''Limit selection to visible'' (May also be labeled ''Occlude background geometry'') on.  You can also switch to top view, center your mouse on the topmost vertex and use the circle tool. Don't forget to deselect all first ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}})

:'''Noob note:''' make sure the ''Limit selection to visible/Occlude background geometry'' button is in the right state each time you select vertices, edges or faces. When it's off, selection affects any item, visible or not.''

{{Clear}}




===Building the neck with the 3D transform manipulators===
To turn on the 3D transform manipulator, either push down its button [[File:Blender Handicon.png]] or use {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} and choose ''Enable/Disable''.

====Moving the two selected circles up====
[[File:Blenderpenguin2a.png|right|200px]]
Choose the ''Translate'' manipulator (red triangle). Go to the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}). Drag the blue arrow while holding the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key down to move the selected vertices 0.3 units up.

:'''Noob note:''' you may not be able to snap the extrusion lengths to tenths of units. {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} snaps to the grid size by default: if you can only translate by one unit (1.0), zoom in until the grid divides itself into tenths ('''SCROLL'''). Some Blender versions allow to snap to one tenth of the current step by holding both the {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} keys while moving the mouse.

:'''Noob note:''' instead of the ''Translate'' manipulator, you can use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and constraint the movement to the Z axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}).''

{{Clear}}



====Rotating the neck====
[[Image:Blenderpenguin2b.gif|right|200px]]
Now switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and make sure that the rotation/pivot point is set to &quot;median point&quot; either by selecting it from the third drop down menu right of the &quot;Mesh&quot; menu, or by pressing &quot;;&quot;. Choose the ''Rotate'' tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}).  Move the mouse with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key down to rotate the selection 30 degrees counter-clockwise. Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to validate the rotation.

{{Clear}}



[[Image:Blenderpenguin2c.gif|right|200px]]
Select an additional ring of vertices by expanding the selection ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM+}} (''Note: ''NUM+'' Refers to the addition symbol on the NUM Pad, ''KEY+'' will not do.''). You can contract the selection by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM-}}. Move these vertices an additional 0.3 units up, then rotate them as previously 30 degrees counter-clockwise in the side view.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blenderpenguin3c.gif|right|180px]]
Repeat those steps (selection expansion, translation and rotation) two more times and you'll end up with the body seen in the below.

That doesn’t really look like a penguin, yet!
{{Clear}}



[[File:Blenderpenguin3c.png|right|200px]]


Now move all of the selected vertices to the left 0.4 units by pulling the manipulator's green arrow (and of course holding the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key down). This straightens out the neck as seen in the next picture.

:'''Noob note:''' you can also use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and translate the selection by -0.4 as displayed in the bottom left corner of the viewport. Still do this in the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}).


:'''Noob note''' if you had to pull the red arrow, not the green one, then you probably didn't switch to side view, and modeled the neck in front view. If you realize here that you have this done from another view then press AKEY twice, then NUM7, then Space -&gt; Transform -&gt; Rotate and type 90 or 270

{{Clear}}

====Creating the beak====
[[Image:Blenderpenguin4b.gif|right|180px]]
Switch to the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}), and select the frontmost vertex (the one that originally was the top vertex of the sphere) with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}. Then switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and translate this vertex to the left by 1.2 units using the manipulator's green arrow or the translate tool.

:'''''Note:''' some Blender versions allow moving the vertices from the keyboard with the following sequence: {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}, -1.2, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.''&lt;/br&gt;


The main body of the penguin is now finished. The next step is to create some flappers for the poor little guy.

{{Clear}}

== Extruding the wings ==

We are going to create the wings by extruding faces on each side of the penguin.

:'''Noob Note:''' You can rotate the whole object by pressing A to select all of its vertex and then rotate it pressing R or using the Rotate Manipulator until the axis on your screen matches the axis on the example image. That way, also, you can practice a little more


[[Image:Penguin from sphere - wing start.png|right|200px]]
Choose the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and switch to the ''Face select mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} &amp;rarr; ''Faces'', or click on the triangle in the toolbar).
{{Clear}}




[[Image:Blenderpenguin5b.gif|right|200px]]
Now, select two faces that will make up the penguin’s shoulder as shown on the right (either select the first one with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and the second one holding {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}, or use box selection ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) to select them both in a single operation).
{{Clear}}



[[Image:Blenderpenguin4-02.png|right|200px|Wing extrusion]]
Then switch to front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and extrude the selection:
* choose {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Region'',
* constrain to the X axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}),
* hold {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} to snap,
* and move the mouse to extrude the shoulder by 0.2 to 0.3 units.
{{Clear}}






[[Image:Blenderpenguin4-03.png|right|200px|Bottom face selection]]
We'll now extrude the bottom face of this new extrusion. Rotate the view to show it with:
* a {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} drag, 
* or several presses on {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM2}},
* or {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}} (bottom view).
Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to deselect all, and select the bottom face ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}), switch to front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}), extrude by 1.4 units down ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}).

Now do the same on the penguin's other side: use {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}} to view the left side (you can also rotate with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}, or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM4}} several times).

{{Clear}}

==Smoothing the wings==

We’re going to smooth out the shoulders and improve the wings. Though this can be done in many ways, we'll only use the merge tool.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blenderpenguin4-04.png|right|200px]]

Rotate your penguin so that you can see one shoulder from above. Then switch to ''Vertex select mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} &amp;rarr; ''Vertices''). Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to deselect all, then select the two shoulder vertices with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|MKEY}}, choose ''At Center'' from the popup in order to merge the two vertices at their center.  Finally dismiss the message saying ''Removed 1 Vertices''.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender - Penguinto spheres - wing smoothing.png|thumb|250px|right|Edges to smooth]]
Repeat the steps with the two other vertex pairs shown on the right picture, and smooth the other wing. I’m leaving the middle segments for now, else the wing tips will be too pointy.

:'''''Note:''' if you have troubles merging vertices, it comes from vertex duplicates in your mesh. You probably chose ''Individual Faces'' instead of ''Region'' when extruding the wings, which creates duplicate vertices and neighbouring faces. To clean up your model: select all vertices ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and choose {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; ''Remove Doubles''.''

You must do them one by one!

{{Clear}}




[[Image:Blenderpenguin6b.gif|right|200px]]


Finish off the wings by selecting the two backmost vertices of the wings, and moving them up using the blue arrow by 0.1 unit.

{{Clear}}
[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - wing complete.png|200px|right|Wings complete]]


You should now have something like this:


{{Clear}}

==Cutting the underside==
[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-01.png|200px|right]]
[[Image:blenderpenguin7.gif|right|200px]]
We're going to cut the penguin's lower end, for it to stand up! Select the bottom vertices (bottom vertex and the first ring above it) as shown in the picture. There are many ways, this is left as an exercise.

Once they're selected, delete them ({{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} &amp;rarr; ''Vertices''). Now our penguin is hollow: select all the vertices around the hole, and fill it using {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}}.



:'''Noob note:''' To quickly select all the vertices around the hole, you can enter edge mode {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}-&gt; &quot;Edges&quot;, and then select one edge that goes around the hole. Now press '''CTRL+E''' -&gt; &quot;Edge Loop Select&quot;, which should select all edges around the hole. Now go back to Vertex select mode and continue with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}}.
:'''Noob note:''' For Blender 2.56 In vertex select mode and occlude on hold down ALT and select one of the vertices all the vertices in the ring will be selected.

==Adding the feet==
[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - feet start.png|right]]
The next step is to provide the little guy with feet. To do this, we’re going to extrude two of the front faces:

* choose the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}),
* switch to ''Face select mode'',

Then switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and extrude the selection by -0.6 units ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Region'', restrict to the Y axis: {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}).

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-05.png|right|190px]]

Keep the selection and look for the ''Mesh Tools'' in the Tool Shelf. If you can’t see it, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}} to make the Tool Shelf visible. Then click on the ''Subdivide'' button (under Add in the Tools tab). Or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} and choose Subdivide.

[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-06.png|right|190px]]

Switch to &quot;Vertex Select Mode&quot;,
Now select the three middle vertices (or two edges) vertically at the tip of each foot, and drag them along the Y axis by 0.3 units towards the penguin

:'''Note:''' if something goes wrong here, you may need to remove double first. As always, to move the vertices, either use the manipulator or {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}} sequence.''

[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-10.png|right|250px]]
[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - tail.png|right|250px]]

To complete the penguin, we have to add a tail (the end of the tuxedo):
* go to the back view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}),
* make sure you're still in ''Vertex select mode'',
* and that ''Limit selection to visible''/''Occlude background geometry'' is on.

Select the three middle vertices in the second row up from the bottom.  Then, switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and extrude the edges 0.3 units away from the penguin and 0.08 units down ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Edges''), so that the end of the tail is at the same level as the bottom of the penguin.

'''Noob Note:''' Or you can extrude the edges 0.3 units away from the penguin, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} -0.08, {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

== Subsurfing ==

[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - subsurf.png|frame|right|Now that's what I call a penguin. But then again, there are no penguins where I live, so I might be wrong.]]
Go to ''Object Mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}), and make sure the penguin is selected. Then check for the ''Modifiers'' toolkit in the ''Buttons'' panel. Press ''Add Modifier &amp;rarr; Subsurf'' (or Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|O}}).

Look at the penguin now, he’s much smoother. You can alter the levels of the subsurfing if you like, but I’ll settle for level one.
Under the ''Links and Materials'' toolkit, you can press the ''Set Smooth'' button as well, which makes the penguin really slick.
:'''''Note:''' you may see some weird effects at the bottom and the tail after subsurfing the penguin. If so, there is an issue with normals: they have to be all pointing outwards. This can be achieved by selecting all vertices in ''Edit Mode'' and recalculating the normals outside ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|N}}). Click on the message to confirm. Note that {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|N}} will turn the normals inwards and that {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; ''Flip Normals'' flips them.

:'''''Question:''' The finished penguin looks fine in Object Mode, but when I render it, it looks odd. Quite patchy.
:'''''Answer:''' Make sure you adjust the &quot;Render Levels&quot; parameter (directly under &quot;Levels&quot;) to be greater-or-equal than &quot;Levels&quot;.

==Protein Handling and Storage==
&lt;p&gt;Over time, changes will take place in protein structure that could potentially alter experimental results.  There are also many problems that can arise from improper handling of proteins. Contaminants in samples can cause results to be skewed, and may even damage equipment. However, there are many steps that can be taken in the protein handling and storage processes that help to 
minimize any damage and in turn, maximize accuracy of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Sterile Work Environment====
&lt;p&gt;Whenever handling protein samples, it is very important to wear gloves.  Often times gloves are used to protect us when handling harmful substances, but the gloves are also used to shelter the sample from any foreign proteins or chemicals found on our hands.  Contamination could not only lead to unexpected results but could potentially damage our sample.  For this same reason it is also very important to always use sterile containers, pipette tips, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Flash Freezing====
&lt;/p&gt;At some point it may be desirable to store a protein for use months down the road; most often, this is achieved by freezing.  By storing proteins at temperatures as low as -20 degrees celcius, the structural components of the molecule can be preserved until its use, assuring functionality. However, if the freezing process is not carried out correctly, the protein can actually be subjected to drastic changes in pH as well as in salt concentration.  To avoid these environmental changes over time, the sample can be &quot;flash frozen&quot; by dipping the tube containing protein sample in a mixture of dry ice, ethanol and acetone.  After being frozen, the sample can then be rapidly thawed in a beaker of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Protein Loss====
&lt;p&gt;While perforing any proteomics experiment care must be aware of potential for loss of proteins or peptides due to chemical properties of those proteins in a sample. For example, it is not uncommon for hydrophobic proteins to stick to the walls of test tubes or chromatography columns in solution. If a protein of interest is known to be hydrophobic, the glass ware to be used can be &lt;b&gt;silanized&lt;/b&gt; or salanized glassware can be purchased to prevent loss of the protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Working with Small Samples====
&lt;p&gt;Micro-biopsies, laser capture micro-dissection, and stem cell therapy only provide small, non-conventional sample sizes, and in order to take advantage of these small samples, a less wasteful sample preparation is needed.  Trifluoroethanol provides a viable alternative to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Hydrostatic Pressure Cycling Technology====

[[Image:Pct-lipids-fullsize.png | thumb | right | 450px | PCT dissociates lipids, protein remains intact; protein is released from lipid tissue. ]]
&lt;p&gt;Pressure cycling technology (PCT) alternates pressure in a reaction vessel.  For example, a sample is placed in an air-tight vessel and next the pressure in the vessel is alternated between very high pressure and room pressure.  When pressure drops from very high down to room levels, compressible molecules (such as lipids) tend to dissociate.  One example of useful dissociation is that of bilayer lipid membranes, which results in the release of proteins and other metabolites from the bilipid layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCT-assisted liquid-liquid extraction {{ref|Gross}} leverages PCT to fraction a sample into different classes, using class-specific immiscible solvents within the same reaction vessel.  The initial solvents are combined with the raw sample, then the pressure is raised.  As the pressure peaks, the solvents mix, forming a temporary solvent, and the sample dissolves in this new temporary solvent.  The pressure is lowered, and the temporary solvent separates back into the initial solvents, fractioning the dissolved sample in the process (the different classes of sample molecules being more soluble in a particular initial solvent) .  At room pressure, each class of sample molecules are found isolated within each of the initial, immiscible solvents.&lt;/p&gt;

'''Summary'''

Micro-biopsies, laser capture micro-dissection, and stem cell therapy only provide small, non-conventional sample sizes, and in order to take advantage of these small samples, a less wasteful sample preparation is needed.

Typical protocols for proteomic sample processing usually involve a strong denaturant such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride combined with different types of detergents.  These methods are rapid, however, the detergents or salts need to be entirely removed from the sample before the LC-MS analysis.  If they are not properly removed, the level of detection sensitivity may not be enough for the peptides.  These procedures show their weaknesses when working with sample sizes less than a microgram, because some of the sample is inevitably left behind when removing the detergents.

To get around the issues involved with using detergents, a different sample preparation technique using only a single tube was used.  The technique used trifluoroethanol (TFE), in a hypotonic aqueous buffer as a replacement for the detergents.  TFE is better because it improves protein solubility and denaturation, and it readily evaporates, so there’s no need to remove the TFE when no longer needed.  So using TFE in the place of detergents removes the cleanup step, eliminating the waste involved with removing the detergent.

An experiment was conducted to test this hypothesis using two different mouse brain tissue samples.  One was disrupted in a buffer of denaturants and CHAPS, and the other one in a hypotonic buffer containing 50% TFE.  The chromatogram figures of the two samples indicated that the presence of detergent in the first sample has suppressed the signals of peptides that are co-eluted with the detergent.  A larger number of proteins were identified using the TFE protocol rather than CHAPS protocol.  Also, TFE proved to be more efficient than the traditional detergent based protocol even with processed MCF cells, with a larger number of proteins identified than when using traditional methods.

The TFE based protocol proved to be more efficient in micro and nano scale sample processing than traditional methods. The main advantage in using the TFE based protocol is that extra cleanup steps are eliminated and the whole process is carried out in a single tube, hence there is no manhandling and no loss of sample. Other advantages of TFE are that it improves protein solubilization, increases protein denaturation, and finally it can be removed by tryptic digestion without performing any extra clean up step.  The TFE based protocol also provides better sample recovery and better reproducibility.

'''Course Relevance'''

Sample preparation efficiency can be a large problem when trying to detect different proteins in a proteome, because if a proteome only has a tiny amount of a certain protein to begin with, 
then any loss of the sample during preparation may mean the loss of some or all of that protein.  Therefore, learning a variety of different sample preparation methods, preferably the most efficient methods, is useful to students hoping to work with and prepare proteomic samples.

===Tissue Fractionation by Hydrostatic Pressure Cycling Technology: The Unified Sample Preparation Technique for Systems Biology Studies===

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=19137106 Gross V, Carlson G, Kwan AT, Smejkal G, Freeman E, Ivanov AR, Lazarev A. ''Journal of Biomolecular Techniques'' '''19:'''189-199 (2008)]

'''Main Focus'''

The authors present a novel, detergent-free, concurrent sampling process for high yield extraction of multiple classes of biological molecules from the same sample, using pressure cycling technology (PCT) as the basis of the new process.  A significant advantage of the new process is that the samples may either be used directly in another (compatible) process for further analysis (such as MS), or require very minimal cleanup before additional analysis.  Relevance to systems biology studies is emphasized.{{ref|Gross}}

[[Image:Pct-lipids-fullsize.png | thumb | right | 600px | PCT dissociates lipids, protein remains intact; protein is released from lipid tissue. ]]

'''Summary'''

Given the widening popularity of systems biology studies, it's become increasingly important to improve the consistency and quality of the samples under analysis.  Many current high quality sampling techniques are geared toward a single type of analysis (DNA/RNA, or protein, or lipids).  Concurrent sampling techniques are important, in particular with regard to systems biology studies, because of the way that information from several classes of molecules must be correlated during analysis.  Concurrent techniques are also critical where small sample size is a constraining factor (for example, human biopsy tissue).  

The authors have developed a new concurrent sampling protocol that cleanly separates DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids using detergent-free processes.  The new protocol leverages pressure cycling technology (PCT), as well as a proprietary set of partitioning reagents that separate molecules by class.  PCT destabilizes molecular interactions by quickly alternating pressure, from very high to low.  High pressure mostly affects compressible molecules (lipids), which subsequently dissociate when the pressure is lowered.  PCT does not impact covalent bonds, so DNA, RNA, and proteins remain intact while lipid bilayers are dismantled.

PCT-assisted liquid-liquid extraction is another PCT-based technique that's used to partition a sample given a set of partitioning solvents.  For example, two solvents are combined with the sample, the solvents being immiscible.  Pressure is then increased, and the solvents begin to merge.  When the pressure is high enough, the solvents mix and form a temporary tertiary solvent in which the sample dissolves.  The pressure is then lowered, and the tertiary solvent separates back into the initial two solvents, particles of the original sample being partitioned into either of the two solvents.  When the pressure is back to “normal”, the original sample has been cleanly partitioned into the separate solvent phases.  In previous works, the authors have evolved the above PCT-based techniques, with some commercial success.   The newly developed ProteoSolve-SB protocol builds upon this previous work such that the new protocol cleanly separates DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids from a single sample.

ProteoSolve-SB is compared to current protocols, including Thizol, AllPrep, and PARIS.  Thizol shows good DNA recovery, but suffers from slow extraction and cleanup from the organic phase, as well as from possible protein modification.  Thizol works well with relatively low sample concentrations (less than 10% of volume), whereas ProteoSolve-SB is compatible with sample concentrations up to 25% to 30% of the overall volume.  Sample concentration is an important factor since subsequent precipitation procedures are more efficient with higher concentrations of the sample.

AllPrep had RNA recovery volume similar to Thizol and ProteoSolve-SB, however it's a more expensive process and required multiple columns for the test procedure.  AllPrep also suffers from the side-effect of potential protein loss: many proteins may not unbind from RNA, so they may not be recoverable.  Also, the proteins that are recovered must be cleaned before SDS-PAGE; the cleaning process may incur additional protein loss.

PARIS recovered less than half the RNA as compared to the other tested protocols, which was expected since only half the sample was used for the RNA analysis: the other half was used for protein analysis.  In addition to low yields of RNA, the recovered proteins required additional cleanup (dialysis, filtration).

ProteoSolve-SB has been shown to yield high recovery of DNA, RNA as well as a significant recovery of protein and an simplified recovery of lipids (fewer steps than other methods, less hands-on time).  Sample homogenization via PCT yields more consistent samples, as opposed to sonication or grinding in liquid nitrogen.  Once centrifuged, minimal cleanup is required for analysis: the proteins are ready to go after drying; lipids are ready to go for MALDI-TOF MS, and; DNA, RNA may be extracted from the solid phase using common, compatible extraction protocols.  Future work will focus on scaling down the process further for applications such as needle biopsies, as well as for cell cultures derived from individual stem cells.

'''Course Relevance'''

This new process provides a low-loss rate for proteins in the original sample, as well as avoids detergents and other solvents that may change the protein before it can be analyzed further downstream.  It's relevant to proteomics because it provides another method of extracting proteins from cell tissue in a manner that reduces the loss and/or the contamination of the proteins from the original sample.  It's also a relevant process for samples that are unique or hard to obtain.

''Cleanup of protein detergents:''
A gas chromatographic method for quantification of detergents frequently used in membrane protein structural studies 

Gas Chromatography http://www.separationsnow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?chId=3&amp;id=20260&amp;type=Feature&amp;page=1/ (2009-01-26)

'''Main Focus'''
The traditional method of protein extraction involves use of detergents. Though they affect the stability of the proteins, they were used in the extraction for quite a long time until the advantages of organic solvents are known.

'''Summary'''

Structure of proteins are studied outside the functional environment in conditions different to normal conditions. The most conventional method is the use of detergents in the extraction, purification, concentration and crystallization of proteins. But the concentration of detergents have a strong impact on the stability of the proteins. The procedure of measuring the amount of detergent associated with the protein was illustrated by using four detergents decyl maltoside, dodecyl maltoside, dodecyl phosphocholine and lauryldimethylamine N-oxide. Separation of the detergents was carried out at a temperature gradient of 200-280C and low injection volumes of 1 microlitre. The retention times for all these four detergents were suitable for the separation and identification of detergent mixtures. Separations were carried out under the experimental conditions and the resultant calibration curves matched with the quadratic regression curves. Thus this is one of the most easy methods for the separation of detergent mixtures from the proteins.

'''Main Focus'''

PCT will improve the rate of discovery for proteomics-based research by providing practitioners with a technology that safely and efficiently fractions biological samples into specific biological classes (proteins, lipids) that may, in some cases (especially for proteins), be fed directly into common downstream analysis processes.

'''Summary'''

Major diseases in the US continue to be targets of biological research: namely obesity, heart disease and diabetes.{{ref|Pressure}}  The relationships between such diseases are complex as are the analyses of the biological mechanisms.  Improved processes and technology are needed to battle these diseases, and of particular importance is more efficient drug discovery and drug development cycles.  Such improvements will increasingly support complex research efforts, including the use biomarkers and proteomics to drive discovery forward.

There are some important technological challenges to address in the proteomics space, including the need for processes which are increasingly sensitive to lower protein concentrations as well as in tissue proteomics, where proteins of interest are found primarily in lipids.  Sample preparation techniques play a large role in the outcome of proteomics experiments, and many current preparation techniques have problems such as safety, contamination, long processing times and are not easily automated.  Compounding the problem is that some techniques are only useful for specific sample types.  As a consequence, experimental results are not easily, reliably reproduced.

Proteins found in high lipid concentration tissue are critical to our understanding of important diseases.  The use of detergents presents a challenge because not all the protein in a sample may be exposed, especially if the lipid concentration exceeds sixty percent and the sample is prepared in an aqueous solution.  Furthermore, detergents are not always compatible with subsequence analysis procedures.  There have also been cases where proteins of interest have been discarded with pellets as cell debris.  These types of challenges can have negative impacts on the pace of research.

[[Image:Pct-liquid-liquid.png | thumb | right | 400px | PCT-based liquid-liquid extraction breaks apart cells, separates molecules into solvent fractions; no detergents necessary. ]]

Pressure cycling technology (PCT) addresses the aforementioned concerns.  In a single step, using all organic (not detergent-based) solvents, lipids and proteins are dissociated and partitioned in a manner that is very safe for the researcher.  PCT-based liquid-liquid extraction is leveraged to capture dissociated molecules in different solvent fractions.  Samples are added to a combination of immiscible solvents.  Next, PCT makes use of high pressure in the reaction vessel to break apart and mix samples with liquid solvents.  Upon the release of the high pressure, sample molecules are fractioned in the initial liquid solvents.  The reaction vessel in PCT (special reaction tubes) are designed to withstand high pressure, isolate the sample and solvents from contaminants as well as to provide safety to the researcher.  PCT is especially good at releasing proteins from their captivity in lipid tissues.

In a study between Pressure BioSciences and Harvard School of Public Health, the results of proteomic analysis of adipose tissue were deemed useful for the mechanistic studies of diabetes and obesity.  In the results of the study, PCT is reported to have higher protein yields compared to more “traditional” techniques.  PCT results were high yield and efficient to come by.  PCT was also compatible with the downstream protein identification method (HPLC-ES/MS).  PCT processes are also highly reproducible.

Other applications may include those dealing with neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, hyperactivity, depression and/or schizophrenia.  Neurological disorders make an interesting research target because myelin, which coats a major portion of neuron cells, has a protein/lipid ratio of about three to seven.  Phospholipids, which tend to be membrane proteins, are important for neuron regulation – as such, phospholipids also make an interesting research target.

;Immiscible: Incapable of being mixed without separation phases. Water and petroleum oil are immiscible under most conditions, although they can be made miscible with the addition of an emulsifier.{{ref|Immiscible}}

'''Course Relevance'''

PCT is relevant to proteomics because it is the basis of an efficient, safe, automated, reproducible sample preparation technique, of particular importance with respect to protein extraction from lipid tissues.

==Contaminant Elimination==
&lt;p&gt;In almost any biological experiment, eliminating contamination is of utmost importance.  This is especially true when dealing with proteins, as human  
subjects can contaminate the sample with their own proteins, leading to unexpected results.  Dialysis, Desalting, Protein Precipitation and Ultrafiltration are all methods that may be used to prevent unwanted molecules, assuring accurate and reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Dialysis====
&lt;p&gt;Dialysis is a common protocol for isolating proteins in a sample based on size exclusion. Semi-permeable membranes are manufactured with varying pore sizes such that a dialysis bag can be selected specific to a particular experiment’s needs. The protein sample, in solution, is sealed in the bag which is then placed in a large volume of buffer, normally 200 – 500 times the volume of the sample [3]. Due to the gradient between the sample and the buffer, the molecules in the sample attempt to flow from the dialysis bag where only those smaller than the pore size actually leave the sample [2]. The power of dialysis lies in its ability to cleanse a sample of a number of contaminants at once, including small proteins, and small contaminating molecules such as salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful separation based on dialysis is the selection of an optimal pore size. Membrane pore sizes are typically measured in Daltons such that pores measuring 1,000 Daltons will retain molecules a molecular mass of 1,000 Daltons. More information on preparing a dialysis tube based separation can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Image:dialysis_bag.png|dialysis bag concept]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Desalting====
&lt;p&gt;Another method for removing foreign molecules from protein samples, desalting provides us with the ability to remove detergents, DNA or RNA, lipids and salts.  Oftentimes, this method is known as gel filtration, or molecular exclusion.  The premise behind desalting is that the molecules in the sample are passed through a porous resin.  The smaller molecules pass into the pores and get stuck, whereas the larger molecues do not fit and simply flow around and out of the resin.  In doing so, the larger molecules are separated away from the other molecules in the solution, which remain stuck in the pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Protein Precipitation====
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the other methods already discussed, precipitation involves removing unwanted substances from our protein sample prior to analysis.  In this case, it is the protein that is precipitated, allowing for the remaining solution to be poured off.  Most often, precipitation is achieved using salts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At low salt concentrations, proteins are generally observed to be more soluble than at high concentrations.  Using this information, a technique known as salting out is often used which involves increasing the salt concentration until the proteins precipitate out.  Although this is the most common form of protein precipitation, similar results can be obtained by changing the pH of the solution or through the introduction of metal ions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Ultrafiltration====
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafiltration is a process similar to gel filtration or molecular exclusion, but also relies on pressure in separating the molecules.  Due to the pressurized samples, a much smaller pore size may be used (around 250 nanometers)[4].  The smaller molecules are then forced through the pores while the larger proteins are retained.&lt;/p&gt;

*Solubilization and Solution Preparation
For High Performance LC (HPLC), it is very imporant that the sample solution (mobile phase) be free of particulate matter.  Due to the sensitive nature of a HPLC column and the extreme pressures involved, such contaminants can be extremely damaging and [[w:Proteomics|Protein_Sample_Preparation|Contaminant_Elimination#Contaminant_Elimination]] is very important.  


*Recombinant techniques for affinity chromatography

Affinity chromatography is a protein seperation technique where substrates with affinities for specific proteins are used in the solid phase of a chromatogaphy column.  One highly specific technique is to use recombinant technology to isolate proteins expressed from recombinant DNA. If a gene is inserted into a cloning vector for the purpose of fermenting large amounts of a protein, the gene can be altered to include additional amino acids in the protein.  This subsequence can then be utilized as a binding site for the stationary phase substrate.  Two examples of this are the additions of histidine residues that bind covalently to certain metal ions and the addition of glutathione-S-transferase protein that will bind with glutathione.

==Sample Preparation for Electrophoresis==
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE), described in detail in [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|Chapter 4.2]], is a process by which molecules, typically proteins, are separated by their mass. By assuming the speed at which a protein travels through a gel matrix is directly related to its mass, that is, the total matter in the protein, it is crucial to ensure the shape of the protein is not affecting its speed. As such, a number of sample preparation techniques have been refined to confer similar shapes on all proteins in a sample. Furthermore, protocols have been refined to maximize the consistency of mass related characteristics. This section aims to confer the purpose and procedures of a number of these techniques involved in preparing a sample for gel electrophoresis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====SDS Treatment:====
&lt;p&gt;Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent used to denature proteins prior to gel electrophoresis. As stated above, it is necessary to denature all proteins in a sample in order to separate them solely on their mass in a gel matrix. SDS efficiently breaks down secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets (both primarily comprised of hydrogen bonds) as well as many tertiary structures. However, SDS does not break down any of the disulfide bonds that participate in many tertiary structures; treatment with DTT, described below, is often necessary to break down disulfide bonds.&lt;br&gt;
SDS is found to be particularly useful in 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). As mentioned in [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|Chapter 4.2]], 2DE involves an initial stage of Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) which results in all proteins finding their pI on the IEF strip resulting in all proteins having a net charge of zero. Due to the nature of PAGE, a negative charge is necessary to induce movement of the proteins through the gel matrix. Fortuitously, treatment of a protein sample with SDS not only denatures all proteins in the sample, it also binds all proteins and confers its negative charge to the bound proteins. It is seen that SDS binds a protein in a manner proportional to the mass of that protein which results in a negative charge directly related to the protein’s mass; further supporting a separation based on mass alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Image:SDS-2D-skeletal.png|500px|Chemical structure of SDS]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
====DTT Treatment:====
Dithiothreitol (DTT) is a reducing agent typically used to break down the disulfide bonds contributing to tertiary structure which SDS was unable to affect, further denaturing the protein to deemphasize the role of protein shape in PAGE. DTT reduces a disulfide bond by two sequential thiol-disulfide exchange reactions resulting in DTT becoming a six-member ring structure. 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), another disulfide reducing agent, is commonly used in lieu of DTT. Furthermore, it should be noted that while both DTT and ME sufficiently reduce disulfide bridges in proteins, there is a propensity for them to reform. Thus the protein sample is commonly treated with 2-Iodoacetamide, an alkylating sulfhydryl reagent, which binds covalently to free sulfides and prevents disulfide bridges from reforming.
&lt;/p&gt;

====Protein Extraction from Yeasts====

To extract proteins from yeast, the collected yeast cells are resuspended in a buffer containing NaOH, 2-mercaptoethanol, and SDS and immediately heated to 90oC. Then the sample is neutralized using a Tris-HCl buffer.  Glycerol and bromophenol blue is then added so that the final sample is contained in a standard SDS-PAGE buffer. The combination of both the heat and the buffer in effect destroys all cell walls and at the same time makes soluble the proteins needed to be extracted.

Varying the concentration of SDS, boiling time, and the addition of solubilizing reagents can change and optimize the extraction of yeast proteins. The addition of deoxycholate or urea to the above protocol was found to optimize the extraction of certain proteins but decreased the optimization of others.  The above parameters are optimal for the extraction of most of the proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae, but not for all proteins.  To this date, there is no one universal buffer or protocol that can yield all expressed protein from the yeast cell.

===Optimized Protein Extraction for Quantitative Proteomics of Yeasts===
[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001078 von der Haar T ''PLoS One'' '''2(10):'''1-8 (2007)]

'''Main Focus'''

The main focus of this article is to find the optimal extraction technique for yeast proteins.  The von der Haar group has found an optimal technique for most of the yeast proteins but not all expressed proteins.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:Yeast Protein Preparation.PNG|right|thumb|450px|Diagram of the steps necessary to prepare yeast proteins for SDS-PAGE]]

The abundance data that come out of published papers for any protein can vary from group to group.  This is due to the varying efficiencies of the extraction procedures that they use. The von der Haar group has found a protein extraction procedure that can extract most of the proteins in the yeast ''S. cerevisiae''.  The original protocol that they found to be the best calls for the use of 0.1N NaOH as the resuspension buffer, incubate for several minutes, then boiled in standard SDS-PAGE sample buffer.  The problem with this procedure is that when yeast is suspended and incubated in 0.1N NaOH not all the cell walls are destroyed.  Many yeasts cells are still intact.  This can lead to the yeast cells to express proteins not normally expressed solely under the environment of study but due to the NaOH environment.  The von der Haar group has devised a new protocol that fixes this problem.

The new protocol calls for the extracted yeast cells to be resuspended in a buffer containing NaOH, 2-mercaptoethanol, and SDS and immediately heated to 90oC.  Then the sample is neutralized using a Tris-HCl buffer and glycerol and bromophenol blue is then added so that the final sample is contained in a standard SDS-PAGE buffer. The combination of both the heat and the new buffer in effect destroys all cell walls and at the same time makes soluble the proteins needed to be extracted.

The von der Haar group has also found that varying the concentration of SDS, boiling time, and the addition of solubilizing reagents can change the optimization of protein extraction.  The optimal concentration of SDS that they have found was 2%.  The optimal time of boiling is 10 minutes at 90oC.  These parameters are optimal for the extraction of most of the proteins expressed in ''S. cerevisiae'', but not for all proteins.  The addition of 1% deoxycholate increased the efficiency of the extraction of Sup45p and Rpl25p, but decreased the efficiency of Sup35p.  The addition of 8M Urea increased the efficiency of extraction of Sup35p but decreased the efficiency of all the other proteins.

The von der Haal group did find the optimal protocol to extract most of the proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae, but not for all proteins.  The addition of other solubilizing agents can be optimal for certain proteins but can significantly decrease the solubilization of others.  It is clear that there can be no one universal buffer or protocol that can yield all expressed protein for the yeast cell.

For more descriptive steps, refer to Figure 1 of the article.

'''Main Focus'''

The main focus of the website is to provide protocols and other information about the Gottschling Lab, a laboratory focused on cancer research.

'''Summary'''


The Gottschling laboratory is interested in studying yeast, specifically ''S. cerevisiae'', because of its link to cancer.  When yeast cells enter the middle to late stage of their lifespan, they experience genomic instability.  This genomic instability can also be seen in humans due to increased age and cancer.  The Gottschling group believe that there is a link between the transition experienced by yeast and the increased age and occurrence of cancer in humans.

The website provides many different protocols along with a protocol for extracting yeast proteins.  They list three different ways to prepare yeast proteins for direct gel electrophoresis.  The first uses a SUMEB buffer along with a protease inhibitor in order to extract yeast protein.  The website provides the ingredients needed to make the SUMEB buffer.  The second protocol uses only sample buffer and the website also provides the recipe for the sample buffer.  The third protocol that they have listed is the use of glass beads along with sample buffer.

More sure about German than English here.
''Mir ist übel'' or ''mir ist schlecht'' means I am going to throw up (nausea).
''Ich bin krank'' means I am suffering from an illness (generally, with or without nausea).
The English translations seem reversed to me (i.e. sick sounds more nauseous than ill to me).

==Sample Preparation for Chromatography==

[[Image:hplc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A HPLC. From left to right: A pumping device generating a gradient of two different solvents, a steel enforced column and an apparatus for measuring the absorbance.]]

====Solubilization and Solution Preparation====
&lt;p&gt;For High Performance Liquid [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography|Chromatography]] (HPLC), it is very important that the sample solution (mobile phase) be free of particulate matter.  Due to the sensitive nature of a HPLC column and the extreme pressures involved, such contaminants can be extremely damaging and [[Proteomics/Protein Sample Preparation/Contaminant Elimination|contaminant elimination]] is very important.  Each specific liquid chromatography technique requires specialized solutions.  Reversed phase chromatography requires polar organic solvents, while normal phase chromatography can use inorganic solvents such as water.  One of the most common organic solvents is acetonitrile.  This polarity gives the solvent the ability to elute proteins out of a reversed phase column, and it is also easily coupled to mass spectrometry.  Also, solution buffers must contain high quality pH stabilizers such as acetic acid (acid) and sodium acetate (base).  Salt buffers such as Potassium Chloride are used to produce elution conditions in ion-exchange chromatography, and also must be of very high purity.  A list is given below of common chromatography reagents:&lt;/p&gt;
*Buffer reagents
**Acetic Acid
**Phosphoric Acid
**Triethylamine
**Sodium Acetate
**Ammonium Acetate
**Potassium Phosphate
**Sodium Bicarbonate
**Sodium Chloride
&lt;br&gt;

RIPA is radio immunoprecipitation Assay the buffer can be used to solubilize proteins in a cell. Analysis shows that RIPA dissolves some membrane bound protiens and most intracellular proteins. RIPA is not to be used to find protein- protein interactions because this buffer breaks the bonds of the protein-protein formations.

====Recombinant Techniques for Affinity Chromatography====
&lt;p&gt;Affinity [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography|chromatography]] is a protein seperation technique where substrates with affinities for specific proteins are used in the solid phase of a chromatogaphy column.  One highly specific technique is to use recombinant technology to isolate proteins expressed from recombinant DNA. If a gene is inserted into a cloning vector for the purpose of fermenting large amounts of a protein, the gene can be altered to include additional amino acids in the protein.  This subsequence can then be utilized as a binding site for the stationary phase substrate.  Two examples of this are the additions of histidine residues that bind covalently to certain metal ions and the addition of glutathione S-transferase[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1R5A|Glutathione-S-transferase] protein that will bind with glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;

===Sample prep for proteomics of breast cancer: proteomics and gene ontology reveal dramatic differences in protein solubilization preferences of radioimmunoprecipitation assay and urea lysis buffers===

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2600628&amp;tool=pmcentrez Ngoka, Lambert CM; ''Proteome Science'' '''6''': 30. pg 1-21; Published online 2008]


The focus of this paper is to prepare a protien sample from cancer cells using the widely etstablished RIPA method. RIPA buffer does this by taking protiens from there native insoluable state and solubilizing them into a seperable sample.It also seperates the protiens from salts and other contaminents making it a reliable sample prep tool. A problem with using just one sample buffer is that the buffer may not have solubilized all the proteins from the sample cell. This experiment, in addition to RIPA, also uses urea to extract proteins missed by RIPA. Tumor cells with varying origin characteristics were subjected to RIPA analysis and urea analysis. It was concluded that using the different methods each cell yielded some of the same proteins and many unique proteins. With the RIPA analysis many intracellular proteins and proteins with small molecular weights were readily soluble. Some Other Proteins would bind weakly to the buffer following for solubility. The results for the urea analysis proved somewhat opposite, this test would solublize extracellular matrix proteins and proteins with high molecular weights. This is not to say that neither protein yielded the same results, from the paper it can be witnessed there is a big overlap of the same proteins found with different analysis. When making a protein sample or finding novel proteins experimenters should use multiple isolation techniques to obtain the greatest population of proteins available. 

'''New Terms'''

plasmogen activators- molecule used to disasociate blood clots.

angiogensis -  blood vessel genesis and progression. (dictionary.com)

In the extraction process of proteomics it is useful to use more than one extraction buffer to obtain different libraries of proteins.

==Websites Summarized==

===Immunoprecipitation===

http://www.molecularstation.com/protein/immunoprecipitation (3/26/09)

This website describes Immunoprecipitation along with some applications and methods it employs.

'''Summary'''

Immunoprecipitation has several steps, the first is to lysis the cell and obtain a protein mixture. It is then a good idea to clean the cell of all non-specific proteins. Following this cleaning you want to add the anti-bodies to precipitate the targets. Then you can isolate your sample for further analysis. Some lysis buffers are RIPA and NP-40, RIPA disrupts protein-protein interactions and NP-40 is used to identify protein-protein interactions. Success of this technique depends on the affinty binding of the protein-antibody formation.

Immunoprecipitation is a method of protein extraction, usually radio-labeled this technique can obtain the molecular weights and quantity of protein samples. Samples are extracted using anti-body- protein complexes. Immunoprecipitation can also be used to determine protein- protein interactions, rate of synthesis of a protein, and can concentrate small levels of proteins. 

'''New Terms'''

pre-clearing -  A step in imuunoprecipitation that lowers non-specific proteins. (http://www.molecularstation.com/protein/immunoprecipitation)

mono-clonal antibodies - antibodies cloned to produce high volume populations of themselves. (dictionary.com)

Immunoprecipitation is widely used in sample preparation of proteins, it yields samples with acceptable concentrations and accurately targets specific proteins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The carboxyl group (abbreviated -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H or -COOH) is one of the most widely occurring functional groups in chemistry as well as biochemistry. The carboxyl group of a large family of related compounds called Acyl compounds or '''Carboxylic Acid Derivatives'''.

All the reactions and compounds covered in this section will yield Carboxylic Acids on hydrolysis, and thus are known as Carboxylic Acid Derivatives. Hydrolysis is one example of ''Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution'', which is a very important two step mechanism that is common in all reactions that will be covered here.


==Structure==
This group of compounds also contains a carbonyl group, but now there is an electronegative atom (oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen) attached to the carbonyl carbon. This difference in structure leads to a major change in reactivity.

==Nomenclature==
The systematic IUPAC nomenclature for carboxylic acid derivatives is different for the various compounds which are in this vast category, but each is based upon the name of the carboxylic acid closest to the derivative in structure. Each type is discussed individually below.


===Acyl Groups===
Acyl groups are named by stripping the ''-ic acid'' of the corresponding carboxylic acid and replacing it with ''-yl''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO-R = ''acetyl-R''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Acyl Halides===
Simply add the name of the attached halide to the end of the acyl group. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COBr = ''acetyl bromide''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Carboxylic Acid Anhydrides===
A carboxylic acid anhydride ([RC=O]O[O=CR]) is a carboxylic acid (COOH) that has an acyl group (RC=O) attached to its oxygen instead of a hydrogen.
If both acyl groups are the same, then it is simply the name of the carboxylic acid with the word ''acid'' replaced with ''anhydride''. 
If the acyl groups are different, then they are named in alphabetical order in the same way, with ''anhydride'' replacing ''acid''. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO-O-OCCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Ethanoic Anhydride''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Esters===
Esters are created when the hydrogen on a carboxylic acid is replaced by an alkyl group.  Esters are known for their pleseant, fruity smell and taste, and they are often found in both natural and artificial flavors.  Esters (RCOOR&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are named as ''alkyl alkanoates''. The alkyl group directly attached to the oxygen is named first, followed by the acyl group, with ''-ate'' replacing ''-yl'' of the acyl group.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''acetyl butanoate''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
cooh
1
cooh
1 2-ethan oic acid
&lt;\blochquote&gt;

===Amides===
Amides which have an amino group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) attached to a carbonyl group (RC=O) are named by replacing the ''-oic acid'' or ''-ic acid'' of the corresponding carboxylic acid with ''-amide''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''acetamide''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nitriles===
Nitriles (RCN) can be viewed a nitrogen analogue of a carbonyl and are known for their strong electron withdrawing nature and toxicity.  Nitriles are named by adding the suffix ''-nitrile'' to the longest hydrocarbon chain (including the carbon of the cyano group). 
It can also be named by replacing the ''-ic acid'' or ''-oic acid'' of their corresponding carboxylic acids with ''-onitrile''.
Functional class IUPAC nomenclature may also be used in the form of ''alkyl cyanides''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN = ''butonitrile'' or ''butyl cyanide''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structure and Reactivity==
Stability and reactivity have an inverse relationship, which means that the more stable a compound, generally the less reactive - and vice versa.  Since acyl halides are the least stable group listed above, it makes sense that they can be chemically changed to the other types.  Since the amides are the most stable type listed above, it should logically follow that they cannot be easily changed into the other molecule types, and this is indeed the case.

The stability of any type of carboxylic acid derivative is generally determined by the ability of its functional group to donate electrons to the rest of the molecule.  In essence, the ''more electronegative'' the atom or group attached to carbonyl group, the ''less stable'' the molecule.  This readily explains the fact that the acyl halides are the most reactive, because halides are generally quite electronegative.  It also explains why acid anhydrides are unstable; with two carbonyl groups so close together the oxygen in between them cannot stabilize both by resonance - it can't ''loan'' electrons to both carbonyls.

The following derivative types are ordered in decreasing reactivity (the first is the most reactive):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Acyl Halides '''(CO-X)''' &gt; Acyl Anhydrides '''(-CO-O-OCR)''' &gt; Acyl Thioester '''(-CO-SR)''' &gt; Acyl Esters '''(-CO-OR)''' &gt; Acyl Amides '''(-CO-NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As mentioned before, any substance in the preceding list can be readily transformed into a substance to its right; that is, the more reactive derivative types (acyl halides) can be directly transformed into less reactive derivative types (esters and amides).  Every type can be made directly from carboxylic acid (hence the name of this subsection) but carboxylic acid can also be made from any of these types.

M = MgBr (Grignard reagent) or Li (organolithium reagent)

===Mechanisms===
A common motif in reactions dealing with carboxylic acid derivatives is the tetrahedral intermediate. The carbonyl group is highly polar, with the carbon having a low electron density, and the oxygen having a high electron density. With an acid catalyst, a H+ is added to the oxygen of the carbonyl group, increasing the positive charge at the carbon atom. A nucleophile can then attack the carbonyl, creating a tetrahedral intermediate. 

For example, in Fischer esterification, the mechanism can be outlined thus:
1) H+ is added to carbonyl oxygen
2) Oxygen atom of the alcohol adds to the carbonyl carbon
3) Proton transfer from alcohol oxygen to carboxyl oxygen
4) Water molecule ejected from tetrahedral intermediate, double bond forms, recreating the carbonyl
5) H+ is removed from carbonyl oxygen

# Set aside to allow the flavours to merge, at least 20 minutes but preferably for a couple of hours.

==Notes, tips and variations==
{{Wikipedia|Coleslaw}}
* Savoy cabbage can be used instead of white cabbage
* other vegetables can be added to the coleslaw for greater variety, including:
** sliced [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]] - red, yellow and orange
** [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
** chopped [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nuts]] - e.g. [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]], [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]]
* Some people prefer to sweeten the dressing by adding up to 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] to the mayonnaise and vinegar
* Spices can be added to the dressing to &quot;liven it up&quot; - e.g. ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Celery|celery seeds]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Topic 2: Cells===

====2.1 Cell Theory====
----

'''2.1.1 Outline the Cell Theory'''
:* Living organisms are composed of one or more cells
:* Cells are the smallest unit of life
:* All cells come from pre-existing cells

'''2.1.2 Discuss the evidence for the cell theory'''

The cell theory has amassed tremendous credibility through the use of the microscope in the following:
:* Robert Hooke- studied cork and found little tiny compartments that he called cells
:* Antonie van Leeuwenhoek- observed the first living cells, called them 'animalcules' meaning little animals
:* Schleiden- stated that plants are made of 'independent, separate beings' called cells
:* Schwann- made a similar statement to Schleiden about animals
 
'''2.1.3 State that unicellular organisms carry out all of the functions of life'''
:* Metabolism; chemical reactions inside the cell, including cell respiration to release energy
:* Response; perceiving and responding to changes in the environment
:* Homeostasis; keeping conditions inside the organism within tolerable limits
:* Growth; an irreversible increase in size
:* Reproduction; producing offspring either sexually or asexually
:* Nutrition; obtaining food, to provide energy and the materials needed for growth
:* Defense; protection against enemies 

Amoeba would be an example of an unicellular organism.

'''2.1.4 Compare the relative sizes of molecules, cell membrane thickness, viruses, bacteria, organelles and cells, using the appropriate SI unit '''

nm = nanometer
µm = micrometer

:* Molecules - 1 nm
:* Thickness of membrane - 10 nm
:* Viruses - 100 nm
:* Bacteria - 1 µm 
:* Organelles - up to 10 µm
:* Most cells - up to 100 µm (three dimensional nature/shape)

'''2.1.5 Calculate the linear magnification of drawings and the actual size of specimens in images of known magnifications '''
:* :Drawings should show cells and cell ultrastructure.
:Include:
::A ''scale bar'': |------| = 1 µm 
::''Magnification'': ×250

:To calculate ''magnification'':
::*''Magnification = Measured Size of Diagram &amp;divide; Actual Size of Object
but before this, both magnifications must be in the same measuremente, either in mm, cm etc..

'''2.1.6 - Explain the importance of the surface area to volume ratio as a factor limiting cell size.'''
:*A cell needs a large surface area in order to carry out metabolic functions (as chemical reactions require a surface). As a cell grows, it needs to carry out more and more reactions. Therefore, since a cell has to maintain a certain surface area to volume ratio, its size is limited. 
:*The rate of exchange of materials (nutrients/waste) and energy (heat) is a function of its surface area.
::'''Thus''': As a cell grows in size (volume), the distance increases between the cytoplasm at the center of the cell and the cell membrane. The rate of chemical exchange with the surrounding environment may hence become too low to maintain the cell. It is not able to excrete waste quickly enough or take in important minerals.
:Volume of a cell determines requirements while surface area determines supply.

''' 2.1.7 - State that multicelluar organisms show emergent properties'''
:* Emergent properties arise from the interaction of component parts: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

''' 2.1.8 - Explain how cells in multicellular organisms differentiate to carry out specialized functions by expressing some of their genes but not others.'''
:*During the early development stages of multicellular organisms, cells undergo ''[[w:Cellular_differentiation|differentiation]]'', becoming specialized in structure and function. These cells are then organized into tissues and organs. Cells of multicellular eukaryotes express only a small fraction of their genes, allowing them to perform highly specialized functions. Cells, such as those of muscle or nervous tissue, express only a tiny fraction of their genes.

''' 2.1.9 - State that stem cells retain the capacity to divide and have the ability to differentiate along different pathways.'''
:*Unspecialised cells that can become any type of cells.
:*Embryo cells are &quot;totipotent&quot;, meaning they can become any cells; after divisions, when the zygote became a ball of cells of blastocyst, which is &quot;pluripotent&quot;, meaning capable of being almost any type of tissue. Stem cells can also come from umbilical cord of new baby, which are &quot;multipotent&quot;, meaning they can be limited number of tissues.
:*Stem cells are self-sustaining: they can divide for many times.
:*They differentiate into specific tissue based on a chemical signal

''' 2.1.10 - Outline one use of therapeutic stem cells .'''
:*Bone marrow transplants. They only work because what you are actually transplanting is the hematopoetic stem cells in the marrow. And peripheral blood stem cells, as well as cord blood stem cells, can be used in lieu of bone marrow, making being a donor FAR easier today than in decades past.
http://www.marrow.org

&lt;big&gt;Random Stuff that Doesn't fit or is old syllabus material&lt;/big&gt;

'''State that a virus is a non-cellular structure consisting of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat.'''
:* '''[[w:Virus|Viruses]]''' are not cells. They are simple particles consisting of DNA and RNA wrapped in a protein coat. Viruses are not considered alive because they have no metabolism and they require a host to live.  Viruses do not carry out all the functions of life, therefore they are not living.


'''Explain three advantages of using light microscopes.'''
:'''Light microscopes'''
:*Display color instead of monochrome (black and white) images.
:*Provide a large field of view.
:*Facilitate preparation of sample material.
:*Allow for the examination of living material and the observation of movement.
:*Cheap in comparison to electron microscopes


'''Outline the advantages of using electron microscopes.'''
:'''Electron microscopes:'''
:*Provide images of higher ''resolution'' and ''magnification'' than light microscopes.
::*''[[w:Resolution|Resolution]]'' refers to the ability to distinguish two objects as separate entities.
::*''[[w:Magnification|Magnification]]'' refers to the ability to increase the size of a viewed object.
:''Scanning Electron Microscopes'' (SEM) provide images of the specimen's surface while ''Transmission Electron Microscopes'' (TEM) provide images of a sample's interior. The resolution of an SEM is approximately half that of a TEM.
:*May provide a three dimensional view.


'''Define ''organelle''.'''
:*An '''[[w:organelle|organelle]]''' is a discrete structure within a cell, and has a specific function. A [[w:Mitochondrion|mitochondrion]] would be an example of an organelle. 

Organelle List:

[[w:Mitochondrion|mitochondrion]]

[[w:Golgi Body|golgi body]]

[[w:Endoplasmic Reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]]

[[w:Vacuole|vacuole]]

[[w:Lysosome|lysosome]]

[[w:Ribosome|ribosome]] In contrast to the other organelles, they are not surrounded by a membrane. 

[[w:Centriole|centriole]] (Unique to animal cells)

[[w:Chloroplast|chloroplast]] (Unique to plant cells)


'''Define ''tissue'', ''organ'' and ''organ system''.'''
:*'''[[w:Tissue|Tissue]]''': An integrated group of cells that share structure and are adapted to perform a similar function. 
:*'''[[w:Organ|Organ]]''': A combination of two or more tissues which function as an integrated unit, performing one or more specific functions.
:*'''[[w:Organ system|Organ system]]''': A group of organs that specialize in a certain function together.

====2.2 Prokaryotic Cells====
----

'''2.2.1 Draw and label a diagram of the ultrastructure of Escherichia (E. coli) as an example of a prokaryote'''
:* The Diagram Should show cell wall, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, pili, flagella, ribosomes and nuceloid (region containing naked DNA)

Two Good Pictures
:*http://www.the-simple-homeschool.com/image-files/prokaryote_cell_.gif
:*http://www.ecoliblog.com/cell-ecoli.gif


'''2.2.2 Annotate the diagram from 2.2.1 with the functions of each of the named structures'''
:#'''[[w:Cell Wall|Cell Wall]]''': Maintains the cell's shape and gives protection.
:#'''[[w:Plasma Membrane|Plasma Membrane]]''': Regulates the flow of materials (nutrients, waste, oxygen, etc.) into and out of the cell.
:#'''[[w:Cytoplasm|Cytoplasm]]''': Holds and suspends the cell's specialized organelles and enzymes.
:#'''[[w:Pili|Pili]]''': The function of the pili is attachment to solid surfaces, apparatus for use in transfer of DNA from one cell to another, twitching motility, and cell-cell adhesion.
:#'''[[w:Flagella|Flagella]]''': Flagella are whip like tails that are used to propel the organism forward.
:#'''[[w:Ribosome|Ribosome]]''': Protein synthesis.
:#'''[[w:Nucleoid|Nucleoid]]''': Nucleoid is the area in the cytoplasm where the strands of DNA are present.

'''2.2.3 Identify structures from 2.2.1 in electron micrographs of E. coli'''

http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/bacteriatem.gif
http://www.exploratorium.edu/traits/images/ecoli_micro.jpg

'''2.2.4 State that prokaryotes divide by binary fission.'''
:*Prokaryotes divide by binary fission.
:*The process starts with DNA replication, then separation of the two circular strands to either side of the cell. Then cytokenesis occurs: division into two. 
:*Each new cell has about half of the cytoplasm. 
:*Growth restores the original size.



&lt;big&gt; Old Stuff not in syllabus or misplaced &lt;/big&gt;

'''State that prokaryotes show a wide range of metabolic activity including fermentation, photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation.'''
:*Prokaryotes demonstrate a range of metabolic activity
::* [[w:Cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria]] (often referred to as ''blue-green algae'' although they are not algae) obtain their energy through photosynthesis.
::*Bacteria can convert organic substances into other organic substances. (i.e., glucose to lactic acid during [[w:Anaerobic_respiration|anaerobic respiration]])
::*Some bacteria can [[w:Nitrogen_fixation|fix nitrogen]] from the air, converting it into ammonia (which is biologically available).

====''2.3 Eukaryotic Cells''====
----
'''2.3.1 Draw and label a diagram of the ultrastructure of a liver cell as an example of an animal cell'''
[[Image:Diagram_of_an_animal_cell_in_three_dimensions.png |thumb|Diagram of an animal cell]]
:* Should include free ribosomes, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), lysosome, Golgi apparatus, mitochondrion, and nucleus.

'''2.3.2 Annotate the diagram from 2.3.1 with the functions of each of the named structures.'''
:#[[w:Ribosomes|Ribosomes]]: Main site of protein synthesis.
:#[[w:Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum|Rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER)]]: Packages the proteins synthesized in the ribosomes.
:#[[w:Lysosome|Lysosome]]: Digests macromolecules and contain digestive enzymes.

:#[[w:Mitochondria|Mitochondrion]]: Serves as the site of cellular respiration. 
:#[[w:Nucleus|Nucleus]]: Contains a cell's genetic material

'''2.3.4 Compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.'''
:Differences should include
:* Contain naked DNA vs. DNA associated with proteins (DNA wrapped around histones, a protein molecule, creating units called nucleosomes)
:* DNA in cytoplasm vs. DNA enclosed in a nuclear envelope - Prokaryotes have naked DNA in cytoplasm, Eukaryotes have a nuclear membrane surrounding it in a nucelus.
:* No membrane-enclosed organelles vs. membrane-enclosed organelles (e.g., mitochondria, chloroplasts) - Prokaryotes have no mitchondria, thousands of reactions occur in cytoplasm.
:* 70S vs. 80S ribosomes - Prokaryotes = 70S, Eukaryotes = 80S.

:*both have ribosomes
:*prokaryotic has small ribosomes, Eukaryotic has larger ones
:*both have cell membrane
:*Eukaryotic has centriole, prokaryotic has no centriole

::*[[w:Cell walls|Cell walls]]
::*[[w:Chloroplasts|Chloroplasts]]
::*[[w:Vacuole|Vacuole]] - more specificially central vacuole
::*[[w:Plasmodesmata|Plasmodesmata]]

'''2.3.6 Outline two roles of Extracellular components'''
:* The plant wall maintains shape, prevents excess water uptake, and holds the whole plant up against the force of gravity.
:* Animal cells secrete glycoproteins that form the extracellular matrix (ECM). This functions in support, adhesion and movement.


&lt;big&gt; Stuff not in syllabus or not relevant or misplaced &lt;/big&gt;

::*Starch granules for storage of carbohydrates
::*[[w:Centrioles|Centrioles]]
::*[[w:Cholesterol|Cholesterol]] in the plasma membrane
::*[[w:Glycogen|Glycogen]] for storage of carbohydrate

State the composition and function of the plant cell wall
:The main component of plant cell walls is cellulose. Cellulose molecules are arranged in bundles called microfibrils. These give the cell wall great tensile strength and allow high pressures to develop inside the cell.
:extra:The cellulose cell wall consists of three layers: middle lamella, primary cell wall, and secondary cell wall. The overall functions the cell wall preforms are: structure, support, protection.

====2.4 Membranes====
----
'''2.4.1 Draw and label a diagram to show the structure of membranes.''' 
:*Diagram should show the phospholipid bilayer, cholesterol, glycoproteins, and integral and peripheral proteins. Use the term plasma membrane not cell surface membrane for the membrane surrounding the cytoplasm. ''[http://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/upload/a6645014.gif]'' 

'''2.4.2 Explain how the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of phospholipids help to maintain the structure of cell membranes. '''
:*Hydrophilic molecules are attracted to water. Hydrophobic molecules are not attracted to water, but are attracted to each other. The phosphate head is hydrophilic and the two hydrocarbon tails are hydrophobic. In water, phospholipids form double layers with the hydrophilic heads in contact with water on both sides and the hydrophobic tails away from the centre. The attraction between the heads and the surrounding water makes membranes very stable.
In your answer you should:
:— First discuss PHOSPHOLIPID STRUCTURE
:*hydrophobic tail/hydrophillic head
:*head made from glycerol and phosphate
:*tail made from two fatty acids
:—Then discuss the ARRANGEMENT IN MEMBRANE
:*form a bilayer
:*heads face outside the membrane/ tails face inside the membrane
:*there is a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophillic exterior
:—DRAW A DIAGRAM
:—STATE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
:*phospholipids are held together by hydrophobic interactions
:*stabilized by interaction of hydrophillic heads with surrounding water
:*fluidity helps the membrane to be stable
:*the fluidity allows for breaking and remaking of the membranes
:*allows for endo/exocytosis
:*the hydrophyllic/hydrophobic layers restrict movement
:*phospholipids can move about horizontally.

'''2.4.3 List the functions of membrane proteins. '''
:*hormone binding sites
:*enzymes
:*electron carriers
:*Channels for passive transport
:*Pumps for active transport
:*cell to cell recognition
:*receptors for neurotransmitters

'''2.4.4 Define ''diffusion'' and ''osmosis''. ''' [[Image:Diffusion.svg|thumb|Diffusion]]
:*[[w:Diffusion|Diffusion]]: is the passive movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, as a result of the random motion of particles.
:*[[w:Osmosis|Osmosis]]: the passive movement of water molecules, across a partially permeable membrane, from a region of higher solute concentration to a region of lower solute concentration.  

'''2.4.5 Explain passive transport across membranes by simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion.'''
Mention channels for facilitated diffusion.
A molecule or ion that crosses the membrane by moving down a concentration or electrochemical gradient and without expenditure of metabolic energy is said to be transported passively/diffused.  All molecules and ions are in constant motion and it is the energy of motion - kinetic energy - that drives passive transport.  Transport of uncharged species across a membrane is dictated by differences in concentration of that species across the membrane - that is, by the prevailing concentration gradient.  For ions and charged molecules, the electrical potential across the membrane also becomes critically important.  Together, gradients in concentration and electric potential across the cell membrane constitute the electrochemical gradient that governs passive transport mechanisms.
*Facilitated diffusion is diffusion that is &quot;facilitated&quot; by proteins that span the membrane and provide an alternative route or bypass.  It is similar to simple diffusion in the sense that it does not require expenditure of metabolic energy and transport is again down an electrochemical gradient.  Two major groups of integral membrane proteins are involved in facilitated diffusion:
1. Carrier proteins (also known as permeases or transporters) bind a specific type of solute and are thereby induced to undergo a series of conformational changes which has the effect of carrying the solute to the other side of the membrane.  The carrier then discharges the solute and, through another conformational change, reorients in the membrane to its original state.  Typically, a given carrier will transport only a small group of related molecules.

2.  Ion Channels do not really bind the solute, but are like hydrophilic pores through the membrane that open and allow certain types of solutes, usually inorganic ions, to pass through.  In general, channels are quite specific for the type of solute they will transport and transport through channels is quite a bit faster than by carrier proteins.  Additionally, many channels contain a &quot;gate&quot; which is functions to control the channel's permeability.  When the gate is open, the channel transports, and when the gate is closed, the channel is closed.  Such gates can be controlled either by voltage across the membrane (voltage-gated channels) or have a binding site for a ligand which, when bound, causes the channels to open (ligand-gated channels).  Ion channels allow currents to be carried across the membrane and are thus of particular importance in the physiology of excitable cells like neurons and muscle cells.  

:—BROKEN DOWN
:*passive transport requires no energy
:*molecules move down a concentration gradient
:*water moves by osmosis
:*moves from higher solute concentration to lower solute concentration
:*small uncharged molecules move by diffusion
:*charged molecules move by facilitated diffusion
:*facilitated diffusion requires protein channels

'''2.4.6 Explain the role of protein pumps and ATP in active transport across membranes. '''
:*Active transport is the movement of substances across membranes using energy from ATP. Active transport can move substances against a [[w:concentration gradient|concentration gradient]]. Protein pumps in the membrane are used for active transport. Each pump only transports particular substances so cells can control what is absorbed and what is expelled. 
:*goes against concentration gradient
:*requires a protein in the cell membrane /pump/carrier protein
:*hydrolysis of ATP / ATP → ADP + phosphate;
:*involves a conformational change in the pump / protein

'''2.4.7 Explain how vesicles are used to transport materials within a cell between the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane. '''
:*vesicle is made by pinching off a piece of membrane
:*fluidity of membrane allows this
:*vesicles can be used to transport material around inside cells
:*proteins are transported in vesicles
:*from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus
:*from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane
:*formation of vesicle from plasma membrane allows material to be taken in
:*endocytosis/pinocytosis/phagocytosis is absorption of material using a vesicle
:*fusion of vesicle with plasma membrane allows material to be secreted / passed out
:*exocytosis is secretion of material using a vesicle

'''2.4.8 Describe how the fluidity of the membrane allows it to change shape, break and re-form during endocytosis and exocytosis'''
:*In endocytosis part of the plasma membrane is pulled inwards. A droplet of fluid becomes enclosed when a vesicle is pinched off. Vesicles can then move through the cytoplasm carrying its contents.
:*In exocytosis vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane. The contents of the vesicles are then expelled. The membrane flattens out again.

====2.1 Cell Theory==== (Yet to be fully updated)
----
'''2.5.1 Outline the stages in the cell cycle, including interphase (G1, S, G2, mitosis and cytokenisis) '''
::#[[w:Interphase|Interphase]]: Divided into 3 phases; Gap Phase 1 (Cell grows larger), Synthesis (Genome is replicated), Gap Phase 2 (seperates the newly replicated genome).
::#[[w:Mitosis|Mitosis]]: Includes four stages--prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes and pull sister chromatids apart. It seperates two daughter genomes.
::#[[w:Cytokinesis|Cytokinesis]]: Division of the cytoplasm to form two new cells.

'''2.5.2 State that tumours (cancers) are the result of uncontrolled cell division and that these can occur in any organ or tissue'''
:*Tumors are formed when cell division goes wrong and is no longer controlled. This can happen in any organ or tissue.

'''2.5.3 State that interphase is an active period in life of a cell when many metabolic reactions occur, including protein synthesis, DNA replication and an increase in the number of mitochondria and/or chloroplasts.'''\

:*Interphase is an active period in the life of a cell during which many metabolic reactions occur such as protein synthesis, DNA replication and an increase in the number of mitochondria and/or chloroplast.

'''2.5.4 Describe the events that occur in the four phases of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase)'''
 
::#[[w:Prophase|Prophase]]: The spindle microtubules are extended from each pole to the equator.
::#[[w:Metaphase|Metaphase]]: Chromatids move to the equator and the spindle microtubules from each pole attach to each centromere on opposite sides.
::#[[w:Anaphase|Anaphase]]: spindle microtubules pull sister chromatids apart making the centromeres to split. This brings the sister chromatids apart, splitting them into chromosomes. Each identical chromosome is pulled to opposite poles.
::#[[Telophase|Telophase]]: Spindle microtubules break down, while chromosomes uncoil and therefore are no longer individually visible. The nuclear membrane now reforms. The cell then is divided by cytokinesis to form two daughter cells with identical genetic nuclei.

'''2.5.5 Explain how mitosis produces two genetically identical nuclei.'''

:*During prophase, chromosomes become visible under a light microscope as they super coil and therefore they get shorter and becomes more bulky. The nuclear envelope disintegrates and the spindle microtubules grow, moves towards each pole, towards the equator. At metaphase the chromatids move to the equator. The sister chromatids are two DNA identical molecules as they were replicated during DNA replication. These sister chromatids are then separated in anaphase as the spindle microtubules attaches to the centromere, it pulls the sister chromatids to opposite poles. Now that sister chromatids are separated, they are known as chromosomes. This means that each pole has the same chromosomes. Finally the microtubules break down, the chromosomes uncoil and the nuclear membrane reforms. The cell then divides into two daughter cells with genetically identical nuclei.

'''2.5.6 State that growth, embryonic development, tissue repair and asexual reproduction involve mitosis. '''

:*Growth, embryonic development, tissue repair and asexual reproduction involve mitosis.

====Chemical Elements and Water====
----

''' State that the most frequently occurring chemical elements in living things are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. '''

''' State that a variety of other elements are needed by living organisms, including sulphur, calcium , phosphorus, iron and sodium. '''

''' State one role for each of the elements mentioned above '''
:#Nitrogen: Required by proteins. (Remember, nitrogen is included in the amino acid structure) Essential to enzymes required for plant function.
:#Calcium: The mineral that strengthens bone and teeth uses calcium. Also important in nerve synaptic transmission of nerve impulses and muscle contraction. Regulates the cell wall construction in plants.
:#Phosphorus: Part of the phosphate groups in ATP and DNA molecules. In plants it is needed for cell reproduction and division. It is part of the cell membrane.
:#Iron: found in the structure of hemoglobin and essential for the production of red blood cells. It is involved in the light energy transferring compounds involved in photosynthesis in plants.
:#Sodium: Major ion associated with the propagation of a nerve impulse. Can replace potassium in some plants.In membrane function. 
:#Sulfur: It is a component of amino acids. 

'''Outline the difference between an atom and an ion and a polypeptide'''
:An atom is a single particle of a chemical element. When an atom either gains or loses an electron it then becomes an ion. Ions are charged, while atoms are uncharged. An Ion has either a negative or positive charge depending if it gained or lost an electron. On the other hand a polypepetide chain is a chain of amino acids joined through peptide bonds, the amino acids are molecules that are formed through the combination of ions. 

'''Outline the properties of water that are significant to living organisms, including transparency, cohesion, solvent properties and thermal properties. Refer to the polarity of water molecules and hydrogen bonding when relevant.'''
:#Water is '''transparent''' which allows light to filter into aquatic environments, and thus aquatic plants can absorb light and perform photosynthesis. Since the ancestor of all plants originated in the ocean, the transparency of water has had an immeasurable influence on life as we know it. 
:#Water is also '''cohesive''', that is it binds to itself, due to the polarity of the water molecule. The positive, hydrogen side of the molecule binds to the negative, oxygen side of another water molecule. This bond is called a hydrogen bond. Water is also '''adhesive''', that is it binds to other things around it. This property allows for transport of water against gravity in plants. The water adheres to the xylem tube of plants and is able to be drawn up in long columns up the stem due to its strong cohesive force
:#Water's solvent properties allows molecules to dissolve in it. This means that water can transport minerals up the xylem tube and sugars up the phloem tubes in plants. Blood in animals consists largely of water, allowing the transportation of oxygen, urea and glucose throughout the body. Water also is the site of metabolic reactions because reactions can occur between dissolved compounds.
:#Water's polarity also inhibits movement of its molecules. Since all the molecules are connected, they cannot freely move about as other, non-polar molecules do. Heat, the kinetic energy of molecules, is thus restricted and so water has a high specific heat (it must absorb large amounts of energy in order to change states). This means that water can serve as a '''temperature insulator''', and does so in organisms of all kinds.
:#Water's high latent heat of vaporization is due to strong hydrogen bonds existing between water molecules. A large amount of heat is released when water in the liquid state vaporizes into the gaseous state.
'''Explain the significance to organisms of water as a coolant, transport medium and habitat in terms of its properties'''
:#''''Coolant:''' Allows us to perform homeostasis. (We sweat to cool ourselves down). Additionally, water's high heat of vaporization allows water molecules to absorb large amounts of energy from the body before evaporating - thus, the sweating individual loses heat.
:#'''Transport medium:''' Digestion, also important to help transport blood.  Phloem in plants transport nutrients dissolved in water using the cohesive and adhesive properties.
:#'''Habitat:''' Organisms need water; the ready availability of it is essential in the choosing of a habitat. Water's high heat capacity (the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1gm of water by 1 Degrees Celcius) and high heat of vapourization (amount of energy absorbed by 1gm of liquid to be converted to the gaseous form) prevents from plants and animals from overheating and dying.

====Carbohydrates, Lipids, and Proteins.====
----
'''Define organic'''
:*Organic compounds are defined as compounds containing carbon that are found in living organisms. 
:*Compounds are considered inorganic when they contain carbon but are widely found in the environment (carbon dioxide and hydrogen).


'''Draw the basic structure of a generalized amino acid'''
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Image:Beta-D-Ribofuranose.svg|&lt;center&gt;Ribose.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Draw the structure of glycerol and a generalized fatty acid'''
[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~cfford/101triacylglycerol.gif]click link for picture

'''Outline the role of condensation and hydrolysis in the relationship between monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides; fatty acids, glycerol and glycerides; amino acids, dipeptides, and polypeptides.'''
:*In a condensation reaction, two molecules work together and form one big molecule along with water, because water is released during this reaction. So, two amino acids could join together and form a dipeptide and this would be a condensation reaction. Same applies for monosaccharides becoming dissaccharides, you get the drift.
:* Now in a hydrolysis reaction, water molecules are used up to make a large molecule into a small molecule. Think about it- &quot;hydro&quot; means water and &quot;lysis&quot; means splitting. So, water is used up to split a disaccharide into a monosaccharide. 

'''Draw the structure of a generalized dipeptide showing peptide linkage'''
http://homepages.ius.edu/GKIRCHNE/peptide.jpg 

'''List three examples for each of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides'''
:*'''Monosaccharide:''' Glucose, Fructose and ribose
:*'''Disaccharide:''' Maltose (Glucose + Glucose) and Sucrose (Glucose + Fructose), and lactose.
:*'''Polysaccharide:''' Starch (made of glucose subunits) and Glycogen (made of glucose subunits, but linked differently from starch). (Plants use mostly starch, humans use mostly glycogen) and cellulose.

'''State one function of glucose, lactose and glycogen in animals, and of fructose, sucrose and cellulose in plants.'''
:* '''Animals'''
:**Glucose: metabolized for energy.
:**Lactose: provides energy to mammalian young.
:**Glycogen: longer term energy in muscles and liver.
:* '''Plants'''
:**Fructose: sweetens fruit to disperse seeds
:**Sucrose: energy storage
:**Cellulose: cell wall structure

'''State three functions of lipids''' 
:*'''Energy storage''': Fat in humans. Oil in plants.
:*'''Heat insulation''': A layer of fat under the skin reduces heat loss. 
:*'''Buoyancy''': Lipids are less dense than water.

'''Discuss the use of carbohydrates and lipids in energy storage.'''
:*Lipids and carbohydrates are excellent for storing energy in living organisms. Carbohydrates are usually used to store energy in the short-term while lipids are used for the long-run.
:*'''Advantages of Lipids'''
::#Contain more energy per gram. Therefore lighter to store.
::#Lipids are insoluble in water; do not interfere with osmosis.
:*'''Advantages of Carbohydrates'''
::#More easily digested, so energy is released more easily from them.
::#Carbohydrates are soluble in water, so easier to transport.

'''Explain the four levels of protein structure'''&lt;br&gt;
''Primary structure''
:*A linear sequence of amino acids joined by peptide linkages. There are about 20 different amino acids.

''Secondary structure''
:*α -Helix is maintained by hydrogen bonds. The helix makes up keratin (skin, nails, hair).

:*β -Pleated Sheet: flat zig-zag amino acid chain. The sheets make up fibroin (silk.

::Both structures are fibrous and form structural proteins

''Tertiary structure''
:*Folded polypeptide chains into specific shapes. This means that tertiary proteins are globular (hormones, enzmyes, membrane proteins).

''Quaternary structure''
:*Two or more polypeptide chains joined (e.g. haemoglobin).

'''Outline the difference between fibrous and globular proteins, with references to two examples of each protein type'''
:Fibrous	proteins (such as keratin, collagen)
:*Chain extended
:*Insoluble
:*Resistance to pH/temperature changes
:*Structural material

:Globular proteins (such as haemoglobin, amylase)
:*Chain folded
:*Soluble/colloidal
:*Susceptible to pH/temperature changes
:*Compact, rounded molecules

====Enzymes====
----
'''Define ''Enzyme'' and ''Active Site'''''
:# '''Enzyme''': Globular proteins used to catalyze chemical reactions.
:# '''Active site''': The binding site on the surface of an enzyme where catalysis occurs.

'''Explain enzyme-substrate specificity'''
:* The active site for an enzyme is very specific in shape, with very precise chemical properties. Active sites match the shape of their substrates. Other molecules do not fit or do not have the same chemical properties. The enzyme is therefore substrate specific. This enzyme is a lock, and the substrate is the key which can open it.

'''Explain the effects of temperature, pH and substrate concentration on enzyme activity'''
:* Temperature, pH and substrate concentration all affect the rate at which enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. 
Substrate concentration: At low s.c. the enzyme activity is proportional to the substrate concentration, because of random collision between substrate and enzyme. Thus the more substrate the higher the rate. However at a high substrate concentration, at some point all active sites are occupied so raising the substrate concentration has no effect.

Temperature: Enzyme activity increases as temperature increases, often doubling with each 10°C. This is because collision between substrate and active site happen more frequently at higher temperatures, due to fast molecular movement. However at high temperatures enzymes are denatured and stop working. This is because heat causes vibrations inside the enzyme, which break bonds needed to maintain the structure.

pH: There is an optimum at which enzyme activity is fastest ( mostly pH 7), and as pH increases or decreases from its optimum, enzyme activity is reduced. (acids and alkali denature enzymes)

'''Define ''Denaturation'''''
:* '''Denaturation''': A structural change in a protein that results in a loss of its biological properties. This can be caused by pH or by temperature.

'''Explain the use of lactase in the production of lactose free milk'''&lt;br&gt;
Lactose- The sugar present in milk. Lactase is obtained from Kluveromyces and lactis, a type of yeast that grows naturally in milk.
Lactose can be converted to glucose and galactose using the enzyme lactase (di-saccarharide). 
Biotechnology companies culture the yeast and extract the enzyme in order to produce lactose free milk.

:*'''Advantages''': Pectinase makes juice more fluid and easy to separate from pulp.

:*Fructose is widely used in food manufacturing because it is much sweeter than glucose. It is made from starch, usually found in maize. Amylase is needed to break down the starch into glucose.
:*''''Source of Enzyme''': Amylase is obtained from fungi.
:*'''Use''': Used to break Starch into glucose, which is then converted into fructose using the enzyme '''glucose isomerase'''.

====DNA Structure====
----

'''Outline DNA nucleotide structure in terms of sugar (deoxyribose), base, and phosphate.'''
:* A DNA is composed of a deoxyribose, a phosphate group and a nitrogen base (Adenine, Cytosine, Thymine, and Guanine). The phosphate group is covalently bonded to the carbon of the deoxyribose and then nitrogenous base is attached to the deoxyribose. 

'''State the four names of the bases of DNA'''
:* Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine.

'''Outline how the DNA nucleotides are linked together by covalent bonds into a single strand.'''
:* Two DNA nucleotides can be linked together by a covalent bond between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of another. More nucleotides can be added to form a single strand.

'''Explain how the DNA double helix is formed using complementary base pairing and hydrogen bonds.'''
:* DNA molecules consist of two strands of nucleotides which are then wound together to form a double helix. These are formed between the bases of two strands. However, it is formed by complementary base pairing because Adenine only forms hydrogen bonds with Thymine and Cytosine only forms hydrogen bonds with Guanine.

'''Draw a simple diagram of the molecular structure of DNA.'''

URL of a suitable picture: http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtTxtJml/Images3/dblhelx1.gif

====DNA Replication====
----

'''State that DNA replication is semi-conservative.'''
:*DNA replication copies DNA to produce new molecules with the same base sequence. It is semi-conservative because each new molecule formed by replication uses one new strand and one old strand which is conserved from the parent DNA molecule.

'''Explain DNA replication in terms of unwinding the double helix and separation of the strands by helicase, followed by formation of the new complementary strands by DNA polymerase.'''
:#'''Stage 1''': The DNA double helix is unwound and separated into strands by helicase breaking the hydrogen bonds holding the strands together and creating a replication bubble. 
:#'''Stage 2''': The single strands act as blueprints for new strands. Free nucleotides are present in large numbers. The enzyme primase places primers on the new strand, allowing DNA Polymerase III to add to the strand in a 5-carbon to 3-carbon direction.  Several small strands are made within the replication bubble formed by helicase that are known as Okazaki fragments. DNA Polymerase III is then removed, and DNA polymerase I replaces primers with corresponding base pairs.  The enzyme ligase then binds these new base pairs to the rest of the strand. The bases of these nucleotides form hydrogen bonds with the bases of the parent strand. The nucleotides are connected to form a new strand. 
:#'''Stage 3''': The daughter DNA molecules each rewind into a double helix.

The two daughter DNA molecules are identical in base sequence to each other and to the parent molecule, because of complementary base pairing (Adenine pairs with Thymine and Cytosine with Guanine). Each of the new strand is '''complementary''' to the template on which it was made and '''identical''' to the other template.

'''Explain the significance of complementary base pairing in the conservation of the base sequence of DNA.'''
:*Because the nitrogenous bases that compose DNA can only pair with complementary bases, any two linked strands of DNA are complementary. This ensures that the old base sequence is conserved.

====Transcription and Translation====
----

'''Compare the structure of RNA and DNA'''
:1. '''The number of strands.'''
::* DNA has two strands forming a double helix.
::* RNA has one strand.
:2. '''The type of sugar.'''
::*DNA has a deoxyribose.
::*RNA has a Ribose.
:3. '''The Nucleotides.'''
::*DNA has A,C,G,T
::*RNA has A,C,G,U, (Uracil replaces Thymine)

'''Outline DNA transcription in terms of the formation of the RNA strand complimentary to the DNA strand by RNA polymerase.'''
:*'''Transcription''': The copying of the base sequence of a gene by making an RNA molecule.
:# The DNA double helix uncoils and the two strands separate.
:# RNA Polymerase attaches to promoter regions of the DNA strand
:# RNA polymerase binds free RNA nucleotides to create mRNA that are a copied template of the corresponding DNA strand.
:# The mRNA separates from the DNA.
:# The DNA strands reforms into a double helix.

'''Describe the genetic code in terms of codons composed of triplets and bases.'''
The genetic code is a triplet code- three bases code for one amino acid. A group of three bases is :*called a codon. 

'''Explain the process of translation, leading to polypeptide formation'''
:# Before the mRNA strand is translated, it must be processed.  A cap and tail are added to the mRNA strand to allow the mRNA strand out of the nucleus.
:# There are intron and exon segments of the strand.  The introns are removed by the introduction of a splicesome.  The splicesome pushes out the introns and binds the exons together.
:# The mRNA then passes through the nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm.
:# The two subunits of a ribosome (60s and 40s) lock onto the mRNA at the ribosome-binding site.
:# Transfer RNA (tRNA) are clover-leafed shaped molecules that have a specific amino acid attached.
:# Each tRNA also has three bases called the anticodon that binds to the mRNA. The anticodon determines which amino acid the tRNA carries.
:# The tRNA can only bind to the mRNA in the presence of a ribosome. In each ribosome there are two tRNA binding sites (Aminoacyl tRNA binding site or A site and Peptidinal tRNA binding site or P site) and a tRNA exit site (E site).
:# The mRNA is divided into groups of three bases each called a codon. The anticodon on the tRNA binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA. In so doing it brings the amino acid into position.
:# The mRNA is fed between the small and large subunits of the ribosome.  The first tRNA molecule with the attached start amino acid, methanine, attaches at the A site and is transferred to the P site.  The next tRNA binds to the mRNA and contains an amino acid.  
:# When two tRNA molecules are bound to the mRNA at the ribosome a ribosomal enzyme forms a peptide bond between the two amino acids.
:# The first tRNA becomes detached from its amino acid and moves off from the ribosome after it slides into the exit site.
:# The ribosome moves a distance of one codon and a new tRNA binds bringing in another amino acid to be joined to the polypeptide chain.
:# The first codon translated on any mRNA is always AUG. This is called the initiation codon and it sets the reading frame of the mRNA.
:# There are also three codons that signal the end of the mRNA and stop translation. They are the stop codons UAG, UAA and UGA.
:# Several ribosomes may all be translating the same mRNA at the same time. This is called a polysome.

'''Define the terms degenerate, and universal as they relate to the genetic code'''
:*'''Degenerate''': Having more than one base triplet to code for one amino acid.
:*'''Universal''': Found in all living organisms.

'''Discuss the relationship between one gene and one polypeptide'''
:* Polypeptides are long chains of amino acids.
:* Amino acids must be linked up in a precise sequence to make a polypeptide.
:* Genes store the information needed to make a polypeptide in a coded form.
:* The sequence of bases in a gene codes for the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide.
:* The information in the gene is decoded during the making of the polypeptide.
:* This process is conducted in two stages known as transcription and translation.

====Cell Respiration====
----

'''Define Cell-Respiration'''
:*'''Cell Respiration''': controlled release of energy in the form of ATP from organic compounds in cells.

'''In cell respiration, glucose in the cytoplasm is broken down into pyruvate with a small yield of ATP'''
: Glucose is organic compound that is sometimes used in cell respiration. Chemical reactions break Glucose into a simpler compound called pyruvate. A small amount of ATP (2 ATP) is produced by using energy released from glucose.

'''In anaerobic cell respiration pyruvate is converted into lactate or ethanol dioxide in the cytoplasm with no further yield of ATP'''
:* Lactic fermentation: In the process of glycolysis glucose is transferred into two pyruvate. Since no oxygen is available, the Krebs cycle cannot run which therefore also stops the process of the electron transport chain. Too much pyruvate is built up in the cytoplasm and we need to get rid of it. Therefore, it is transferred into the waste product - lactate - that can be removed from the cell. No ATP is produced.
:*Alcohol fermentation: since there is no oxygen, pyruvate is transferred into ethanol/alcohol and carbon dioxide is created as a bi-product. This is how an one-celled organisms overcome oxygen deficiency. 

'''In aerobic respiration pyruvate is broken down in the mitochondrion into carbon dioxide and water with a large yield of ATP'''
If oxygen is available, the pyruvate is absorbed by mitochondrion. The pyruvate is then broken down into carbon dioxide and water. A large amount of ATP is produced. 

:::'''Note''': How to remember the difference! Aerobic sounds healthy- so something good comes out of it! Anaerobic sounds like unaerobic and that sounds unhealthy! Easy to remember, right? Also, think of doing aerobics, which is healthy as well and makes you breathe a lot!

====Photosynthesis====
----

'''State that photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy.'''
:*Photosynthesis involves energy conversion. Light energy, usually sunlight, is converted into chemical energy.

'''State that white light from the sun is composed of a range of wavelengths.'''
:* Sunlight is called white light, but it is actually made up of a range of wavelengths including red, blue, and green.

'''State that chlorophyll is the main photosynthetic pigment'''
:* The structure of chlorophyll allows it to absorb some colours of wavelength better than others.

'''Outline the differences in absorption of red, blue and green light by chlorophyll'''
:* Red and blue light are absorbed more than green. The green light that cannot be absorbed is reflected giving plants (and the pigment chlorophyll) their green colour.

'''State that light energy is used to split water molecules (photolysis) to give oxygen and hydrogen and to produce ATP'''

:*Some of the energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to produce ATP
:*Some of the energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water molecules. This is called photolysis of water
:*Photolysis of water results in the formation of oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released as a waste product

'''State that ATP and hydrogen (derived from photolysis of water) are used to fix carbon dioxide to make organic molecules.'''
:*Carbon dioxide is absorbed for use in photosynthesis
:*The carbon from it is used to make a wide range of organic substances
:*The conversion of carbon in a gas to carbon in solid compounds is called carbon fixation
:*Carbon fixation involves the use of hydrogen from photolysis and energy from ATP.

'''Explain that the rate of photosynthesis can be measured directly by the production of oxygen or the uptake of carbon dioxide, or indirectly by the increase of biomass'''
:* Uptake of carbon dioxide: Since carbon dioxide is important in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, its consumption by plants can be measured as a means to determine the rate of ATP and electron carriers used for carbon fixation.
:* Production of oxygen: Aquatic plants release bubbles of oxygen when they carry photosynthesis. e.g. these bubbles are collected; their volume can be measured.
:* Increase in Biomass: If batches of plants are harvested at a series of times and their biomass determined, then the rate of photosynthesis can be determined by an increase in biomass. 

'''Outline the effects of temperature, light intensity, and carbon dioxide concentration on the rate of photosynthesis''':
:* Light - At low medium light intensities the rate is directly proportional to light intensity. At high light intensities the rate reaches a plateau.
:* Carbon Dioxide - No photosynthesis at very low CO2 concentrations. At low to fairly high CO2 concentrations the rate is positively correlated with CO2 concentration. At very high CO2 concentrations the rate reaches a plateau.
:* Temperature - As temperature increases the rate increases more and more steeply. If the temperature increases with 10¤C it roughly doubles the rate. When it reaches it maximum point it is said to be its Optimum Temperature which is around 40¤C. Above the optimum temperature the rate slows down rapidly and then stops. This happens because the excessive heat destroys the enzymes which are responsible for catalyzing chemical reactions.

====3.1. Chromosomes, Genes, Alleles and Mutations====
----

'''3.1.1. State that eukaryote chromosomes are made of DNA and protein.'''
   
'''3.1.2. Define gene, allele, and genome.'''
:* '''Gene''': A heritable factor that controls a specific characteristic. It is a portion of the DNA. 
:*'''Allele''': one specific form of a gene, differing from other alleles by one of few bases only and occupying the same gene locus as other alleles of the gene.
:*'''Genome''': the whole genetic information of an organism.

'''3.1.3. Define gene mutation'''
:* A change in the base sequence of a gene. Point mutations affect only individual bases. Bases can be deleted, inserted or substituted.

'''3.1.4. Explain the consequences of a base subsitution in relation to the process of transcription and translation , using the example of sickle cell anemia.'''
:# Base subsitution (gene mutation) from A to T in the triplet coding of a sixth amino acid. The mutation changes the allele HbA into a new allele, HbS
:# One codon in the mRNA is different and therefore one amino acid in the polypeptide is altered. Therefore, the hemoglobin of people with sickle cell anemia contain valine instead of the normal glutamate.
:#These valine may change the phenotype from normal. Sometimes the cells become sickle shaped (hence the name). The problem with this is that it might cause clotting since the cells hook on and clot areas. Also, the person might suffer a severe lack of oxygen in their body tissues.
:# The allele HbS is quite common in southern Africa, because it actually helps resist malaria.

====3.2 Meiosis ====
'''State that meiosis is a reduction division in terms of diploid and haploid chromosomes'''

'''Define ''homologous chromosomes'''''
:* Chromosomes which have the same arrangement of genes as each other. The actual base sequence of these genes may differ, however, resulting in different alleles of those genes. For example, homologous chromosomes carry a gene coding for eye-color on the same location, the actual information carried on these genes (the base sequence) may be different.

'''Outline the process of meiosis including pairing of chromosomes followed by two divisions, which results in four haploid cells.'''

:* Homologous chromosomes pair up. Nuclear membrane will break down. Spindle fibres extended from each pole of the equator. 
:* The pairs of chromosomes line up on equator.  Spindle fibres attach to different chromosomes in each pair ensuring that each is pulled to opposite poles. 
:* The spindle fibres pull the chromosomes to opposite poles halving the chromosome number. Each chromosome still consists of two chromatids.
:* The cell membrane around the equator is pulled inwards to divide the cell to form two haploid cells.  New spindle fibres grow from the poles to the equator.
:* Steps 2 and 3 repeats (separating the chromatids).
:* Four new haploid cells are formed. Nuclear membranes reform. Each nucleus now has half of many chromosomes as the nucleus of the parent cell.

'''Explain how the movement of chromosomes during meiosis can give rise to genetic variety in the resulting haploid cells'''

:* The position of each pair of chromosomes in the nucleus when the spindle fibres become attached is random (random orientation). They attach to whichever chromosome of the pair is closer.
:* Each pole could receive either chromosome of a pair. In total, each pole could receive four possible combinations of two chromosomes.
:* The number of possible combinations of chromosomes that can be formed during random orientation is expressed through 2n (n being the number of pairs of chromosomes).
:* Each combination is genetically different, so the movements of chromosomes in meiosis generate a lot of genetic variety.

'''Explain how the non-disjunction can lead to changes in chromosome number, illustrated by reference to Down's Syndrome (trisomy 21)'''
:* Sometimes chromosomes that separate and move to opposite poles move to one pole instead. When chromosomes do not separate it is called '''non-disjunction'''.
:*When gametes that contain an extra chromosome fertilize, the zygote produces three chromosomes of one type instead of the normal two. This is called '''trisomy''' of chromosome 21. This is when there are 3 chromosome 21's instead of just 2.

'''State Mendel's Law of Segregation'''
:* Two alleles of each gene separate into different gametes.

'''Explain the relationship between Mendel's Law of Segregation and Meiosis'''
:* This segregation occurs during meiosis.

====3.3. Theoretical Genetics====
---- 
'''3.3.1 Define: genotype, phenotype, dominant allele, recessive allele, codominant alleles, locus, homozygous, heterozygous, carrier, and test cross'''

'''Genotype'''- the alleles of an organism
       
'''Phenotype'''- the characteristics of an organism
       
'''Dominant Allele'''- an allele that has the same effect on the 
phenotype whether it is present in the homozygous or    heterozygous 
state
       
'''Recessive Allele'''- an allele that only has an effect on the 
phenotype when it is present in the homozygous state
       
'''Codominant allele'''- pairs of alleles that both affect the phenotype when present in a heterozygote

'''Locus'''- the particular position of a gene on homologous chromosomes
       
'''Homozygous'''- having two identical alleles of a gene

'''Heterozygous'''- having two different alleles of a gene

'''Carrier'''- an individal that has one copy of a recessive allele that causes a genetic disease in individuals that are homozygous for this allele
       
'''Test Cross'''- testing a suspected heterozygote by crossing it with a 
known homozygous recessive


'''Construct a Punnett grid'''


'''Construct a Pedigree chart'''


'''State that some genes have more than two alleles (multiple alleles)'''


'''3.3.4 Describe ABO blood groups as an example of codominance and multiple alleles'''
         Phenotype           Genotype
             O                  ii
             A                I^A I^A or I^A i
             B                I^B I^B or I^B i
            AB                I^A I^B

'''Outline how the sex chromosomes determine gender by referring to the inheritance of X and Y chromosomes in humans'''


'''State that some genes are present on the X chromosome and absent from the shorter Y chromosome in humans'''


'''Define Sex-Linkage'''

Sex linkage is the association of a characteristic with gender, because the gene controlling the characteristic is located on a sex chromosome.


'''State two examples of sex-linkage'''

Color blindness and hemophilia- both these conditions are produced by a recessive sex-linked allele on the X chromosome.


'''State that a human female can be homozygous or heterozygous with respect to to sex-linkage genes. 


'''Explain that female carriers are heterozygous for X-linked recessive alleles


'''Calculate and predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratio of offspring of monohybrid crosses involving any of the above patterns of inheritance'''


'''Deduce the genotypes or phenotypes of individuals in pedigree charts'''

====3.4 Genetic Engineering and Other Aspects of Biotechnology====
----
'''State that PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) copies and amplifies minute quantities of nucleic acid.'''

'''State that gel electrophoresis involves the separation of fragmented pieces of DNA according to their charge and size.'''
:* Based on idea that molecules move at different rates (and directions) when placed in an electric field due to different charges and sizes.

'''State that gel electrophoresis of DNA is used in DNA profiling.'''

'''Describe two applications of DNA profiling.'''
:* Paternity suits (determining parent-child relationships).
:* Criminal investigations (using blood or semen collected from the scene).
:* Identification of people long dead (e.g. Egyptian mummies, Russian Tsars).
:* Everyone's DNA is unique and so can be used in identification; however, samples can be contaminated.

'''Define genetic screening.'''
:* Determining experimentally if a person has a specific gene or not.

'''Discuss three advantages and/or disadvantages of genetic screening.'''
:* Advantages include: Checking unborn babies for genetic disorders, can gain knowledge about one's own genotype.
:* Disadvantages include: Ethical issues (e.g. selection, abortion(?))

'''State that the Human Genome Project is an international cooperative venture established to sequence the complete human genome.'''
:* The human genome has 30,000 to 40,000 genes. The HGP is attempting to find the location of all these genes and their base sequence.

'''Describe two advantageous outcomes of this project'''
:* Easier to study how genes control human development.
:* Allow identification of genetic diseases and allow for the production of a drug based on the normal DNA sequences of genes. 

'''State that genetic material can be transferred between species because the genetic code is universal'''
:*The genetic code is universal. This means that genes can be transfered from one organism to another, (and this has indeed been the case). Organisms that have had genes transferred to them are called '''genetically modified organisms'''.

'''Outline the basic technique for gene transfer involving plasmids, a host cell (bacterium, yeast or other cell) restriction enzymes (endonucleases) and DNA ligase.'''
:# Messenger RNA coded for insulin is extracted from human pancreas cells. 
:# DNA copies of the messenger RNA coding for insulin are made using the ''enzyme reverse transcriptase''.

:# '''Plasmids''': are small loops of DNA found in bacteria.
:# Plasmids are cut open using ''restriction enzyme endonucleouse''. 
:# The insulin gene and the plasmid are mixed.

:# ''DNA ligase'' seals up the plasmid.
:# The plasmid with the human insulin gene is inserted into a '''recombinant plasmid'''.
:# The recombinant plasmid are mixed with a strain of E.Coli bacteria.
:# The E.coli bacteria start to make insulin which is then extracted, purified and used by patients suffering from diabities. 

'''State two examples of the current uses of genetically modified crops or animals'''
:* Golden rice is a genetically modified rice crop that produces beta-carotene, which can be metabolized into Vitamin A within the body. Scientists hope that golden rice will eventually be a cheap source of beta-carotene in malnourished countries, reducing the number of children worldwide that go blind from Vitamin A deficiency.
:* Bt maize is a genetically modified corn crop that produces a toxin that kills European corn borers feeding on the maize.

'''Discuss the potential benefits and potential harmful effects of one example of genetic modificiation'''
:* '''Bt Maize''': Contains a gene which releases toxin that kills insects feeding on the maize.
::* '''Advantages''': Less pest damage, and therefore better harvests. 
::Less land needed for crop production.
::Less use of insecticides.

::*'''Disadvantages''': Humans or animals that eat BT Maize might be harmed by bacterial DNA in it.
::Insects that are not feeding on the maize could be killed. The maize pollen, which contains the toxin, could be blown onto nearby plants.
::Wild plants might also adapt the same gene.
::Overuse of Bt maize would lead to toxin-resistant corn borers.

'''Outline the process of gene therapy using a named example'''
:* '''Gene Therapy''': is the treatment of a genetic disease by altering the genotype. It is is still very experimental. However, if the allele of a gene is recessive, then perhaps the dominant gene could be inserted to prevent that disease. SCID (Severe combined immune deficiency) is caused by lack of the enzyme ADA. It produces lymphocytes, without it, the body cannot fight diseases. The gene causing SCID is recessive.

:# Genetic screening shows a baby has SCID. 
:#The gene that codes for ADA is obtained. The gene is inserted into a retrovirus.
:# The retrovirus is mixed with stem cells. They enter and insert the gene into the stem cell's chromosomes.
:# Stem cells containing ADA are injected back into the baby's blood stream. 

''&quot;SCID-ADA-l(ymphcytes)&quot; / &quot;skedaddle&quot;''

'''Define Clone'''
:* A '''clone''' is a group of genetically identical organisms or a group of genetically identical cells derived from a single parent.

'''Outline the technique for cloning using differentiated cells'''
:*Udder cells are taken from a donor sheep. The genes in the cell are made dormant. [[Image:Cloning_diagram_english.png|thumb|Outline of Cloning]]
:*Unfertilised eggs are taken from another sheep.
:# The nucleus is removed from the egg cell.
:#The egg cell without a nucleus is fused with the udder cell using a pulse of electricity.
:# The fused cells develop into zygotes.
:# Inserted back into mother.

'''Discuss the ethical issues of cloning in humans'''
:'''Arguments against cloning humans'''
::* Psychological problems from being a clone.
::*Clones might suffer diseases, and there is a higher risk of diseases or abnormalities.
:'''Arguments for cloning in humans''':
::*Happens naturally, so nothing new.
::* Might make screening for genetic diseases easier.
::* Greater chance for IVF.

====Communities and Ecosystems====
----

'''Define ecology, ecosystem, population, community, species and habitat.''' 
:*[[w:Ecology|Ecology]] - the study of relationships between living organisms and between organisms and their environment. 
:*[[w:Ecosystem|Ecosystem]] - a system made up of organisms as well as the abiotic factors in the area. 
:*[[w:Population|Population]] - a group of organisms of the same species who live in the same area at the same time 
:*[[w:Community|Community]] - a group of populations living and interacting with each other in an area 
:*[[w:Species|Species]] - a group of organisms which can interbreed and produce fertile offspring 
:*[[w:Habitat|Habitat]] - the environment in which a species normally lives or the location of a living organism

'''Explain how the biosphere consists of interdependent and interrelated ecosystems.''' 
:*In an ecosystem, organisms feed off of each other. This relation or interaction of organisms can be in the form of a food chain or a food web. The food chain is a linear and simple feeding relation, where one organism has one type of food and is eaten by one type of organism. However, a food web is more complex and it includes more variety of organisms, each of which can feed on a variety of other organisms and is fed upon by a variety of organisms. These are not the only interactions that compose the biosphere, however. A remarkable diversity of animal interactions, as well as the work of plants, bacteria, fungus, and protists combine to influence the biosphere. Also, organic cycles such as the water cycle, the recycling of the respiratory products of animals (carbon dioxide) in photosynthesis, and the transpiratory return of water to the atmosphere in plants all play major roles as well. 

'''Define autotroph (producer), heterotroph (consumer), detritivore and saprotrophs (decomposer).''' 
:*[[w:Autotrophs|Autotrophs]] - also known as producers, they can make their own food - main producers are photosynthesizers, which utilize the sun's energy and convert it into chemical energy, which they use to build their bodies. Considered net producers of O2. 
:*[[w:Heterotroph|Heterotroph]] - are consumers, they feed on ready made organic material, they cannot synthesize their own food, and they are considered net producers of CO2. 
:*[[w:Detritivore|Detritivore]] - organisms that feed on the detritus (thus detritivore)and decomposing organic material of living organisms (eg. dung beetle).
:*[[w:Saprotrophs|Saprotrophs]] or decomposers- organisms that feed on dead organisms and products of living organisms. They secrete enzymes on these materials that cause decomposition, and then they absorb the resulting simple compounds into their bodies. So they do not ingest whole food, but rather, they absorb decomposed and digested food. Examples are bacteria and fungi. 

'''Describe what is meant by a food chain giving three examples, each with at least three linkages (four organisms).''' 
:*A food chain is a linear and simple feeding relation, where one organism has one type of food and is eaten by one type of organism. For example:
::#Mosquito larva ---&gt;beetle ---&gt;mouse---&gt;snake 
::#Plankton----&gt;krill----&gt;mullet---&gt;shark
::#Earwig----&gt;lizard---&gt;shrew--&gt;owl
::#Clams----&gt;starfish---&gt;sea otters---&gt;orcas 
::#Periwinkle plant---&gt;moth---&gt;frog---&gt;snake----&gt;hawk
:::'''Tip''': It's not necessary to memorise this, instead you can think logically. 

'''Describe what is meant by a food web'''
:*A food web is more complex than a food chain and it includes a larger variety of organisms. Each of which feed on a variety of other organisms and they are in turn fed on by more organisms. Therefore, if one species becomes extinct the ecosystem will still be able to exist. A drawing will be inserted at a later date of a food web. 

'''Define trophic level.''' 
:*Trophic Level: Position in the food chain, determined by the number of energy-transfer steps to that level; A functional classification of taxa within a community that is based on feeding relationships (eg, plants make up the first trophic level, herbivores make up the second). 

'''Deduce the trophic level of organisms in a food chain and a food web.''' 

'''Construct a food web containing up to 10 organisms, given appropriate information.''' 

'''State that light is the initial energy source for almost all communities.''' 
:*Light is the initial energy source for almost all communities.

'''Explain energy flow in a food chain.''' 
•	Energy losses between trophic levels include material not consumed or material not assimilated and heat loss through cell respiration. Also, energy flows (basically) from the sun to producers to herbivores to carnivores.

'''State that when energy transformations take place, including those in living organisms, the process is never 100% efficient, commonly between 10-20%.''' 
:*When energy transformations take place, including those in living organisms, the process is never 100% efficient, commonly between 10-20%.

'''Explain what is meant by a pyramid of energy and the reasons for its shape.''' 
:*A pyramid of energy shows the flow of energy from one trophic level to the next in a community. The units of pyramids of energy are therefore energy per unit area per unit time.

'''Explain that energy can enter and leave an ecosystem, but that nutrients must be recycled.''' 
:*Energy can enter and leave an ecosystem but nutrients must be recycled. Sun light is the main source of energy on this planet. It is absorbed by photosynthesizing organisms, which convert light to chemical energy. Nutrients must be recycled by obtaining them from other organisms or products of organisms. 

'''Draw the carbon cycle to show the processes involved.'''
:* See [[w:Carbon Cycle|Carbon Cycle]] 
:* Five major processes involved: Photosynthesis, cellular respiration, feeding, fossilization and combustion. 

'''Explain the role of saprotrophic bacteria and fungi (decomposers) in recycling nutrients.'''
:*These organisms feed on dead organisms and products of living organisms. They secrete enzymes on these materials that cause decomposition, and then they absorb decomposed and digested foods. They absorb only what they need to survive, the remainder of the nutrients are reabsorbed into the ecosystem. They are essential as they unlock these nutrients, readying them for reabsorbtion. Examples include many species of bacteria and fungi. These are essential organisms to an ecosystem, since they cause recycling of materials between biotic and abiotic parts of the ecosystem.

====4.2 The greenhouse effect====
----

'''Draw and label a diagram of the carbon cycle to show the processes involved.'''

'''Analyse the changes in concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide using historical records.'''

'''Explain the relationship between rises in concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane and oxides of nitrogen and the enhanced greenhouse effect.'''

: 'As levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides increase, more radiation is reflected back to Earth instead of being lost to space. 

'''Outline the precautionary principle.'''
: 'better safe than sorry'- When an activity raises threats of harm, measures should be taken, even if a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established scientifically.

'''Evaluate the precautionary principle as a justification for strong action in response to the threats posed by the enhanced greenhouse effect.'''

'''Outline the consequences of a global temperature rise on arctic ecosystems.'''
:•Effects include increased rates of decomposition of detritus previously trapped in permafrost, expansion of the range of habitats available to temperate species, loss of ice habitat, changes in distribution of prey species affecting higher trophic levels, and increased success of pest species, including pathogens.

====4.3 Populations====
----

'''Outline how population size can be affected by natality, immigration, mortality, and emigration.'''
:*If (natality + immigration) &gt; (mortality + emigration) then a population is increasing. These factors determine whether a population is increasing or decreasing.

'''Draw a graph showing the sigmoid (s-shaped) population curve.'''

'''Explain reasons for the exponential growth phase, the plateau phase, and the transitional phase between these two phases'''
:*During the [[w:Exponential phase|Exponential phase]] the population increases exponentially because the natality rate is higher than the mortality rate. The resources needed by the population such as food and space are abundant, and diseases and predators are rare.
:*During the [[w:Transitional Phase|Transitional Phase]], the birth rate begins to decrease. Natality is still larger than mortality, but the difference between them is slowly decreasing.
:*During the [[w:Plateau phase|Plateau phase]], available resources become so low that no further reproduction can take place. Mortality starts to become larger than natality. A species may have reached its [[w:Carrying Capacity|Carrying Capacity]].

'''Define ''carrying capacity'''''
:*[[w:Carrying Capacity|Carrying Capacity]]: The maximum number of organisms of a species, or the maximum population size which an environment is able to support.

'''List three factors which set limits to population increase.'''
:*Available resources.
:*Disease
:*Space available
:*Predators

'''Define ''random sample'''''
:* A sample where every individual in a population has an equal chance of being chosen. 
:* No Bias


'''Describe one technique used to estimate the population size of an animal species based on a capture-mark-release-method.'''
:* One method of estimating the population size of an animal species is the capture-mark-release method. 
::#As many individuals of a population are caught. These individuals are marked. 
::#The individuals are released back into their environment.
::#After a while, as many individuals of a population are caught in the same area again.
::#The total number is taken note of and ''the number of those caught which are marked''
:This is known as the &quot;Lincoln Index&quot;
::* The formula (n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is then used where:
::*n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of individuals caught in the first trial.
::*n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of individuals caught in the second trial.
::*n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = The number of individuals in the second trial which were marked.

'''Describe one method of random sampling used to compare the population numbers of two plant species, based on quadrant methods'''
:*[[w:Frame Quadrant|Frame Quadrat]]: 
:*[[w:Line Quadrant|Line Quadrat]]: 

'''Calculate the mean of a set of values'''
:* Mean= Total sum of values / number of values.

'''State the term ''standard deviation'' is used to summarize the spread of values around the mean and that 68% fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean'''

'''Explain how standard deviation is useful for comparing the means and spread of ecological data between two or more populations.'''

====Evolution====
----
'''Define evolution.'''
:*[[w:Evolution|Evolution]] is the accumulation of changes in the heritable characteristics of a population.

'''State that populations tend to produce more offspring than the environment can support.'''

This increases the chance of survival of the population as a whole--a single death is less disastrous in a population of 1,000 than it is in a population of 10.

'''Explain that the consequence of the potential overproduction of offspring is a struggle of survival.'''
:*Populations of living organisms tend to increase exponentially. 
::#More offspring are produced than the environment can support. There is a struggle for important resources such as food and space. Intraspecific competition. Some individuals survive and others die. 
::#Characteristics in organisms differ from one another. Some have characteristics which make them better suited to survive in their environment. These are the most likely to survive. 

'''State that the members of a species show variation.'''
:*Members of a species show variation.

'''Explain how sexual reproduction promotes variation in a species.'''
:*Variation is essential for natural selection and therefore for evolution. Although mutation is the original source of new genes or alleles, sexual reproduction promotes variation by allowing the formation of new combinations of alleles. Two stages in sexual reproduction promote variation.
:#Meiosis allows a huge variety of genetically different gametes to be produced by each individual
:#Fertilization allows alleles from two different individuals to be brought together in one new individual.

'''Explain how natural selection leads to the increased reproduction of individuals with favourable heritable variation.'''

The much better-adapted individuals pass on their characteristics to more offspring than the less well adapted individuals. The results of natural selection therefore accumulate. As one generation follows another, the characteristics of the species gradually change, the species evolve.

'''Discuss the theory that species evolve by natural selection.'''
:*There is a struggle for existence in populations. There are a limited amount of resources to suffice a population of organisms. They must face both interspecific and intraspecific competition in order to obtain these resources.
:*Some organisms have more useful characteristics than others that makes them more adapted to their environment, and give them a better ability at obtaining these limited resources.
:*These creatures will survive because of this trait, reproduce, and there is high chance their offspring will also survive as well. Overtime, more members of the population will acquire this trait and thus overtime the whole species may have ''evolved''.

''''Explain two examples of evolution in response to environmental change; one must be multiple antibiotic resistance to bacteria. '''
:*Before [[w:Penicillin|Penicillin]] was invented, bacteria was the leading cause of death. However, once it began to be used, since it's an antibiotic, some individuals of bacteria may carry the gene Penicillinase, which codes for an enzyme that deactivates Penicillin, making them resistant to an antibiotic such as Penicillin. Thus, when it is indeed used, they will be the only ones left to reproduce and new bacteria will also be resistant to the antibiotic. 
:* The [[w:Peppered Moth|Peppered Moth]] is another example of evolution in response to environmental change. When Britain began industrialising, soot would come from factories and land on trees. A species of peppered moth with a lighter colour vanished and those with a darker colour flourished because they could hide themselves easily.

====Classification====
----
'''Define species.''' 
:*A [[w:species|species]] is a group of organisms with similar characteristics, which can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.

'''Describe the values of classifying organisms.'''
:* '''Species Classification''':It is easier to find out which species an organism belongs to when you have other organisms to compare it to. 
:*You can make assumptions about characteristics of a species in general.
:*Evolutionary links, you can make assumptions about traits of a common ancestor. You can also predict how they evolved.

'''Outline the binomial systems of nomenclature.'''
:* Called binomial because two names are used.
::# First name is genus, with first name being a capital.
::# Second name is species, with no capital.
::# Italics are used when the name is printed.
::# The name is underlined if it is handwritten.

'''State that organisms are classified into the kingdoms, Prokaryotae, Protoctista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animilia.'''
:*[[w:Prokaryotae|Prokaryotae]]- bacteria
:*[[w:Protoctista|Protoctista]]- Including unicellar organisms like Amoeba and Algae
:*[[w:Fungi|Fungi]]- Including moulds and yeasts
:*[[w:Plantae|Plantae]]- Including conifer, ferns, mosses and flowering plants
:*[[w:Animalia|Animalia]]- Multicellular and locomotive, including sponges, corals, birds and mammals

'''List the seven levels in the hierarchy of taxa- kingdom, phylum, class, order family genus species- using an example from two different kingdoms for each level. (King Philip Comes Over For Good Soup)'''
:*Kingdom: Animalia | Plantae
::*Phylum: Chordata | Conferophyta
:::*Class: Mammalia | Pinopsida
::::*Order: Cetacea | Pinales
:::::*Family: Balaenopteridae | Taxodiaceae
::::::*Genus:  Baleaenoptera | Sequoia
:::::::*Species: musculus | sempervirens

'''Apply and/or design a key for a group of up to eight organisms. Shape, number, color, etc.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Keys are most commonly used to identify plants, insects, and birds. These are often area specific, for example, the Plants of Northern Europe.
Keys are usually constructed in the following ways:
*The key consists of a series of numbered stages
*Each stage consists of a pair of alternative characteristics
*Some alternatives give the nest stage of a key to go to
*Some alternatives give the identification
For an in depth analysis of constructing a Dichotomous Key see: [[Dichotomous_Key]]

====Human Impact====
----
'''Outline the two local or global examples of human impact causing damage to an ecosystem or the biosphere. One example must be the increased greenhouse effect.'''
:* '''Air Pollution''': The warmth of the earth can be attributed to radiation from the sun. Some of the radiation is absorbed by the earth. Many gases aid in these absorption such as carbon dioxide, methane,  and water vapour. They withhold the radiation and form a blanket warming the earth. The effect is like a greenhouse, hence the name: [[w:Greenhouse Effect|Greenhouse Effect]]. 
:*However, there has been in increase in carbon dioxide and methane because of combustion of fossil fuels. This has led to an increased greenhouse effect and thus global warming.

:*'''Deforestation''': In some areas, rainforests are cut to make way for farmland- slash and burn techniques. This has generally a negative effect because rainforest soil is not generally good for farming and can only be used temporally. Moreover, this is a catalyst for soil erosion. Almost everywhere, forested land is cleared for construction and for resources (wood). 

'''Explain the causes and effects of the two examples before, supported by data.'''
:* See before. 

'''Discuss measures which could be taken to contain or reduce the impact of the two examples with reference to the functioning of the ecosystem.'''
:* In reference to the Greenhouse Effect: Cleaner fuels that emit less carbon dioxide and other gases, especially in motor vehicles, could ease pressure on the environment, allowing natural effects to work the problem out. Photosynthesis should be encouraged to reduce carbon dioxide from the air, and also emissions from the burning of fossil fuels should be reduced.
:* In reference to deforestation: People having fewer children (2 at most) would stop the increase in the human population. If the population were to remain the same, new housing construction would be unnecessary. Also, re-planting deforested areas and giving them time to grow would serve to rectify the problem to an extent.

===Topic 6: Human Health and Physiology===

====Digestion====
----
'''Explain why digestion of large food molecules is essential.'''

:*The foods that we eat are not necessarily usable in their current form by our tissues. They have to be broken down and rearranged to &quot;human versions&quot;. 

:* original ingested molecules are often too large to be absorbed by the villi in the small intenstine so they must be broken down to be absorbed. 

'''Explain the need for enzymes in digestion.'''
Without enzymes digestion would still occur, however at a significantly slower pace.

'''State the sources, substrate, products and optimum pH conditions for one amylase, one protease, and one lipase.'''
:*'''Enzyme''': Salivary Amylase | Pepsin             | Pancreatic lipase
:*'''Source''': Salivary glands  | Wall of Stomach    | Pancreas
:*'''Substrate''':       Starch  | Proteins           | Triglycerides (fats or oils)
:*'''Products''':        Maltose | Small polypeptides | Fatty Acids and Glycerol
:*'''Optimum pH''':        pH 7  | pH 1.5 - 3         | pH 7

'''Draw a diagram of the digestive system. 
[[Image:Digestive_system_diagram_en.svg]]

'''Outline the function of the stomach, small intestine and large intestine.'''
:*Digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, where the process is sped up by the enzyme pepsin. Harmful bacteria that has entered the body can be killed by the stomach's acidic environment(pH 1.5-2).
:*In the small intestine, enzymes complete the process where the end matter is absorbed by villi. 
:*The large intestine absorbs water and passes the unabsorbable rest off as feces. 

'''Distinguish between absorption and assimilation.'''
:*[[w:Absorption|Absorption]] is when food molecules pass through a layer of cells such as passing through the villi.
:*[[w:Assimilation|Assimilation]] is when food actually becomes part of the body's tissue.

'''Explain how the structure of the villus is related to its role in absorption of the end products of digestion.'''
:*It increases the surface area of the small intestine
:*The epithelium has a surface of only a thin layer of cells.
:*Protein channels in the microvilli allow for quick absorption of foods via facilitated diffusion and active transport.
:*Blood capillaries close to epithelium making it only a small distance for diffusion to occur.

====The Transport System====
----
'''Draw a diagram of the heart showing all four chambers, associated blood vessels and valves.'''

[http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z11/YumSmoothies/Diagramoftheheart.jpg?t=1210696189 see labelled diagram here]

'''Describe the action of the heart in terms of collecting blood, pumping blood and opening and closing valves.'''
:*The right atrium relaxes for the blood to be received from the superior and inferior vena cava.
:*The atrioventricular valve opens for blood to go to the right ventricle by the contracting atrium.
:*The right ventricle then relaxes to receive the blood from the atrium. Then it contracts in order to open up the pulmonary valves. Deoxygenated blood goes through to the pulmonary artery, where it enters the lungs so that the blood will be oxygenated.
:*Blood returns from the lungs to the heart through the pulmonary veins, now oxygenated.
:*The left atrium relaxes to receive it and then contracts to pump blood and open the atrioventricular valve where then the blood goes to the relaxed left ventricle.
:*The left ventricle contracts to open the semilunar valves and then the blood goes through the aorta to the rest of the body.

'''Outline the control of the heartbeat in terms of the pacemaker, nerves, and adrenalin.'''
:*The pacemaker is located in the wall of the right atrium at the Sinoatrial node (SAN). Each time the pacemaker sends out a signal, the heart carries out a contraction or a beat. The heart beats by itself (myogenic). Nerves and hormones can transmit messages to the pacemaker: Sympathetic nerve secretes adrenaline (also known as &quot;epinephrine&quot;) which carries messages from the brain to the pacemaker telling the pacemaker to speed up the beating of the heart. Another nerve tells it to slow it down.

'''Explain the relationship between the structure and function of arteries, capillaries, and veins.'''
:*'''Arteries:''' 
::*Thick wall to withstand high blood pressure.
::*Thick outer layer of longitudinal collagen and elastic fibers.
::*Thick layers of circular elastic and muscle fibers.
::*walls stretch and recoil for the blood to go from the heart to the small intestine.
::*Narrow lumen to help maintain the high pressure..

:*'''Veins'''
::*Thin layers with a few circular elastic and muscle fibers.
::*Thin walls to allow the muscles to squeeze the veins
::*Thin outer layer of longitudinal collagen and elastic fibers.
::*Valves for blood to stay and not flow backwards.
::*Wide lumen to accommodate for the slow flowing of blood

:*'''Capillaries:''' 
::*Has pores to allow plasma and phagocytes to diffuse in or out.
::*Connects the vein and artery
::*Moist and thin for diffusion and has a short diffusion distance.
::*Narrow diameter and large quantity allow for a large exchange of materials through diffusion

'''The blood is composed of plasma, erythrocytes, leukocytes (including phagocytes and lymphocytes) and platelets.  What is the function of each?'''

:*'''Plasma'''
::* Plasma is largely water and makes up about 55% of the total blood volume.
::* This is the main transporting part of blood and takes advantage of the solvent properties of water.
::*Composed of:
:::*Salts (Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, Magnesium, Bicarbonates)
:::*Gases (Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide)
:::*Plasma Proteins (Albumin [buffer], Fibrinogen [clotting])
:::*Nutrients (Glucose, Amino Acids)
:::*Waste (Urea)
:*'''Erythrocytes'''
::*Red Blood Cells
::*Transports oxygen and assists the transport of carbon dioxide.
:*'''Leucocytes''' 
::*White blood cells
::*Phagocytes
:::*White blood cells that protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells.
::*Lymphocytes
:::*White blood cell in the vertebrate immune system.
:::*Large granular lymphocytes include natural killer cells (NK cells). Small lymphocytes consist of T cells and B cells.
:*'''Platelets'''
::*Cells involved in hemostasis, leading to the formation of blood clots.


'''Identify at least 6 things that are transported by the blood.'''
:*Nutrients
:*Oxygen
:*Carbon Dioxide
:*Hormones
:*Antibodies
:*Urea.

====Pathogens and Disease====
----
'''Define pathogen'''
:*[[w:Pathogen|Pathogen]]: an organism or a virus that causes a disease.

'''State one example of a disease caused by members of the following groups: viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, flatworms and roundworms.'''
:*'''Viruses''': [[w:HIV|HIV]]
:*'''Bacteria''': [[w:Cholera|Cholera]]
:*'''Protozoa''': [[w:Malaria|Malaria]]
:*'''Fungi''': [[w:Ringworm|Ringworm]]
:*'''Flatworms:''' pork tapeworm
:*'''Roundworms''': Hookworm

'''List at least six methods by which pathogens are transmitted and gain entry to the body.'''
:# Airborne/inhalation 
:# Direct contact
:# Cuts
:# Ingestion of contaminated food or water 
:# Sexual intercourse
:# Insects
:# Blood transfusions 

'''Describe the cause, transmission and effects of one human bacterial disease.'''
:*'''[[w:Cholera|Cholera]]''': is a waterborne disease caused by the bacterium ''Vibrio cholerae''.
::*'''Cause''': Cholera is caused by the bacteria ''Vibrio cholerae'' which produces potentially lethal secretory diarrhea. 
::*'''Transmission''': Cholera is transmitted through the ingestion of feces contaminated by the bacteria. The contamination usually occurs when sewage gets into drinking water. It's  a huge problem in developing countries, which lack a developed sewage system, and also right after natural disasters such as floods. The recent Tsunami brought fears of Cholera.
::*'''Effect''': Cholera causes a lethal secretory diarrhea and dehydration. Other symptoms may include cramping, fever, and nausea. 

'''Explain why antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses.'''
:*[[w:Antibiotics|Antibiotics]] are drugs which kill or slow the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics block metabolic pathways of bacteria, inhibiting cell wall formation and protein synthesis, resulting in the death of foreign bacteria. However, viruses are not alive and utilize the organisms host cells to replicate, which are not targeted by antibiotics. In order to kill a virus by antibiotics human cell has to be killed as well

'''Explain the cause, transmission, and social implications of AIDS.'''
:*'''[[w:AIDS|AIDS]]''' or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is a collection of symptoms and infections caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
::*'''Transmission''': HIV is transmitted via direct contact of the mucous membrane with a bodily fluid containing HIV such as blood, semen, or breast milk. The transmission could be through anal or penetrative sex, blood transfusion, contaminated needles, or during pregnancy. Most researches think that the virus originated from the Sub-Sahara, but the exact cause is unknown.
::*'''Social Implications''' Fear and apprehension for those associated with the disease, the lifestyle associated with the disease is attacked, trouble getting a job or even getting health insurance- distanced from society

====Defense Against Infectious Diseases====
'''Explain how skin and mucous membranes act as barriers against pathogens.'''
:*The skin and mucous membranes form a barrier that prevents most pathogens from entering the body. The other layers of the skin are tough and form a physical barrier. These dry, keratinised layers of skin discourage pathogen growth.  The skin also produces a thin layer of acid and oils. Mucus contain an enzyme called lysozyme which kills bacteria. 

'''Outline how phagocytic leucocytes ingest pathogens in the blood and in body tissue.'''
:* [[w:Phagocytes|Phagocytes]] are a type of leucocyte which ingest and destroy foreign matter through phagocytosis. 
:# They can easily move through the walls of blood capillaries and the site in which there is an infection.
:# A phagocyte comes in contact with pathogen cells and does not recognize the glycoprotein struture on its cell wall.
:# The pathogen is then ingested through endocytosis. Plasma membrane forms around pathogen.
:# Pathogen vacuole then binds with lysosome containing digestive enzymes which break down the pathogen.
:# Large numbers of phagocytes form pus.

'''State the difference between antigens and antibodies.'''
:*[[w:Antigens|Antigens]] are macromolecules that elicit an immune response by lymphocytes.
:*[[w:Antibodies|Antibodies]] are proteins secreted by plasma cells that bind to a particular antigen and mark it for elimination.
'''Explain antibody production.'''
:* Antibodies are made by lymphocytes, which recognize an enormous number of antigens, but each individual cell recognizes only one type of antigen. Each lymphocyte puts some of the antibody that it makes into its cell surface with the antigen-combining site projecting outwards. When a pathogen enters the body, its antigens bind to the antibodies in the cell surface of one type of lymphocyte. The selected lymphocyte proliferates to give rise to a clone of identical cells bearing receptors for the selecting antigen. Some of the cells develop into short-lived plasma cells that secrete antibody specific for the antigen. Others develop into long-lived memory cells that can respond rapidly upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen.

'''Outline the effects of HIV on the immune system.'''
:* HIV attacks T-cells which are part of the immune system that are important for the formation of Beta lymphocytes. The virus enters the T-Cells and replicates there. As reproduction increases, the cell breaks up and the virus RNA is spread to other T-cells.  The virus keeps infecting and killing other T-cells, paralyzing the immune system. This enables other organisms usually kept under control by the immune system to be able to affect the body.

'''Discuss the cause, transmission and social impacts of AIDS'''
:*The cause of AIDS is that the HIV retro-virus develops further enough to change into AIDS. 
:*HIV doesn’t survive outside of the body and can’t easily pass through the skin. Transmission involves the transfer of body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected one.
:# Through small cuts or tears in the vagina, penis, mouth or intestine during vaginal, anal or oral sex.
:# In traces of blood on a hypodermic needle that is shared by intravenous drug abusers.
:# Across the placenta from a mother to a baby, or through cuts during childbirth or in milk during breast feeding.
:# In transfused blood or with blood products such as Factor VIII used to treat haemophiliacs.
Social implications
:* Friends and families suffer grief.
:* Families become poorer if the individual with AIDS was the wage earner and is refused life insurance.
:* Individuals infected with HIV may become stigmatized and not find partners, housing or employment.
:* Sexual activity in a population may be reduced because of the fear of AIDS.

====Gas Exchange====
----
'''State the difference between ventilation, gas exchange and cell respiration.'''
:*'''Ventilation''': Is the process of inhaling and exhaling, with oxygen entering the alveoli (large surface area).
:*'''Gas exchange''': Process of exchanging one gas for the other between the alveoli and capillaries. (Carbon dioxide for oxygen).
:*'''Cell Respiration''': The chemical process occurring in the mitochondria where energy is released as ATP.

'''Explain the necessity for a ventilation system.'''
:* A ventilation system is needed in order to obtain oxygen for living organisms and to get rid of carbon dioxide. Surface diffusion utilized by many smaller organisms is not sufficient in supplying the oxygen needs of the body.  It is also needed to maintain a concentration gradient in the alveoli.

'''List the features of the alveoli that adapt them to gas exchange.'''
:# Cells secrete fluid making the inner surface moist.
:# Increase in surface area.
:# Single layer of cells allowing for short diffusion distance
:# Dense network of capillaries near the surface.

'''Draw a diagram of the ventilation system including trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs.'''
[http://www.ibguides.com/images/biology/respiratory-system.gif Diagram of ventilation system]

'''Explain the mechanism of ventilation in human lungs, including the action of the internal and external intercostals muscles, the diaphragm, and the abdominal muscles.'''
:* (You can try this in an exam room if you can't remember.)
::* When we inhale, the diaphragm moves down and becomes flat because abdominal muscles relax(allowing for more air). The volume of the thorax increases, air flows into the lungs. External intercostal muscles contract. 
::* When we exhale, abdominal muscles contract and the diaphragm becomes dome-shaped, moving up. The volume of the thorax decreases and intercostal muscles contract causing pressure to increase. Air flows out to equalize pressure gradient.

====Homeostasis and Excretion====
----
'''State that homeostasis involves maintaining the internal environment at a constant level or between narrow limits, including blood pH, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, blood glucose, body temperature and water balance.'''
:*Homeostasis involves maintaining the internal environment at a constant level between narrow limits. This includes blood pH, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, blood glucose, body temperature and water balance.

'''Explain that homeostasis involves monitoring levels of variables and correcting changes in levels by negative feedback mechanisms.'''
:* Homeostasis involves maintaining the body in a environment between narrow limits by negative feedback mechanisms. Negative feedbacks contain a detector which measures the value of a feature to be controlled.  This sends information to an effector, which then takes action. 

'''State that the nervous and the endocrine systems are both involved in homeostasis.'''
:*The [[w:endocrine|endocrine]] systems and [[w:nervous system|nervous system]] are both involved in homeostasis.

'''State that the nervous systems consists of central nervous system and peripheral nerves and is composed of special cells called neurons that can carry electrical impulses rapidly.'''
:*The nervous systems consists of central nervous system and peripheral nerves and is composed of special cells called neurons that can carry electrical impulses rapidly.

'''Describe the control of body temperature including the transfer of heat in blood, the role of sweat glands, and skin arterioles, and shivering.'''
:* 
1) Blood near the skin exchanges heat with the environment to preserve 37°C temperature.

2) Vasoconstriction can decrease blood flow to the skin, preserving heat in cold weather. vasodilation will cause an increase of blood flow close to the skin, which will cool your body.

3) Sweating can cool the body as moisture on skin evaporates.

4) Shivering produces muscle heat.


'''State that the Endocrine systems consists of glands which release hormones that are transported in blood.'''
:* 
The Endocrine systems consists of glands which release hormones that are transported in blood.'

'''Explain the control of blood glucose concentration, including the role of glucagons, insulin, Alpha and Beta cells in the pancreatic islets.'''
1) Glucagons - released by Alpha cells in the pancreatic islets when blood sugar is low, it transforms stored glycogen into glucose that enters the blood stream.
2) Insulin - released by Beta cells in the pancreatic islets when blood sugar is high, it transforms glucose in blood to stored glycogen .

'''Define excretion.'''
:* [[w:Excretion|Excretion]] is the process of eliminating from an organism waste products of metabolism and other products which are of no use. 

'''Outline the role of the kidney in excretion and the maintenance of water balance.'''
:* The human body has two kidneys located in the back of the abdominal cavity. Each kidney is connected to the urinary bladder by the ureter which dumps toxins filtered by the kidneys into it, along with excess water. The renal artery will supply the kidney with urea and unwanted materials, which it also dumps in the bladder, and sends of the correct amounts of urea, salts, and water through the renal vein. Without the kidney the excess materials would not be able to be filtered out and may cause harm to the body.

====Reproduction====
----
'''Draw diagrams of the adult male and female reproductive systems.''' female:[http://www.mydr.com.au/files/images/categories/anatom/femalereproductiveorgans.jpg]
male: [http://www.web-books.com/eLibrary/Medicine/Physiology/Reproductive/repdt_male.jpg]

'''Explain the role of hormones in regulating the changes of puberty (testosterone, estrogen) in boys and girls, and in the menstrual cycle (FSH, LH) estrogen and progesterone.'''

From birth to the age of ten, testosterone level is very low. It increases sharply after that and begins puberty in males. This is when sperm production takes place. Testosterone stays at high levels until the age of 40-50, then it gradually decreases. It is also responsible for voice change, hair growth in certain parts of the body, and the building of muscles. Estrogen leads to the production of eggs, which leads to the menstrual cycle. In the menstrual cycle, FSH secreted by pituitary gland increases, this is responsible for the growth of an oocyte (an immature egg) and it's follicle. Two weeks after the start of menstruation, ovulation occurs due to a sudden and sharp increase in LH from the pituitary gland. It also causes the empty follicle to develop into the yellow body (corpus luteum) which starts releasing the hormone progesterone. This is responsible for maintaining and thickening the endometrium(wall of the uterus) in preparation for implantation. 

'''Reasons for the levels of FSH and LH rising at the end of the reproductive phase.'''

Estrogen and progesterone levels remain low as no follicles produce estrogen at the end of the reproductive phase. At this stage, this leads for FSH and LH production to not be inhibited. The high levels of FSH and LH do not cause hyper-ovulation in women because the ovary becomes insensitive to FSH and the primary follicles have all degenerated or have all been used.


'''Reasons for expecting the number of births of male and female babies to be equal.'''

Gender is determined by sex chromosomes. The chromosomes in females are XX and those in males are XY. Therefore, eggs carry an X chromosome, and a sperm carries either an X or a Y chromosome, as they separate during the first division of meiosis in males. Half of the sperm carry X chromosome and half carry a Y chromosome, therefore the chances that the sperm, which fertilizes the egg, is carrying an X chromosome as opposed to a Y chromosome are the same.


'''List the secondary sexual characteristics of both sexes.'''

Secondary sexual characteristics in males are the growth of pubic and armpit hair, growth of the larynx causing a deepening in voice, and building of muscles. In females, it is the growth of pubic hair, vagina, breasts, pelvis, fat deposits in thighs and buttocks, secretion of fluids in vagina, and the beginning of the menstrual cycle. 

'''Explain how levels of other hormones control the FSH level during pregnancy.'''

Another hormone, HCG, stimulates the maintenance of the corpus luteum and as a result, the production of progesterone.  The levels of progesterone  rise during pregnancy and inhibit FSH production.

'''Discuss how many embryos fertility centers should be allowed to transfer.'''

Reducing the amount of embryos allowed to be transferred reduces the chance of having multiple births, which is beneficial as these types of births increase health risks for both the mother and the child, or children.  Restricting the number of embryos allowed for transfer to two would prevent almost all multiple, especially triplet, births from occurring.  In older mothers, however, there is a lesser risk of multiple births; therefore, more embryos could be transferred to them.



'''State the differences between copulation and fertilization.'''

Copulation is the physical contact between the male and female reproductive structures that is needed for the sperms to move from the male to the female but does not necessarily result in fertilization due to the use of a contraceptive or being infertile. Fertilization is the fusion of the male and female nuclei to produce the zygote. 

'''Describe the early embryo development up to the implantation of the blastocyst.'''

Fertilization occurs, resulting in mitotic divisions or cleavage divisions which lead to the formation of a ball of cells called the morula. The morula reaches the uterus about 4 days after fertilization. Slightly unequal divisions continue until the 7th day, causing a fluid filled spaced in the middle of the morula to form. This is the blastocyst. The outer cells of the blastocyst are called trophoblast and will imbed itself in the endometrium.

'''State that the fetus is supported and protected by the amniotic sac and amniotic fluid.'''

The fetus is supported and protected by the amniotic sac and amniotic fluid.

'''State that materials are exchanged between the maternal and fetal blood in the placenta.'''

Materials are exchanged between the maternal and fetal blood in the placenta.  

'''Outline the process of birth and its hormonal control, including progesterone and oxytocin.'''

Labor, delivery, and afterbirth mark the three stages of birth. Labor is marked by contractions of the uterus, it is stimulated by a hormone called oxytocin, which is released as levels of progesterone decrease by the pituitary gland. Oxytocin causes dilation of the cervix. The most powerful contractions are during the next stage, delivery. Placenta, along with other fluids and blood come out after the baby. This placenta that comes out marks the afterbirth. Labor and delivery are controlled by the actions of oxytocin, progesterone, and estrogen. 

'''Describe four methods of family planning and contraception. [Chemical, mechanical and behavioral examples should be mentioned].'''

:* Chemical - Contraceptive pills prevent ovulation by inhibiting FSH and LH. 

:* Mechanical - The use of a male condom prevents the release of sperm into vagina. Another method is intrauterine device (IUD) which prevents fertilization or implantation. There is sterilization. In this, the female gets a tube legation where the oviducts are tied so the sperm can't reach the egg, or the male gets a vasectomy where the sperm ducts are cut and prevents the release of sperm. 

:* Behavioral - Abstinence has a 100% success rate of preventing pregnancy.  Timing copulation with a woman's ovulation cycle is also effective at preventing pregnancy.


'''Discuss the ethical issues of family planning and contraception.'''

Some people believe it is unethical to abort a baby, that is to kill a fetus that was formed after fertilization. Other people think it is the right of the woman carrying the fetus to decide what to do with it. 

Ethical considerations on the use of contraceptives may include: considerations about overpopulation, considerations about the future of the child(ren), religious considerations. Some religions teach that it is wrong to interfere with natural processes such as reproduction.

'''Outline the technique of amniocentesis.'''

Amniocentesis is where some amniotic fluid from the amniotic sac is drawn by a syringe through the abdomen of the mother. The cells are then grown on a tissue culture to be studied to create a karyotype and are then studied to find out if there are any abnormalties. 

'''Outline the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF)'''

:* 1. Various drugs are injected one a day for three weeks to stop the menstral cycle.
:* 2. Large doses of FSH are injected to stimulate ovaries to develop many follicles.
:* 3. HCG hormone is injected 36 hrs. before cell collection, causing the eggs to mature and loosen.
:* 4. Eggs are removed from the ovaries of a woman by suction through the vagina and are placed in a glass dish. The eggs are then cleaned to remove blood and other unwanted material. The egg is then incubated.
:* 5. A male provides sperm which is collected by a doctor. 
:* 6. The healthiest sperm are selected and mixed with the egg, to force fertilization.  
:* 7. Two or three eggs are selected and implanted in the uterus through the vagina.
:* 8. After a few weeks, a pregnancy test is administered.
:* 9. Later in the pregnancy, a scan is conducted to find a heartbeat.

'''Discuss the ethical issues of IVF.'''

:* For IVF - Childless and infertile couples are provided a means to have children. Suffering due to a genetic disease of infertility is reduced.

:* Against IVF - There is a high probability that children conceived using IVF from infertile parents would inherit this genetic disease, going against natural selection.  Spare embryos are killed or donated to stem cell research.  Once fertilized embryos have been implanted in the uterus, the parents have the option of choosing which eggs shall be removed, essentially allowing humans the right to define life and death.  Those who do not remove extra eggs from the uterus have multiple births, increasing the risk of health problems for the fetus.

      <comment>1. Pages out of date as it refer to the 2003 syllabus now repalced by the 2009. The suggestions that Biology is memorised does not address the actual learning style required to understand Biology</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{International Baccalaureate}}

'''IB Biology''' refers to the [http://www.gunthersclass.com/ibguide.pdf International Baccalaureate (IB) group 4 experimental science Biology].

The following is (or will hopefully eventually be) an explanation of the entire IB Biology Syllabus: For first examinations in 2003. Please nte that this is now replaced by the 2009 examinations and the content of the pages are out of date. The syllabus has had significant revisions.

The Syllabus provided by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) consists of the titles displayed in '''bold'''. The explanations written in plain text below these titles have been added as supplementation and/or when further clarification is required. Basically, it takes away the need to research the &quot;answers&quot; to the syllabus and gives everyone a study-guide which can be accessed from anywhere, whenever needed. The following only covers the core material, all that is required for standard level Biology, and a few of the available HL/SL options. 

'''Some Advice''': Some may suggest that a large part of Biology is memorization which is a common mistake when studying Biology. The real difference is that between the Biological sciences (based on concepts) and those of the physical sciences (based on laws and theories). Thiis affects the style of learning required to master the Biologicla sciences. Go through each part individually, don't try to digest everything at once. If you manage to go through each part individually over a long period of time, ''you will ace the exam''. Good luck!

[[Image:Mojito.jpg|right|thumb|Mojito]]
The '''Mojito''' is a traditional Cuban drink, known to Americans as a favorite of [[w:Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mojito&quot;&gt;[http://www.tasteofcuba.com/mojito.html Cuban Mojito recipe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==

* 2 oz. (60 mL) Cuban white rum
* 1 lime (or 2 ounces (60 mL) lime juice)
* 1 tsp powdered sugar
* 4 mint leaves
* Club soda

==Garnishes==

* Mint sprig

==Glass==

* Collins Glass

==Instructions==

# Muddle mint leaves and sugar
# Fill with ice, then add rum and lime juice
# Stir, then add a splash of club soda
# Garnish with mint sprig

==Variations==

* Ernest Hemingway requested Mojitos without sugar.  Of course, this suggests that less lime juice be used.
* Sometimes, the juiced lime is used as an additional garnish.
* Bacardi heavily promotes their own proprietary variant.
* Due to the United States embargo against Cuba, Cuban rum cannot (legally) be purchased in the United States; American bars use other light rums.
* Vodka Revolution (a bar chain in England) make their mojitos by: crushing 3 tsp Demerara sugar,8-10 fresh mint leaves, torn up  and 8 sections of a lime cut into 1cm cubes, together in the base of a glass. Then adding half the ice, pouring in 25ml Havana Club Rum, 25 ml Zubrowka Vodka and 50ml apple juice. Shake, add the rest of the ice and mint sprig to garnish.
==Related Drinks==

* The virgin mojito may be referred to as a fauxjito.  Less commonly, the term fauxjito may refer to house drinks that are similar to a mojito in some way or another.  

* The mojito is a descendant of the Draquecito, named after Sir Francis Drake and said to be his favorite drink before pirate battles.  That drink is made with cachaça rather than rum, and uses water instead of ice and soda, neither of which would have been available to Drake on the high seas.

The '''Mai Tai''' is perhaps the canonical Tiki cocktail and there are innumerable recipes for it.  Here are a number of them:

== Authentic Trader Vic's Mai Tais ==
Source:
* Provided by Trader Vic's to [http://www.kevdo.com/maitai/recipes.html The Search for the Ultimate Mai Tai]

=== The Original from 1944 ===
Ingredients:
* 2 oz of 17-year old J. Wray &amp; Nephew Rum over shaved ice
* Add juice from one fresh lime
* 1/2 oz Holland DeKuyper Orange Curaçao
* 1/4 oz Trader Vic's Rock Candy Syrup
* 1/2 oz French Garnier [[wikipedia:Orgeat|Orgeat]] Syrup

Method:
* Shake vigorously.
* Add a sprig of fresh mint

=== The &quot;Old Way&quot; from 1997 ===
Ingredients:
* 1 oz (3&amp;nbsp;cl) Fine Jamaican Rum (15 or 8 year old)
* 1 oz Martinique Rum (St. James)
* 1 oz Dark Jamaican rum (15 or 8 year old)
* 1 oz Martinique Amber rum (St. James)

Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into an old fashioned glass over crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and mint, and serve with a straw.

==Recipe #4==
'''Don the Beachcomber Mai Tai'''

This version is much closer to what Don the Beachcomber served in his restaurants.  It can be garnished with various fruits, as in the above recipe.  Falernum is a spice and lime-based Caribbean liqueur/syrup with a very different taste from the Orgeat syrup used in the Maitai #1.

Ingredients
* 2 oz (or 1/4 cup) water
* 3/4 oz or 1-1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
* 1 oz or 2 tablespoons fresh grapefruit juice
* 1 oz or 2 tablespoons sugar syrup
* 1 oz or 2 tablespoons dark rum
* 1-1/2 oz or 3 tablespoons golden rum
* 1/2 oz or 1 tablespoon Cointreau or triple Sec
* 1/4 oz or 1/2 tablespoon Falernum liqueur/syrup
* 2 dashes or scant 1/2 teaspoon Angostura bitters
* 1 dash or scant 1/4 teaspoon Pernod or other anisette-flavored pastis 

Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into a tall [[Bartending/Glassware#Highball|highball glass]] filled with crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw.

==Recipe #5==
'''Pineapple Variation Mai Tai'''

* 2 oz orange juice
* 2 oz pineapple juice
* 1 oz Rose's lime juice
* 1 oz dark rum
* 1 oz light rum
* 1/2 oz triple sec
* 1/2 oz grenadine

==Recipe #6==
Fill a collins glass with ice. Add:
*¾ oz. Light Rum&lt;br&gt;
*¾ oz. Dark Rum&lt;br&gt;
*½ oz. Amaretto&lt;br&gt;
*½ oz. Triple Sec&lt;br&gt;

Fill with:
*½ Orange Juice&lt;br&gt;
*½ Pineapple Juice&lt;br&gt;

Float ½ oz. of Grenadine on top

==Recipe #7==
'''O'Sheas Famous Mai Tai'''

Ingredients
* 3 Ounces Raspberry or Regular Vodka
* 3 Oz. Of Cranberry Juice
* 3 Oz. of Orange Juice
* 3 Oz. of Pineapple Juice
* 3 Oz. of All Natural 7-Up

Instructions
# Pour vodka over shaved ice
# Add juices, stir with vodka in cocktail shaker
# Strain or leave with ice.

==Recipe #8==
'''Aussie Beachcomber'''

Ingredients:
* 2 Shots - Good Quality Spiced Rum
* 1 Shot - Cointreau
* 1 Shot - Orgeat Syrup
* Splash - Agave Syrup
* 1/2 Lime - Juice
* 2-3 Sprigs Mint
* Mulled Pineapple (Optional)

Glass: Low Ball Glass

Method:&lt;br /&gt;
Pre-cool the glass with ice. Add all the ingredients into a cocktail shaker including the mint (mint must bruise with ice). Shake vigorously and pour into the glass over ice.

==Recipe #9==
'''Samurai Steve's Iowa Mai Tai'''

* 1 oz white rum (Paramount or better)
* 1 oz spiced rum (Captain Morgan or better)
* 1 oz orange rum (Bacardi O or better)
* 1 oz Malibu rum
* 1 oz Sour mix
* 1/2 oz Grenadine
* 4 oz Pineapple Juice
* 2 oz Orange Juice
* 1 Glass with Ice
* 1 Swirly straw or tiny umbrella

Directions:
# Mix rums into glass with ice
# Add Pineapple and Orange juices
# Top with Sour Mix and Grenadine
# Add swirly straw or tiny umbrella

==Recipe #10==
'''Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas Recipe'''

Very close to the original recipe.

Ingredients
* 1 1/4 oz Appleton Jamaican rum
* 1 1/4 oz Mount Gay Eclipse rum
* 1/2 oz orange curacao
* juice of 1 1/2 fresh lime
* 1/2 oz orgeat syrup (almond syrup)
* 1/2 oz rock candy syrup (2 parts sugar, 1 part water, boil until syrup)
* Splash of Grenadine to achieve appropriate color.
 
In an ice filled mixing glass add above ingredients minus the appleton: shake until well-blended, strain into an ice filled 16oz glass or cup and float the appleton on top. Garnish with spent lime shell, mint spring and pineapple spear.

==Recipe #11==
'''Fuji &amp; Jade Garden (State College, PA - 2010) Recipe'''

A slight tweak on the original recipe.  The parenthetical ingredients hint at how this version of the Mai Tai evolved.

Ingredients
* 3/4 oz Cruzan Estate Light rum
* 3/4 oz Cruan Guava rum
* 1/2 oz Trader Vic's Macadamia liqueur (or 3/4 oz Amaretto)
* 1/2 oz DeKuyper triple sec (or Cointreau)
* 1/2 oz Nellie &amp; Joe's lime juice (or fresh)
* 1/2 oz Velvet Falernum
* 3/4 oz Zaya 12-yr Trinidad rum [floater]
 
Glass:  12-oz Rocks Glass (aka Double Old-fashioned glass) 

Method:&lt;br /&gt;
In an ice-filled mixing glass add the first six of the above ingredients.  Shake until well-blended, then pour into a 12oz rocks glass.  Top with Zaya 12-yr rum as a floater.  Garnish with fresh mint, orange slice and/or a pineapple spear.

== Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, does not have same blocks ==

On [[WB:RFA]] you wrote: ''The problem is that this school is on a huge shared network that regulaly gets blocked from Wikipedia because of vandals from other schools. I need to be able to unblock the network so that my (lovely, well behaved) pupils can edit (and reblock when we have finished if necessary).''

I wonder if this is causing confusion? Wikibooks is a '''sister project''' of Wikipedia. Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, in the same way that Wikibooks is not [[Wikiquote:Main Page|Wikiquote]]. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia. The two projects also have separate sets of administrators, and separate lists of blocked users and IPs. If a Wikipedia administrator blocks your network from editing the Wikipedia encyclopedia, then access to Wikibooks is not affected. Users of your network can continue to edit Wikibooks, even when they are blocked from Wikipedia. I sometimes use an IP address which is blocked at Wikipedia, but not at Wikibooks. When I use that IP, I can edit Wikibooks, but not Wikipedia.

So, in short, if your &quot;huge shared network&quot; becomes &quot;blocked from Wikipedia&quot;, you do not need to unblock it on Wikibooks. This is unless someone blocks it from Wikibooks also.

You might also want to read [[MetaWikipedia:Names|Names on MetaWikipedia]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:10, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

LOL yeah I know all that already, I was  involved at the very start of wikibooks. I was IIRC the third administrator on wikibooks. I figured that if wikipedia regulaly blocks the whole school network than so most likely will wikibooks. [[User:Theresa Knott|Theresa Knott]] 19:54, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Sysop rights ==

I contacted the developers about your problem. See [[w:User_talk:Theresa_knott#wikibooks_identity_confirmation]].

Anyway, I'm going to be online at 6 am UTC (10 hours from now) and if the issue won't get resolved, I would just grant you sysop rights. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:25, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A user interface is the part of your program that is visible to a human user. It can be as simple as a [[Guide to Windows commands|command line]] or as sophisticated as an immersive virtual reality simulator (see [http://www.ibdof.com/IBDOF-book-detailedview.php?book_id=5023 Death Dream by Ben Bova]). However, in the context of Visual Basic it usually means what is commonly referred to as a Graphical User Interface or GUI which generally consists of one or more Forms that contain text boxes, labels, buttons, picture boxes, etc.

A more common example of a GUI would be a standard EXE([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms Windows Forms]).

The '''Black and Tan''' is, appropriately, a mixture of black- and tan-colored beers.

== Ingredients ==

* 1/2 pint Guinness Stout
* 1/2 pint Bass Ale&lt;ref&gt;Note:For a 'Half and Half' Harp's lager can be used&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;references/&gt; 

== Glass ==

* [[Bartending/Glassware#Other_Pints.2FHalves|Pint]]

== Instructions ==

Layer stout over ale

== Notes ==

* The Stout and Pale Ale are not immiscible in the same sense as oil and water.  Most layered drinks depend on the use of ingredients with different specific gravities, but in this case both beers have approximately the same specific gravity; the high [[w:viscosity|viscosity]] of the stout is the only reason that it can be layered over the ale.  In practice, this means that creating a layered Black and Tan requires a little more finesse than, say, making a Brain Hemorrhage shooter.  Guinness suggests filling the glass halfway with your &quot;tan,&quot; tilting it at a 45 degree angle, and slowly adding the stout.  Of course, the normal spoon-layering technique can be used as well.  Finally, know that the layering has more to do with flair bartending than with the drink itself, and an unlayered Black and Tan is perfectly acceptable in many parts of the world.

* There are a few bottled Black and Tans on the market, such as The Mississippi Brewing Company's Mississippi Mud Black and Tan and Yuengling's Black and Tan.

* The term &quot;Black and Tan&quot; should be used with caution in Ireland, as it can refer to a unionist [[w:Black and Tans|paramilitary group]] and as such can offend Irish nationalists.  See &quot;Half and Half&quot; below.

== Related Cocktails ==

* The Half and Half, which replaces the Bass with Harp Lager.  In a more general sense, the terms &quot;Half and Half&quot; and &quot;Black and Tan&quot; are often used interchangeably, so it is probably best to verify what the customer wants in his drink.

The '''Old Fashioned''' cocktail is a pre-Prohibition American cocktail.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 shot Rye
* Half-slice of orange
* 1 tsp Sugar (or simple syrup)
* Angostura bitters

== Garnishes ==

* Maraschino Cherry
* Orange

== Glass == 

* Old-Fashioned Glass

== Instructions ==

# Place sugar in glass; add water (~1 tsp) to dissolve
# Muddle in bitters and orange slice
# Fill with ice, add whiskey
# Garnish with cherry

== Variations ==

* The amount of whiskey may be increased
* The Brandy Old Fashioned is popular in some areas, and a rum analogue can be made as well
* This drink is also often served in a highball glass instead of its namesake old-fashioned glass


==Recipe for San Diego Old Fashioned==
This recipe was contributed by Big V, who was clued in to Old Fashioned cocktails by her grandpa Sid.  In Sid's words, &quot;An Old Fashioned is the best drink in the world.  It's like an alcoholic lemonade&quot;.
*2 oz bourbon (try to find one with an intense toffee finish)
*2 maraschino cherries
*The juice of 2 maraschino cherries
*1/4 lime
*1/2 lemon
*1/2 orange
*2 oz drinking water
*2 oz Perrier
*4 ice cubes
*12 oz Mason jar

#Muddle cherries in cherry juice in the bottom of Mason jar
#Squeeze in the juices of all citrus fruits
#Add drinking water
#Add Perrier
#Add ice cubes
#Add bourbon
#Stir

[[Image:Mint_Julep.jpg|right|200px]]
The '''Mint Julep''' is a mixed alcoholic drink, or cocktail originating in the Southern United States. The word 'julep' is derived from the Persian 'julab' meaning rose water. There are a number of ways of making a mint julep.  All are served over crushed ice in a julep glass with a narrow cocktail straw.  It is correct to use the straw when drinking this cocktail.

==Mint Julep==
===Ingredients===
*4 oz bourbon whiskey
*4-6 sprigs of mint
*1 tsp sugar

===Garnish===
Mint Leaves
===Glass===
Tall glass or Julep cup
===Procedure===
#Crush the sugar with the sprigs of mint in the bottom of the glass.  
#Fill the glass with crushed ice and then add the bourbon.  Feel free to add more bourbon to fill the glass, if necessary.  
#Garnish with remaining mint.  
#Insert a straw, cutting it to no more than 2 inches (5 cm) above the rim of the glass (allows one to smell the julep while drinking).  
#Serve.
==Mint Julep #2==

===Ingredients===
*1 tbs sugar syrup
*4-6 sprigs of mint
*4 oz bourbon whiskey

===Procedure===
#To make the sugar syrup, simply heat equal parts sugar and water, then cool.  
#Add syrup and mint to a glass of crushed ice.  
#Fill the glass with bourbon and serve.  

Some recipes call for making a &quot;mint bourbon&quot; by soaking mint in the bourbon for days before serving.  Other recipes call for steeping the mint in the hot water for 5 minutes, then removing it before adding the sugar to make the syrup.

The '''boilermaker''' consists of a shot of whiskey and a glass of beer.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 pint American Pilsner
* 1 shot Tennessee Whiskey (or Bourbon)

== Glass ==
[[Image:Pint Glass (Pub).svg|left|25px|]]
* [[Bartending/Glassware#Pint|Beer glass]]
[[Image:Shot Glass (Standard).svg|left|25px|]]
&lt;br&gt;
* [[Bartending/Glassware#Shot|Shot glass]]
&lt;br&gt;
== Instructions ==

Generally, the shot of whiskey and beer are served separately to the customer.  There is more than one way to consume this drink; one can:

* Shoot the whiskey and then drink the beer
* Pour the whiskey in the beer
* Take the whiskey as a &quot;depth shot,&quot; that is, drop the shot glass into the beer, causing the beer to foam up, and then chug the result.  Note that this is not exactly the safest procedure, especially after a few drinks; if the shot glass breaks when dropped, it may go unnoticed until the glass shards hit the throat.

== Related Drinks ==

* [[../Irish Car Bomb|The Irish Car Bomb]], where the shot consists of a 2:1 mixture of Irish whiskey and Irish cream
* The Dog's Nose, with gin
* The Beer Buster, with vodka and a couple dashes of tabasco

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since we are coming around to the Kentucky Derby 2006, I decided that we needed some Julep recipes.  Enjoy.
[[User:Dlc3007|Dlc3007]] 13:09, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Quantity/type of mint ==

The directions call for &quot;5-6 sprigs of mint&quot; for every 3oz of bourbon.  I have been making mint juleps frequently for a few years, and I would say that this recipe calls for a lot of mint.  I have an English mint plant (a variety of spearmint), and 5-6 _leaves_ for every two or three shots of bourbon is enough to make a very minty julep.  Can anyone else comment on mint quantities?  I have used peppermint, as well as some wild mint (unsure of the variety) in the past, and the results were the same.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">1)Using the basic KML document examples from the chapter as a guide, creat your own version of each document.  You will need to use Google Earth to find the exact coordinates for your locations.

2)Practice copy and pasting code into a text editor, then changing the file name to a .kml extension so it opens up correctly in Google Earth when you open the file.

3)Experiment with Google Earth's interface.  Practice right clicking on features and saving the code so you can view it.  Take your own virtual vacation!

'''Microwaving''' is cooking food in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]]. It is often quicker and more convenient than equivalent methods such as [[cookbook:boiling|boiling]] or [[cookbook:baking|baking]]. Many [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], for example, can be microwaved instead of boiled or [[cookbook:steaming|steamed]].

As with other cooking instruments some care must be taken and food should be checked regularly if it is microwaved for a long period. [[cookbook:Aluminium foil|Aluminium foil]] and other metal items should never be put in a microwave. Always use a container labelled &quot;microwave safe&quot; to avoid toxins in foods.

Items are often extremely hot after being microwaved, so take care when removing them.</text>

A '''social science''' is a study of society and the way individuals interact within it.

'''Economics''' is a social science, and is the study of how society employs finite resources in order to satisfy infinite wants.

'''Microeconomics''' is the study of individual economic units such as households and firms.

'''Macroeconomics''' is the study of the economy as a whole.

'''Growth''' is an increase in real GDP.

'''GDP/National Income''' is the value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period.

'''Potential output''' is the highest possible level of output that can be sustained over the long term. 

'''Development''' is an increase in the standards of living. It is a qualitative measure, taking into account factors like education and health.

'''Positive statements''' are based on facts or evidence so can be proven or disproved using a scientific approach.

'''Normative statements''' are opinion based and biased. They cannot be proven or disproved.

'''Sustainable development''' is development that meets the needs of today without compromising the needs of tomorrow.

'''Ceteris paribus''' is Latin for all other things being equal.

'''Scarcity''' is the result of no resources being infinite, whereas the want of them is.

'''Factors of production''' include land, labour, capital and enterprise. These are the resources necessary to create goods and services in an economy.

'''Land''' is the gift of nature, everything on, under, above or in the land/sea. It is in return for rent.

'''Labour''' is the human component of the production of a good. It is in return for wages.

'''Capital''' is any man made assistance to capital. It is in return for interest.

'''Utility''' is the satisfaction gained from the consumption of a product.

'''Opportunity cost''' is the cost of the next best alternative forgone.

A '''free good''' is one which is not scarce, has no opportunity cost and therefore no price.

An '''economic good''' is one which is scarce and therefore has an opportunity cost and price.

A '''free market''' is one in which resource allocation is determined by market forces (demand and supply). Market forces decide the answers to the three economic questions, what, how and for whom to produce.

A '''centrally planned/command''' economy is one in which resource allocation is determined by a central authority/government agent. The authority decides the answers to the three economic questions.

A '''transitional economy''' is one in transition between a command and free market system.

'''Services''' are intangible products.

A '''market''' is somewhere where goods and services are bought and sold.

A '''Production Possibility Curve/Frontier (PPF/PPC)''' is used to show all the possible combinations of two goods/services that can be produced within an economy. The curve itself is the potential output while anything inside is attainable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''' Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act, [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=44-10-1 O.C.G.A. §§ 44-10-1 to 8]''' 

==General Description==
The Act creates the standards for the use of conservation easements for the purpose of protecting forest, open-spaces, and agricultural land.  A conservation easement is a restriction on a piece of land that prevents development and maintains the land in its current state.  These provisions do not directly relate to water resources, but the conservation measures may help to maintain natural waterways and water quality.

==Creation and recordation==
A conservation easement is created, transferred, and recorded in the same way as other easements.  The easement is recorded in the county Superior Court.

==Practical Information==
A conservation easement is a way to protect a piece of green space into the future.  Placing a conservation easement on a piece of property can result in tax advantages for the land owner.  These easements are often held and managed by community nonprofit groups such as land trusts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Martini''', more so than any other drink, embodies the class and style of the cocktail in the popular imagination.

== Ingredients ==

* 3 oz. (5.5 cl) Gin
* 1/2 oz. (1.5 cl) Dry (white/blanc) vermouth (preferably Noilly Prat, alternately Martini &amp; Rossi)

== Garnishes ==
Either:
* Cocktail olive, queen size at minimum. Or olive juice could be added to make it a 'dirty martini'; or,
* A twist of lemon peel (including the pith);

== Glass ==
[[Image:Cocktail Glass (Martini).svg|thumb|left|40px|]]
* [[Bartending/Glassware#Martini|Cocktail Glass]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
== Instructions ==

# Fill a martini glass with ice and water, set aside.
# Fill the glass half of a two-piece cocktail shaker to the top with ice, add 1 oz. dry vermouth.
# Fill the shaker again with ice, add 2 oz. gin, stir gently.
# Discard ice and water in the martini glass.
# Strain martini into glass.
# Garnish with ''one'' olive (two makes it a Franklin).

== Variations ==

* Adjust the gin/vermouth ratio for a drier martini.  The trend in the latter part of the 20th century was to go &quot;ultra-dry&quot; by limiting the amount of vermouth to smaller and smaller quantities.  However, this limits the drink to being essentially a cocktail glass of cold gin.  The additional herbal and tempering qualities of vermouth are necessary for the proper flavor profile.  A 6:1 gin to vermouth ratio is considered &quot;ideal&quot; though your taste may vary.
* Replacing the green olive with a pickled cocktail onion turns the Martini into a Gibson Cocktail.
* More extreme variants introduce triple sec and/or bitters, but the &quot;classic&quot; recipe stands as merely gin and vermouth.
* If you want to be James Bond, the classic Fleming recipe involves an ounce and a half of vodka, an identical portion of gin, and a half-ounce of Lillet Blanc, shaken over ice and served with a twist of lemon.
* Stuffed olives go well with a martini.  The &quot;Spanish&quot; olive, green stuffed with pimento, is the default.  However, those olives stuffed with a garlic clove or bleu cheese are popular as well.
* Adding a splash of the olive brine to the drink makes it a &quot;Dirty Martini.&quot;  Some prefer the additional element of saltiness that this adds.
* A Churchill martini involves shaking 6 parts of gin, straining into a cocktail glass, looking at the bottle of vermouth, and serving with an olive garnish.

== Related Cocktails ==

* The Martini is a member of a family of cocktails sometimes referred to as the French-Italian cocktails.  Other examples are the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Manhattan|Manhattan]], [[Bartending/Cocktails/Rob Roy|Rob Roy]], and [[Bartending/Cocktails/Harvard|Harvard Cocktail]].

==External Links==

== Notes ==

* The best gins for a Martini are those with the most complex botanicals -- Bombay Dry, Boodles, Junipero, for example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Call/Vote for Reorganization and Various Fixes ==

The reorganization issue I have is that &quot;Methods of Proof&quot; (which come from prepositional logic: contructive/direct, contrapositive, contradiction, and counterexample) should be separated from what I will call the &quot;Tools of Proof&quot; (higher level proof methods such as  proof by induction, exhaustion, pigeonhole -though it's not here right now-, etc.).  I don't feel I quite have the right to do this myself if the book is still alive in any way.
Also, there is at least one proof that I would like to fix, but don't know how to use the system well enough to patch it (so that the only fix I can do right now would be to remove it).  This is in &quot;counterexamples&quot;, where the author tries to make a bijection but misses one case (that is, that any terminating decimal is equivalent to a nonterminating decimal).  I'll try to look into the syntax of this system and maybe fix it myself, but like I said, the only way I can fix it right now is by removal. [[User:Mo Anabre|Mo Anabre]] 16:54, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

I've fixed the proof I referred to above... I'm still looking into perhaps revamping various parts.  If anyone is especially adamant against my doing so, speak now.  Otherwise, after school gets out in a few weeks, I'll start running through it. [[User:Mo Anabre|Mo Anabre]] 23:29, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

== Add interest by adding puzzles ==
Why not start the book with a nice example? How about the puzzle about the checkerboard and the dominoes? Take a checkerboard and cut off the two opposite black corner squares. Now try to place 31 dominoes on the remaining squares. Is it possible? (The answer is no - the reason is that each domino is on one red and one black square. The truncated checkboard has 32 red squares and 30 black squares. If there was a solution, at least one of the dominoes would have to be on two red squares.) Solving this puzzle is similar to constructing a proof. Maybe it's the same thing. You can work this example through the whole introduction, or maybe a set of puzzles could work their way through the whole book.

== Velleman's Proof Designer ==

Daniel J. Velleman has a [http://www.cs.amherst.edu/~djv/pd/pd.html program]
that goes along with his book &quot;How To Prove It. Second Edition&quot;.  It provides proof checker and builder that uses a concise syntax that could be used as a standard format for all proofs in the book?  Comments, Questions, Concerns?

== Geometry? ==

Why is this book under the Geometry section?  Geometric proofs are only a limited part of Mathematical Proof.

== Good Ideas ==

You've got great ideas.  Please change anything you think needs to be.  It won't hurt my feelings.  I'm just an undergrad--I only started the book because the topic interests me.  Go ahead and add puzzles and I'll try to standardize the method of proof and everything.  Thanks for the input. -[[User:Gandalfxviv|Gandalf]] 03:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== Getting basics out of the way? ==

From what I've read of deadtree proof books, it may be a good thing to focus a little more on background first, like maybe moving [[Mathematical Proof/Introduction/Notation#Basic Set Theory|Basic Set Theory]] into its own page, talking a little bit about the properties of arithmetic, and maybe flushing out Boolean reasoning a bit more. I mean, what's there is good, but there isn't a dedicated section for De Morgan's Laws, and I'm not sure where they'd best fit.

Of course, adding too much background material up front could make the book overly dense, so maybe there should be some very simple proofs early. The contrapositive identity would make a good candidate in my opinion, but I'd like to hear if anyone else has any ideas.

[[Image:Effect of Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster (total).jpeg|thumb|right|Artistic depiction of the effect of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster]]

The '''Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster''' was invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox, a major character in [[wikipedia:Douglas Adams|Douglas Adams]]' novel [[wikipedia:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]. The effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is described as &quot;like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon, wrapped 'round a large gold brick.&quot; It has also been described in the novel as &quot;the alcoholic equivalent to a mugging; expensive and bad for the head.&quot; Its original, fictional recipe, is as follows:

===Recipe===

# Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.
# Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V(Oh, that Santragian seawater! Oh, those Santragian fish!) 
# Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).
# Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in honor of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia. 
# Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qalactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heavy odors of the dark Qalactin Zones, subtle, sweet, and mystic.
# Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.
# Sprinkle Zamphuor.
# Add an olive.
# Drink . . . but . . . very carefully . . .

* 4 parts Bacardi Citron
* 1 part Bacardi 151 (for color)
* 1 part Goldschlager
* 1 part Everclear (to cut Goldschlager)

=====Recipe number six=====
Another recipe: 
*	1 part Everclear (or any other strong grain alcohol such as Bourbon, Moonshine, or Vodka)
*	1 part Bitter Lemon (or plain Tonic Water)
*	1 part Bombay Sapphire Gin (or other gin)
*	1 part Yukon Jack Perma-Frost Schnapps (or other mint schnapps, or white crème de menthe)
*	Enough blue food coloring to make the mixture a very light sky blue

Also needed: 
*	Sugar cubes
*	Cinnamon extract
*	Yellow food coloring (optional)
*	Angostura Bitters
*	Olives

Mix the first five ingredients and chill (usually for 24 hours). Then, take a sugar cube and let it absorb 1 milliliter of cinnamon extract and 1 drop of yellow food coloring (optional). Place three ice cubes in a glass and pour the chilled liquid mixture over these. Drop in the sugar cube and stir to dissolve, or just let it sit (if food coloring is used, often the sugar cube is just left to sit, to create a layering effect with the color). Sprinkle the Angostura Bitters in the drink, and add an olive.
Drink, but very carefully.

Alternatively, one can let the sugar cube absorb 1 milliliter of Angostura Bitters, and sprinkle ground cinnamon on the top of the drink, thus omitting the cinnamon extract.

It is often more convenient to make a large amount of the mixture ahead of time and chill for a day, rather than to constantly mix more of it. It's also best to save it for a special occasion, such as Towel Day, due to the work put into making the drink.

=====Recipe number 7=====
2 measure of white orujo.
1 measure of gin.
3 measures of tonic water.
Angostura drops.
Lemon drops.
Add an olive.


=====Recipe number 8=====

1 dash goldschlager
2 dashes everclear
1 dash lemonclhello

=====The Mallet Assembly's Recipe=====
Fill a 28-oz. hurricane glass with crushed ice.  Add the following ''in order'':
* 1 oz. Everclear&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;  (''The ice should sizzle.'')
* 1 oz. Bacardi&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; 151
* 1 oz. apricot-flavored brandy
* 1 oz. triple sec
* 1 oz. lemon juice
* 1 oz. orange juice
* 1 oz. pineapple juice
* 1 oz. Tom Collins mix
Stir, then top off the glass with ice.  Drink.  ''Slowly''.&lt;br&gt;
This recipe is a modified version of the Pat O'Brien's&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Skylab [Fallout]&quot;.  Some have suggested replacing the apricot-flavored brandy with peach-flavored brandy and cutting back on the citrus while increasing the amount of Collins mix; purists argue that the resulting drink is a bit too sweet.  This recipe is not strictly analogous to Douglas Adams' recipe, but the effect is the same, and the equimolar quantities of ingredients make it easily scalable (until you've ''had'' one, at least).  As an added bonus, the dregs may be used to restore the shine to old pennies.


=====The BarBot Recipe=====
Prepare one part of each:
* Vodka
* Rum
* Whiskey (preferably cheap and harsh)
* Gin
* Orange juice
* Lime juice, diluted to taste
* Cola
* Ginger beer
Have [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAivAWCsxW8&amp;feature=youtu.be a robot] dispense each measure into an iced tumbler from a considerable distance. Thank your robot, and prepare for the rest of your night to become a blur.

=====The Housewarming Recipe=====
This is a slightly sweet drink, but hey, I like sweet.  And this recipe gives an unparalleled visual experience.

Use a 16oz clear glass.  Add the following:
* 1 oz. Grape Juice
* 2 oz. Pineapple Juice
* 1 oz. Citron Vodka
* 1 oz. Hot Cinnamon Schnapps

Then add a glowing ice cube.  You can find glowing LED ice cubes online.  The best are the ones that change color.  Then:

* 2 oz Sprite&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;
* 4 oz Club Soda

That is, fill up the rest of the glass with Sprite&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; and Club Soda in a 1:2 ratio, but leave an inch or so of room at the top of the glass.

It's best if the Sprite&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; and Club Soda are room temperature, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; cold.

Then add a piece of dry ice.

For a minute or so you'll have the full Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster experience: a glowing, bubbling drink overflowing with mist (Fallian marsh gas).  Once the dry ice has bubbled away, enjoy.  Best served at night, or in a dark environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is probably the most basic technique, and doesn't require a lot of theory, mainly just algebraic manipulation.  However, it does have its limitations, namely it really only works with polynomials.  It is more of a cookbook method:  here's the recipe, follow the steps.

Given two polynomial functions &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(z)&lt;/math&gt;, where the degree of Q is greater than the degree of P, we define another function to be the quotient of the two polynomials:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

And we note that if we factor Q we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;Q(z) = (z-z_0)^{a_0} \cdot (z-z_1)^{a_1} \cdot ...&lt;/math&gt;

Then depending on the form of &lt;math&gt;(z-z_0)^{a_0}&lt;/math&gt; we can reduce the function into a limited series of simple or m-th order poles as so:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} = \frac{A_0(x)(+ B_0)}{(z-z_0)^{a_0}} + \frac{A_0(x)(+ B_0)}{(z-z_0)^{a_0-1}} + ... + \frac{A_1(x)(+ B_1)}{(z-z_1)^{a_1}} + \frac{A_1(x)(+ B_1)}{(z-z_1)^{a_1-1}} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

And then the coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_0,...,B_0,...&lt;/math&gt; can be solved for and the function can be stated into an explicit form with readable residues.

Of course, this is taught a lot better by example and case.

==Case 1, simple one-order factors==

We begin with the function:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1}{z^2 + 3z + 2}&lt;/math&gt;

And note that it can be factored thusly:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1}{z^2 + 3z + 2} = \frac{1}{(z+1)(z+2)}&lt;/math&gt;

For this case the correct form we &quot;guess&quot; is like so:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(z+1)(z+2)} = \frac{A_0}{z+1} + \frac{A_1}{z+2}&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining portion is by algebra, we multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;(z+1)(z+2)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;1 = A_0z + 2A_0 + A_1z + A_1&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives us two equations:

&lt;math&gt;0 = A_0z + A_1z&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1 = 2A_0 + A_1&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;A_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

And our function can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1}{z+1} - \frac{1}{z+2}&lt;/math&gt;

The remainder  of this section discusses suggests fractional forms that aid in separation, since the actual method and theory hold.

==The Other Two Cases==

Case 1, Unfactorable Terms. In our generic expression, there is A(x)+B term, but really should include an additional polynomial for possible &quot;unfactorable&quot; terms (i.e., terms that can't be factored with only real numbers, although if the terms are factored correctly with imaginary numbers, the method works).  To account for this the &quot;guessed&quot; fraction, include these extra terms. For example,

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1}{(z^2+4)(z-1)} = \frac{A_0x + B_0}{z^2+4} + \frac{A_1}{z-1}&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; to be solved.

Case 2, Term(s) Raised To A Power, The correct &quot;guess&quot; will include a trailing series of decreasing powers of the factor. For example,

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1}{(z+1)^2(z-1)} = \frac{A_0}{(z+1)^2} + \frac{A_1}{z+1} + \frac{A_2}{z-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Remark==

Again, partial fractioning only really works with polynomials, and can be a huge hassle for large denominators.  The next section looks at a more general way of determining the residue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a much more general, more lovely, all-pole encompassing formula for determining residues.  We start off by examining the Laurent series of a function:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infin}^{\infin} a_n (z-z_0)^n&lt;/math&gt;

And when examining the expansion we note that if we want the residue of the simple pole of a function, we want the coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The second order pole, &lt;math&gt;a_{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.  In order to really see what's going on in the formula, it's best to look at the expansion:

&lt;math&gt; f(z) = ... + \frac{a_{-2}}{(z-z_0)^2} + \frac{a_{-1}}{(z-z_0)} + a_0 + a_1(z-z_0) + a_2(z-z_0)^2 + ... &lt;/math&gt;

Say we want the residue of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; from a function with a 2nd-order pole about that point, we first multiply by &lt;math&gt;(z-z_0)^2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{a_{-2}}{(z-z_0)^2} + \frac{a_{-1}}{(z-z_0)} + a_0 + a_1(z-z_0) + a_2(z-z_0)^2 + ... &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(z-z_0)^2 f(z) = a_{-2} + a_{-1} (z-z_0) + ...\,&lt;/math&gt;

We now want to isolate the &lt;math&gt;a_{-1}&lt;/math&gt; term, so we take a derivative:

&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{d}{d z} ((z-z_0)^2 f(z)) =  a_{-1} + ... &lt;/math&gt;

Now if we evaluate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;, the remaining terms will be zero, thus:

&lt;math&gt;g(z_0) = \frac{d}{d z} ((z-z_0)^2 f(z)) =  a_{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

gets us the residue, from repeating this same procedure the general formula can be obtained quite easily.

==The Residue Formula==

&lt;math&gt;Res(f,z_0) = \lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} \frac{1}{(m-1)!} \frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}} ((z-z_0)^m \cdot f(z)) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the point about which the residue is to be found, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the function.

There are some extra terms placed into this formula that weren't discussed above.  The factorial eliminates the extra multiplied terms from the derivatives, and the limit deals with issues caused by a removable singularity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simplifying Integrals==

Given the following integral:

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \frac{1}{x^2-1} dx&lt;/math&gt;

Now with partial fractions (or the residue theorem) we can split this up into a series of mono-pole terms, which would allow us to use substitution and receive logarithmic answers:

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{x-1} dx + \int_a^b \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{x+1} dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \ln (x-1) |_a^b - \frac{1}{2} \ln (x+1) |_a^b&lt;/math&gt;

==Cauchy's Residue Theorem==

Cauchy's Residue Theorem is a VERY important result which gives many other results in Complex Analysis and Theory, but more importantly to us, is that it allows us to calculate integration with only residue, that is, we can literally integrate without actually 'integrating'.  ''Note:  Its derivation is in Complex Analysis, which is listed as a prerequisite for these more advanced tricks.''

This is the actual (general) theorem:

Let &amp;Gamma; be a simple closed positively oriented contour.  If f is analytic in some simply connected domain D containing &amp;Gamma; and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is any point inside &amp;Gamma;s, then:

&lt;math&gt;f^{n}(z_0)= \frac{n!}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma} \frac{f(\gamma)}{(\gamma-z)^{n+1}} dz&lt;/math&gt;

Upon first look, this has absolutely nothing to do with residues, but mathematicians are very abstract and tricky people.

Take a general function, call it &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, just so we don't confuse it with the function in Cauchy's Integral Formula.  &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; can be made into a Laurent Series:

&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \sum_{n=-\infin}^{\infin} a_n (z-z_0)^n&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we integrate over a contour &amp;Gamma; of &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, keeping in mind that &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; has been 'Laurentized':

&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Gamma} \sum_{n=-\infin}^{\infin} a_n (z-z_0)^n dz&lt;/math&gt;

Also by Complex Analysis, the parts of the series that are analytic and zero and thus dropped out (which is actually ANOTHER result by Cauchy), this leaves the sum of the integrals containing powers on the bottom, now by carrying out the differentiations of &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; and applying the General Cauchy Integral Formula (The proof is tedious but you can do the Laurent series and check yourself), you will come upon the Cauchy Residue Theorem (Cauchy really did do a lot of this stuff, a running joke in Complex Analysis classes is, &quot;Isn't every proof done by Cauchy?&quot;):

&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Gamma} g(z) = 2 \pi i \sum_{j=1}^{n} Res(z_j)&lt;/math&gt;

Read over that equation a few times, make sure you really grasp what it's saying, to do an integral, you need only calculate the residues.  Does it seem useless because you're concerned with only the real number line?  You're not being creative enough.  Take the line integral with one part over the real-number line, and the other lines over the complex such that they are easily computable, as a general example:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Gamma} g(z) = \int_{Real Line} g(z) + \int_{A simple line that closes the loop} g(z) = 2 \pi i \sum_{j=1}^{n} Res(z_j)&lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, this too borders the line with a book on Complex Analysis, since these 'simple lines' are discussed therein, but just to not leave you hanging, here's a typically simple one so you can try out integration without integrating on your own:

If &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of two polynomials such that the degree of the lower polynomial is at least two more than the numerator polynomial then &lt;math&gt;lim_{\rho \rightarrow \infin} \int_{C_{\rho^+}} f(z) dz = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Where &lt;math&gt;C_{\rho^+}&lt;/math&gt; is a half-circle on the plane.  This allows you to close some loops made by integrals over the real-number line and try out this method for yourself.

And that's where we leave off!

===Introduction and Examples of Behaviour===
----
'''State that behaviour in animals is related to the environmental context'''

'''State that innate behaviour develops independently of the environmental context, whereas learned behaviour reflects conditions experienced by individuals during development.'''

'''Explain the role of natural selection in the development of behaviour patterns'''
:*An organism may develop a certain behaviour which makes it better suited to its environment. For example, a learned behaviour allows the species to obtain food with ease. Possessing a certain behaviour  will increase the likelihood of a species and its offspring to survive, and thus more and more of a species will develop this behaviour.

'''Explain using species of birds or animals one example of each of the types of behavior: migration, grooming, communication, courtship and mate selection.'''
:*'''Migration''': Arctic tern, swallow, white stork, blue whale
:*'''Grooming''': Rhesus monkeys will groom one another. This is a sign of respect as lower ranking members will groom higher ranking ones. Also, grooming may be addictive for the monkeys due to the release of endorphins while grooming
:*'''Communication''': bird songs, alarm responses and hierarchal dominance patterns in wolves and red deer
:*'''Courtship''': male display (ex: peacock, mallard duck, great crested grebe, blue footed boobie)
:*'''Mate selection''': territory and song (birds) or combat (stags)

'''Explain the need for quantitative data in studies of behaviour'''
:* Studies of animal behaviour usually begin with careful observations from researchers. These careful observations allow us to understand the natural history of a species and often lead to the formation of a hypothesis. From here we can test the hypothesis by collecting quantitative data. Then according to this data we can then establish confidence levels for the data by statistical tests.

===Perception of Stimulus===
----
'''State that sensory receptors act as energy transducers'''
:* Sensory receptors act as energy transducers. All sensory receptors convert energy from the stimulus into the electrical energy of a nerve impulse. Animal's behaviour is the response that the animals make to the environment and involves perception of stimuli from this environment. They then use sensory receptors and thus all energy transducers.

'''State that human sensory receptors are classified as mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, or photoreceptors.'''
:* Human sensory receptors are classified as mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, or photoreceptors. 

'''Describe what is meant by by each of the terms mentioned before with reference to one named example of each type of receptor'''
:* '''Mechanoreceptors''': Perceive mechanical energy in the form of movement or sound, etc. An example is hair cells in the inner ear which send nerve impulses to the brain when sounds make them vibrate.
:*'''Chemoreceptors''': Perceives chemical substances. Nerve cells in the nostrils send impulses to the brain when chemicals bind to them.
:* '''Thermoreceptors''': Perceive temperature. Warm and cold endings in the skin send messages to the brain of the spinal cord.
:* '''Photoreceptors''': Perceive light. Rod and cones in the eyes send messages to the brain when they absorb light.

'''Draw the structure of the human eye'''


'''Annotate diagrams of the human retina'''

[[Image:Diagram_of_retina.JPG|500 px]]

'''Distinguish between rod and cone cells'''
:* **Rods function well in dim light, while cone cells function well under bright light. Rod cells absorb all types of light and give monochrome vision whereas cone cells absorb red, blue, and green, and give off colour vision (sensitivity to wavelengths). **Rods group together and send impulses to the same neuron while cones have their individual neurons. Cones give greater visual accuracy than rods. Rods are more widely dispersed through the Retina while cones are concentrated. Rods deal with the pigment rhodopsin, while cones deal with the pigment iodopsin. 

'''Outline how visual stimuli are processed in the retina and the visual cortex'''
:* Bipolar cells in the Retina combine the impulses of rod and cone cells and pass them on to sensory neurons of the optic nerve (Ganglion cells). The left and right optic nerves meet at a structure called the optic chiasma. Here, all the neurons that are carrying impulses from the right field of vision split and bring the impulses to both hemispheres of the brain, and vice versa. As a result, the left optic nerve carries information from the right half of the field of vision and vice versa. The impulses are processed first by the thalamus, and then carried to the visual cortex where the information is processed into images.

'''Identify the structures of the human ear.'''


Perception of Sound
1. Eardrum
When sound waves reach the eardrum at the end of the outer ear, they make it vibrate. The vibration consists of rapid movements of the ear drum, towards and away from the middle ear. The role of the eardrum is to pick up sound vibrations from the air and transmit them to the middle ear. 

2. Bones of the middle ear
There is a series of very small bones in the middle ear, called the ossicles. Each ossicle touches the next one. The first ossicle is attached to the eardrum and the third one is attached to the oval window. The ossicles' role is to transmit sound waves from the eardrum to the oval window. They also act as levers, reducing the amplitude of the waves, but increasing their force, which amplifies sounds by about 20 times. The oval window's small size, compared with the eardrum, helps with amplification. Muscles attached to the ossicles protect the ear from loud sounds, by contracting to damp down vibrations in the ossicles.

3. Oval window
This is a membranous structure, like the eardrum. It transmits sound waves to the fluid filling the cochlea. This fluid is incompressible, so a second membranous window is needed, called the round window. When the oval window moves towards the cochlea, the round window moves away from it, so the fluid in the cochlea can vibrate freely, with its volume remaining constant.

4. Hair cells in the cochlea
The cochlea consists of a tube, wound to form a spiral shape. Within the tube are membranes, with receptors called hair cells attached. These cells have hair bundles, which stretch from one of the membranes to another. When the sound waves pass through the fluid in the cochlea, the hair bundles vibrate. Because of gradual variations in the width and thickness of the membranes, different frequencies of sound can be distinguished, because each hair bundle only resonates with particular frequencies. When the hair bundles vibrate, the hair cells send messages across synapses and on to the brain via the auditory nerve.

===Innate Behaviour===
----
'''Define innate behaviour'''
:*Innate behaviour is behaviour inherited by genes which occurs in all members of a species. An animal in a sense is born with this type of behaviour.

'''Outline the pain withdrawal reflex and one other human spinal reflex'''
:* A hand accidentally touches something which causes pain. This will stimulate pain receptors in the skin. The pain receptor passes a message to a sensory neuron which carries it as a nerve impulse to gray matter in the spinal cord. The message is passed via a linking neuron called an associate neuron in the grey matter to a motor neuron. The motor neuron carries the message to a muscle in the arm. The message stimulates the muscle to contract, removing the hand from danger. This is called the reflex arc. 
Knee-Jerk Reflex - Stretch receptor to the sensory neuron to the motor neuron to the muscle.

'''Draw the structure of the spinal cord and its spinal nerves to show the components of the reflex arc'''

'''Outline the pupil reflex and one cranial reflex'''
:* If a bright light is shone in one eye, the pupils of both eyes constrict. Photoreceptor cells in the retina detect the light stimulus. Nerve impulses are sent in sensory neurons of the optic nerve to the brain. The brainstem processes this and send impulses to the muscles of the iris which contract.
:* Sneeze - Irritation in nose,sensory receptor, trigeminal cranial nerve (5th), medulla, motor neuron, muscles (abdominals), SNEEZE!
'''Draw the gross structure of the brain including the medulla oblongata, cerebellum, hypothalmus, pituitary gland and cerebral hemisphere'''



'''State one function for each of the parts of the brain listed before.'''
:* '''Medulla oblongata''': controls unconscious processes including breathing rate.
:* '''Cerebellum''': helps to coordinate muscle movements and balance.
:* '''Hypothalamus''': controls secretion of hormones in the pituary gland.
:*'''Pituitary gland''': Secretes hormones
:*'''Cerebal hemispheres''': Complex thought processes such as memory, learning, and problem solving.

'''Discuss the use of the pupil reflex in testing for brain death'''
:* If light stimulation does not cause the pupils to constrict, then heavy damage to the most basic parts of the central nervous system is likely.

'''Define taxis and kinesis'''
:*[[w:Taxis|Taxis]]: is directional movement away or towards a direct stimilus. Maggots move directly away from a light source. 
:* [[w:Kinesis|Kinesis]]: a stimulus produces a change in the the rate of movement or rate of turning. Woodlice moves fast in dry areas, but moves slow in humid areas while turning more. 

'''Explain, using one example of each behaviour, how the responses improve the animal's chances for survival'''
:* Woodlice live better in humid areas as they dehydrate easily in dry areas because of their gas exchange. The kinesis that they have ensure that they spend more time in humid areas. 
:* Fly maggots move away from light. This ensures that they stay inside a dead carcass where there is abundant food and protection from predators. 

'''Discuss the importance of innate behaviour to the survival of animals'''
:* Innate behaviour are inherited from parents as genes. They develop by natural selection and thus are suited to better adapt a species to its environment. Therefore, they increase an animal's chances for survival.

===Learned Behaviour===
----
'''Define classical conditioning'''
:* Classical conditioning is an alteration in the behaviour of an animal as the result of the association of external stimulus.

'''Outline Pavlov's experiments on conditioning of dogs'''
:* Ivan Pavlov observed that dog's secreted saliva when they saw or tasted food. The sight or taste of meat is called the unconditioned stimulus and the secretion of saliva is called the unconditioned response. Pavlov then gave a neutral response by ringing a bell whenever he served the dogs food. The sound of the bell eventually came to become the conditioned stimulus as dogs would secrete saliva at its sound. The dogs associated the sound of the bell with the arrival of food. The secretion of saliva due to the conditioned stimuli is called the conditioned response.

'''Define operant conditioning'''
:* Operant conditioning is behaviour which develops as a result of the association of reinforcement with a particular response on numerous occasions.

'''Outline Skinner's experiments into operant conditioning '''
:* Skinner created a ‘skinner box’, into which a rat (or pigeon) could be placed, and on pressing a lever food would be delivered to feed the rat. A hungry rat would be placed in the box, and it would eventually press the lever by accident, and learn to associate the pressing of the lever with the reward of food. The food reward is the reinforcement and pressing the lever is the operant response. The more quickly the reinforcement is given, the faster operant conditioning develops. When the response is not given invariably, the conditioning develops more strongly. 

'''Define imprinting'''
:* Imprinting is a learning a response to a stimulus during a sensitive period of development.

'''Outline Lorenz's experiment on imprinting in geese'''
:* Lorenz removed half of the eggs that a female goose had laid and incubated them. When they hatched, he observed them for a time, so that he was the first moving object which the goslings saw. The goslings then associated him with their mother, and so followed Lorenz around, and on maturity even attempted to mate with humans. The birds which hatched with the female goose developed normally. The goslings are able to filter external stimuli to identify the moving object as a sign stimulus, and the ability to identify the sign stimulus is called the innate releasing mechanism. Imprinting allows animals to learn to respond to significant stimuli in their environment and ignore others. Imprinting is species-specific (innate) behaviour.

'''Discuss how the process of learning improves the chances of survival'''
:* Birds can avoid tasting black and orange caterpillars, Monarch butterflies.
:* Grizzly bears can learn how to catch salmon.
:* Goslings learn who their mother is and avoid predators by staying with her

===Social Behaviour===
----
'''List three examples of animals that show social behaviour'''
:* Ants, honey bees, and termites.

'''Describe the social organization of honey bee colonies'''
:* There are three castes of honey bees which have different tasks. The single queen bee of a colony has to lay eggs. The worker bees do jobs that maintain the colony. The drones do nothing to help the colony to survive. However, if they successfully mate with virgin queens, they spread the genes of the colony to new colonies. Workers eject drones from the colony at the end of the season during which virgin queens are available.

'''Discuss the role of altruistic behaviour in social organizations using two examples'''
:* Wolves - In a pack of wolves, there is a dominant male and female which are the sole reproducers, and the other members of the pack hunt and bring back food for the breeding pair.
:*Naked Mole Rats - There exist breeding males and females, the diggers (who dig tunnels and provide food) and protectors who offer their lives when facing a predator. The concept is that the sacrificers will indirectly pass on their genes by protecting the mating pair.

===AHS The ANS (Autonomic Nervous System)===
----
The ANS consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.

The roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic system are largely antagonistic towards one another - that is, the parasympathetic nerves might stimulate a bodily function that will be inhibited by the sympathetic nerves.

The ANS serves the heart, blood vessels, smooth muscles and digestive system.

Their comparative effects can be explained as follows:

'''Parasympathetic Nerves'''
Largely concerned with calming and returning the body’s emphasis to self-maintenance functions.	
Originate in the lower brain and at the base of the spinal cord.
Stimulate the salivary glands.	
Constricts the pupil.		
Slows the heart.	

'''Sympathetic Nerves'''
Correlates with arousal and energy generation, focusing on specific functions.
Originate from the middle region of the spinal cord.
Inhibit salivary gland secretion.
Dilates the pupil.
Accelerates the heart.

Discuss the relationships between the influence of the conscious part of the brain and automatic reflexes as shown by bladder or anus control, meditation and yoga - this basically means that it is possible for a person to override automatic reflexes (for example, by concentration).

===Neurotransmitters and Synapses===
----
'''State that synapses of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are classified according to the neurotransmitter used, including acetylcholine and noradrenalin.'''
--Synapses of the PNS are classified according to the neurotransmitter used.  Cholinergic synapses use acetylcholine and adrenergic synapses use noradrenalin.  Most adrenergic synapses are sympathetic and most cholinergic synapses are parasympathetic.



'''Explain how pre-synaptic neurons can either encourage or inhibit post-synaptic transmission by depolarization or hyperpolarizaton of the post-synaptic membrane.'''--Pre-synaptic neurons can encourage post-synaptic transmission by depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane.  It does this by causing sodium ions or other positively charged ions to enter the post synaptic neuron, helping to depolarize it and cause and action potential.  This is called an excitatory synapse.
--Pre-synaptic neurons can inhibit post-synaptic transmission by hyperpolarizaton of the post-synaptic membrane.  This happens when negative chloride ions move to the post-synaptic neuron, increasing polarization.  This is called hyperpolarizaton and makes it more difficult to depolarize a neuron sufficiently to cause an action potential.  These synapses are called inhibitory synapses.


'''Outline how pain is sensed and how endorphins and enkephalins can act as painkillers.'''--Pain receptors are located in the skin and on organs.  Pain signals are sent along these nerve endings along nerve fibers on the spinal cord.  The signals pass synapses to neurons that carry them up in an ascending tract to the stem or thalamus of the brain.  The signals may pass on in other neurons to sensory areas of the cerebral cortex, causing conscious pain.
--Endorphins and enkephalins act as painkillers by stopping the pain signal to the brain.  Enkephalins block calcium channels in the membrane of the pre-synaptic neurons.  They block the synaptic transmissions, so the message doesn’t reach the brain.  Endorphins are released from the pituitary gland to control pain.  They are carried to the brain and bind to pain receptors and block the release of the neurotransmitter that is used to transmit pain signals to the brain.


'''Outline the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and the involvement of dopamine.'''--Parkinson’s is from the death of neurons in a certain part of the brain called the substanti negra.  These neurons release dopamine at synapses that control muscle contradictions.  The synapses at which dopamine are released are inhibitory.  Muscle contractions cannot be controlled properly without dopamine and this leads to the symptoms of Parkinson’s.
The early symptoms of Parkinson’s are feeling shaky and tired and the loss of concentration.  Eventually the body becomes stiff because the antagonistic muscles cannot relax.  Uncontrollable shaking affects the hands and other parts of the body and movements become very slow.
		

'''Explain that psychoactive drugs affect the brain and personality by either increasing or decreasing synaptic transmission.'''--psychoactive drugs affect the brain and personality by either increasing or decreasing synaptic transmission.  They do this by 1) some act as neurotransmitters and bind to receptors for that neurotransmitter in post-synaptic membranes.  They block the receptor, preventing the neurotransmitter from having its usual effect; 2) some have the same effect of a neurotransmitter, but unlike the neurotransmitter, they are not broken down when they bind to the receptors, so the effect lasts much longer; and finally 3) some interfere with the breakdown of neurotransmitter in synapses and prolong the effect of the neurotransmitter.


'''Discuss the behavioral effects of the excitatory psychoactive drugs nicotine, cocaine and amphetamines.'''--The behavioral effect of the excitatory psychoactive drug nicotine are said to be calming and thus an increase in the nicotine levels reduces the craving for it.  The behavioral effect of the excitatory psychoactive drug cocaine is alertness, increased energy, and talkativeness.  The behavioral effect of the excitatory psychoactive drug amphetamines has a similar effect of cocaine, but usually last longer.  Users frequently become aggressive and hyperactive.  One amphetamine is ecstasy and it usually fosters feelings of empathy, openness and caring.  It lowers feelings of aggression and increases sexual behavior.

'''Discuss the behavior effects of the inhibitory psychoactive drugs benzodiazepines, cannabis and alcohol.'''--The behavioral effect of the inhibitory psychoactive drug benzodiazepine is a feeling of relaxation and reduction of anxiety.  High doses cause drowsiness, slurred speech, and loss of muscle coordination.   The behavioral effect of the inhibitory psychoactive drug cannabis is an increases intensity of sensual perception and the feeling of emotional well-being and allows clear thinking of complex ideas.  The behavioral effect of the inhibitory psychoactive drug alcohol is said to reduce inhibitions, making people more talkative and confident.  It impairs reaction times and fine muscle coordination.  In large quantities it causes loss of memory, slurred speech, loss of balance and poor muscle coordination.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Modern History}}
Russian Revolution can refer to the following events in the history of Russia:

The Russian Revolution of 1905 was a series of strikes and anti-government violence against Tsar Nicholas II 
The Russian Revolution of 1917, which included: 
February Revolution, which resulted in the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia 
October Revolution, which was the Bolshevik seizure of power 
The Third Russian Revolution was the failed anarchist revolution against the Bolsheviks and the White movement 1918 - 1922 
When the year is not indicated in the reference, the term &quot;Russian Revolution&quot;, if used as a time mark, usually refers to the October Revolution of 1917, whereas references to the revolution of 1905 always mention the year and references to the February Revolution always mention the month.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: obsticle → obstacle using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">One obstacle is even if we do know the future, what can we do to stop what will be? Can anything be done at all? Are all things just fated to occur? Is there a rational behind the universe. Is the future written as it occurs or in advance?
==[[Wikipedia:Fortuna|Fortuna]]==
In Roman mythology, Fortuna (equivalent to the Greek goddess Tyche) was the personification of luck, hopefully of good luck, but she could be represented veiled and blind, as modern depictions of Justice are seen, and came to represent the capriciousness of life.

Fortuna had a retinue that included Copia among her blessings. Under the name Annonaria she protected grain supplies. In the Roman calendar, June 11 was sacred to Fortuna, with a greater festival to Fors Fortuna on the 24th.

Fortuna was propitiated by mothers. Traditionally her cult was introduced to Rome by Servius Tullius. Fortuna had a temple in the Forum Boarium, a public sanctuary on the Quirinalis, as the tutelary genius of Roma herself, Fortuna Populi Romani, the &quot;Fortune of the Roman people&quot;, and an oracle in Praeneste where the future was chosen by a small boy choosing oak rods with possible futures written on them.

All over the Roman world, Fortuna was worshipped at a great number of shrines under various titles that were applied to her according to the various circumstances of life in which her influence was hoped to have a positive effect. Fortuna was not always positive: she was doubtful (Fortuna Dubia); she could be &quot;fickle fortune&quot; (Fortuna Brevis), or downright evil luck (Fortuna Mala).

Her name seems to derive from the Italic goddess Vortumna, &quot;she who revolves the year&quot;.
===From Carmina Burana===
Fortune plango vulnera I bemoan the wounds of Fortune&lt;br&gt;
stillantibus ocellis with weeping eyes,&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Graphic headlines with TextGen.aspx ==

=== Introduction ===

Textgen.aspx generates a graphic-headline depending on the parameters passed
to it.

=== Preparations ===

Before you can use the TextGen feature you need to upload the TrueType font file, which you'd like to use. Font files must be placed inside the ''umbraco/config/fonts'' directory. You also need to create an entry for your font in fonts.xml which resides in the same directory.

There are many truetype fonts available in the windows directory 'fonts' folder.

=== Usage within the Rich text editor ===

You can insert a dynamically generated image into the richtext-editor by clicking the icon beside the Bold and Italic-icons (Two A's).

=== Usage within templates ===

Place the following code in your Umbraco template (ensure you url encode the text parameter): 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;img 
alt=&quot;Your Text Here&quot; 
src=&quot;/umbraco/TextGen.aspx?
	text=Your+Text+Here
	&amp;amp;font=arial
	&amp;amp;size=48
	&amp;amp;color=ffcc33
	&amp;amp;bgColor=ffffff
	&amp;amp;bold=1&quot; 
border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
!Name
! width=&quot;400&quot; | Description
!Example

== What does IB mean? ==
It took me a few seconds to find out what IB means. I had to search google for it. 
People outside Europe (I guess) do not know these letters mean. 


This book definitely needs work. We'll work on getting all the relevant data in before turning it into a real guide to IB Econ, but these should ultimately have information similar to that in the Course Companion.

I'll work on completing and expanding the glossaries of each section first and move from there!

[[User:Philovitist|Philovitist]] 00:36, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

This has to be the worst IB Study Guide ever- most of what's written doesnt even remotely relate to the syllabus. Im changing all that. --[[User:Daniel.Stevens|Daniel.Stevens]] 21:38, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

need graphs and diagrams. and lots of them.--[[User:212.221.74.57|212.221.74.57]] 07:30, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

There are two easy ways to improve the material for students at IB Economics. One way is to customise a search engine for IB Economics in Wikibooks. The other way is to customise a search engine for the best pages about IB Economics. I am now working on the latter.

I have included the best parts of the Wikibooks to the index. I added the search engine for IB Economics to the bottom. In the future, it can be an integrated part in the Wikibooks. Feel free to participate in customising the engines. Customisation is a process, and it never ends. --[[User:Henri Losoi|Henryh]] 7th March 2009

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Naming policy ==
Chapter page names need to start with the book name followed by a slash, for example, &quot;Book Title/Chapter Name&quot;.  See [[WB:NP]] for more details  To follow this policy, you can change the chapter titles to:

: Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book
: Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere
: Etc.

If you want to keep chapter numbers in the links, then you can format links as:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book|Introduction: Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere|Chapter 1: Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Etc.

The part before the pipe character &quot;|&quot; indicates the page name while the part after the pipe character indicates how the link appears in the text.  Thus the links looks like:

: [[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book|Introduction: Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book]]
: [[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere|Chapter 1: Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere]]
: Etc.

Actually, this way of displaying the chapter titles is confusing to say the least.  On solution would be to move (rename) the book so as to drop the &quot;An Introduction&quot; part.  That is, to rename to book to &quot;Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere&quot;.  Another would be to drop the book name from the link text as follows.

: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book|Introduction: The Idea Behind this Book]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere|Chapter 1: The Evolution of the Public Sphere]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Etc.

This displays as:

: [[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Idea Behind this Book|Introduction: The Idea Behind this Book]]
: [[Rhetoric and Writing in the Public Sphere: An Introduction/The Evolution of the Public Sphere|Chapter 1: The Evolution of the Public Sphere]]
: Etc.

== WRTC 320 Fall 2011 final project ==

Hello, Karen McDonnell's Public Sphere students.
This is our discussion page. 
I've been doing copyediting in the existing chapters.
I hope that you'll make your way here and converse with each other as you think of ways that your sections connect.[[User:Mcdonnkm|Mcdonnkm]] ([[User talk:Mcdonnkm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mcdonnkm|contribs]]) 21:53, 12 December 2011 (UTC)
What has happened to the chapters on the media and technology???

== Proposed Chapter/Table of Contents ==

I notice that the already existing chapters of the Wikibook are still there (sans two chapters it would appear) and no new chapters have been added. Are we going to go off of the picture of the board from our class discussion that is posted on Boondoggle?

I geuss what I'm asking is: what are the chapters going to be, and when are they going up? In the picture on Boondoggle, I notice there is a heading that says &quot;Arts.&quot; I think my section pertains mostly to this (music blogs and the public sphere), so should I make this a chapter? Do others feel as though this would be a good chapter to create?

(K. McDonnell) Like I said above, I don't know WHAT happened to the missing chapters. That said, I dont' think that we've lost much. You definitely hold the power to create new chapters, so have at it.[[User:Mcdonnkm|Mcdonnkm]] ([[User talk:Mcdonnkm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mcdonnkm|contribs]]) 13:22, 14 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*CLL is the most common leukemia among adults in Western world
*It is characterized by accumulation of mature B-cells
**CLL molecular phenotype: CD5+, CD23+, surface Ig weak, CD79b weak/absent, FMC7 neg.
**Diagnosis: lymphocytosis (often &gt;5 x 10^9 / L, but not an absolute cutoff)
*Risk factors are male sec, advanced age, white race, and family history of CLL or lymphoproliferative disorders
*Cause and pathogenesis are largely unknown
**Peripheral blood of some healthy adults shows circulating B-cell clones with surface phenotypes simlar to CLL
**Monocloncal B-cell lymphomatosis (MBL) indicates presence of such B-cells in blood at &lt;5000 per cubic millimeter
**Prevalence of MBL may be 3-5% in general population &gt;50 years of age
**It appears that these circulating B-cell clones may be present in blood of for years prior to development of CLL, and that the light chain re-arrangement is the same
**Thus, it may be reasonable to consider MBL a precursor state to CLL, in a similar fashion as MGUS is a precursor state to multiple myeloma
*CLL and SLL are histologically and immunophenotypically identical
**By definition, CLL has more marked peripheral blood involvement
**CLL: absolute lymphocyte count &gt;=5 x10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L
**SLL: absolute lymphocyte count &lt;5 x10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L
*Clinical course varies widely, but frequently characterized by indolent behavior
*Treatment commonly deferred while patients asymptomatic
*No consensus on best treatment, but [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy#Pyrimidine_analogues|nucleoside analogues]] and Rituxan have lead to improved outcomes

==Staging==
&lt;big&gt;Rai Staging&lt;/big&gt;

**Retrospective. 2126 consecutive CLL/SLL patients
**Outcome: rates of response, OS, and FFS not different among different groups
**Predictive factors: deletion of 17p or 6q, age &gt;60, b2-microglobulin &gt;2, albumin &lt;3.5, creatinine &gt;1.6
**Conclusion: Patients with CLL or SLL can be treated similarly


==Richter's transformation==
*Named for Maurice N. Richter who described it in 1928
*Development of high grade NHL (typically [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/DLBCL|diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]) in the setting of CLL
*May be triggered by viral infections (e.g. EBV) or by genetic defects acquired by the malignant clone
*Occurs in ~4% of CLL patients
*Response rates to chemotherapy are low, up to ~40%; median OS is ~8 months

[[User talk:Prometheuspan/archive1]]

apparently i have been listed as possibly in contravention to wiw.
So, I'd like to go over that.
------------------


== Wikibooks hosts instructional resources ==

Since this clause of this policy statement is increasingly being used as a rationale for deleting content from this project, I think a major discussion needs to take place (again) on this topic.  Perhaps with some time passing from the original arguments and changes that were made earlier, perhaps we can hold a rational discussion on this topic.
-------------------
Honestly, I would be willing to pull out materials from my notes
which show that my stated goal even before i found wikibooks
or had even heard of wikibooks was to write Textbooks. I have 10
year old freindships that i could probably get to attest that this
has been a brewing idea of mine for that long. 

The evolution of the idea is important, originally i was going to
write textbooks on POV issues, which i am an expert on.
However, a year long retreat into the wilderness made me realize i was too bent from arguing. So i thought about what i knew and where i might want to go with it, and the concept of ThinkStarship was born.

Its first incarnation was &quot;Geeks of all trades&quot; a now defunct phpbb
website i managed to create with the help of a freind.
------------------


:''Wikibooks hosts instructional resources.&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy. This is for textbooks. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''

---------------
Honestly here, ThinkStarship rapidly departs the stated convention.
Its Textbooks are for theoretical colleges inside of theoretical
space ships, and for theoretical libraries onboard same.
So &quot;existing class&quot; i suppose no, don't meet that as a criteria.
However, I think that the idea here is sound to generate texts with
a space exploration/ colonization theme. Its a big umbrella, and
a great human motivator.
---------------

:'''As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy.  The primary mission for Wikibooks is the creation of textbooks for instructional purposes.  A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.  Other content may exist on Wikibooks, but it should still act in a supporting role for textbooks as a general instructional resource.'''

-------------
My textbooks would be textbooks in every sense other than that they
are for classes which don't exist yet. Somehow, it seems like that
isn't any different from most Wikibooks; You can't have a text for an existing class being written right now; Texts being written right now are for classes LIKE existing classes in the very immediate future.
---------------




Once consequence of this, however, is that content like [[Voter's Guide]], [[Colonising Mars]], and most of [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]] would be subject to deletion.  These topics have been debated before, but the big question is how do you make a policy here that permits some creativity but at the same time focuses the effort here to textbooks and textbook-like content?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:34, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
---------------
Good question. I don't see how this really makes everything as subject to deletion as you are saying. What is looks like to me is more of a guidelin of the direction current efforts should go in.
I hope in any case that this is what is meant.
As an interesting aside, I have now secured by means of making
freinds a new potential host site, but, I'd rather stick here as it
does help me to focus and because its a great support mechanism.
Plus, I really do think what i am doing is not only in the purview of Wikibooks, but is sort of on the cutting edge actually to solve
the problems that the rule is otherwise adressing. For instance,
if wikipedia ran a &quot;collaboration&quot; effort to come help ME out, we would have a very focused and streamlined path to generate the minimum set of textbooks to quallify the library as an operational 
educational library.
------------

:I wouldn't even try.  I don't think thats what wikibooks should be doing.  Wikibooks was made for instructional resources.  Some of those fit in a classroom setting.  Some of them are more practical knowledge (how-to books, for example).  Others are fields that don't fit in a college or high school classroom.  These items should not be excluded, just because they aren't &quot;textbooks&quot;.  Keep wikibooks as accepting non-fiction, and explicitly exclude areas we don't want.  Its always possible to add exclusions if we find more material we don't want.  Its next to impossible to remove exclusions, because a book will never grow to critical mass to see if its useful to us.  It would be deleted long before then.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
--------------------
I keep hoping that Wikibooks will make a &quot;Fiction&quot; bookshelf, and that this would relieve me of SOME of the burden of living up to the
standard placed before me. Still, and even so, The point here in the main is and always has been to write the library document that would be carried into space. That is simultaneously paralell in mission in many ways with wikibooks.
----------------
::So should we revert Jimbo's addition here? 
-------------
No, I don't think we need to revert the wording, i think we
need to explore what the meaning is in a non-alarmist mindset.
I don't feel threatened by the wording as is, tho the interpretation
might be a problem; obviously i do ride the edge of several different layers of the criteria for being here. Trying to walk that
line as best i can is something i am growing into more slowly than i would have hoped, but its a worthwhile adventure, and I am aware of the conventions and believe that the minor indulgences i am asking
for are justified by my mission; to write textbooks.
----------- 


Certainly what it means needs to be expanded a bit more somehow, even if I agree with your sentiments here.  Jimbo's wording can be, and is interpreted strictly on many VfD discussions as just textbooks alone and nothing more, with more of an attitude of going for more strictly college textbooks at that.  Wikibooks has certainly gone beyond that, and I think this official policy needs to reflect that change somehow, or some serious discussion should happen if we are to remove all non-textbook material altogether. 
--------------
From my POV the whole removal and deletion thing is so overused.
Rather than think in terms of deleting and moving, why not think
in terms of organizing and creating a sense of order thus that we
veer wikibooks in a direction?
------------


The two schools of thought were certainly played out with the [[Jokebook]], where the inclusionists want to keep it here, and the deletionists wanted it gone for good never to come back.  It certainly sits right on the threshold of what could be considered an instructional material by a very loose definition.

::I'm not trying to play that VfD out here again, but the point I'm making is that this is an unsettled question, and similar books are going to be popping up here on Wikibooks again and again with this issue unresolved.  It seems as though Jimbo is either undecided himself on this issue, or that it is to become a continual point of argument for Wikibooks in the future, where each borderline case is to be decided by VfD.  That doesn't sound right either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:02, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

-----------------
The problem is that its an informational engineering attempt made too simple. It needs a lot of fleshing out and a lot of thought. 
Other, very different methods ought to be employed to achieve the same goals.
-----------------



==Protection of minors and adult material==

nothing thinkstarship intends to do on wikibooks would ever cross
over G methinks. Theres a plan in the works to move once the textbooks as such are finished andto go to a new host site where
who knows what will happen, but that is in the far future and not
really anything concerning wikibooks.
------------

:I disagree.  First off, having a garuntee mean anything is impossible-  we'd either need a huge number of admins, or we'd need to switch to an approval based edit system instead of a wiki.  Both of those are unacceptable answers.  
---------------
I think an automated welcoming system as we have right now is probably sufficient, the problem is conveying quickly to potential
authors where to take their potential traffick, esp if it doesn't fit
here.
-----------------

:I think that it is a bad idea to have all the negative &quot;Wikibooks is not...&quot; instructions full stop. We really should be able to define what wikibooks is in positive terms (with it being implied that wikibooks is not anything that doesn't fall within what wikibooks is), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:32, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
--------------------
I agree, and plus, a page directing people to other places for adding materials on subjects x,y and z would be nice.
--------------



I have removed it because it is too drastic of a change. It needs some discussion (here on en.wikibooks.org) first. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

just buzzing around and thought to throw in 2 cents. &quot;too drastic of a change&quot; is true, but more complicated than that and potentially
misleading. The original charter is &quot;textbooks&quot; and video games really never did meet those criteria. What happened was a loose interpretation of the rules, owing probably in part to wanting to have ANY material on a newly started project. Wikibooks is full of stuff which doesn't really fit the prime criteria. Again, I think a bookshelf labeled &quot;Fiction&quot; and another labeled &quot;POV&quot; are probably
very good ideas. 

Is there a wikicity on videogames that isn't too specific?
(biggest problem with wikicities, they are tiny micro-umbrellas.)

Another thought; there ought to be more than just a &quot;what wikibooks is not&quot; page, as in a &quot;where to go to contribute on topics x,y,and z&quot;
page.
Thanks fer listening...

==explain==
----------------------------
&quot;I don't understand&quot;

Gawsh, i think i do, and, i'd like to explain.

this is about the information resource function of informational engineering, and what happens if the content as a whole ends up significantly departing from what is in the libraries best interest
for convincing the general public that we are indeed a library.

Its a social and informational engineering tactic, and as such, it is remarkably sensible.

The flipside from my head is the problem of excessive exclusivity.
This is a GOOD tool for the purpose of insuring the success of Wikibooks as an information resource AT ITS CURRENT EVOLUTIONARY STATE. It is a Bad overall idea for the long term library because it
limits the scope and size of the umbrella.

The larger the umbrella, the more applications the information service has, the more clients the information service gets. 

I'd like to quote Jimbo.
---------------
We have to draw a line somewhere, and we can argue internally endlessly
without getting much resolution.  So a useful technique is to try really
hard to reference some external standards.
-----------------
This is true; we need standards by which to generate reliable and useful information as an information service. The real question here,
is how and why and what and the particulars and details of those standards. A key issue from my perspective is the duration of implementation of an engineering tactic.

&gt; 1. What about guides to games that are not video or computer games?
&gt; These can include guides on how to play chess and go (which we already
&gt; have), bridge, whist, etc.. together with suitable strategies;
&gt; conceivably this may also include more modern games such as risk or
&gt; monopoly or cluedo. To my mind, guides on well-known intellectual games
&gt; such as these have educational value and are worth keeping, but your
&gt; comments would be welcome.

My question would be whether or not there exist classes at accredited
institutions on the subject which use something similar _as a textbook_.

Notice how this works: first, we can be quite broad in what constitutes
a textbook, for example at my sister's cooking school, they use a
cookbook for a textbook, no question.

But in virtually every university, there are classes on Shakespeare
which use Hamlet as material, but not as _textbook_ per se.

I am unaware of any course at any accredited institution which teaches
risk or monopoly or clue.  Chess and go, probably, but I actually don't
know.  Doom?  No.
-------------------
For good psyche reasons, nobody writes textbooks using Doom as
a reference resource. Could it be done in theory? Sure. Not by me,
and, more to the point, what is there isn't that.

The problem we are trying to solve here is that geek pursuits are not
always scholastic, and geeks have the time and energy and motivation
to write books for geeks that aren't scholastic. Might this ever be in the pervue of Wikibooks? Maybe 10 years from now when Wikibooks
has an up and functioning library. Right now, it causes system friction. Entropy ensues.

&gt; 2. Your comments included a direct reference to wikibooks having
&gt; textbooks suitable for &quot;elementary school, high school, or college
&gt; courses&quot; (and I'm not sure what age groups you meant by &quot;college&quot; as it
&gt; seems to mean different things in the US from what it means in the UK).
&gt; I trust this list was not meant to be exhaustive and that you would
&gt; agree that textbooks related to professional learning (eg accountancy),
&gt; adult learning (eg cookery) and (if not covered by &quot;college&quot;) university
&gt; learning are suitable for wikibooks.

Yes!  I think we should be quite broad about it.  The key point is that
there have to be some kind of courses offered by some kind of serious
institution of learning.
-------------------
While i agree, in theory, and in principle with the engineering tactic, i think that the primary flaw is that there lacks provisos
or explanations. What problems are you trying to solve with the &quot;rule&quot; Jimbo? 

Perhaps the more important question is &quot;Can we think of some other standards which would be more inclusive and still adress the problem?&quot;

Personally, I don't think that is such a tall order. I remember a similar moment for my poor little &quot;caught in the middle&quot; brain on
Dennis Kuciniches website not so long ago. On the issue of abortion.
You see, I totally want there to never be an Abortion ever. I think
that is a great and wonderful goal. However, legislating that won't
solve as many problems as it will create, and the real solutions to the real problems are an order of magnitude more complicated than that. In order to never have abortions, you have to engineer a more
just and supportive society with also a saner approach en totalia 
to human sexuality. The problem is circular. Those persons most opposed to Abortion are incidentally those perpetuating the social
paradigm which is most responsible for Abortions as a social outcome.

Maybe i go try to clean it up? Sorry again.

Their words are separated from their signature. When more than one person is talking, the issue gets very bad indeed. Take for example what you did at the Staff Lounge. It is difficult, if not impossible, to see immediatly if it is you or Robert Horning who is talking. Because of the lines it appears that those comments Robert made were done by anonymous contributors. Look at the lines you cut through in this section already. Just with 5 or so lines, we have 3 unsigned comments, any of which can belong to you or me. When there are more than 2 people in a discussion, it only gets worse.

:The ideal thing to do is to just add your comments below their post with one more indent level. Also, it is reccomended not to use the lines. I realize other wikis use the line notation for their discussion pages, but here at wikibooks, things are done differently. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

==No personal attacks comment==

I didnt understand your comment on [[User:Jguk]]'s talk page. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:48, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

:I hadn't seen your comment earlier (someone else had made a comment on a separate issue later, so when I checked the diff I didn't see it). I certainly don't read what you said as a personal attack.

:I understand how you feel about THINKSTARSHIP whilst its location is uncertain. About that, I can only say two things. 1) that it is not my decision, but the community's as to whether it meets WB:WIW (as amended by Jimbo). 2) that regardless of where that discussion ends up, it is no-one's intention to delete any wikibook covered by Jimbo's addition to WB:WIW from the internet. Plenty of time will be given to any book falling foul of that to find an alternative wiki which would welcome it. The conclusion from this is that any amendments and improvements you make to the book will stay.

:Another point I can usefully make is that if you could provide a clear explanation of why you believe it complies with the Jimbo-amended WB:WIW (assuming that you do believe that), that may help resolve the issue quickly. Without wishing to be rude, I have so far had difficulty in following the line of your arguments, which makes it more difficult for me (and no doubt others) to come to a view on this matter. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:47, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 01:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
Thanks for your answer. My argument is pretty complex. I think
that Jimbos actual wording and idea are being blown out of proportion
here. I'm caught in an interesting middle. I totally agree with Jimbo
in theory, via the lens of my interpretation of what i think he means. I don't think that everybody elses interpretation is realistic, and seems alarmist. I agree with Jimbo, mostly because i understand the information engineering angle. It is exactly the kind
of thing i could see myself saying 3 years from now when ThinkStarship gets big and has a lot of participants. I think that I
have tried to make an argument that thinkstarship is within the WB:WIW, I suppose it doesn't help that this is interspersed with comments where i try to get people to see what i see in terms of the wisdom of what he is actually saying on the one hand, and the difference between what he is actually saying, and how it looks to me
like everybody is misinterpreting that. To start with, the way its worded doesn't make it sound like its to be applied to anything in the past; its a foreward moving information engineering concept, nothing in the things said leads me to believe he meant it to be retroactive. Secondly, it looks like a pretty open ended Guideline,
not an absolutist and certainly not a literalist rule. From my perspective, Jimbo made a sensible new suggestion, and by virtue of imagining it to be retroactive, everybody has gone into a sort of panic attack. I'm glad you asked me this, I think i'll repost it
to Jimbo. ThinkStarship actually factually does sort of sit on the fuzzy line between fiction and fact, and on those grounds, I can't
claim absolutely to see myself as totally totally totally within WB:WIW. In fact, to some extent, Thinkstarship is sort of one big
toe over the line, and the rest very much in line. More important to
me personally is that ThinkStarship actually looks to me to have essentially a paralell mission statement to the whole of Wikibooks;
To generate an online library of textbooks covering '''every''' subject. In an absolutist or literalist interpretation of the rules,
especially the &quot;Must be reasonably useful to existing class&quot;, I don't
think ThinkStarship would pass. &quot;Existing Class&quot; is a pretty strong
qualifier. However, in a non absolutist and non literalist interpretation, ThinkStrships materials would be applicable to Classes in the very near future. Those classes would teach the subjects in question from a different angle than is currrently being used; Thats what a &quot;Thematic Unit&quot; does to a subject. Lastly, even tho i am VERY sympathetic to Jimbo, I agree with the assessment that
he is out of the loop. Its hard to continue to be a BENEFICIENT dictator when your participation is only 44 edits. I think he should
get his self over here and spend some time working with us before making Information engineering rules. The evolution of a place like
wikibooks is somewhat organic, and won't conform to expected rules.
What Jimbo can't understand is the molasses sort of way that books
creep foreward as compared to articles. I think we should quit deleting things in general, and start shelving them appropriately.
I keep saying over and over; get a &quot;fiction&quot; and &quot;pov&quot; bookshelf. We probably don't want to encourage those shelves to become populated,
but the fact is, people are going to come here and write stuff which they think in good faith is &quot;textbook&quot; and which isn't. Instead of deleting it, I think we should consider it a starter book, and look
for ways to improve it.

==Third response to brain dump commentary==

First, sorry for the delay getting back to you. I have been, and am still, extremely busy.

Regarding your most recent responses in the ThinkStarship thread:

''I'm feeling pretty sensitive to &quot;odd&quot; ideas lately. I have some good ideas and some mediocre ideas. All of my ideas are pretty well covered by science on the one hand and my willingness to allow process to be what it is, not what i assume on the other. Please forgive me if this sounds annoyed, but all i am doing here is trying to get the experts together to get them to solve the problems, not pretend that i allready have the answers.''

The thing is, some of the design choices you've made assume that you already have the answers. I'll try to give a better explanation below.

''This is all very interesting and i hope that you will consider making a presentation of this kind of information in the actual document.''

Regarding me adding material to WikiBooks for this project, I'm actually not sure this is the best place to put it. You're pitching this as a textbook, but what it actually appears to be is a &quot;design study&quot;, which is a different type of beast. Further, anyone with sufficient skill to be in a position to help actually implement a space colonization project will already have expertise in the areas you'd be teaching about in any textbook collection associated with ThinkStarship. I can see a WikiBooks project happening after the design study is done, to teach people about it, but what would best serve the interests of the project at present would be just improving existing texts on orbital mechanics, spacecraft design, existing proposed space habitat designs, ecology of closed systems, and so forth. This sidesteps the question of whether or not ThinkStarship belongs on WikiBooks by restricting contributions to things that definitely _do_ belong here.

If I find myself with large amounts of free time, I'll probably put an expanded version of my comments here on my own site, but that's not likely to happen any time soon.

''I think that this'' (nuclear pulse propulsion) ''is the primary form of &quot;nuclear powered&quot; rocket which i had been exposed to, but it was described very differently from what you have here. The bombs were going off almost inside the engine.''

Then it wasn't an Orion-style drive. You might be thinking of inertial confinement fusion drives, that cause a pellet to undergo fusion and explode, but I've already commented on them. We can't presently build them, and any technology for them in the planning horizon you're using would be too heavy to use for a space drive.

''Thats not true, my one claim to reasonable knowledge is that i found out 20 years ago basically what you are saying'' (about Bussard Ramjets) ''and was so heartbroken than i tinkered the idea up a lot to make it work in any case. My ramscoops aren't used for much in most cases other than to get more speed once allready moving, and they are nuclear powered magnetic/plasma driven, which means that they double as a magnetic thrust system.''

Again, what you are describing isn't a ramscoop. Any ramscoop that tries to collect hydrogen from the interstellar or even interplanetary medium has to be going fast enough that you don't need it for your colonization project, and _also_ gives a net loss for the reasons mentioned for Bussard drives.

There are &quot;nuclear powered magnetic/plasma&quot; drive designs, but I've already covered these under &quot;nuclear-electric&quot; drives. The closest to what you describe seems to be the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VASIMR VASIMR] drive, but any electric drive will have similar performance characteristics. I like Hall effect thrusters because they can be bought off the shelf right now and are very well understood, but both VASIMR and Hall thrusters avoid the erosion problems ion and classic plasma drives have, and so would be suitable.

''This isn't true, i do know how big space is, and, this is why i am talking about asteroid colonization, you see, a key component of the plan is to piggyback onto objects that are allready traveling around the solar system. Cruithnes closest pass is only abit farther out than the moon.''

Then you aren't factoring in how long you have to wait for your orbits to synchronize with each other. A requirement of any realistic colonization scheme is that you get from point A to point B in a short enough time that your environment maintenance systems don't break down. I'd handwaved this at 5-10 years in my original estimates. Unmanned probes can last a lot longer because they aren't as complicated and don't have to perform continual recycling. Colonies can only get away with longer lifetimes after being founded because they have a large amount of matter and energy freely available, making partially open-loop systems possible and relaxing power constraints. Your ship can't afford this, which I explain in more detail below, and you'd be stuck on the asteroid for a very long time before it passed close to another object you were interested in.

I don't think trying to avoid the problem by colonizing these _small_ asteroids is feasible. You have the problem of trying to run industry in microgravity, as previously mentioned, as well as lacking hydrogen (in the inner solar system), and having a higher rate of mass loss from your colony (matter lost goes away, rather than staying on the body you've colonized). You can't just spin the colony habitat - industry will be spread out all over the place, especially for power generation.

''i have contemplated these problems and still consider going after small rocks to be the best early tactic. I am not alone in this, a lot of other people have similar ideas.''

I've heard lots of people propose this, but haven't heard any reasonably sound plans for _how_ to do it. Certainly the claims of massive economical paybacks from the ones I've heard aren't convincing (we're already sitting on top of a ball of metal with lithophillic elements pre-concentrated). We already know how to build colonies and industry on larger bodies, so I fail to see why we wouldn't have these as the first targets of colonization.

''Again, I am not a physicist and i don't do algebra. I have on the other hand studied ecology sciences in pretty good depth, and I think i know what is possible. I'd be going for a garden as soon as the ships got into space because i know thats the best way to do it.''

This is the difficulty that I mentioned a couple of times above: you're assuming that something is the best solution without working the math to see when it makes sense and when it doesn't.

I ran numbers last week for recycling of air, water, and food, and got the following. The key is that it's _not_ free - you at the very least have to add power plant weight to handle the recycling load, and for air and water, that's the dominant constraint. Breakeven of stored supplies vs. recycling happens when supplies weight exceeds the weight of the recycling equipment (assumed here to mostly be power plant weight unless otherwise noted).

*The power plant is assumed to produce 100 W/kg. This is quite good for a closed-loop system; I was assuming 10 W/kg for my original posts. Cars get about 300 W/kg of engine-related system, but are open-loop. The higher the power to weight, the more maintenance it's going to need, and you can't do much maintenance on spaceship turbines sitting next to a live fission reactor, so 100 W/kg is probably _optimistic_.

*Recycling oxygen takes about 20 MJ/kg (mostly the cost of electrolyzing the water produced as an intermediate step). Humans consume about 1 kg/day (based on figures at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing Breathing] on Wikipedia), or about 1e-5 kg/second. Power required to recycle oxygen is therefore about 200 W per person. This corresponds to an added power plant weight of 2 kg. Breakeven happens after 2 days for our plant specifications, or 20 days for a more conservative plant, so air recycling is desirable. Reclamation of hydrogen from the methane produced isn't perfect, but it's close enough that this figure isn't thrown off much by the need to store extra water for hydrogen production.

*Recycling water takes a bit more than 2 MJ/kg (mostly the &quot;heat of vaporization&quot; of converting it to steam to distill). Humans consume about 2 kg/day on average (based on figures at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking Drinking] on Wikipedia), or about 2e-5 kg/second. This includes water in food, but most foods in storage will be dry, so it's a good estimate. Power required to recycle water is therefore about 40 W/person. This corresponds to an added power plant weight of 0.4 kg. Breakeven happens in hours for our plant specifications, or about 2 days for a more conservative plant, so water recycling is desirable.

*Producing food requires between 0.1 and 0.3 hectares per person, based on the best yields for crops given in Wikipedia's articles on agriculture in the first world. Power needed to light that crop area is an average of about 200 W per square metre (averaging over the day/night cycle and angle change for illumination on Earth), or 200 kW per person under the most productive possible conditions. This requires about 2000 kg of added power plant per person at 100 W/kg. Dried food consumed by a human is about 100 kg/year (0.3 kg/day), so breakeven against storage happens in 20 years for our power plant specifications, or 200 years with a conservative power plant, even if we ignore the weight of the crops and the hydroponics trays. Even the shortest breakeven time estimate is much longer than the estimated length of the trip, so producing food on the ship isn't practical.

You'd grow food on the ship if you were travelling between the stars, because the trip time is much longer than your breakeven time. You'd also grow food at a colony, because you get most of the weight of the power plant from local materials instead of materials you have to haul with you, making the breakeven (for transported materials vs. transported dried foods) much earlier. You wouldn't use it on an interplanetary ship, because carrying dried food is lighter.

It's important to be able to calculate this type of tradeoff, as it tells you what you can do under any given set of conditions, and what conditions you'd need to do any given thing.

''It'' (a rotating colony) ''solves more problems than it generates.''

I think you're underestimating the engineering problems it generates. A ship can do it, but a ship doesn't have to touch anything, and only has to do it for 10 years. A colony has lots of nonrotating infrastructure (for mining and power generation), which suffers the microgravity problems noted above and previously, and which your rotating colony has to interface with.

It's not impossible, but I don't see why we'd willingly do it.

''Muscles atrophy probably in less than .4 G.''

I don't see why muscle atrophy is a problem. Colonists would only have to move around at 0.1 G. I'd worry more about malfunctions of the body's internal organs or development problems for children born at the colony, and the numbers I'd heard cited for that said 0.1 G was acceptable. This lets us colonize all of the large gas giant moons, though unfortunately not Pluto or Ceres. It also provides enough gravity that heavy industry won't have insurmountable problems.

''I think that you are missing the point. I am a realist and a pragmatist. I know that there are serious problems to be solved. I am anxious for us to start working to solve them. If we don't have operational robots in time to lanch the first ships, then we will have other things to do wha they might have.''

My point is that you should assume that you're _not_ going to have operational autonomous general-purpose robots by launch time. The NASA study's estimate for a self-maintaining autonomous general-purpose facility was that it would be complex enough to require 1e+11 bits to describe the design. A human being, on the other hand, has a design stored in about 1e+10 bits. So, please realize that you're proposing to design from scratch a system ten times more complicated than a human being, when we can't even design a self-replicating single celled organism from scratch right now. It'll _eventually_ be something we know how to do, but if you want colonization in full swing in 50 years, you'll need to work with things we know how to build _now_. Going from &quot;design idea using known parts&quot; to &quot;fully functional spaceship ready to move colonists&quot; takes multiple decades. Going from &quot;first colony ship launched&quot; to &quot;multiple colonies established and mostly self-sufficient&quot; also takes multiple decades. Taking any technology from &quot;first experimental demonstration&quot; to &quot;something that can be reliably used&quot; takes at least a decade for things that are fundamentally _simple_. A system as complex as the robots you propose would take vastly longer, for reasons mentioned in my previous post (design difficulty and '''debugging''' difficulty go up worse-than-linearly with complexity). Any book on systems engineering or software design can explain why this is the case in far more detail than I am doing here, if you don't want to take my word for it.

In summary, to be realistic and pragmatic, you have to have tools that let you assess what approaches work best for moving your colony ship and keeping it habitable, and you have to assume that you'll be working with technology that's either widely available now or that has fully working prototypes now if you want colonization to occur in your intended timeframe.

The Adios Motherfucker (often abbreviated AMF and also known as a &quot;Blue Motorcycle&quot;) is a strong &quot;multi-liquor&quot; cocktail, similar and comparable to the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Long Island Ice Tea|Long Island Ice Tea]].

===Ingredients===
*1/2 oz. vodka
*1/2 oz. rum

===Notes===

*The AMF is very similar to the Long Island Iced tea, which uses cola and triple sec instead of the clear soda and Curaçao. 

*Many bars that cannot serve doubles consider the AMF (and its cousin, the Long Island), off-limits.  They are potent and go down smoothly by virtue of their mild flavor.

      <comment>/* cash-flow determination from two year's balance sheets, change in equity , and a detailed income statement */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a part of the financial statement required by law or the accounting standard.

A cash flows statement provides information beyond that available from other financial statement such as the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet. It is an important information because cash flow is essential to the continued operation of a business. The main purpose of the statement, according to the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) is to provide: 

* Information about the changes of an entity cash or cash equivalents in the accounting period.
* Information about a company borrowing and debts repayment activities.
* The company sale and repurchase of its ownership securities.
* Other factors affecting the company's liquidity and solvency.

The normal format of The Cash Flow Statement is:


'''Statement of Cash Flows for the period 1/1/2005 to 31/12/2005.'''

{|class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
! 
! Debit +/- 
! Credit +/- 
|-
|Cash flows from operating activities&lt;br /&gt;Cash receipts from customers&lt;br /&gt;Cash paid to suppliers and empoyees
|Balance c/d
|
|-
|Cash flow from investing activities          
|
|
|-
|Cash flow from financing activities           
|
|
|-
|Net increase/decrease/Change in the cash and cash equivalents
|
|
|-
|Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of period 
|
|
|-
|Cash and cash equivalents at the end of period
|
|
|}

Each of the above headings will have further details, such as Cash flow from operations with increase in account receivables, accounts payables, cash receipts from customers, payment for goods sold and operating expenses. The investing cash flow includes capital expenditures for long-term assets, sales of assets and investing in joint ventures etc. Financing cash flow includes debts financing, dispensing ownership funds and borrowings.

When activities that do not involve cash they are not normally disclosed on the statement, BUT the Standard requires such transactions to be disclosed by way of footnotes or on a separate schedule.

The importance of the Cash Flow Statement for investment decision making includes:
* Regular operations is sustainable or not.
* Sufficient cash generated to pay debts or not.
* The likelihood that the company needs further financing.
* Can unexpected obligations or opportunities be taken up by the company without difficulty.

==== cash-flow determination from two year's balance sheets, change in equity , and a detailed income statement ====
Using a divide-and-conquer technique, it may be possible to determine a cash flow statement from knowing a beginning balance sheet,
an ending balance sheet, a change in equity statement, and a detailed income statement. Even if there is not enough detail to calculate exactly,
it helps to correlate that the statements are consistent.

The first division is to divide cash flow into operating, investing and financing activities. 
Cash flow from :-
* operating activities - this can be seen by calculating changes in the ''current assets'' and ''current liabilities'', and from operating income and expenses in the income statement. Payment of interest on borrowings is regarded as an operating activity, as interest is a current liability arising out of a non-current liability.
* investing activities - these deal with changes in ''non-current assets''  , such as property and equipment, and investment of cash , such as shares, foreign currency, government bonds - and return on investment such as dividends from invested other entities and gains from sale of non-current assets , which can be seen in the investing income part of the income statement.
* financing activities - cash may be generated from creation of company shares, and used in  buybacks of company shares, payment of dividends on company shares, borrowing cash, and repayment of cash, and these can be seen in ''changes in non-current liabilities'', and in ''changes in equity'' in the change-in-equity statement. e.g. Repayment of a long-term debt from retained profits is a outgoing cashflow; dividends is a form of drawings and is a equity distribution cash flow; issuing discounts is regarded as a finance expense, but there is no cash flow.

Why separate current and non-current, and separate non-current asset cash flow from non-current liability cash flow ? Separating current from non-current helps to see if there is enough easily accessible cash for day-to-day operations : separating long-term assets from long-term liabilities may help to predict longer term cash flow problems. However, cash flow statements are more useful when seen in the entire series: for instance, the first cash flow statement of the company may show a large incoming cash flow from borrowing in the financial section; then subsequent cash flow statements show the company purchasing non-current assets with outgoing cash flow; not knowing about the first borrowing cash flow makes the company look good.

== IPA ==

There is no way that '''le''' and '''or''' and '''a''' can be the same sound, why is this Wikibook missing IPA transcriptions? I got the gist of Ö from the table underneath but the sentence provided at the top of the article completely baffles me, Peop'''le''' is ''not'' the same sound as C'''ur'''led, not in RP, nor in American English, nor in Australian or NZ English. +[[User:Hexagon1|Hexagon1]] ([[User_talk:Hexagon1|talk]]) 02:52, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
:I just stumbled across this book, and indeed some of the pronunciations are incorrect. I fixed the obvious ones I found by a quick look, and added IPA pronunciations. I didn't have time to check the whole article yet, so there still might be some inaccuracies. I'll see if I can do that later. --[[User:Jarkko Piiroinen|Jarkko Piiroinen]] 20:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

== electricity ==

perhaps a better example than &quot;electricity&quot; should be given for &quot;e&quot; since it is pronounced quite differently by speakers of american and british english.

== Erroneous examples ==

I don't know how things work in Finnish, but I was under the impression that ''ö'' is not at all the same sound as the vowel in &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;burn&quot;. They sound a bit similar, I suppose, but one is a front rounded vowel and the other a rhotic schwa (or something to that effect) and it may be rather misleading to explain the pronunciation that way. Also, Finnish has a length distinction, right?

The example &quot;oval&quot; given for Åå sound cannot be right, I would have thought &quot;awe&quot; or &quot;raw&quot; a better choice [[Special:Contributions/78.64.81.222|78.64.81.222]] ([[User talk:78.64.81.222|talk]]) 19:51, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

== V and W ==

I was wondering why the pronunciation example for W gives &quot;[v]ery&quot;, while the audio example pronounces Waltari with an English W? [[Special:Contributions/195.54.253.27|195.54.253.27]] ([[User talk:195.54.253.27|discuss]]) 00:20, 2 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Sidecar-cocktail.jpg|thumb|The Sidecar.]]

The '''sidecar''' serves as the foundation for many of the most popular cocktails of the last century: the Margarita, the Daiquiri, the Cosmopolitan, and the Kamikaze, to name a few.  The cocktail originated in Paris shortly after the first World War.

== Ingredients ==
* Brandy
* Triple sec
* Lemon Juice

(For the measurements, see &quot;Variations&quot; below)

== Garnishes ==
* Sugar rim
* Lemon twist

== Glass ==
* [[Bartending/Glassware#Cocktail|Cocktail Glass]]

== Instructions ==
# Apply sugar rim to cocktail glass
# Combine ingredients over ice
# Shake and strain into glass
# Add lemon twist

== Variations ==
* David Embury, who claims to know the drink's inventor, suggests an 8:2:1 ratio
* Robert Hess suggests a ratio of 4:2:1, and insists on Cognac and Cointreau
* In practice, most customers apparently expect a brandy-based Margarita
* Steve Jaffe offers a K.I.S.S. approach by simply exchanging the brandy and sugar rim for the tequila and salt rim in your favorite Margarita recipe to maintain a parallel flavor profile when introducing your Margarita drinkers to the Sidecar (magicbar@sbcglobal.net).

== Related Drinks ==
* The Daiquiri
* The Margarita
* The Cosmopolitan
1 oz cognac, 1 oz lemon juice, 1 oz Cointreau or triple sec. Shake with ice, and then strain into a cocktail glass. Sugar rim on the glass. See [[Bartending/Cocktails/Sidecar]] for details.


The Sidecar was originally invented at a bar in [[w:Paris|Paris]] for one of the patrons who was fond of arriving driven in a motorcycle [[w:sidecar|sidecar]].  [[w:David A. Embury|David A. Embury]] (''The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'', 1948) credits the invention to an American Army captain during [[World War I]] &quot;and named after the motorcycle sidecar in which the good captain was driven to and from the little bistro where the drink was born and christened.&quot; According to Embury, the original Sidecar had several more ingredients, which were refined away. A Sidecar according to Embury, a connoisseur of cocktails rather than a bartender, is simply a [[Bartending/Cocktails/Daiquiri|Daquiri]] with brandy as its base rather than rum, and with Cointreau as the sweetening agent rather than sugar syrup. He recommends the same proportions (8:2:1) for both, making a much less sweet Sidecar.

It is said that a proper Sidecar should be made with [[Cognac]] (at least a [[VSOP]] - Very Superior Old Pale) rather than just ordinary brandy. Cognac is technically brandy but it is easier to find a quality Cognac than a quality unflavored brandy. Also, since the Sidecar is a French creation, it is appropriate to use a distinctly French liquor.

===First Listed Recipes for the Side-Car===
The first recipes for the Side-car appear in 1922, in Harry MacElhone's Harry's ABC of Cocktails and Robert Vermiere's Cocktails: How to Mix Them. 


Side-Car

Fill the shaker half full of broken ice and add:

1/6 gill of fresh Lemon Juice.
1/6 gill of Cointreau.
1/6 gill of Cognac Brandy.

Shake well and strain into a cocktail-glass.

This cocktail is very popular in France. It was first introduced in London by MacGarry, the celebrated bar-tender of Buck's Club


After giving his formula, MacElhone writes, &quot;Recipe by MacGarry, the Popular bar-tender at Buck's Club, London.&quot; Vermiere provides a little more detail: &quot;This cocktail is very popular in France. It was first introduced in London by MacGarry, the celebrated bar-tender of Buck's Club.&quot; MacGarry--I haven't been able to dig up his first name--was still tending bar at Buck's in 1940, so he must've been doing something right. Whether he invented the recipe or found it (Fernando Castellon, based upon what evidence I do not know, states in his recent Larousse des cocktails that he encountered it at a villa in the South of France), MacGarry's formula (as reported by both MacElhone and Vermiere) called for equal parts cognac, Cointreau and lemon juice, and made no mention of the sugar-frosted rim.  

Later, an &quot;English School&quot; of Sidecars emerged, as found in the Savoy Cocktail Book (1930): one-half cognac, one-quarter each lemon juice and Cointreau. I prefer this one, myself.

===David Embury Quote on the Side-Car===
&quot;The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot; (1948) by David Embury 

&quot;This cocktail is the most perfect example I know of a magnificent drink gone wrong. It was invented by a friend of mine at a bar in Paris during World War I and was named after the motorcycle sidecar in which the good captain customarily was driven to and from the little bistro where the drink was born and christened. As originally concocted it contained some six or seven ingredients in place of the three now set forth in practically all recipe books.&quot;

===The Side-Car was developed from...===
As for the drink's Prehistory: Certainly the Brandy Crusta is in there. Also in there, though, is the Brandy Daisy. While this began its life as a Brandy Fizz--brandy, juice of half a lemon, dashes of gum syrup--with orange cordial in place of some of the sugar, by the 1880s it was served in a cocktail glass rather than a fizz glass, and had only a little fizz water in it. By 1900, one even finds an English recipe omitting the fizz water altogether (although, truth be told, it also omits the orange cordial, substituting Yellow Chartreuse). Somewhere out of all this, the Sidecar emerged. Its proportions of lemon juice and orange cordial are much more like those of the Daisy, while it loses the bubbles and swipes the Crusta's sugar rim.

===The Sugar rim on the Side-Car===
The earliest mention for the sugar rim on the Sidecar glass is 1934, in three different books: 

Burke's Complete Cocktail &amp; Drinking Recipes, 

Gordon's Cocktail &amp; Food Recipes,

Drinks As They Are Mixed (a reprint of Paul E. Lowe's 1904 book, with a couple of pages of &quot;Popular Specials&quot; spliced it).

Birth of the Sidecar
By Stan Grayson

Out in front of the Ritz Bar, where the opulent Hispano-Suizas and Rolls-Royces lined the Rue Cambon, there appeared one day a young American and a tiny two seat French automobile.  “You call that thing a car” asked the Ritz’s famous bartender, Frank.  “That’s a child’s toy; that’s more like the size of a sidecar than a regular car.”  The scene was repeated frequently.  “You here again, Mr. Side Car?  What will it be this time?”
	Eventually the young man, a twenty-one-year-old Floridian-in-Paris named Horace Chase – nephew of Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner – decided to have Frank mix a special drink.  “What will it be?” he answered the loquacious bartender’s inevitable question.  “Well in Florida, I used to mix Bacardi and lemon juice and a little Cointreau.  Let’s try that but use brandy instead.”  Horace pronounced his brainchild a tasty concoction indeed and those at the bar who eagerly sampled it agreed.  Frank, as the drink’s craftsman, was pleased too and he christened the new cocktail at once.  He called it a Side Car, thinking of Horace’s distinctive little vehicle in the street out front.  That machine was an Amilcar.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean Cuisine]]

Bibimbap (also called Bibimba or Bibimbop) or Dolsot Bibimbap is a typical Korean meal that literally means &quot;mixed rice&quot; The meal consists of a bowl of steamed white rice topped with vegetables, beef (sometimes tofu or chicken to suit tastes), a whole egg, and kochujang (Korean chili pepper paste). Kochujang is usually served separately to control the spiciness of the dish. It is often made vegetarian by substituting tofu for beef. The ingredients below are the most typical of the dish although many other ingredients and often served on the side depending on the cooks preferences. The quantity shown serves 3. If your bowls are large, you can pack more into each and share them.

== Master Ingredient List ==

* ¾ to 1 ½ c rice 
* ¾ c kimchi
* 1 lb steak
* 2 small carrots
* 10 oz spinach
* 8 oz bean sprouts - with beans attached 
* 3 eggs
* 1 cucumber
* ¼ c + 2 tsp sesame oil
* ¼ c ground sesame seeds
* 1 tsp grated garlic
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil (peanut, olive, etc)
* ¼ c soy sauce
* salt

== Overview ==
Start the rice cooking in a rice cooker or pot. While the rice is cooking make the namurus (side dishes). Then make the beef soboro. Finally, assemble the ingredients in the bowls and cook them. Grate the garlic and grind the sesame seeds for all the namurus as once. Sesame seeds expand when ground; 2 or 3 tablespoons of sesame seeds will make ¼ cup of ground sesame seeds.

== Carrot Namul ==
'''Ingredients'''

* 2 small carrots
* 2 tbsp sesame oil
* 2 tbsp ground sesame seeds
* ¼ tsp grated garlic
* a pinch or two of salt

'''Procedure'''
Cut the carrots into matchsticks. Boil in salted water for a few minutes covered. Drain. Rinse with cold water until cool. drain again, then put in a bowl. Add the sesame oil, ground sesame seeds, grated garlic, and salt. Mix with your fingers.

== Spinach Namul ==

'''Ingredients'''

* 10 oz spinach
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 2 tsp ground sesame seeds
* ¼ tsp grated garlic

'''Procedure'''
Put the spinach in a large covered pot with an inch of water. Bring to a boil and cook as usual. Stir occasionally to keep the spinach from sticking to the pot. The spinach is done when it's dark green and reduced to a small fraction of its original volume. Drain the cooked spinach. Cool by adding cold water to the pot and drain again. Squeeze the spinach in your hands to remove the water. Slice the cooked spinach into 1-inch pieces. Put the cooked spinach in a bowl with the sesame oil, ground sesame seeds, and grated garlic. Mix with your fingers.

== Bean Sprout Namul ==
'''Ingredients'''

* 8 oz bean sprouts 
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp ground sesame seeds
* ¼ tsp grated garlic
* a pinch of salt

'''Procedure'''
Blanche the bean sprouts in a pot of salt water until they become clear. Drain and put the cooked sprouts in a bowl. Dress with sesame oil, ground sesame seeds, grated garlic, and salt.

== Beef Soboro ==

'''Ingredients'''

* 1 tbsp olive oil (peanut, vegetable, etc)
* 1 lb steak
* ¼ c soy sauce
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tbsp ground sesame seeds
* ¼ tsp grated garlic

'''Procedure'''
Slice the steak thinly, but not paper-thin. Heat the oil in a large frying pan on high. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the beef. Stir-fry. While the beef is cooking, add the sesame oil, ground sesame seeds, and grated garlic. Cook until the meat is well browned. Add the soy sauce. Continue cooking until the liquid has boiled off.

== Egg Topping==

Cook eggs over easy to your own personal preference.


== Serving ==

Place rice in each bowl and add ingredients separately to sit on top in a color pleasing setting along with the chopped uncooked cucumbers. The egg sits in the middle. kochujang, kimchi and any other root or leafy vegetable is served on the side in small individual bowls for the table to help themselves. 



== Dolsot Bibimbap==


If using dolsots to serve your Bibimbap the preparation is slightly different as it is a hot version of the meal so the process will heat the vegetables again. 

Rub the inside of the dolsots with sesame oil. Spread the cooked rice evenly over the bottom of the dolsots and part way up the sides. Place the namurus and the beef soboro on top of the rice, each in its own area. Cover the dolsots and cook over medium-high heat. Watch carefully near the end to avoid burning the rice on the bottom. To test, use a spoon to scrape the rice from the side. Remember that the bottom cooks more than the sides and that the rice keeps cooking after you remove it from the heat. Do no preheat the dolsots.

Add an uncooked egg to the middle of each dolsot. Place dolsots on small pieces of wood to keep the heat from damaging the table. To eat, start by scraping the rice from the bottom and stirring the ingredients together with a metal spoon. The egg will cook as it breaks up. The rice on the bottom will be crunchy and sometimes hard to remove unless you continue stirring as you eat.

== Alternative Ingredients ==

Vegetables that can be served on the side (in small individual bowls) include lettuce (instead of cucumber), Shitake Mushrooms, Duraji Namul, Kong Namul, Gaji Namul, Sukju Namul, Gosari Namul, and Hobak Namul. Other ingredients like dried sesame seeds, seaweed (gim: dried in paper thin sheets and often seasoned)  are added to the mix at varying times, depending on personal taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dan. Welcome to Wikibooks. I hope you enjoy your time here.

Can I just check whether you are aware of [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]]. Generally cocktails should only appear on the glossary unless there is something too long for the glossary that can usefully be said about them (indeed, some of your new additions (from Wikipedia?) are duplicates for pages that have already been merged into the glossary and deleted.

As I note, where a cocktail is genuinely worthy of its own page, it should indeed have one, and it should be linked from the Glossary too. 

Finally, if you have ideas on how to improve the Glossary, they would be appreciated too, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:37, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with your comments on my talk page. My point really is that the glossary should be just that, and that there should be separate pages for many of the cocktails, but this should be done only where we have more content on a particular drink than would reasonably be covered in the glossary.

:Before the glossary was created by merging articles we had over 200 of them, the overwhelming majority of which were stubby, giving little more than the ingredients and very basic instructions and were poorly formatted (though there were exceptions to this). No-one in their right mind would want to read them. If we end up with a glossary and 40, say, full, good-looking, informative articles about the more popular and/or tricky cocktails, that would be great, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

::By all means format the glossary better. Do bear in mind, of course, that the glossary is really a throwback to the (sometimes quite poor) articles mass transferred here from wikipedia, rather than to lots of well thought out, specially designed pages made with this wikibook in mind. I also think it will still be of interest to those who drink cocktails and amateur bartenders at home, although I accept that it has little or no value to the professional. The glossary is also a good place to chuck any future poor articles that come here from wikipedia:). As long as you're committed to making sure all your pages look good and complete before moving onto the next series of cocktails, I can see this book soon becoming a &quot;Book of the Month&quot;, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== Templates ==

Hey, awhile ago I made some templates for ingredients, for example {{tl|vodka}} {{tl|tequila}} {{tl|gin}}. Any opinions on their usefulness or any changes you think should be made? [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 20:48, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

Measure was an attempt an internationalising the recipes although it needs linking to the measurements and conversions page explaining that U.S. recipes use 1 fl. oz (us customary) and the rest of the world use 25ml. the difference is only about 3ml and the ratios are the same. A simplier and perhaps more familiar word would be parts, but that still needs some explaining as to the recommended volumes for glass sizes etc. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 12:27, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

I did think it might be too rigid to include measures in the templates, I was experimenting with things at the time. For things like the martinis with widely ranging ratios they should be listed as variations on the martinis page, a lot of the different ratios are distinct enough to have their own names after all.

As for categorising by base-spirit, I can see how its not going to be very useful at the moment (a bloody mary would have gin and tequila listed from its variations), In the long term i'd like to see variations with unique names moved to their own pages to help improve indexing of the recipes etc in which case it might become slightly more useful but leaving the categorisation in templates means we can remove it or add it back later easily without having to change hundreds of pages. I did intend there to be a template for every ingredient eventually which while it would take awhile to set up makes changing links and categories later a whole lot easier, and while base spirit isnt that useful at the moment a category such as cocktails with Green Chartreuse certainly would be.

As far as internationalisation is concerned the british reference books i have seen so far all use measures or parts as the majority have come from imperial measurements in some form but have taken advantage of the fact that 1 fl.oz~25ml in order to make it more accessable to everyone. In most cocktail chains here also they use in-house recipes given only in metric, while im sure the more professional bars are familiar with jiggers and ponies etc the more casual bars and the average uk reader is not. I see nothing wrong with fluid ounzes being used as thats pretty simple for everyone but i'd like to avoid jiggers, ponies, cups etc. I would still prefer to see parts or measures being used however to have consistency across the recipes as the actual difference in volume between imperial and metric recipes is sufficiently small that they are effectively the same recipe, in which case it makes no sense to use a mixture of units across the book. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 01:51, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

Removing the measure thing from the template is fine by me, I'll do that later today.

Consistency is important across a book which is why i think we should ideally be using only one set of measurements. This is more important in my eyes than making it easy to contribute, and converting to and from ratios should be something any reader can do quickly, I think its overly-optomistic to cater this book towards professional bartenders, especially in its current state. We should list all known measurements on the measures page so it is there if people need it but i dont think they should go beyond that. Anyway we should get some more opinions I'll ask Jguk after this. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 15:10, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

==WIIIIIIIIIIIIGA==
I am currently trying, very slowly, to write a Wikibook to learn [[w:Uyghur language|Uyghur]]. 

'''TODO.'''
* Write a [[Write Arabic]] book, specifically concerned with only how to read (that is, parse) and write Arabi scripts. So ''not just Arabic''. Will probably adopt some of the approaches of [http://www.declan-software.com/arabic/index.htm ReadWrite Arabic], since it seems very good. Animated gifs for all!!
** ''The Arabic alphabet: how to read and write it'' by Nicholas Awde &amp; Petros (? can't read my own handwriting) Samano, 1986.
* Um... go back to Uyghur...






==Cookbook stuff==
I'm Australian and did a bunch of editing under [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=203.214.115.130 my IP] before finally succumbing to yet another wikimedia project. Argh!

I'll probably mostly be interested in the '''[[Cookbook]]''' I think. I think there's a lot to be done! I like adding pictures because I personally almost never cook a recipe if it doesn't have a picture.

If you want some photos for a recipe feel free to suggest it to me. But the ingredients should be understandable to me and it should be vegetarian. Eggs &amp; dairy products OK.

I find the whole concept of copyright in relation to recipes pretty suss. Someone once told me you can't copyright the method, just the particular way you've described it. So it's perfectly fine to rewrite the method in your own description, and voila, your copyright. Really???

[[Image:Chocolate.jpg|200px|right]]
'''Melting chocolate''', for example for [[Cookbook:icing|icing]], is not always easy. When it goes wrong, it goes horribly wrong. There are several methods.

If you are not using chocolate chips or &quot;melts&quot;, be sure to cut/break up the chocolate into smaller pieces.

==Stove-top method==
You will need a saucepan and an oven-proof bowl that can sit on top of the pan without falling in it and without dipping in too low.

It is crucial to not let any water come in contact with the chocolate. If this happens, the chocolate will &quot;seize up&quot; and this method won't work: you will have to start all over again. This is why the bowl must fit well over the saucepan. The bowl must be absolutely dry as must any stirring implement used.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Melting chocolate - step 1.JPG|1. Fill the saucepan with water.
Image:Melting chocolate - step 2.JPG|2. Place the chocolate (and in this case, butter too) in the bowl and place the bowl on top of the saucepan.
3. Boil the water in the pan. 
Image:Melting chocolate - step 3.JPG|4a. Chocolate begins to take on &quot;sweaty&quot; appearance.
Image:Melting chocolate - step 4.JPG|4b. Chocolate starts to mark the bowl and the edges of the individual pieces become soft.
Image:Melting chocolate - step 5.JPG|4c. Most has melted, but individual chunks are still discernible - it's not smooth.
Image:Melting chocolate - step 6.JPG|4d. We can no longer see individual pieces. (Note that melting chocolate by itself results in a much smoother, more viscous fluid.)
5. When the chocolate is smooth, carefully remove the bowl and pan from the heat.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

      <comment>/* Garlic */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Garlic ==

I changed the mention of cloves of garlic to toes (cloves) of garlic. I'm partially a Kiwi but I grew up in Malaysia. I have always referred to them as cloves. However the original author of this recipe referred to them as toes. While this is a slightly strange name for me, unless there is any specific style policy that requires us to refer to them as cloves, I don't see any reason not to respect the original authors name in this case. It would help if the person who changed the name from toes to cloves had a more respectable history. However Eadmund history shows he/she embarked on a thankfully short-lived crusade to change recipes to a style he/she preferred. While some of these changes we helpful or didn't really create any difference, his/her most disruptive changes included removing or replacing any metric measurements and removing the F for Fahrenheit from temperatures. He/she also changed Tablespoon etc to Tbsp. Although this was also a style change, I feel it was fairly neutral and didn't make any significant difference. But since the original author apparently preferred toes of garlic, I feel this is a style we should respect. BTW, is toes the common way to refer to cloves of garlic by Americans?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
In a deployment scenario on Mac OS X, Linux, or Solaris, your applications will most likely be deployed on Apache.  Additionally, if you develop with WODirectConnectEnabled=false (you '''should''', see the [[Programming:WebObjects/Web Applications/Development/Direct Connect|Direct Connect]] section for details), you will be running your application locally through Apache as well.  Apache is a very extensible web server that provides a huge number of capabilities, some of which we will detail here.

=== Split Install ===
WebObjects applications are deployed in a &quot;split install&quot;.  A split install means that your application code, components, and resources are deployed in one location to be served from your WebObjects application (on OS X, /Library/WebObjects/Applications/YourApp.woa), while your WebServerResources are installed in another location (on OS X, /Library/WebServer/Documents/WebObjects/YourApp.woa/Contents/WebServerResources) to be served directly by Apache.  This provides the optimal performance scenario, as Apache is specifically tuned for serving static content, and it does not make sense to send requests for large binary files through WebObjects if it is not necessary.

=== mod_expires ===
To get the most performance out of Apache, you should make sure that you have mod_expires enabled.  mod_expires controls the caching headers that are applied to static resource requests.  Depending on your installation, Apache may default to mod_expires disabled, which would cause your end-users' browser to re-request every resource on your site on every page, even if it's a common header graphic.

An example mod_expires configuration might look like:

  &lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault A60
    ExpiresByType image/bmp A3600
    ExpiresByType image/gif A3600
    ExpiresByType image/ief A3600
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg A3600
    ExpiresByType image/png A3600
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;

You will also need the corresponding type-extension mappings:

  &lt;IfModule mod_mime.c&gt;
    AddType image/bmp bmp
    AddType image/gif gif
    AddType image/ief ief
    AddType image/jpeg jpeg
    AddType image/jpeg jpg
    AddType image/jpeg jpe
    ...
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;

This tells Apache that when a request is made for a type image/gif, the requesting browser will be told not to request the image again for an hour (A3600 = 3600 seconds).

=== mod_rewrite ===
Anyone who has used WebObjects has likely noticed that WebObjects URLs are long (http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/AppName.woa/wa/something).  It is a common request to make these URLs nicer for end-users who are used to just requesting &quot;http://yoursite.com&quot;.  Fortunately Apache provides an amazingly extensive module called &quot;mod_rewrite&quot; that allows you to rewrite the URL requests of your site based on a series of regular expressions and rules.

Aaron Rosenzweig has a very thorough article about [http://www.jewelryluv.com/fashion/pageWithName/ModRewrite using mod_rewrite with Apache].

==== mod_rewite with mod_webobjects ====
I ran into a problem with mod_rewrite when using mod_WebObjects where mod_WebObjects had be loaded first or it just wouldn't work properly (it would work fine with cgi-bin adaptor).

So in http.conf, search for mod_rewrite and change it to:

  LoadModule WebObjects_module    /System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache/mod_WebObjects.so
  LoadModule rewrite_module         libexec/httpd/mod_rewrite.so

, find again:

  AddModule mod_WebObjects.c
  AddModule mod_rewrite.c

There's still a load module in /System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache/apache.conf, but you can just ignore it -- it produces a warning about being loaded twice.

==== Mike Schrag ====
Here's an example mod_rewrite we use on one of our apps:

  &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/$ /page/HomePage [R]
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^appNum=([-0-9]+)(.*)$
    RewriteRule ^/page/(.*)$ /cgi-bin/WebObjects/AppName.woa/%1/wa/viewPage?pageName=$1%2 [L,PT]
    RewriteRule ^/page/(.*)$ /cgi-bin/WebObjects/AppName.woa/wa/viewPage?pageName=$1 [L,PT,QSA]
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;

The WOA produces URLs in the format http://site.com/page/HomePage?appNum=2, which turns into http://site.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/AppName.woa/2/viewPage?pageName=HomePage.

=== WebObjects Adaptor for Apache 2.2 ===
==== Travis Cripps ====
A number of people have expressed interest in using the WebObjects adaptor with Apache 2.2.x.  I finally gotten a chance to sit down and work on it today.  I'm writing to let you know that it's available in the Project Wonder CVS repository.

The necessary changes turned out to be mostly minor updates to change calls to outdated/deprecated functions.  The biggest (and non-trivial) change was for SSL support.  It's been re-written to use Apache's mod_ssl module.

I've tested with MacOS X 10.4.7, Apache 2.2.2, with and without ssl support.  It works in all of my tests.

Configuration of the web server to work with the adaptor turned out to be surprisingly challenging, due to the new, very strict default access rules that ship in Apache 2.2.x httpd.conf file.  Once I discovered that, it was trivial to change the setting, but it's worth mentioning here to save some people a lot of frustration.

The new default configuration is:

  &lt;Directory /&gt;
     Options FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride None
     Order deny,allow
     Deny from all
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

Your options are to comment out the last 2 lines of that block, or to override them in a VirtualHost block.  Just setting the usual Location block didn't seem to work for me.

And, of course, either change the name of the WebObjectsAlias setting from /cgi-bin/WebObjects to &lt;foo&gt;/WebObjects or comment out the ScriptAlias definition for the /cgi-bin/ directory.

Other than these tips, it's pretty much the standard compilation and installation, and configuration.

# Alter the make.config file in the Adaptors directory of the Wonder repository to reflect your apache installation setup.*
# Run make to build the Adaptor
# Curse because of that one setting you forgot.  Fix it.
# make clean; make
# Install the mod_WebObjects module with apxs
# Configure your httpd.conf and either link or copy the WebObjects directory from the standard location (if on MacOS X) to your new htdocs directory.
# apachectl configtest; apachectl graceful
# Test.
# Curse again.  Change the httpd.conf file as necessary.
# apachectl graceful.  Go to 8 as necessary.
# Finally!  apachectl graceful

Enjoy your shiny new WO adaptor. :)

*Note: if you are getting the error
  libtool: compile: unable to infer tagged configuration
  libtool: compile: specify a tag with `--tag'
  apxs:Error: Command failed with rc=65536

Add to the end of your make.config the following:
CC = gcc

I readded the mention to can of crushed tomatoes. The original author suggested can crushed tomatoes. This was replaced by Eadmund with spagehetti sauce without any discussion. While in this instance, Eadmund weren't really disruptive and are a useful addition, I don't see any reason why we should remove the originals author's suggestion of crushed tomoatoes (personally, that would be a bit bland). Also, I have made sugar optional since sugar wasn't in the original authors suggestion and the bit on Dominoes makes it clear that some people might not want to add sugar in any case.

I have also reworked the section on Domino's. Firstly, many people won't know what domino's is. Also, the taste is probably akin to most fast-food like pizza outlets. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 13:55, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== My Suggestions ==

This page needs to be totally reworked, or even deleted. While I appreciate the author's effort to share information, the page is disorganized and the info is somewhat suspect (This last is a totally subjective opinion from a long-time Itallian cook). I'm loathe to completely disect the original article, but I'd split it into three pages: (1) a quick-n-easy homemade pizza sauce; (2) additions to store-bought sauces; and (3) assembling a pizza.

[[User:William Peterson|William Peterson]] 08:05, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

I agree with the above. Personally, I'd prefer it if there were measures for fresh herbs instead of the dried kind, and I'd like it if it were more authentic.

Technically pizza sauce is a pretty vague term anyway. Are we talking margherita? If so, that's just plain tomato sauce and basil leaves. Is it the american style? If so, new york, chicago, or california style?</text>

The recipe stated 256°F as the temperature. But the stage described sounds like hard crack which is not 256°F. Since this is taffy, we can expect it should be either soft crack or hard crack. Therefore, I have changed the temperature to the temperature range for hard crack. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 14:17, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

==How to write a Poetry Commentary==

In order to write a proper IB Paper 1 style essay, the following guidelines must be followed.
For the IB commentary, you are expected to explain a given poem or prose. While it is not to be confused with a detailed explanation as you might expect in college which would be anywhere from 5-15 pages in length, the commentary is less formulaic and structured than the World Literature papers, but at the same time, it adheres to formal standard English.

There are several disagreements as to what constitutes a commentary. Some hold that by nature, it is not formal--it can be a running &quot;commentary&quot;(hence the term, &quot;commentary&quot;) of what the examinee sees in a given poem. Though this approach runs the risk of seeming like a literary version of a grocery list, as long as the examinee sees some overarching, organizing method--an idea, concept, or literary device that the poet uses to hold the poem together cohesively--the commentary need not be as tightly formulaic as the five paragraph thesis paper (which is generally despised in most circles because it discourages divergent thinking).

Others say that this organic approach makes it impossible to surmise any actual literary analysis through this approach. A beginning &quot;thesis&quot; of what the poem's focus, followed by organizing the analysis into patterns, strands, or organizational groups, makes it easy to follow a persuasive, holistic presentation.

All agree, however, on the paramount importance of framing one's literary analysis within the terms and devices of poetry; one must both identify literary elements, analyze its purpose and effect, and speak intelligently as to tone, diction, structure, mood, and form.

Below are some literary devices to get you started.
:*'''[[w:Accent|Accent]]''': refers to the stressed portion of a word. An accent is used to place emphasis on a word. '''
::*Note''': accent and stress can be used interchangeably. 
:*'''[[w:Allegory|Allegory]]''': A description that has a second, usually moral meaning.  
:*'''[[w:Alliteration|Alliteration]]''': is the repetition of initial (at the beginning) CONSONANT sounds (if it's a vowel repetition, you would call it assonance. Assonance includes any repetition of a vowel sound in any part of the word. It usually occurs in the middle of words).  
:*'''[[w:Allusion|Allusion]]''': refers to an event from an external content. It is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the reference in question (as the writer assumes the reader has).
:*'''[[w:Apostrophe (figure of speech)| Apostrophe]]''': Something that addresses an object or person or idea who is not present as though he/she/it could reply.
:*'''Antithesis''': The juxtaposition of contrasting words or ideas to create a feeling of balance (e.g Too black for heaven, and yet too white for hell)
:*'''[[w:Assonance|Assonance]]''': The repetition of vowel sounds may also add to euphony.
:*'''Aubade''': Poetry referring to either the dawn, a love song or about parting lovers. 
:*'''[[w:Ballad|Ballad]]''': A form of poetry in a specific meter meant to be sung. There is always a repeating refrain and it is always narrative in form. See below for more information.
:*'''[[w:Blank verse|Blank verse]]''': Iambic Pentameter that doesn't rhyme. (Much of Shakespeare's plays for example were written in blank verse.)
:*'''Caesura''': A cut or break in a line, could be a comma or a semicolon. 
:*'''[[w:Cacophony|Cacophony]]''': Harsh sounding and generally unpleasant. 
:*'''[[w:Literary consonance|Consonance]]''': The repetition of consonant sounds NOT in the beginning of a word (which would be alliteration). Enforces relation. 
:*'''Continuous Form''': Lines follow each other without any type of structural organization except by blocks of meaning.
:*'''Didactic Poetry''': Poetry with a directly morally teaching purpose.
:*'''[[w:Euphony|Euphony]]''': Pleasant sounding.
:*'''[[w:Extended Figure|Extended Figure]]''': An apostrophe, simile, metaphor, etc. which is developed throughout a poem.
:*'''[[w:Imagery|Imagery]]''': Language which appeals to each of the five senses. 
::*'''Visual imagery''': Sight. The most frequent type.
::* '''Aural or auditory imagery''': Sound.
::* '''Olfactory imagery''': Smell.
::*'''Gustatory imagery''': Taste.
::*'''Tactile imagery''': Touch, tangibility.
::*'''Organic imagery''': Human sensations, hunger for example.
:*'''[[w:Irony|Irony]]''': Dramatic or otherwise, conveying an aspect that is intrinsically unexpected or self-contradictory.
:*'''[[w:Metaphor|Metaphor]]''': A comparison between two unlike things without using the words &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as&quot;. 
:*'''[[w:Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeia]]''': Words which are written to mimic a sound. (SHAZAM! SPLAT! PLOP!)
:*'''[[w:Paradox|Paradox]]''': A statement which appears to contradict itself but makes sense (usually in an abstract sense). 
:*'''[[w:Personification|Personification]]''': Animals and inanimate objects are given human characteristics.
:*'''[[w:Phonetic Intensive|Phonetic Intensive]]''': A word whose sound emphasizes its meaning. 
:*'''[[w:Prose|Prose]]''': Language which is not in meter.
:*'''[[w:Refrain|Refrain]]''': A repeated line, phrase, sentence, etc. which appears throughout a poem.
:*'''[[w:Rhetorical Poetry|Rhetorical Poetry]]''': Poetry written in superfluous language with the intention of being overdramatic.
:*'''[[w:Scansion|Scansion]]''': The process of measuring verse. 
:*'''[[w:Simile|Simile]]''': The comparison of two subjects using &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as&quot; or something similar
:*'''[[w:Sonnet|Sonnet]]''': See link.
:*'''[[w:Tone|Tone]]''': The writer's attitude toward the subject. 

'''Advanced Vocabulary for the Daring'''

:*'''[[w:Apostrophe_(figure_of_speech)|Apostrophe]]''': A poem directed to a person or thing not present/alive.

====Step 1: Reading the Poem====
----
:* Read the poem silently once. Take a mental note or actually write down if you can't remember any impressions, emotions, or confusions the poem may originally stir. 
:* Read the poem once more; try to understand its meaning or the course of events it may describe.
:* Read the poem aloud if possible. If you're in an exam room you can read the poem under your breath. Take note of the tone and speed of the poem. 
:* Read the poem again and take notes about the literal and figurative context of the poem. This should include its meaning on the literal level and any figurative meanings it may include.
:* Read the poem again, this time looking for literary devices. These should be, but not limited to:
::*Imagery
::*Assonance
::*Consonance
::*Onomatopoeia and Phonetic Intensive words
::*Metaphors, Similes, and Personifications.
::*Juxtaposition and Contrast
:* Once you're sure you've found these literary devices, proceed to look further for:
::*What does the title suggest- is it related to our understanding of the poem?
:::*'''Note''': Compare your first impression of the title to its actual meaning.
::*Does the poem have an apostrophe?
::*Are sections cacophonic or euphonic? If so, do the previous literature features make them so?
::*Is there any irony?
::*Does the poem have an extensive figure?
::*Is there a refrain?
:*Next, once you've gone through the poem's meaning and its literary devices- it's time to look for form! 
::*'''Note''': Knowing a poem's scansion is not necessarily required. You don't need to state this poem is written in dactylic hectometre, but it’s pretty obvious if a poem is written in iambic pentameter and counting meter isn't too difficult. 
::* Is the poem in a continuous form, a stanzaic form, or a fixed form? (Such as a Ballad or a Sonnet) 
::* Take note of the poem's structure- how many stanzas, how many lines, etc.
::* Make extra note of the author's tone and how this influences the poem.

====Step 2: Looking for Detail====
----
:* Now that you've found the poem's literal and figurative meanings, its form, and its literary devices - it's time to get to work! 
::* Make connections - in what ways do the poem's literary devices add to the poem's meaning?
::* What effect does the writer's tone have on the reader's perception of the poem?
::* What effect does meter and form have on meaning?

----

An excellent way of keeping your entire commentary in focus is, asking yourself these simple yet significant questions:

1) What's being said (content, maybe theme, character, ideas, relationships, ideas, love, peace etc.)  


2) How is it being said (stylistic devices, rhyme, structure, diction, etc.) 


3) So What? (I.e. for what ends, purposes, extrapolation chances, personal connection and response, etc.)

Remember it's not a grocery list of memorized terms- barfed out in a time period of 2 hours. It is supposed to be an intricate and insightful response to what you as a reader, understand from the text, the author's intended message. The planning phase is perhaps the most important, even more important than the writing phase (which comes naturally succeeding it, if planning goes well the written should be equally responsive).

====Step 3: Structuring your Commentary====
----
:*There is no definitive structure to a poetry commentary; this isn't like writing a history essay. However, structure is an important aspect in writing a poem commentary and you can prepare yourself in advance by having some notion of the order in which you will write. Here is an example of a possible essay structure:
::*'''Note''': Everyone is different, if you want to write your poetry commentary in a different form, by all means do so- '''this is merely a suggestion''' aimed at guiding your writing.

:*'''Introduction'''
::* State the poem's title, author, and a small introduction to the poem's overall literal meaning. 
::* State the poem's form, and any important literary devices which appear throughout it.
::* Write about an important aspect of the poem which you will further discuss in your wildcard paragraph and eventually conclude in your last paragraph.

:*'''Paragraph One: Structure and Narration'''
::* Briefly mention the poem's structure. Make note of the use of [[w:Enjambment|Enjambment]] or the [[w:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] of words.
::* Write about the poem's meter and its speed.
::* Make note of the poem's speaker (do not use narrator) and his/her tone.

:*'''Paragraph Two: Meaning'''
::*State the poem's literal meaning.
::*State the poem's figurative meaning.

:*'''Paragraph Three: Devices'''
::*Write about the poem's literary devices.
::*Write about important themes present in the poem.

:*'''Paragraph Four: Combine'''
::*Write how literary devices and meaning interconnect.
::*This paragraph should begin to bring things together.

:*'''Paragraph Five: The Wild Card'''
::*Introduce an important theme or aspect of the poem in great detail. This could be a refrain, an extended figure or an apostrophe. 

:*'''Conclusion'''
::*The conclusion should combine the Wild Card with the above paragraphs. In this case, one could talk about how literary devices or the poem's structure aid in supporting an extended figure.

Here is another suggestion for a structure which requires about 10-15 minutes of planning, but is still just as efficient-
:*'''Introduction'''
::* State the poem's title, author, and a small introduction to the poem's overall literal meaning. 
::* If any, state the relevance of the background of the author (i.e. their philosophies, causes, a message..)
::* Construct a 'map' to your answer. Concisely, write one sentence on each idea that will be put forth in the essay

:*'''Paragraph One: Idea One'''
::* Use PETER
:::* '''P'''oint: State the point you are trying to prove, e.g. The conflict in the extract symbolizes change
:::* '''E'''vidence: Give evidence for the conflict by quoting
:::* '''T'''echnique: State the literary features
:::* '''E'''laboration: Develop your point further and give a deeper explanation on your point. Also state the reason for the point that the author was trying to make, or the reason for which the literary feature was used
:::* '''R'''esponse: Describe the emotions or ideas evoked into the reader, if any

:*'''Paragraph Two: Idea Two'''
::*e.g. Point: The first person narrative is used to gain empathy from the reader.
::*(Follow the same pattern as used for the first idea)

(An ideal commentary has '''3-5 ideas'''. Remember to focus more on developing the ideas than to have more of them. 3 well developed ideas will fetch more marks than 6 baseless points.)

:*'''Conclusion'''
::*(Off record: One must realize that a conclusion is usually just the introduction which is paraphrased with a more conclusive tone and possibly a fact or two more!)
::*The conclusion must contain a brief summation of all the points you have made and why were they the most important. It could also include some personal interpretation that you are not confident about adding in the body of your essay.

====Step 4: Example Commentary====
-----
Confused? Don't be! Here everything will be made clear as together we'll decipher a poem. Our poem of choice is '''[[w:I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud|The Daffodils]]''' by '''[[w:William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth]]'''.

I wandered lonely as a cloud
:That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
:A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.


Continuous as the stars that shine
:And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
:Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced, but they
:Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A Poet could not but be gay,
:In such a jocund company:
I gazed--and gazed--but little thought

What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
:In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
:Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,

And dances with the daffodils.

:* Try to do it by yourself first- even if roughly.

:*'''Ready'''?
:*'''First impression''': The poem is extremely euphonic and uses quite a bit of pleasant imagery. When spoken, it rolls off the tongue naturally. This reinforces the poem's joyful tone which proceeds through out the poem except for momentarily in the fourth stanza where the first two lines are cacophonic. The poem deals with an extended figure which may be considered an apostrophe.

:*'''Structure''': The poem is in a stanzaic form of four stanzas of six lines each. The rhyming scheme alternates at first, ABAB, but ends in a rhyming couplet CC which adds to the euphony of the poem and the ease at which it's spoken. The lines are in iambic tetrameter.
::*'''Note''': Meter can be found by counting the syllables in each line and simply dividing them by two. If this is the same for each line, then the poem is written in a specific meter.
:*'''Speaker''': The speaker is obviously the poet himself. By sharing his own first experiences with such a crowd of daffodils the reader gains the same first impressions.
:*'''Literal Meaning''': The poet recalls his first experience of seeing such a wondrous crowd of daffodils beside a bay. The blowing wind moves them in an awesome formation, a spectacle of nature of which the poet remembers in order to lift his spirits.
:*'''Figurative Meaning''': Everyone has had their good experiences in life. Perhaps it's the sensation of getting a new dog or seeing a beautiful bird take flight. It's important for us to remember those experiences, in times when we are down. 

:*'''Imagery''':  Lots of visual imagery
::* &quot;Golden daffodils&quot; (4)
::* &quot;Sparkling waves&quot; (14)
::* &quot;stars that shine / and twinkle on the milky way&quot; (7-8)
:* '''Kinesthetic imagery'''
::* &quot;Fluttering and dancing in the breeze&quot; (6)
::* &quot;Tossing their heads in sprightly dance&quot; (12)
::* &quot;The waves beside them danced&quot; (13)
:* '''Metaphors and Similes'''
::* &quot;I wandered lonely as a cloud&quot; (1)
::* &quot;Continuous as the stars&quot; (7)
:*'''Personification of the Daffodils'''
::* I saw a crowd / a host, of golden daffodils (3-4)
::* Tossing their heads in sprightly dance (12)
::* In such a jocund company (16)
:*'''Assonance'''
::* A host of golden daffodils (3)
::* Beside the lake, beneath the trees (6)
::* For oft when on my couch (19)
::* heart with pleasures fills (23)
:*'''Alliteration'''
::*Beside... beneath... breeze (5-6)
::*stars...stretch...shine (7-8)
::*glee...gay...gazed...gazed (13-15)
:*'''Repetition''':
::* Dance (6), (12), (13), (24)
::* Gazed (15)

:* Wildcard: '''Importance of the Speaker'''
::* The speaker shows a great tranquility and appreciation of nature. The juxtaposition of the first two lines of the last paragraph with the rest of the poem and the use of the word &quot;couch&quot; suggest unhappiness with the material surroundings.

:* Great! Now that we've written down the basic aspects of the poem- it's time for us to connect their meanings and effects!

'''The Commentary'''
----
&quot;The Daffodils&quot; by William Wordsworth describes the poet's sight of a spectacular field of daffodils situated by a bay. He uses worldly imagery to magnify such a small feat of nature in an attempt to demonstrate how both nature and memories are important in dealing with many of the woes of a modern society. The personified daffodils are the center of the poem which is written in a stanzaic form with a consistent rhyming scheme. Through the use of literary devices and intensive visual and kinesthetic imagery, the reader is able to adopt the same feeling of awe at this simplistic spectacle as once felt by the poet.

The poem is written in stanzaic form of four stanzas each consisting of six lines with each line written in iambic tetrameter. For the first four lines of each stanza, the rhyming scheme alternates as ABAB, but ends with a rhyming couplet. This stanzaic form serves to reinforce the poem's euphony, with the ending the consistent rhyming scheme serving to ensure that the poem progresses smoothly. Indeed, the structure of the poem may even serve to reflect the extended figure of the poem, for like the daffodils, we too are entranced by the product of its general simplicity. The poem is told through the eyes of the poet himself. 

The poem describes in detail, a simplistic wonder of nature, a &quot;crowd, / a host, of golden daffodils&quot; (3-4) situated &quot;along the margin of a bay&quot; (10). The daffodils &quot;dance&quot; (6) and though not mentioned directly, this dance is most likely caused by the wind. The poet is amazed at two things, the sheer number of daffodils, comparing their numbers to the number of stars in the &quot;the milky way&quot; (7) and the intricate dance that they produce. He then states that the waves of the lake also danced, most likely ripples once again caused by the wind, but the effect the wind had on the flowers &quot;Out-did the sparkling waves in glee&quot;(13). The sight was so beautiful that the poet &quot;gazed and gazed&quot; (17), clueless of the &quot;wealth&quot; (18) gained from the experience. From then on, when the Poet is in a &quot;vacant mood&quot; (20), he recalls this experience in his mind and his &quot;heart [fills] with pleasures&quot; (23) as he too &quot;dances with the daffodils&quot; (24).

(Note: this commentary isn't the best example... the use of the quotes at the end is exactly what IB doesn't want. Additionally it's far too short - a commentary should be about one thousand words)

==Patterns of failure==
'''''General:'''''
*'''JCRT''' (1968-85) - PMID 2033433, 1991 &amp;mdash; &quot;Regional nodal failure after conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage breast carcinoma.&quot; Recht A et al. J Clin Oncol. 1991 Jun;9(6):988-96.
**Retrospective. 1624 pts. Stage I-II treated with breast conserving therapy. Median f/u 77 months. 
**Regional nodal failure was first site of failure in 2.3%.
***'''For pts undergoing axillary dissection''' and RT to the breast only: ''Axillary failure'' was 2.1% for those who were node negative and 2.1% for those with 1-3 positive nodes. ''Supraclavicular recurrence'' in 1.9% (N0) and 0% (1-3 LN). 
***For cN0 pts '''without axillary dissection''' treated with breast + axilla RT: ''Axillary failure'' 0.8% and  ''supraclavicular failure'' 0.3%. 
**Salvage after failure: only 47% of pts achieved control after treatment for a nodal relapse.


===Supraclavicular===
*'''Germany''' (1978-88) - PMID 8276654, 1994  &amp;mdash; &quot;The prognostic significance of the supraclavicular lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients.&quot; Kiricuta IC et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Jan 15;28(2):387-93.
**Retrospective. 21 pts with supraclav metastasis at diagnosis and 38 pts who developed supraclav mets after therapy. Compared with 20 pts with M1 disease at diagnosis and 278 pts who later developed distant mets.
**Survival of pts with supraclav mets was similar to those with M1 disease. 2-yr and 5-yr OS was 52% and 34% with SCLV at diagnosis vs 50% and 16% with M1 disease at diagnosis.  


'''''After mastectomy:'''''
*PMID 3002595, 1986 &amp;mdash; &quot;The significance of supraclavicular fossa node recurrence after radical mastectomy.&quot; Fentiman IS et al. Cancer 1986 Mar 1;57(5):908-10.
**35 pts. Survival intermediate between single nodule and multiple nodule groups.

===Internal Mammary===
[[Image:Tumor_Breast_IM_recurrence.JPG|thumb|Left internal mammary node recurrence]]
{{clear}} &lt;!--this forces the section break to occur AFTER the image instead of through it--&gt;

==Prediction==
*'''2006 NSABP''' PMID 16720680 -- ''Gene Expression and Benefit of Chemotherapy in Women With Node-Negative, Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.'' (Paik S, J Clin Oncol. 2006 May 23; [Epub ahead of print])
**Prospective PCR gene-assay of 21 genes (RS score). Used 651 tissue blocks from ''NSABP-20'' patients. 227 tamoxifen, 424 tamoxifen + chemotherapy. Patients ranked &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; for distant recurrence risk
**High RS score: large benefit from chemotherapy, absolute decrease in 10-year recurrence rate 28%
**Intermediate RS score: unclear benefit
**Low RS score: no benefit from chemotherapy, absolute decrease in 10-year recurrence rate -1.1%
**Conclusion: The RS assay not only quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, but also predicts the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit.

*'''2004 NSABP''' PMID 15591335 -- ''A multigene assay to predict recurrence of tamoxifen-treated, node-negative breast cancer.'' (Paik S, N Engl J Med. 2004 Dec 30;351(27):2817-26. Epub 2004 Dec 10.)
**Prospective PCR gene-assay of 21 genes (RS score). Used 668 tissue blocks from ''NSABP-14'' patients. BCA node-negative, on tamoxifen. Patients ranked &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; for distant recurrence risk
**Patient proportions: low 51%, intermediate 22%, high 27%
**10-year recurrence rate: low 7%, intermediate 14%, high 30% (recurrence score independently predictive)
**Conclusion: The recurrence score has been validated as quantifying the likelihood of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.

==Treatment==
*Limited data available
*Probably reasonable to re-treat with 45-50 Gy, or if hyperthermia with 30-35 Gy


'''''General:'''''
*'''Multi-Institutional; 2008''' (1993-2005) PMID 17869019 -- &quot;Multi-institutional review of repeat irradiation of chest wall and breast for recurrent breast cancer.&quot; (Wahl AO, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Feb 1;70(2):477-84. Epub 2007 Sep 14.)
**Retrospective. 8 institutions. 81 patients treated with repeat RT for breast/CW recurrence. Median dose first RT 60 Gy. Median dose second RT 48 Gy. Median interval 3.2 years. Concurrent HT 54%, concurrent chemo 54%. Median F/U 1 years
**Outcome: CR 57%; no variable predictive, but trend for hyperthermia benefit (67% vs. 39%, p=0.08)
**Toxicity: Late Grade 3/4 5%
**Conclusion: Repeat RT to CW is feasible, acceptable toxicity, and encouraging response rates

*'''Germany; 2002''' (1987-96) - PMID 12153940 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy in the treatment of locoregional relapses of breast cancer.&quot; Schuck A et al. Br J Radiol. 2002 Aug;75(896):663-9.
**5-yr OS 43%. Chest wall recurrences associated with improved survival.

===Salvage Breast Conservation===
There is a scant amount of published information on treatment of IBTR with salvage breast conserving surgery as opposed to salvage mastectomy, but SBCS is feasible in selected patients. There does not appear to be a loss of survival to those treated with SBCS, but they are at risk for continued local recurrences.

*'''Yale; 2005''' ( PMID 16199315 -- &quot;Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast conservation therapy: outcomes of salvage mastectomy vs. salvage breast-conserving surgery and prognostic factors for salvage breast preservation.&quot; (Alpert TE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Nov 1;63(3):845-51.)
**Retrospective. 146 pts with IBTR after BCS+RT. Of these, 30 refused mastectomy and opted for salvage breast-conserving surgery (SBCS); the other 116 underwent salvage mastectomy (SM).  Of SM pts, 28 pts had multicentric disease (known prior to surgery by mammogram or PE). 
**Median f/u 13.8 yrs. OS 64.5% at 10 yrs overall (SM, 65.7%; SBCS, 58.0; NS). No difference in rate of DM (30%) between groups. Local recurrence: 19% (SBCS) vs 4% (SM).
**Half of pts with BRCA1/2 mutations had multicentric disease at time of mastectomy.
**Conclusion: Long-term survival is possible after IBTR. Salvage mastectomy represents the standard of care, but SBCS appears feasible in select pts (favorable biology). Survival does not appear to be compromised by SBCS. There does not appear to be a Pts with BRCA1/2 mutations are less appropriate for SBCS. Pts treated with SBCS are at continued risk for subsequent IBTR.

*'''Marseille (France); 1988''' (1963-86) PMID 3129175 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142%2819880515%2961:10%3C1969::AID-CNCR2820611006%3E3.0.CO;2-O/abstract Full text] -- &quot;Results of wide excision for mammary recurrence after breast-conserving therapy.&quot; (Kurtz JM, Cancer.  1988 May 15;61(10):1969-72.)
**Retrospective. 118 pts treated with BCS+RT for breast cancer developed local recurrence. Of these, 52 pts with recurrences &lt; 2cm (with no skin changes and no signs of rapid growth) were selected for salvage breast conserving surgery with wedge resection (+/- axillary dissection). 96% of these recurrences were near the original tumor (true recurrence). 
**Median 6 yrs. OS 79% at 5 yrs, 64% at 10 yrs (from date of 2nd surgery). DM in 27%. Freedom from breast recurrence 78%
**Second local or regional recurrence in 23% (12 of 52; 10 - breast alone; 1 breast + nodes; 1 nodes only) at median interval 36 months.  10 of 12 second recurrences were operable
**In 10 of 18 pts undergoing axillary dissection, positive nodes found. 
**Conclusion: wedge resection of small in-breast recurrence results in acceptable alternative to salvage mastectomy.

===Supraclavicular node recurrence===
*'''MDACC; 2011''' (1975-1994) PMID 21168284 -- &quot;Long-term outcomes in patients with isolated supraclavicular nodal recurrence after mastectomy and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for breast cancer.&quot; (Reddy JP, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Aug 1;80(5):1453-7.)
**47 pts (treated prospectively on clinical trials) developed SCLV recurrence with or without other locoregional recurrence (but no DM). Compared outcomes with pts who had LRR not involving SCLV lymph nodes. 
**3-yr DM-free survival 40% (SCLV) vs 54% (non-SCLV); OS 49% vs 69%; both SS. 
**Isolated SCLV recurrence: 23 pts had isolated SCLV recurrence. Overall survival was similar to those with isolated CW recurrence. 5-yr OS 25%.
**Conclusion: &quot;Although breast cancer recurrence with SCV involvement carries a high risk of distant metastasis and death, among women with recurrence limited to the SCV alone, overall survival after isolated SCV recurrence can be long (25% &gt;5 years).&quot;

*'''Italy''' - PMID 16446058, 2006 (1995-2002)&quot;Prospective multicenter study of combined treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer women with the rare clinical scenario of ipsilateral supraclavicular node recurrence without distant metastases.&quot; Pergolizzi S et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 May 1;65(1):25-32.
**Prospective, non-randomized. 44 pts. Treated with doxorubicin or taxol based chemo x 6 courses and RT to 60 Gy to &quot;involved field.&quot; RT given between 3rd and 4th cycles of chemo. 
**Overall response 94.9%. Median TTF 28 months and MS 40 months. 5-yr OS 35% and DFS 20%.

*'''Netherlands''', 2003 (1984-94) - PMID 12833449 &amp;mdash; &quot;Detection, treatment, and outcome of isolated supraclavicular recurrence in 42 patients with invasive breast carcinoma.&quot; Van der Sangen MJ et al. Cancer. 2003 Jul 1;98(1):11-7.
**42 pts with isolated SCLV failure after axillary dissection. Treated with various modalities
**CR achieved in 83%, but of these 34% developed a second SCLV relapse. 5-yr OS (based on date of sclv recurrence) was 38%.

===Hyperthermia===
*''Please also see the main [[Radiation_Oncology/Hyperthermia|hyperthermia]] page


*'''Duke''' (1994-2001) -- RT +/- hyperthermia
**Randomized. 109 patients with superficial tumors (&lt;= 3cm depth); breast 65%, H&amp;N 13%, melanoma 10%. Tumors had to be &quot;heatable&quot; on initial HT. Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) RT + HT. Hyperthermia to &gt;43C x1 hour, 2x/week. RT dose 30-60 Gy if previous RT, otherwise 60-70 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx
**'''2005''' PMID 15860867 -- &quot;Randomized trial of hyperthermia and radiation for superficial tumors.&quot; (Jones EL, J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 1;23(13):3079-85.) 
***Outcome: CR RT 42% vs. RT+HT 66% (SS). Patients with prior RT had most benefit (68% vs. 23%, SS)
***Toxicity: Well tolerated, 1 Grade III thermal burn
***Conclusion: Significant local control benefit for HT

*'''International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group''' (1988-1991) -- combined results from 5 PIII trials
**Randomized. ''5 trials merged due to slow accrual, closed early after benefit.'' 306 patients. Advanced primary or recurrent BCA; 50% active disease outside treatment area. Could have had prior RT. Trials: Dutch Hyperthermia Group (DHG), Medical Research Council (MRC BrI and BrR), European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology (ESHO), and Princes Margaret (PMH). Target hyperthermia 43C. RT given in various fractions.
**'''1996''' PMID 8690639 -- &quot;Radiotherapy with or without hyperthermia in the treatment of superficial localized breast cancer: results from five randomized controlled trials. International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group.&quot; (Vernon CC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jul 1;35(4):731-44.)
***Outcome: CR RT 41% vs. RT+HT 59% (SS); greatest effect in recurrent lesions in previous RT, where re-irradiation dose was low. 2-year OS ~40% (NS), 74% patients progressed outside HT area during follow-up
***Conclusion: Combined result demonstrated efficacy of hyperthermia as adjunct to RT for treatment of recurrence

*'''Wisconsin; 1991''' (1981-1989) PMID 2000551 -- &quot;Hyperthermia and irradiation for locally recurrent previously irradiated breast cancer.&quot; (Phromratanapongse P, Strahlenther Onkol. 1991 Feb;167(2):93-7.)
**Retrospective. 44 patients, locally recurrent previously RT BCA. RT mean 30 Gy (16-56). Hyperthermia goal 43 C for 60 min.
**Outcome: CR 41%, PR 23%, NR 36%; small tumor s(&lt;= 6cm2) significantly better CR 65% vs. 26%); higher thermal dose (&gt; 50 tumor-minutes at 42.5C) better 53% vs. 14%
**Conclusion: Higher thermal doses and smaller tumors associated with more favorable response

*'''Henry Ford; 1989''' (1984-1987) PMID 2642537 -- &quot;Local superficial hyperthermia in combination with low-dose radiation therapy for palliation of locally recurrent breast carcinoma.&quot; (Dragovic J, J Clin Oncol. 1989 Jan;7(1):30-5.)
**Retrospective. 30 patients with locally recurrent BCA (28 prior RT, median dose 50 Gy). RT 32/8 given BIW 4 Gy/fx. HT immediately after RT, goal 43 C for 60 minutes
**Outcome: CR 57%, PR 36%. Long-term local control 80%. Lesions &lt;5 cm significantly more likely to respond
**Toxicity: 30% persistent non-healing ulcer (in 80% associated with persistent tumor)
**Conclusion: Palliative RT + hyperthermia in previously treated CW has value

==Systemic therapy==
*'''CALOR Trial''' (Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for LOcally Recurrent Breast Cancer; IBCSG 27-02 / BIG 1-02 / NSABP B-37) (closed 2010)
**'''2012''' [http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/72/24_MeetingAbstracts/S3-2 Abstract]: San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (Dec 2012), Abstract #S3-2. &quot;Chemotherapy prolongs survival for isolated local or regional recurrence of breast cancer: The CALOR trial&quot; (Aebi S).

***Locoregional recurrence of breast cancer, radically resected (R0 or R1) +/- RT. Can involve breast, chest wall / scar, axillary nodes, IM nodes. No SCLV involvement. Pts randomized to: chemotherapy or observation. 
***Both arms can receive hormonal therapy and/or HER2-directed therapy. 
***RT recommended in all pts. Mandatory for pts with positive margins. 
***Closed early with 162 pts, no interim analysis. (Original sample size 977 pts).
***Over 50% of original recurrences were in-breast recurrences (IBTR).
***5-yr DFS 69% (chemo) vs 57% (no chemo). 
****ER+: DFS 70% vs69%.  ER-: 67% vs 35%. 
***5-yr OS 88% vs 76% (SS). 
****ER+: OS 94% vs 80% (NS). ER-: 79% vs 69% (NS)
***Conclusion: adjuvant chemotherapy improved DFS and OS. The data are strongest for patients with ER-negative recurrences. Longer follow-up is necessary for pts with ER+ recurrences.</text>

== cryptographic hash comment ==

The article states: &quot;In fact, even a cryptographic hash does not provide protection against an adversary who wishes to degrade hash table performance by choosing keys all hashing to the same bucket.&quot;  That depends on the cryptographic hash being used.  A few years ago it was shown MD5 was broken when it came to strong collision resistance (it should be hard to find two different messages m1, and m2, such that hash(m1) = hash(m2)), but I don't believe that to be the case with SHA-1, the cryptographic hash used in the example.</text>

==&quot;Believe in hope&quot;==
- The philosophy during this time was to &quot;believe in hope&quot;, because it &quot;saved one from doubt, dispair, and the Slave World.&quot; This was shown in a radio adaptation of ''A Miracle on 34&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt; Street'', where Kris Kringle emphatically says so. In later times, this attitude came to be associated by some with romanticism. Hope was defined as &quot;A desire of some good, accompanied with an expectation of obtaining it, or a belief that it is obtainable; an expectation of something which is thought to be desirable; confidence; pleasing expectancy.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">AmigaOS is the default native operating system of the Amiga personal computer. On top of a basic kernel called Exec, it includes an abstraction of the Amiga's unique hardware, a disk operating system called AmigaDOS, a windowing system called Intuition and a graphical user interface called Workbench.

== AmigaOS to version 1.3 ==

The 1.x versions are the original implementation of AmigaOS. They defaulted to a distinctive blue and orange colour scheme which was designed to give high contrast on even the worst of television screens (it could easily be changed by the user). Versions 1.1 consisted mostly of bug fixes. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 were distributed only on floppy disks for the Amiga 1000.

Version 1.2 was the first to have Kickstart on a ROM and Workbench on one or two floppy disks. Workbench was then booted from floppy disk or installed on a hard disk on later machines. The early Kickstarts were still available on floppies for Amiga 1000 owners. These versions were shipped in ROM with the A500, A1500, CDTV (1.3 only) and A2000. Version 1.2 of Kickstart fixed many bugs, greatly improving the stability of the system, and added AutoConfig support which could automatically configure expansion boards. Release 1.3 had few changes to Kickstart (mainly to enable autobooting hard disks) but had many improvements in Workbench, including a much faster file system for hard disks, an improved CLI, and various extra programs.

== AmigaOS 1.4 ==

Kickstart/Workbench 1.4 was a beta version of the upcoming 2.0 update and never released, but the Kickstart part was shipped in very small quantities with early Amiga 3000 computers, where it is often referred to as the &quot;Superkickstart ROM&quot;. In these machines it is only used to bootstrap the machine and load the Kickstart that will be used to actually boot the system. The appearance is similar to that of 2.0 and higher, with just minor differences. It is, however, possible to dump out of the OS selection screen by clicking where one would expect to see a close gadget. This will cause the machine to boot Kickstart 1.4 using either the wb_2.x: partition, or from a floppy.

== AmigaOS to version 2.1 ==

Kickstart/Workbench 2.0 introduced a lot of major advances to the Amiga operating system. Gone was the harsh blue and orange colourscheme, replaced with a much easier on the eye grey and light blue. The Workbench was no longer tied to the 640×256 (PAL) or 640×200 (NTSC) display modes, and much of the system was improved with an eye to making future expansion easier. For the first time, a standardised &quot;look and feel&quot; was added. This was done by creating the Amiga Style Guide, and including libraries and software which assisted developers in making conformant software. Technologies included the GUI element creation library gadtools, the software installation scripting language Installer, and the AmigaGuide hypertext help system.

== AmigaOS to version 3.1 ==

3.x was another major update. Updates included:

* A universal data system, known as datatypes, that allowed programs to load pictures, sound and text in formats they didn't understand directly, through the use of standard plugs (see object-oriented operating system)
* A system-standard localization system, allowing the user to make an ordered list of preferred languages; when a locale-aware application runs, it asks the operating system to find the catalog (a file containing translations of the application's string) best matching the user's preferences
* Colour remapping for low-colour display modes
* Improved visual appearance
* Better support for background images

== AmigaOS to version 3.9 ==

Along with this update came a change in the way people referred to the Amiga's operating system. Rather than specifying &quot;Kickstart&quot; or &quot;Workbench&quot;, the updates were most often referred to as simply &quot;AmigaOS&quot;.

Updates included:

* CD filesystem support as standard
* Distribution on CD instead of floppy disk
* Supplied with TCP/IP stack, web browser, and e-mail client
* Improved GUI, called &quot;ReAction&quot;
* AVI/MPEG movie player (OS3.9)
* Support for hard disks larger than 4Gb (a limitation from 1.x)
* HTML documentation
* MP3 and CD audio player (OS3.9)
* Dock program (OS3.9)
* Improved Workbench
* Find utility (OS3.9)
* ASync workbench (no more waiting for files to be copied)

== AROS ==

[[w:AROS Research Operating System|AROS Research Operating System]] is an attempt to clone the AmigaOS API in a portable open-source operating system. Although not binary compatible with AmigaOS (unless running on 68k), users have reported it to be highly source code compatible.

''See [[Aros|AROS wikibook]].''

== AmigaOS 4.x ==

A new version of AmigaOS is being developed by Hyperion Entertainment under license from Amiga, Inc. The 4.0 version will be a major update a decade after the last official release.

Main features planned for AmigaOS 4.0:

* Tripos legacy code finally removed
* Improved TCP/IP networking
* Fully skinnable GUI
* Virtual memory
* Limited memory protection
* CD/DVD writer support, including Mt. Rainier
* Integrated debugger
* Integrated viewer for PDF and other document formats
* Enhanced shared library model
* Support for PowerPC (native) and 68k (emulated JIT) applications
* Improved input device support
* Support for modern hardware devices
* New USB stack
* New PCI stack
* New interface module (replaces the jump table of classic AmigaOS)
* Stack enlargement
* Resource tracking
* Faster memory allocation system, similar to what’s used on Solaris
* 2 GB file limit removed
* New version of AmiDock with plug in support
* New CDFilesystem with Joliet and HFS support, DVDRW support
* HDToolbox replacement
* New HD Recovery tool
* Added support for Truetype and Postscript fonts, with optional anti-aliasing
* Integrated Picasso 96 2D Graphics API
* Integrated Warp3D 3D Graphics API
* Integrated AHI Sound API

== MorphOS ==

MorphOS is a PowerPC native operating system, originally created when the future of the Amiga looked uncertain. It provides binary compatibility with system-friendly AmigaOS applications. A version which runs on Classic Amigas with PPC accelerator cards has been released.

MorphOS is a mixed proprietary and open source operating system produced for the PegasosPPC hardware platform by a core development team and contributors. The OS itself is proprietary. Several libraries and other parts are open source, such as Ambient (the desktop interface).

It currently runs only on PowerPC processors by Freescale and IBM while still supporting the original AmigaOS MC680x0 applications via its proprietary task-based emulation solution and most of the newer, PPC/AmigaOS applications using API wrappers. It is API-compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 but implements many enhancements that bring it up to date, and a modern GUI based on MUI.

Two key deficiencies of MorphOS are the absences of a built-in native TCP/IP stack and a web-browser with modern capabilities. The user community is attempting to remedy this through the use of bounties that have so far resulted in a functional, available, but unfinished version of MOSNet, and an unreleased port-in-progress of KHTML browser, based on GTK+WebCore.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Funnieness==

Lets just make all the sub-titles funny. It seems like the right thing to do!
Examples:

Red Cabbage Indicator: Red cabbage indicator is great for showing if something is acid or alkali. It's that freak'n exciting!

Pinhole cameras: Want to be able to look at the sun and solar eclipses without destroying yours eyes to such a state that you will never be able to see again? Then this is for you!

Electricity with Lemons: Yeep, those juices you put in your highly conductive drinking water have the potential to store electricity! Amazing!

Making rainbows in liquids: Have the time and skill to remain still in order to see pretty colors in liquids? Then this is most certianly for you!

Build your own periscope: WOW! It now takes even LESS energy to look around corners. What an age we live in!

Power a boat with ordinary soap: The best part is: it is a boat powered with ordinary soap!

Make a fantastic Squirting Egg: Want to annoy other people by squirting them with eggs and not even put enough energy into it to crack an egg? Then this is for you!

Make a spinning paper helicopter: You can make a helecopter out of paper! Do you need any other reason to do this experiment? 

[[User:N1person|N1person]] 21:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

:I like it! &lt;JLP&gt; Make it so!&lt;/JLP&gt; [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:31, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

::Remember the audience; we are writing for 8-11 year olds, so the word freak'n, while not a swearword as such, is not appropriate. Furthermore, encouraging negative character traits or actions such as &quot;Want to annoy people...?&quot; should surely be avoided. Ditto graphic hyperbole:

&lt;center&gt;''&quot;...without destroying yours eyes to such a state that you will never be able to see again?&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;

Surely replace with: &quot;...without hurting your eyes?&quot; [[User:Editus Reloaded|Editus Reloaded]] 17:36, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Science behind each experiment ==

We should include a section with each article about the sceince behind each experiment. That way you aren't just, &quot;making pretty colours&quot;.

[[User:N1person|N1person]] 23:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

:OK, I'm looking for a good point to start editing Wikibooks and this looks right up my street. I guess I'll start from the top and work down. [[User:Editus Reloaded|Editus Reloaded]] 17:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:I agree! The point of this site is to learn! [[User:Fruit Boy|Fruit Boy]] ([[User talk:Fruit Boy|talk]]) 18:13, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

Yea, There appears to be an Air of Cynicism just lurking around, Not sure why.

== Hazard advisory? ==

I just happened upon this page by chance. The experiments are interesting. In my quick look round I saw no single warning of hazard. This was also true when the ingredients included hydrochloric acid. I strongly urge that inclusion of specific, appropriate hazard warnings.
:You do not need anyone's permission to do that yourself.  In fact, we would be grateful if you were to do just this! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:26, 16 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Reparo''''' is a spell for fixing broken things, for example a glass bowl that has broken into several pieces. It can also be used to counter the effects of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Diffindo|Diffindo]] charm. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell was first used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s glasses in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], shortly after Harry's exit from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]], though the incantation is not heard there. Curiously, it is also the last spell we see actually cast in the series.

This spell is used a number of times through the series to repair things – dropped glass or china bowls, broken windows, torn bags, or torn books, for instance.

== Analysis ==

It is only in the final book of the series that we learn that it can be used to repair magical items, when Hermione tries to mend Harry's wand with it, and later when Harry successfully mends his own wand. Until that point, only non-magical items had been repaired with this charm.

This spell seems to be useful only for inanimate objects – it is not used on Harry's broken wrist, for example. (Though the charm that &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; used on his wrist in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] does not have the desired effect...)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Categories ==

Should the potions (love potion, Draught of Living Death, etc.) that are listed under Devices be put in a seperate category strictly for potions?
[[User:Saberiel|Saberiel]] 04:14, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
:Leave potions as they are, under devices. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 20:19, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

== Mudblood ==

should there be a separate page for &quot;Mudblood&quot;, as it is merely a pejorative for &quot;Muggle-Born&quot; or &quot;Half Blood&quot;?... its like having a page for &quot;Jew&quot; and then one for &quot;Kike&quot; [[User:Draganta|Draganta]] 15:02, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
:True. The page is a redirect now and its listing on the Magic page is gone. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:50, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
::I disagree. It's an offensive term for '''either''' of those, and it's not even mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Half-blood|Half-blood]]. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 15:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
:::Mentioning it in one place is all that should be done, though. If we want to cut out those other names and consolidate them all onto one page, I have no problem with that. We just don't want to have too much confusion with definitions and cross-referencing. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Missing pages ==

Some of the pages that can be found [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Prefixindex/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic here] are not in this &quot;index of 'Magic' pages&quot;. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 12:12, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
:Would you like to add them to the index then? I'll be going through and templating most of the pages that have been stubbed out shortly. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:22, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
::I would have done that instead of placing this message, but i don't think i have enough time for adding them myself. :( Although I hope I will be able to do it in a few days, if noone else will. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 13:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
:Almost done. Now only Cruciatus (soon to be redirect) and Floo Powder remain. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 15:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Ven?mous Tentacula ==

Yes, I know it's misspelled... but that is how it is spelled in the book. I checked, because it bugged me as well.

Shall I leave it as is, or change it back to what the book has? -- [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

:In that case, i'm sorry to have been too bold; i had merely [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=venomous+tentacula&amp;fulltext=Search searched] Wikipedia for both forms, and the misspelled one [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=venemous+tentacula&amp;go=Go didn't] come up with anything. Now for settling this: i'd like * to try checking in a different version [i'm unable to help with this :-( , sorry], and if the two versions agree, we'll use the misspelled name. If they disagree, we'll check a third version. :-D -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 12:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:(*) better wording: i'd like '''us''' to try checking

::Hmm. Okay; what version of the book (Chamber of Secrets) are you working from? I don't have mine here at the moment; I'll post my version tonight. I think this discussion should be on the Venomous Tentacula talk page... I'll post it there. -- [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 17:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:::Umm, no, not really. I don't have appropriate sources, since all the HP books i own are translations, and their quality is not what i would have wished... So i have been working mainly from my memories of the story, from Wikipedia articles, and from existing text already in the page i was editing. At least i have HP6 borrowed from a distant friend (i'll be giving it back soon), that's why i had asked about it regarding Hallowe[']en. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 21:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

::::For what it's worth, I'm working from the Bloomsbury / Raincoast 1998 edition (UK/ Canadian). I understand that the American editions have extra text that was cut from the UK editions. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 08:18, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

A question has come up about the spelling of this plant's name. In my edition (Chamber of Secrets, chapter 6), it is spelled &quot;Venemous Tentacula&quot;; [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] has corrected that to &quot;Venomous Tentacula&quot;, that being accepted Muggle spelling, and apparently also being how it is spelled in his version.

Could you be a tie-breaker? I think this discussion will end up on the [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Venemous_Tentacula|Venomous Tentacula]] discussion page... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 18:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:I've made my comment [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Venomous Tentacula|here]] regarding this. If it's misspelled, let's correct it. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:08, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== Luna Lovegood ==

Should there be pages for &quot;Heliopath&quot;, &quot;Blibbering Humdinger&quot;, and &quot;Umgubular Slashkilter&quot;, which are all mentioned as being real by Luna Lovegood? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:26, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
:Also &quot;Nargles&quot;, Dirigible Plums, and whatever it is that makes you lose track of what you were saying? Good question... I've not bothered to date because they got only passing mention, where the Snorkack seems to be re-introduced periodically as a specific indicator of the Lovegood lunacy. But many things are present that get no mention at all, except in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. If you want to add them, feel free, but please use the Magic framework from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Frameworks]] as the article starting point, and also, if you would be so kind as to add them to the All Pages collection, I'd deeply appreciate it.

== Ghosts? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Speech recognition software, often referred to as Voice recognition software is very useful for people who are better at speaking than writing. A piece of software that recognises what you are actually saying and transcribes it for you, gone are the days of messy handwriting! Think about it, a computer has no problems with spelling and presents your thoughts and idea's perfectly for you. You would not have to write and then manually type out your thoughts ever again.

Speech recognition is an area that has progressed rapidly over the last few years. However, it still has its limitations. For example the dyslexic website bring it to our attention that in order to use the piece of software people have had to go through an often lengthy process, sometimes taking up to an hour for the software to recognise your own voice (Dyslexic Website 2006)

This process may be appealing to people that have a speech impediment, however, for someone who is an avid or fluent reader this can be a very painstaking way of getting the computer to discriminate between your voice and someone else’s.

We must remember that computers cannot recognise and transcribe a conversation. The text needs to be dictated, which is an art form in itself. The computer cannot recognise &quot;uums&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; and so each spoken word must be clearly dictated to the machine.

The more recent dictation software that has been developed by Dragon, who are the world leaders in speech recognition software estimate full stops and commas for the dictator. This is a major breakthrough for speech recognition software users. The most used software being the ‘Dragon Naturally Speaking’, its developers Dragon claim that it allows you to speak up to 160 words per minute whilst maintaining 99% accuracy (Speech Recognition Website 2006)

There are various ways that you can dictate to a computer, for example the most common method used is to dictate directly into your PC using a headset microphone connected into the soundcard or USB. The Dragon product allows complete mobility and users can even dictate into hand held devices such as PDAs or a Tablet PC and then synchronize the mobile device to a PC so the software can transcribe the voice file into a normal text document.

Originally the early versions of speech recognition software were aimed at people with disabilities such as dyslexia. The new pieces of software such as ‘Naturally Speaking’ can create 900 word documents in less than 6 minutes. So the advantages are endless and more and more professions are choosing this purely to increase the efficiency of their business.

==Introduction==

An important function and property of the human cognitive system is the ability to extract important information out of textually and verbally described situations. This ability plays a vital role in understanding and remembering. But what happens to this information after it is extracted, how do we represent it and how do we use it for inferencing? With this chapter we introduce the concept of a “situation model” (van Dijk&amp;Kintsch, 1983, “mental model”: Johnson-Laird, 1983), which is the mental representation of what a text is about. We discuss what these representations might look like and show the various experiments that try to tackle these questions empirically. By assuming situations to be encoded by perceptual symbols (Barsalou, 1999), the theory of Situation Models touches many aspects of Cognitive Philosophy, Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. In the beginning of this chapter, we will mention why Situation Models are important and what we use them for. Next we will focus on the theory itself by introducing the four primary types of information - the situation model components, its Levels of Representation and finally two other basic types of knowledge used in situation model construction and processing (general world knowledge and referent specific knowledge).

Situation models not only form a central concept in theories of situated cognition that helps us in understanding how situational information is collected and how new information gets integrated, but they can also explain many other phenomena. According to van Dijk &amp; Kintsch, situation models are responsible for processes like domain-expertise, translation, learning from multiple sources or completely understanding situations just by reading about them. These situation models consist, according to most researches in this area, of five dimensions, which we will explain later. When new information concerning one of these dimensions is extracted, the situation model is changed according to the new information. The bigger the change in the situation model is, the more time the reader needs for understanding the situation with the new information. If there are contradictions, e.g. new information which does not fit into the model, the reader fails to understand the text and probably has to reread parts of the text to build up a better model. It was shown in several experiments that it is easier to understand texts that have only small changes in the five dimensions of text understanding. It also has been found that it is easier for readers to understand a text if the important information is more explicitly mentioned. For this reason several researchers wrote about the importance of fore-grounding important information (see Zwaan&amp;Radvansky 1998 for a detailed list). The other important issue about situation models is the multidimensionality. Here the important question is how are the different dimensions related and what is their weight for constructing the model. Some researchers claim that the weight of the dimensions shifts according to the situation which is described. Introducing such claims will be the final part of this chapter and aims to introduce you to current and future research goals.

====The VIP: Rolf A. Zwaan====

Rolf A. Zwaan, born September 13, 1962 in Rotterdam (the Netherlands), is a very important person for this topic, since he made the most research (92 publications in total), and also because most of our data is taken from his work.
Zwaan did his MA (1986) and his Ph.D. (1992) at the Utrecht University (Netherlands), both cum laude. Since then he collected multiple awards like the Developing Scholar Award (Florida state University, 1999) or the Fellow of the Hanse Institute for Advanced Study (Delmenhorst, Germany, 2003) and became member of several Professional Organisations like the Psychonomic Society, the Cognitive Science Society or the American Psychological Society.
He works as Chair of the Biology &amp; Cognitive Psychology at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam (Netherlands), since 2007.

==Why do we need situation models?==

A lot of tasks which are based on language processing can only be explained by the usage of situation models. The so called situation model or mental model consists of five different dimensions, which refer to different sources. To comprehend a text or just a simple sentence, situation models are useful. Furthermore the comprehension and combination of several texts and sentences can be explained by that theory much better.
In the following, some examples are listed why we really need situation models.


====Integration of information across sentences====

Integration of information across sentences is more than just understanding a set of sentences. For example:

''“Gerhard Schroeder is in front of some journalists. Looking forward to new ideas is nothing special for the Ex-German chancellor. It is like in the good old days in 1971 when the leader of the Jusos was behind the polls and talked about changes.”''


This example only makes sense to the reader if he is aware that ''“Gerhard Schroeder”'', ''“Ex-German chancellor”'' and ''“the leader of the Jusos in 1971”'' is one and the same person. 
If we build up a situation model, in this example ''“Gerhard Schroeder”'' is our token. Every bit of information which comes up will be linked to this token, based on grammatical and world knowledge. The definite article in the second sentence refers to the individual in the first sentence. This is based on grammatical knowledge. Every definite article indicates a connection to an individual in a previous sentence. If there would be an indefinite article, we have to build a new token for a new individual. The third sentence is linked by domain knowledge to the token. It has to be known that “Gerhard Schroeder” was the leader of the Jusos in 1971. Otherwise the connection can only be guessed. 
We can see that an integrated situation model is needed to comprehend the connection between the three sentences.

====Explanation of similarities in comprehension performances across modalities====

The explanation of similarities in comprehension performances across modalities can only be done by the usage of situation models. 
If we read a newspaper article, watch a report on television or listen to a report on radio, we come up with a similar understanding of the same information, which is conveyed through different modalities. Thus we create a mental representation of the information or event. This mental representation does not depend on the modalities itself. Furthermore there is empirical evidence for this intuition. 
Baggett (1979) found out that students who saw a short film and students who heard a spoken version of the events in the short film finally produced a structurally similar recall protocol. There were differences in the protocols of the two groups but the differences were due to content aspects. Like the text version explicitly stated that a boy was on his way to school and in the movie this had to be inferred.

====Domain expertise on comprehension====

Situation models have a deep influence for effects of domain expertise on comprehension. In detail this means that person A, whose verbal skills are less than from person B, is able to outperform person B, if he has more knowledge of the topic domain. To give evidence for this intuition, there was a study by Schneider and Körkel (1989). They compared the recalls of “experts” and novices of a text about a soccer match. In the study were three different grades: 3rd, 5th and 7th. One important example in that experiment was that the 3rd grade soccer experts outperformed the 7th grade novices. The recall of units in the text was 54% by the 3rd grade experts and 42% by the 7th grade novices. 
The explanation is quite simple:
The 3rd grade experts built up a situation model and used knowledge from their long-term memory (Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995). The 7th grade novices had just the text by which they can come up with a situation model.
Some more studies show evidence for the theory that domain expertise may counteract with verbal ability, i.e. Fincher-Kiefer, Post, Greene &amp; Voss, 1988 or Yekovich, Walker, Ogle &amp; Thompson in 1990.


====Explanation of translation skills====

An other example why we need situation models is by trying to explain translation. Translating a sentence or a text from one language to another is not simply done by translating each word and building a new sentence structure until the sentence seems to be sound. If we have a look now at the example of a Dutch sentence:


[[File:Translation skills.jpg|center|450px|]]


Now we can conclude that the translation level between Dutch and English is not based on the lexical-semantic level; it is based on the situation level. In this example “don’t do something (action) before you haven’t done something else (another action)”.
Other studies came up with findings that the ability to construct situation models during the translation is important for the translation skill (Zwann, Ericsson, Lally and Hill, in 1998).

====Multiple source learning====

People are able to learn about a domain from multiple documents. This phenomenon can be explained by a situation model, too. For example, we try to learn something about the ''“Cold War”'' we use different documents with information. The information in one document may be similar to other documents. Referents can be the same or special relationships in the “Cold War” can just be figured out by the usage of different documents. So what we are really doing by learning and reasoning is that we integrate information on the base of different documents into a common situation model, which has got an organized order of the information we’ve learned.


We have seen that we need situation models in different tasks of language processing, but situation models are not needed in all tasks of language processing.
An example is proofreading. A proofreader checks every word for its correctness. This ability does not contain the ability to construct situation models. This task uses the resources of the long-term memory in which the correct writing of each word is stored. The procedure is like:

[[Image:Grafik1.jpg|center|400px|Zwaan (2003]]


This is done word by word. It is unnecessary to create situation models in this task for language processing.

==Multidimensionality of Situation Models==
===Space===

Very often, objects that are spatially close to us are more relevant than more distant objects. Therefore, one would expect the same for situation models. consistent with this idea, comprehenders are slower to recognise words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those denoting objects close to the protagonist (Glenberg, Meyer &amp; Lindem, 1987).

When comprehenders have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the setting of the story (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is currently in or is heading to. For example, they can more readily say whether or not two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is one of these rooms than if it is some other room in the building (e.g., Morrow, Greenspan, &amp; Bower, 1987). This makes perfect sense intuitively because these are the rooms that would be relevant to us if we were in the situation. 

People’s interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting movement of people or objects in space, such as ''to approach'', depends on their situation models. For example, comprehenders interpret the meaning of ''approach'' differently in  ''The tractor is just approaching the fence'' than in ''The mouse is just approaching the fence''. Specifically, they interpret the distance between the figure and the landmark as being longer when the figure is large (tractor) compared with when it is small (mouse). The comprehenders’ interpretation also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure (Morrow &amp; Clark, 1988). Apparently, comprehenders behave as if they are actually standing in the situation, looking at the tractor or mouse approaching a fence.

===Time===

We assume by default that events are narrated in their chronological order, with nothing left out. Presumably this assumption exists because this is how we experience events in everyday life. Events occur to us in a continuous flow, sometimes in close succession, sometimes in parallel, and often partially overlapping. Language allows us to deviate from chronological order, however. For example, we can say, “Before the psychologist submitted the manuscript, the journal changed its policy.” The psychologist submitting the manuscript is reported first, even though it was the last of the two events to occur. If people construct a situation model, this sentence should be more difficult to process than its chronological counterpart (the same sentence, but beginning with “After”). Recent neuroscientific evidence supports this prediction. Event-related brain potential (ERP) measurements indicate that “before” sentences elicit, within 300 ms, greater negativity than “after” sentences. This difference in potential is primarily located in the left anterior part of the brain and is indicative of greater cognitive effort (Münte, Schiltz, &amp; Kutas, 1998). In real life, events follow each other seamlessly. However, narratives can have temporal discontinuities, when writers omit events not relevant to the plot. Such temporal gaps, typically signalled by phrases such as ''a few days later'', are quite common in narratives. Nonetheless, they present a departure from everyday experience. Therefore, time shifts should lead to (minor) disruptions of the comprehension process. And they do. Reading times for sentences that introduce a time shift tend to be longer than those for sentences that do not (Zwaan, 1996).

 All other things being equal, events that happened just recently are more accessible to us than events that happened a while ago. 
 Thus, in a situation model, ''enter'' should be less accessible after ''An hour ago, John entered the building'' than after ''A moment ago, John entered the building''. 
 Recent probe-word recognition experiments support this prediction (e.g., Zwaan, 1996).

===Causation===

As we interact with the environment, we have a strong tendency to interpret event sequences as causal sequences. It is important to note that, just as we infer the goals of a protagonist, we have to infer causality; we cannot perceive it directly. Singer and his colleagues (e.g., Singer, Halldorson, Lear, &amp; Andrusiak, 1992) have investigated how readers use their world knowledge to validate causal connections between narrated events. Subjects read sentence pairs, such as 1a and then 1b or 1a’ and then 1b, and were subsequently presented with a question like 1c:

(1a) Mark poured the bucket of water on the bonfire. 

(1a’) Mark placed the bucket of water by the bonfire. 

(1b) The bonfire went out.

(1c) Does water extinguish fire? 

Subjects were faster in responding to 1c after the sequence 1a-1b than after 1a’-1b. According to Singer, the reason for the speed difference is that the knowledge that water extinguishes fire was activated to validate the events described in 1a-1b. However, because this knowledge cannot be used to validate 1a’-1b, it was not activated when subjects read that sentence pair.

===Intentionality===

We are often able to predict people’s future actions by inferring their intentionality, i.e. their goals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference “He is going to sit.” Keefe and McDaniel (1993) presented subjects with sentences like ''After standing through the 3-hr debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down)'' and then with probe words (e.g., sat, in this case). Subjects took about the same amount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted and when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these conditions than in a control condition in which it was implied that the speaker remained standing.

===Protagonists and Objects===

Comprehenders are quick to make inferences about protagonists, presumably in an attempt to construct a more complete situation model. Consider, for example, what happens after subjects read the sentence ''The electrician examined the light fitting''. If the following sentence is ''She took out her screwdriver'', their reading speed is slowed down compared with when the second sentence is ''He took out his screwdriver''. This happens because she provides a mismatch with the stereotypical gender of an electrician, which the subjects apparently inferred while reading the first sentence (Carreiras, Garnham, Oakhill, &amp; Cain, 1996).

 Comprehenders also make inferences about the emotional states of characters. 
 For example, if we read a story about Paul, who wants his brother Luke to be good in baseball, the concept of “pride” becomes activated in our mind when we read
 that Luke receives the Most Valuable Player Award (Gernsbacher, Goldsmith, &amp; Robertson, 1992). 
 Thus, just as in real life, we make inferences about people’s emotions when we comprehend stories.

==Processing Frameworks==

===Introduction===

In the process of language and text comprehension new information has to be integrated into the current situation model. This is achieved by a processing framework. There are various theories and insights on this process. Most of them only model one or some aspects of Situation Models and language comprehension. 

A list of theories, insights and developments in language comprehension frameworks:
*an interactive model of comprehension (Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978)
*early Computatinal Model (Miller, Kintsch, 1980)
*Constructing-integration Model (Kintsch, 1988)
*Structure-Building-Framework (Gernsbacher,1990)
*Capacity Constraint Reader Model (Just, Carpenter, 1992)
*Constructivist framework (Graesser, Singer, Trabasso, 1994)
*Event Indexing Model (Zwaan, Langston, Graesser, 1995)
*Landscape Model (van den Brock, Risden, Fletcher, &amp; Thurlow, 1996) 
*Capacity-constrained construction-integration Model (Goldman, Varma, Coté, 1996)
*The Immersed Experiencer Framework (Zwaan, 2003)

In this part of the chapter on Situation Models we will talk about several models; we will start with some of the early stuff and then go to the popular later ones. We will start with the work of Kintsch in the 70s and 80s and then go on to later research which is based on this.

===An interactive Model of Comprehension===

This model was already developed in the 80s; it is the basis for many later models like the CI-Model, or even the Immersed-Experiencer Framework. According to Kintsch and van Dijk (1978), text comprehension proceeds in cycles. In every cycle a few propositions are processed, this number is determined by the capacity of the Short-Term Memory, so 7 plus or minus 2. In every cycle the new propositions are connected to existing ones, they therefore form a connected and hierarchical set.

===Early Computational Model===

This computational model from Miller and Kintsch tried to model earlier theories of comprehension, to make predictions according to these and compare them to behavioural studies and experiments. It consisted of several modules. One was a chunking program: It's task is to read in one word at the moment, identify if it is a proposition and decide whether to integrate it or not. This part of the model was not done computationally. The next part in the input order was the Microstructure Coherence Program (MCP). The MCP sorted the propositions and stored them in the Working Memory Coherence Graph. The task of the Working Memory Coherence Graph was then to decide which propositions should be kept active during the next processing cycle. All propositions are stored in the Long Term Memory Coherence Graph, this decided which propositions should be transferred back in to the Working Memory or it can construct a whole new Working Memory Graph with a different superordinate node. The problem with this Computational Model was that it show a really low performance. But still it led to further research which tried to overcome it's shortcomings.



===Event-Indexing Model===

The ''Event-Indexing Model'' was first proposed by Zwaan, Langston and Graesser (1995). It makes claims about how the incoming information in comprehension is processed and how it is represented in the long-term memory. 

According to the ''Event-Indexing Model'' all incoming actions events are splitted into five indexes. The five indexes are the same as the five situational dimensions, though Zwaan&amp;Radvasnky(1998) claim that there are possibly more dimensions. These might be found in future research. One basic point of this model is the processing time of integrating new events into the current model. It is more easier to integrate a new incoming event if it shares indexes with a previous event. The more contiguous the new event is, the easier it is integrated into the new Situation Model. This prediction made by Zwaan &amp; Radvanksy (1998) is supported by some prior research (Zwaan, Magliano and Graesser, 1995). The other important point of the ''Event-Indexing Model'' is the representation in long-term memory. Zwaan &amp; Radvasnky (1998) predict that this representation is a network of nodes, these nodes encode the events. The nodes are linked with each other through situational links according to the indexes they share. This connection does not only encode if two nodes share indexes but it also encodes the number of shared indexes through its strength. This second point already hints what the ''Event-Indexing Model'' lacks. There are several things which it does not include. For example it does not encode the temporal order of the events nor the direction of the causal relationships. The biggest disadvantage of the ''Event-Indexing Model'' is clearly that it treats the different dimensions as different entities though they probably interact with each other. 

Radvansky &amp; Zwaan (1998) updated the ''Event-Indexing Model'' with some features. This new model splits the processed information into three types. These three types are the situational framework, the situational relations and the situational content. The situational framework grounds the situation in space and time and it's construction is obligatory. If no information is given this framework is probably build up by standard values retrieved from prior world knowledge or some empty variable would be instantiated.
he situational relations are based on the five situational dimensions. These are analysed through the ''Event-Indexing Model''. This kind of situational information includes not the basic information, which is given in the situational framework, but the relationships between the different entities or nodes in the network. In contrast to the situational framework the situational relations are not obligatory. If there is no information given or there are no possible inferences between entities, then there is simply no relationship there. There is also an index which addresses importance to the different relations. This importance consists of the necessity of the information to understand the situation, the easiness to inference it when it would not be mentioned and how easy the information can later be remembered. Another distinction this theory makes is the one between functional and non-functional relations (Carlson-Radvansky &amp; Radvansky, 1996; Garrod &amp; Sanford, 1989). Functional relations describe the interaction between different entities whereas non-functional relations are the ones between non-interacting entities.  The situational content consists of the entities in the situation like protagonists and objects and their properties. These are only integrated explicitly in the Situation Model, like situational relations,  if they are necessary for the understanding of the situation. Nonetheless the central and most important entities and their properties are obligatory again. It is proposed that, in order to keep the processing time low, non-essential information is only represented by something like a pointer so that this information can be retrieved if necessary.

===The Immersed Experiencer Framework===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:ImmersedExp.jpg|right|Zwaan (2003]] --&gt;
The Immersed Experiencer Framework (IEF) is based on prior processing framework models (see above for a detailed list) but tries to include several other research findings too. For example it was found that during comprehension brain regions are activated, which are very close or even overlap with brain regions which are active during the perception or the action of the words meaning (Isenberg et al., 2000; Martin &amp; Chao, 2001; Pulvermüller, 1999, 2002). During comprehension there is also a visual representation of shape and orientation of objects (Dahan &amp; Tanenhaus, 2002; Stanfield &amp; Zwaan, 2002; Zwaan et al., 2002; Zwaan &amp; Yaxley, in press a, b). Visual-spatial information primes sentence processing (Boroditsky, 2000). These visual representations can interfer with the comprehension (Fincher-Kiefer, 2001). Findings from (Glenberg, Meyer, &amp; Lindem, 1987; Kaup &amp; Zwaan, in press; Morrow ''et al.'', 1987; Horton &amp; Rapp, in press; Trabasso &amp; Suh, 1993; Zwaan et al., 2000) suggest that information which is part of the situation and the text is more active in the reader's mind than information which is not included. The fourth research finding is that people move their eyes and hand during comprehension in a consistent way with the described the situation. (Glenberg &amp; Kaschak, in press; Klatzky et al., 1989; Spivey et al., 2000).

The main point of the Immersed Experiencer Framework is the idea that words active experiences with their referents. For example &quot;an eagle in the sky&quot; activates a visual experience of a eagle with stretched-out wings while &quot;an eagle in the nest&quot; activates a different visual experience. According to Zwaan (2003) the IEF should be seen as an engine to make predictions about language comprehension. These predictions are then suggested for further research. 

According to the IEF the process of language comprehension consists of three components, these are activation, construal and integration. Each component works at a different level. Activation works at the world level, construal is responsible for the clause level while integration is active at the discourse level. Though the IEF shares many points with earlier models of language comprehension it differs in some main points. For example it suggests that language comprehension involves action and perceptual representations and not amodal propositions (Zwaan, 2003).

==Levels of Representation in Language and Text Comprehension==

A lot of theories try to explain the situation model or so called mental model in different representations. Several theories of the representation deal with the comprehension from the text into the situation model itself. How many levels are included or needed and how is the situation model constructed, is it done by once like:

Sentence → Situation Model

Or are there levels in between which have to be passed until the model is constructed?
Here are three different representations shown which try to explain the construction of the situation model by a text.


====Propositional Representation====

The propositional Representation claims that a sentence will be structured in another way and then it is stored. Included information does not get lost. We will have a look at the simple sentence: 

''“George loves Sally”''   the propositional representation is [LOVES(GEORGE, SALLY)]

It is easy to see that the propositional representation is easy to create and the information is still available.

====Three levels of representation====

[[Image:three level.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Fletcher(1994); van Dijk &amp; Kintch(1983); Zwaan &amp; Radvansky (1998)]]
This theory says that there exist three levels of representation the surface form, text base and the situation model. In this example the sentence “The frog ate the bug.” Is already the surface form. We naturally create semantically relations to understand the sentence (semantic tree in the figure). The next level is the “Text base”. [EAT(FROG, BUG)] is the propositional representation and ''Text base'' is close to this kind of representation, except that it is rather spatial. Finally the situation model is constructed by the “Text base” representation. We can see that the situation model does not include any kind of text. It is a mental picture of information in the sentence itself.












====Two levels of representation====

[[Image:two level.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Frank Koppen, Nordman, Vonk (to appear) Zwaan (2004)]]
This theory is like the “three levels of representations” theory. But the “Text base” level is left out. The theory itself claims that the situation model is created by the sentence itself and there is no “Text base” level needed. 

Further situation model theories directing experiences exist. So not only text comprehension is done by situation models, learning through direct experience is handled by situation models, too.












====KIWi-Model====

[[Image:Kiwi model.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A unified model by &quot;Prof. Dr.&quot; Schmalhofer]]
One unified model the so called KIWi-Model tries to explain how text representation and direct experience interact with a situation model. Additionally the domain knowledge is integrated. The domain knowledge is used by forming a situation model in different tasks like simple sentence comprehension (chapter: Why do we need Situation Models).
The KIWi-Model shows that a permanent interaction between “text representation → situation model” and between “sensory encoding → situation model” exists. These interactions supports the theory of a permanent updating of the mental model.

==Inferencing==

Inferencing is used to build up complex situation models with limited information. For example: in 1973 John Bransford and Marcia Johnson made a memory experiment in which they had two groups reading variations of the same sentence.

The first group read the text &quot;''John was trying to fix the bird house. He was '''pounding''' the nail when his father came out to watch him do the work''&quot; 

The second group read the text &quot;''John was trying to fix the bird house. He was '''looking for''' the nail when his father came out to watch him do the work''&quot;

After reading, some test statements were presented to the participants. These statements contained the word ''hammer'' which did not occur in the original sentences, e.g.: &quot;''John was using a hammer to fix the birdhouse. He was looking for the nail when his father came out to watch him''&quot;. Participants of the first group said they had seen 57% of the test statements, while the participants from the second group had seen only 20% of the test statements. 

As one can see, in the first group there is a tendency of believing to have seen the word ''hammer''. The participants of this group made the inference, that John used a hammer to pound the nail. This memory influence test is good example to get an idea what is meant by making inferences and how they are used to complete situation models.

While reading a text, inferencing creates information which is not explicitly stated in the text; hence it is a creative process. It is very important for text understanding in general, because texts cannot include all information needed to understand the sense of a story. Texts usually leave out what is known as ''world knowledge''. World knowledge is knowledge about situations, persons or items that most people share, and therefore don't need to be explicitly stated. Each person should be able to infer this kind of information, as for example that we usually use hammers to pound nails. It would be impossible to write a text, if it had to include all information it deals with; if there was no such thing like inferencing or if it was not automatically done by our brain.


There is a number of different kinds of inferences:

===Anaphoric Inference===

This kind of Inferencing usually connects objects or persons from one to another sentence. Therefore it is responsible for connecting cross-sentence information. E.g. in &quot;''John hit the nail. He was proud of his stroke''&quot;, we directly infer that &quot;he&quot; and &quot;his&quot; relate to &quot;John&quot;. We normally make this kind of inference quite easily. But there can be sentences where more persons and other words relating to them are mixed up and people have problems understanding the story at first. This is normally regarded as bad writing style.

===Instrumental Inference===

This type of Inference is about the tools and the methods used in the text, like the hammer in the example above. Or for example, if you read about somebody flying to New York, you would not infer that this person has built a dragon-flyer and jumped off a cliff but that he or she used a plane, since there is nothing else mentioned in the text and a plane is the most common form of flying to New York. If there is no specific information about tools, instruments and methods, we get this information from our ''General World Knowledge''

===Causal Inference===

Causal Inference is the conclusion that one event caused another in the text, like in &quot;He hit his nail. So his finger ached&quot;. The first sentence gives the reason why the situation described in the second sentence came to be. It would be more difficult to draw a causal inference in an example like &quot;He hit his nail. So his father ran away&quot;, although one could create an inference on this with some fantasy.

Causal inferences create causal connections between text elements. These connections are separated into ''local connections'' and ''global connections''. Local connections are made within a range of 1 to 3 sentences. This depends on factors like the capacity of the working memory and the concentration due reading. Global connections are drawn between the information in one sentence together with the background information gathered so far about the whole text. Problems can occur with Causal Inferences when a story is ''inconsistent.'' For example, vegans eating steak would be inconsistent. An interesting fact about Causal Inferences (Goldstein, 2005) is that the kind of Inferences we draw here that are not easily seen at first are easier to remember. This may be due to the fact that they required a higher mental processing capacity while drawing the inference. So this &quot;not-so-easy&quot; inference seems to be marked in a way that it is easier to remember it.

===Predictive / Forward Inference===

Predictive/Forward Inferences uses the ''General World Knowledge'' of the reader to build his prediction of the consequences of what is currently happening in the story into the Situation Model.

===Integrating Inferences into Situation Models===

The question how models enter inferential processes is highly controversial in the two disciplines of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. A.I. gave a deep insight in psychological procedures and since the two disciplines crossed their ways and give two main bases of the cognitive science. The arguments in these are largely independent from each other although they have much in common.

Johnson-Laird (1983) makes a distinction between three types of reasoning-theories in which inferencing plays an important role. The first class gears to logical calculi and have been implemented in many formal system. The programming language Prolog arises from this way of dealing with reasoning and in psychology many theories postulate formal rules of inference, a &quot;mental logic.&quot; These rules work in a purely syntactic way and so are &quot;context free,&quot; blind for the context of its content.
A simple example clarifies the problem with this type of theory:

     If patients have cystitis, then they are given penicillin.

and the logical conclusion:

     If patients have cystitis and are allergic to penicillin, then they are given penicillin

This is logically correct, but seems to fail our common sense of logic.

The second class of theories postulate content specific rules of inference. Their origin lies in programming languages and production systems. They work with forms like &quot;If x is a, then x is b&quot;. If one wants to show that x is b, showing that x is a is a sub-goal of this argumentation. The idea of basing psychological theories of reasoning on content specific rules was discussed by Johnson-Laird and Wason and various sorts of such theories have been proposed. A related idea is that reasoning depends on the accumulation of specific examples within a connectionist framework, where the distinction between inference and recall is blurred.

The third class of theories is based on mental models and does not use any rules of inferencing. The process of building mental models of things heard or read. The models are in an permanent change of updates. A model built, will be equipped with new features of the new information as long as there is no information, which generates a conflict with that model. If this is the case the model is generally re-built, so that the conflict generating information fits into the new model.

==Important Topics of current research==

===Linguistic Cues versus World Knowledge===

According to many researchers, language is the set of processing instructions on how to build up the Situation Model of the represented situation (Gernsbacher, 1990; Givon, 1992; Kintsch, 1992; Zwaan &amp; Radvansky, 1998). As mentioned, readers use the lexical cues and information to connect the different situational dimensions and integrate them into the model. Another important point here is prior world knowledge. World knowledge also influences how the different information in a situation model are related. The relation between linguistic cues and world knowledge is therefore an important topic of current and future research in the area of Situation Models.

===Multidimensionality===

Another important aspect of current research in the area of Situation Models is the Multidimensionality of the Models. The main aspect is here how the different dimensions relate to each other, how they influence and interact. The question here is also if they interact at all and which interact. Most studies in the field were only about one or a few of the situational dimensions.

=Introduction=

Imagine our friend Knut, who we have already introduced in earlier chapters of this book, hastily walking through his apartment looking everywhere for a gold medal that he has won many years ago at a swimming contest. The medal is very important to him, since it was his recently deceased mother who had insisted on him participating. The medal reminds him of the happy times in his life. But now he does not know where it is. He is sure that he had last seen it two days ago but, searching through his recent experiences, he is not able to recall where he has put it.&lt;br&gt;  
So what exactly enables Knut to remember the swimming contest and why does the medal trigger the remembrance of the happy times in his life? Also, why is he not able to recall where he has put the medal, even though he is capable of scanning through most of his experiences of the last 48 hours?&lt;br&gt; 
Memory, with all of its different forms and features, is the key to answering these questions. When people talk about memories, they are subconsciously talking about &quot;the capacity of the nervous system to acquire and retain usable skills and knowledge, which allows living organisms to benefit from experience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from www.wwnorton.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, how does this so-called memory function?  In the process of answering this question, many different models of memory have evolved. Distinctions are drawn between Sensory Memory, Short Term Memory, and Long Term Memory based on the period of time information is accessible after it is first encountered. '''Sensory Memory''', which can further be divided into '''Echoic''' and '''Iconic Memory''', has the smallest time span for accessibility of information.  With '''Short Term''' and '''Working Memory''', information is accessible seconds to minutes after it is first encountered. While '''Long Term Memory''', has an accessibility period from minutes to years to decades. This chapter discusses these different types of memory and further gives an insight into memory phenomena like '''False Memory''' and '''Forgetting'''. Finally, we will consider '''biological foundations''' that concern memory in human beings and the biological changes that occur when learning takes place and information is stored.

=Types of Memory=

In the following section we will discuss the three different types of memory and their respective characteristics: '''Sensory Memory''', '''Short Term (STM)''' or '''Working Memory (WM)''' and '''Long Term Memory (LTM)'''.

==Sensory Memory==
This type of memory has the shortest retention time, only milliseconds to five seconds. Roughly, Sensory Memory can be subdivided into two main kinds: [[Image:Sensory Memory.jpg|framed|Sensory Memory]]

*	'''Iconic Memory''' (visual input)
*	'''Echoic Memory''' (auditory input)

While Iconic and Echoic Memory have been well researched, there are other types of Sensory Memory, like '''haptic''', '''olfactory''', etc., for which no sophisticated theories exist so far.&lt;br&gt;
It should be noted, though, that according to the Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, R. C. &amp; Shiffrin, R. M. (1968). Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes. 
:In K. Spence &amp; J. Spence (Eds.), ''The psychology of learning and motivation (Volume 2)''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensory Memory was considered to be the same thing as Iconic Memory. Echoic Memory was added to the concept of Sensory Memory due to research done by Darwin and others (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. J., Turvey, M. T., &amp; Crowder, R. G. (1972). An auditory analogue of the Sperling partial report procedure:
:Evidence for brief auditory storage. ''Cognitive Psychology, 3'', 255-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Let us consider the following intuitive example for Iconic Memory:
Probably we all know the phenomenon that it seems possible to draw lines, figures or names with lighted sparklers by moving the sparkler fast enough in a dark environment. Physically, however, there are no such things as lines of light. So why can we nevertheless see such figures? This is due to Iconic Memory. Roughly speaking, we can think of this subtype of memory as a kind of photographic memory, but one which only lasts for a very short time (milliseconds, up to a second). The image of the light of a sparkler remains in our memory (persistence of vision) and thus makes it seem to us like the light leaves lines in the dark. 
The term &quot;Echoic Memory&quot;, as the name already suggests, refers to auditory input. Here the persistence time is a little longer than with Iconic Memory (up to five seconds).&lt;br&gt; 
At the level of Sensory Memory no manipulation of the incoming information occurs, it is transferred to the '''Working Memory'''. By ‘transfer’ it is meant that the amount of information is reduced because the capacity of the working memory is not large enough to cope with all the input coming from our sense organs. The next paragraph will deal with the different theories of selection when transferring information from Sensory Memory to Working Memory.&lt;br&gt;
One of the first experiments researching the phenomenon of '''Attention''' was the '''Shadowing Task''' (Cherry et al., 1953).&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, E. C. (1953). Some experiments on the recognition of speech with one and with two ears. 
:''Journal of Accoustical Society of America, 25'', 975-979.&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment deals with the filtering of auditory information. The subject is wearing earphones, getting presented a different story on each ear. He or she has to listen to and repeat out loud the message on one ear (shadowing). When asked for the content of the stories of both ears only the story of the shadowed side can be repeated; participants do not know about the content of the other ear’s story. From these results Broadbent concluded the '''Filter Theory''' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, D. E. (1958). ''Perception and communication.'' New York: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that the filtering of information is based on specific physical properties of stimuli. For every frequency there exists a distinct nerve pathway. The attention control selects which pathway is active and can thereby control which information is passed to the Working Memory. This way it is possible to follow the utterance of one person with a certain voice frequency even though there are many other sounds in the surrounding.
But imagine a situation in which the so called cocktail party effect applies: having a conversation in a loud crowd at a party and listening to your interlocutor you will immediately switch to listening to another conversation if the content of it is semantically relevant to you, e.g. if your name is mentioned.&lt;br&gt;
So it is found that filtering also happens semantically. The above mentioned Shadowing Task was changed so that the semantic content of a sentence was split up between the ears, and the subject, although shadowing, was able to repeat the whole sentence because he or she was following the semantic content unconsciously.&lt;br&gt;
Reacting to the effect of semantic filtering, new theories were developed. Two important theories are the '''Attenuation Theory''' (Treisman, 1964)&lt;ref&gt;Treisman, A. M. (1964). Monitoring and storage of irrelevant messages and selective attention. 
:''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 3'', 449-459.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the '''Late Selection Theory''' (Deutsch &amp; Deutsch, 1963).&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, J. A. &amp; Deutsch, D. (1963). Attention: Some theoretical considerations. ''Psycological Review, 70'', 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The former proposes that we attenuate information which is less relevant, but do not filter it out completely. Thereby also semantic information of ignored frequencies can be analyzed but not as efficiently as those of the relevant frequencies. The Late Selection Theory presumes that all information is analyzed first and afterwards the decision of the importance of information is made.
Treisman and Geffen did an experiment to find out which one of the theories holds. The experiment was a revision of the Shadowing Task. Again the subjects have to shadow one ear but in contrast they also have to pay attention to a certain sound which could appear on either ear. If the sound occurs the subject has to react in a certain way (for example knock on the table). The result is that the subject identifies the sound on the shadowed ear in 87% of all cases and can only do this in 8% of the cases on the ignored side.
This shows that the information on the ignored side must be attenuated since the rate of identification is lower. If the Late Selection Theory were to hold then the subject would have to analyze all information and would have to be able to identify the same amount on the ignored side as on the shadowed side. Since this is not the case the Attenuation Theory by Treisman explains the empirical results more accurately.

==Short Term Memory==
The '''Short Term Memory''' (STM) was initially discussed by Attkinson and Shiffrin (1968).&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, R. C. &amp; Shiffrin, R. M. (1968). Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes. 
:In K. Spence &amp; J. Spence (Eds.), ''The psychology of learning and motivation (Volume 2)''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Short Term Memory is the link between '''Sensory Memory''' and '''Long Term Memory''' (LTM). Later Baddeley proposed a more sophisticated approach and called the interface '''Working Memory''' (WM). We will first look at the classical Short Term Memory Model and then go on to the concept of Working Memory.

As the name suggests, information is retained in the Short Term Memory for a rather short period of time (15–30 seconds).  [[Image:ShortTermMemory.jpg|framed|Short Term Memory]] 
If we look up a phone number in the phone book and hold it in mind long enough for dialling the number, it is stored in the Short Term Memory. This is an example of a piece of information which can be remembered for a short period of time. According to George Miller (1956)&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. A. (1956). The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information. 
:''Psychological Review, 63'', 81-97.&lt;/ref&gt;  the capacity of the Short Term Memory is five to nine pieces of information (The '''[[w:Magical number seven|magical number seven, plus or minus two]]'''). The term &quot;pieces of information” or, as it is also called, '''chunk''' might strike one as a little vague.
All of the following are considered as chunks: single digits or letters, whole words or even sentences and the like. It has been shown by experiments also done by Miller that '''chunking''' (the process of bundeling information) is a useful method to memorize more than just single items in the common sense. Gobet et al. defined a chunk as &quot;a collection of elements that are strongly associated with one another but are weakly associated with other chunks&quot; (Goldstein, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, E. B. (2005). Cognitive Psychology. London: Thomson Leaning, page 157.&lt;/ref&gt; A very intuitive example of chunking information is the following:&lt;br&gt;
Try to remember the following digits:
*0 3 1 2 1 9 8 2
But you could also try another strategy to remember these digits:
*03. 12. 1982.
With this strategy you bundeled eight pieces of information (eight digits) to three pieces with help to remember them as a date schema.&lt;br&gt;  
A famous experiment concerned with chunking was conducted by Chase and Simon (1973)&lt;ref&gt;Chase, W. G. &amp; Simon, H.A. (1973). The mind’s eye in chess. In W. G. Chase (Ed.), ''Visual information processing''. 
:New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  with novices and experts in chess playing. When asked to remember certain arrangements of chess pieces on the board, the experts performed significantly better that the novices. However, if the pieces were arranged arbitrarily, i.e. not corresponding to possible game situations, both the experts and the novices performed equally poorly. The experienced chess players do not try to remember single positions of the figures in the correct game situation, but whole bundles of figures as already seen before in a game. In incorrect game situations this strategy cannot work which shows that chunking (as done by experienced chess players) enhances the performance only in specific memory tasks.

;From Short Term Memory to Baddeley’s Working Memory Model:
Baddeley and Hitch (1974)&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. D. &amp; Hitch, G. (1974). Working memory. In G. A. Bower (Ed.), ''Recent advances in learning and motivation (Vol. 8)''.
:New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  drew attention to a problem with the Short Term Memory Model. Under certain conditions it seems to be possible to do two different tasks simultaneously, even though the STM, as suggested by Atkinson and Shiffrin, should be regarded as a single, undivided unit. An example for the performance of two tasks simultaneously would be the following: a person is asked to memorize four numbers and then read a text (unrelated to the first task). Most people are able to recall the four numbers correctly after the reading task, so apparently both memorizing numbers and reading a text carefully can be done at the same time. According to Baddeley and Hitch the result of this experiment indicates that the number-task and the reading-task are handled by two different components of Short Term Memory. So they coined the term &quot;Working Memory&quot; instead of &quot;Short Term Memory&quot; to indicate that this kind of Memory enables us to perform several cognitive operations at a time with different parts of the Working Memory.

==Working Memory==
According to Baddeley, '''Working Memory''' is limited in its capacity (the same limitations hold as for Short Term Memory) and the Working Memory is not only capable of storage, but also of the manipulation of incoming information. Working Memory consists of three parts:&lt;br&gt; [[Image:WorkingMemory.jpg|framed|Working Memory]] 
*	'''Phonological Loop'''
*	'''Visuospatial Sketch Pad'''
*	'''Central Executive'''
We will consider each module in turn:&lt;br&gt;
The '''Phonological Loop''' is responsible for auditory and verbal information, such as phone numbers, people’s names or general understanding of what other people are talking about. We could roughly say that it is a system specialized for language. This system can again be subdivided into an active and a passive part. The storage of information belongs to the passive part and fades after two seconds if the information is not rehearsed explicitly. Rehearsal, on the other hand, is regarded as the active part of the Phonological Loop. The repetition of information deepens the memory. There are three well-known phenomena that support the idea that the Phonological Loop is specialized for language: The '''phonological similarity effect''', the '''word-length effect''' and '''articulatory suppression'''. When words that sound similar are confused, we speak of the phonological similarity effect. The word-length effect refers to the fact that it is more difficult to memorize a list of long words and better results can be achieved if a list of short words is memorized. Let us look at the phenomenon of articulatory suppression in a little more detail. Consider the following experiment:&lt;br&gt; 
Participants are asked to memorize a list of words while saying &quot;the, the, the ...“ out loud. What we find is that, with respect to the word-length effect, the difference in performance between lists of long and short words is levelled out. Both lists are memorized equally poorly. The explanation given by Baddeley et al. (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. D. (1986). ''Working Memory''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted this experiment, is that the constant repetition of the word &quot;the&quot; prevents the rehearsal of the words in the lists, independent of whether the list contains long or short words. The findings become even more drastic if we compare the memory-performance in the following experiment (also conducted by Baddeley and his co-workers in 1986):&lt;br&gt;
Participants were again asked to say out loud &quot;the, the, the ...&quot; But instead of memorizing words from a list of short or long words, their task was to remember words that were either spoken to them or shown to them written on paper. The results indicated that the participants’ performances were significantly better if the words were presented to them and not read out aloud. Baddeley concluded from this fact that the performance in a memory task is improved if the two stimuli can be dealt with in distinct components of the Working Memory. In other words, since the reading of words is handled in the Visuospatial Sketch Pad, whereas the saying of &quot;the&quot; belongs to the Phonological Loop, the two tasks do not &quot;block&quot; each other. The rather bad performance of hearing words while speaking could be explained by the fact that both hearing and speaking are dealt with in the Phonological Loop and thus the two tasks conflict with each other, decreasing the performance of memorization.&lt;br&gt;
In the '''Visuospatial Sketch Pad''' visual and spatial information is handled. This means that information about the position and properties of objects can be stored. As we have seen above, performance decreases if two tasks that are dealt with in the same component are to be done simultaneously. Let us consider a further example that illustrates this effect. Brandimonte and co-workers (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Brandimonte, M. A., Hitch, G. J., &amp; Bishop, D. V. M. (1992). Influence of short-term memory codes on visual image processing: 
:Evidence from image transformation tasks. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learing, Memory, and Cognition, 18'', 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt;  conducted an experiment where participants were asked to say out loud &quot;la, la, la...“ At the same time they were given the task of subtracting a partial image from a given whole image. The subtraction had to be done mentally because the two images were presented only for a short time. The interesting result was that the performance not only didn't decrease while saying &quot;la, la, la ...&quot; when compared to doing the subtraction-task alone, but the performance even increased. According to Brandimonte this was due to the fact that the subtraction task was easier if handled in the Visuospatial Sketch Pad as opposed to the Phonological Loop (both the given and the resulting pictures were such that they could also be named, i.e. verbalized, a task that belongs to the Phonological Loop). As mentioned above, because of the fact that the subtraction of a partial image from a whole given image is easier if done visually, the performance increased if participants were forced to visually perform that task, i.e. if they were forced to use the component that is suited best for the given task. We have seen that the Phonological Loop and the Visuospatial Sketch Pad deal with rather different kinds of information which nonetheless have to somehow interact in order to do certain tasks. The component that connects those two systems is the Central Executive.
The '''Central Executive''' co-ordinates the activity of both the Phonological Loop and the Visuospatial Sketch Pad. Imagine the following situation: You are driving a car and your friend in the passenger seat has the map and gives you directions. The directions are given verbally, i.e. they are handled by the Phonological Loop, while the perception of the traffic, street lights, etc. is obviously visual, i.e. dealt with in the Visuospatial Sketch Pad. If you now try to follow the directions given to you by your friend it is necessary to somehow combine both kinds of information, the verbal and the visual information. This important connection of the two components is done by the Central Executive. It also links the Working Memory to Long Term Memory, controls the storage in Long Term Memory and the retrieval from it. The process of storage is influenced by the duration of holding information in Working Memory and the amount of manipulation of the information. The latter is stored for a longer time if it is semantically interpreted and viewed with relation to other information already stored in Long Term Memory. This is called Deep Processing. Pure syntactical processing (reading a text for typos) is called Shallow Processing. Baddeley proposes also further capabilities for the Central Executive:
*	'''Initiating movement'''
*	'''Control of conscious attention'''

;Problems which arise with the Working Memory approach:
In theory all information has to pass the Working Memory in order to be stored in the Long Term Memory. However, cases have been reported where patients could form Long Term Memories even though their STM-abilities were severely reduced. This clearly poses a problem to the modal model approach. It was suggested by Shallice and Warrington (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Shallice, T., &amp; Warrington, E. K. (1970). Independent functioning of verbal memory stores: A neuropsychological study. 
:''Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,22'', 261-273.&lt;/ref&gt;  that there must be another possible way for information to enter Long Term Memory than via Working Memory.

==Long Term Memory==
As the name already suggest, '''Long Term Memory''' is the system where memories are stored for a long time. &quot;Long&quot; in this sense means something between a few minutes and several years or even decades to lifelong. 
[[Image:LongTermMemory.jpg|framed|Long Term Memory]] 
Similar to Working Memory, Long Term Memory can again be subdivided into different types. Two major distinctions are made between '''Declarative''' (conscious) and '''Implicit''' (unconscious) '''Memory'''. Those two subtypes are again split into two components each: '''Episodic''' and '''Semantic Memory''' with respect to '''Declarative Memory''' and '''Priming Effects''', and '''Procedural Memory''' with respect to Implicit Memory. In contrast to Short Term or Working Memory, the capacity of Long Term Memory is theoretically infinite. The opinions as to whether information remains in the Long Term Memory forever or whether information can get deleted differ. The main argument for the latter opinion is that apparently not all information that was ever stored in LTM can be recalled. However, theories that regard Long Term Memories as not being subject to deletion emphasize that there might be a useful distinction between the existence of information and the ability to retrieve or recall that information at a given moment. There are several theories about the “forgetting” of information. These will be covered in the section '''“Forgetting and False Memory”'''.

====Declarative Memory====
Let us now consider the two types of '''Declarative Memory'''. As noted above, those two types are '''Episodic''' and '''Semantic Memory'''. Episodic Memory refers to memories for particular events that have been experienced by somebody (autobiographical information). Typically, those memories are connected to specific times and places. Semantic Memory, on the other hand, refers to knowledge about the world that is not connected to personal events. Vocabularies, concepts, numbers or facts would be stored in the Semantic Memory. Another subtype of memories stored in Semantic Memory is that of the so called '''Scripts'''. Scripts are something like blueprints of what happens in a certain situation. For example, what usually happens if you visit a restaurant (You get the menu, you order your meal, eat it and you pay the bill). Semantic and Episodic Memory are usually closely related to one another, i.e. memory of facts might be enhanced by interaction with memory about personal events and vice versa. For example, the answer to the factual question of whether people put vinegar on their chips might be answered positively by remembering the last time you saw someone eating fish and chips. The other way around, good Semantic Memory about certain things, such as football, can contribute to more detailed Episodic Memory of a particular personal event, like watching a football match. A person that barely knows the rules of that game will most probably have a less specific memory for the personal event of watching the game than a football-expert will.

====Implicit Memory====
We now turn to the two different types of '''Implicit Memory'''. As the name suggests, both types are usually active when unconscious memories are concerned. This becomes most evident for '''Procedural Memory''', though it must be said that the distinction between both types is not as clearly cut as in the case of Declarative Memory and that often both categories are collapsed into the single category of Procedural Memory. But if we want to draw the distinction between '''Priming Effects''' and '''Procedural Memory''', the latter category is responsible for highly skilled activities that can be performed without much conscious effort. Examples would be the tying of shoelaces or the driving of a car, if those activities have been practiced sufficiently. It is some kind of movement plan. As regards the '''Priming Effect''', consider the following experiment conducted by Perfect and Askew (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Perfect, T. J., &amp; Askew, C. (1994). Print adverts: Not remembered but memorable. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology, 8'', 693-703.&lt;/ref&gt; :&lt;br&gt;
Participants were asked to read a magazine without paying attention to the advertisements. After that, different advertisements were presented to them; some had occurred in the magazine, others had not. The participants were told to rate the presented advertisement with respect to different criteria such as how appealing, how memorable or eye-catching they were. The result was that in general those advertisements that had been in the magazine received higher rankings than those that had not been in the magazine. Additionally, when asked which advertisements the participants had actually seen in the magazine, the recognition was very poor (only 2.8 of the 25 advertisements were recognized). This experiment shows that the participants performed '''implicit learning''' (as can be seen from the high rankings of advertisements they had seen before) without being conscious of it (as can be seen from the poor recognition rate). This is an example of the Priming Effect.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Overview Memory.jpeg|framed|center|Final overview of all different types of memory and their interaction]] 

=Forgetting and False Memory=

As important as memory is, also the process of Forgetting is present to everybody.&lt;br&gt; 
Therefore one might wonder:

*	Why do we forget at all?
*	What do we forget?
*	How do we forget?

 
;Why do we forget at all?
One might come up with something you could call “mental hygiene”. It is not useful to remember every little detail of your life and your surrounding, but rather a disadvantage because you maybe would not be able to remember the important things as quickly or even quick enough but have an overload of facts in your memory. Therefore it is important that unused memories are “cleaned up” so that only relevant information is stored.

;What do we forget and how?
There are different theories about how things are forgotten. One theory proposes that the capacity of the Long Term Memory is infinite. This would mean that actually all memories are stored in the LTM but some information cannot be recalled (anymore) due to factors to be mentioned in the following paragraphs:

There are two main theories about the causes of forgetting:
*The &lt;u&gt;'''Trace Decay Theory'''&lt;/u&gt; states that you need to follow a certain path, or trace, to recall a memory. If this path has not been used for some time, one would say that the activity of the information decreases (it fades (-&gt;decays)), which leads to difficulty or the inability to recall the memory. [[Image:Memory Interference.JPG|450px|right|Memory Interference]]

*The '''&lt;u&gt;Interference Theory&lt;/u&gt;''' proposes that all memories interfere with each other. One distinguishes between two kinds of interferences:
**	'''Proactive Interference''':
*:Earlier memories influence new ones or hinder one to make new ones.
**	'''Retroactive Interference''':
*:Old memories are changed by new ones, maybe even so much that the original one is completely ‘lost’.

*Which of the two theories applies in your opinion?
*Do you agree with a mixture of the two?

[[Image:Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve.jpg|450px|left|Ebbinghaus Curve of forgetting]]

In 1885 '''[[w:Hermann Ebbinghaus|Herrmann Ebbinghaus]]''' did several self-experiments to research human forgetting. He memorized a list of meaningless syllables, like “WUB” and “ZOF”, and tried to recall as many as possible after certain intervals of time for several weeks. 
He found out that forgetting can be described with an almost logarithmic curve, the so called '''[[w:Forgetting curve|forgetting curve]]''' which you can see on the left.

These theories about forgetting already make clear that memory is not a reliable recorder but it is a construction based on what actually happened plus additional influences, such as other knowledge, experiences, and expectations. Thus '''false memories''' are easily created.

In general there are three types of tendencies towards which people’s memories are changed. These tendencies are called

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==Biases in memory==
One distinguishes between three major types:

*	'''Egocentric Bias'''
*:It makes one see his or herself in the best possible light.
*	'''Consistency Bias'''
*:Because of which one perceive his or her basic attitudes to remain persistent over time.
*	'''Positive Change Bias'''
*:It is cause for the fact that one perceives things to be generally improving.

(For a list of more known memory biases see: [[w:Memory bias|List of memory biases]])

There are moments in our lives that we are sure about never to forget. It is generally perceived that the memories of events that we are emotionally involved with are remembered for a longer time than others and that we know every little detail of them. These kinds of memories are called '''Flashbulb Memories'''.&lt;br&gt;
The accuracy of the memories is an illusion, though. The more time passes, the more these memories have changed while our feeling of certainty and accuracy increases. Examples for Flashbulb Memories are one’s wedding, the birth of one’s child or tragedies like [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]].

Interesting changes in memory can also occur due to '''Misleading Postevent Information''' (MPI). After an event information given another person can so to say intensify your memory in a certain respect. This effect was shown in an experiment by Loftus and Palmer (1974)&lt;ref&gt;Loftus, E. F., &amp; Palmer, J. C. (1974). Reconstruction of an automobile destruction: 
:An example of the interaction between language and memory. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 13'', 585-589.&lt;/ref&gt; :
The subjects watched a film in which there were several car accidents. Afterwards they were divided into three groups that were each questioned differently. While the control group was not asked about the speed of the cars at all, in the other groups questions with a certain key word were posed. One group was asked how fast the cars were going when they hit each other, while in the other question the verb “smashed” was used. One week later all participants were asked whether they saw broken glass in the films.
Both the estimation of speed and the amount of people claiming to have seen broken glass increased steadily from the control group to the third group.&lt;br&gt;
Based on this '''Misinformation Effect''' the '''Memory Impairment Hypothesis''' was proposed.&lt;br&gt;
This hypothesis states that suggestible and more detailed information that one receives after having made the actual memory can replace the old memory.&lt;br&gt;
Keeping the possible misleading information in mind, one can imagine how easily [[w:Eyewitness identification|eyewitness testimony]] can be (purposely or accidentally) manipulated. Depending on which questions the witnesses are asked they might later on remember to see, for example, a weapon or not.

These kinds of changes in memory are present in everyone on a daily basis. But there are other cases: People with a lesion in the brain sometimes suffer from '''Confabulation'''. They construct absurd and incomplete memories that can even contradict with other memories or with what they know. Although the people might even be aware of the absurdness of their memories they are still firmly convinced of them. (See Helen Phillips' article ''[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19225720.100-mind-fiction-why-your-brain-tells-tall-tales.html Mind fiction: Why your brain tells tall tales]'')

==Repressed and Recovered Memories==
If one cannot remember an event or detail it does not mean that the memory is completely lost. Instead one would say that these memories are '''repressed''', which means that they cannot easily be remembered. The process of remembering in these cases is called '''recovery'''.&lt;br&gt; 
Recovering of a repressed memory usually occurs due to a '''retrieval cue'''. This might be an object or a scene that reminds one of something which has happened long ago.&lt;br&gt;
Traumatic events, which happened during childhood for example, can be recovered with the help of a therapist.  This way, perpetrators have been brought to trial after decades.&lt;br&gt; 
Still, the correctness of the “recovered” memory is not guaranteed: as we know, memory is not reliable and if the occurrence of an event is suggestible one might produce a false memory.&lt;br&gt;
Look at the illustration to the right to be able to relate to these processes.

[[File:Memory forget corr.svg|thumb|How did the memory for an event become what it is?]]

Other than on a daily basis errors in memory and amnesia are due to damages in the brain. The following paragraphs will present the most important brain regions enabling memory and mention effects of damage to them.

=Some neurobiological facts about memory=

In this section we will first consider how information is stored in synapses and then talk about two regions of the brain that are mainly involved in forming new memories, namely the '''amygdala''' and the '''hippocampus'''. To show what effects memory diseases can have and how they are classified, we will discuss a case study of '''amnesia''' and two other common examples for amnesic diseases: '''Karsakoff’s amnesia''' and '''Alzheimer’s disease'''.

==Information storage==
The idea that physiological changes at synapses happen during learning and memory was first introduced by '''Donald Hebb'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D. O. (1948). ''Organization of behavior''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in fact shown that activity at a synapse leads to structural changes at the synapse and to enhanced firing in the postsynaptic neuron. Since this process of enhanced firing lasts for several days or weeks, we talk about '''[[w:Long-term potentiation|Long Term Potentiation]]''' (LTP). During this process existing synaptic proteins are altered and new proteins are synthesized at the modified synapse. What does all this have to do with memory? It has been discovered that LTP is most easily generated in regions of the brain which are involved in learning and memory - especially the hippocampus, about which we will talk in more detail later. Donald Hebb found out that not only a synapse of two neurons is involved in LTP but that a particular group of neurons is more likely to fire together. According to this, an experience is represented by the firing of this group of neurons. So it works according to the principle: 
'''“what wires together fires together”'''.

==Amygdala==
The '''[[w:Amygdala|amygdala]]''' is involved in the modulation of '''memory consolidation'''. 
[[Image:Amyg.png|left|Location of the amygdala in the human brain]] 
Following any learning event, the Long Term Memory for the event is not instantaneously formed. Rather, information regarding the event is slowly assimilated into long term storage over time, a process referred to as '''[[w:Memory consolidation|memory consolidation]]''', until it reaches a relatively permanent state. During the consolidation period, memory can be modulated. In particular, it appears that emotional arousal following a learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person's retention of that event. Experiments have shown that administration of stress hormones to individuals, immediately after they learn something, enhances their retention when they are tested two weeks later. The amygdala, especially the basolateral nuclei, is involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the memory for the event. There were experiments conducted by [[w:James McGaugh|James McGaugh]] on animals in special laboratories. These laboratories have trained animals on a variety of learning tasks and found that drugs injected into the amygdala after training affect the animal’s subsequent retention of the task. These tasks include basic '''[[w:Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]ian Tasks''' such as '''Inhibitory Avoidance''', where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular compartment of an apparatus, and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze, where a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water. If a drug that activates the amygdala is injected into the amygdala, the animals had better memory for the training in the task. When a drug that inactivated the amygdala was injected, the animals had impaired memory for the task.  Despite the importance of the amygdala in modulating memory consolidation, however, learning can occur without it, although such learning appears to be impaired, as in fear conditioning impairments following amygdala damage.  Evidence from work with humans indicates a similar role of the amygdala in humans . Amygdala activity at the time of encoding information correlates with retention for that information. However, this correlation depends on the relative “emotionality” of the information. More emotionally-arousing information increases amygdalar activity, and that activity correlates with retention.

==Hippocampus==
Psychologists and neuroscientists dispute over the precise role of the '''[[w:Hippocampus|hippocampus]]''', but, generally, agree that it plays an essential role in the formation of new memories about experienced events (Episodic or Autobiographical Memory).
[[Image:Hippocampus.png|185px|left|Position of the hippocampus in the human brain]] 
Some researchers prefer to consider the hippocampus as part of a larger [[w:Temporal lobe|medial temporal lobe]] memory system responsible for general declarative memory (memories that can be explicitly verbalized — these would include, for example, memory for facts in addition to episodic memory).  Some evidence supports the idea that, although these forms of memory often last a lifetime, the hippocampus ceases to play a crucial role in the retention of the memory after a period of consolidation. Damage to the hippocampus usually results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia), and normally also affects access to memories prior to the damage (retrograde amnesia). Although the retrograde effect normally extends some years prior to the brain damage, in some cases older memories remain intact - this sparing of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain. However, researchers have difficulties in testing the sparing of older memories and, in some cases of retrograde amnesia, the sparing appears to affect memories formed decades before the damage to the hippocampus occurred, so its role in maintaining these older memories remains controversial.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Amnesia==
As already mentioned in the preceding section about the hippocampus, there are two types of '''amnesia''' - '''retrograde''' and '''antrograde amnesia'''.  
[[Image:Forgetting.jpg|framed|center|Different types of Amnesia]] 
Amnesia can occur when there is damage to a number of regions in the medial temporal lobe and their surrounding structures. The '''[[w:H.M.|patient H.M.]]''' is probably one of the best known patients who suffered from amnesia. Removing his medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, seemed to be a good way to treat the epilepsy. What could be observed after this surgery was that H.M. was no longer able to remember things which happened after his 16th birthday, which was 11 years before the surgery. So given the definitions above one can say that he suffered retrograde amnesia. Unfortunately, he was not able to learn new information due to the fact that his hippocampus was also removed. H.M. therefore suffered not only from retrograde amnesia, but also from anterograde amnesia. His Implicit Memory, however, was still working. In procedural memory tests, for example, he still performed well. When he was asked to draw a star on a piece of paper which was shown to him in a mirror, he performed as bad as every other participant in the beginning. But after some weeks his performance improved even though he could not remember having done the task many times before. Thus, H.M.’s Declarative Memory showed severe deficits but his Implicit Memory was still fine. Another quite common cause of amnesia is the '''[[w:Korsakoff's syndrome|Korsakoff’s syndrome]]''' or also called Korsakoff’s amnesia. Long term alcoholism usually elicits this Korsakoff’s amnesia due to a prolonged deficiency of vitamin B1. This syndrome is associated with the pathology of the midline diencephalon including the dorsomedial thalamus. '''[[w:Alzheimer|Alzheimer’s disease]]''' is probably the best known type of amnesia because it is the most common type in our society. Over 40 percent of the people who are older than 80 are affected by Alzheimer’s disease. It is a neurodegenerative disease and the region in the brain which is most affected is the entorhinal cortex. This cortex forms the main input and output of the hippocampus and so damages here are mostly severe. Knowing that the hippocampus is especially involved in forming new memories one can already guess the patients have difficulties in learning new information. But in late stages of Alzheimer’s disease also retrograde amnesia and even other cognitive abilities, which we are not going to discuss here, might occur.

'''Everyday memory - Eyewitness testimony'''

 
'''Introduction'''
 
Witness psychology is the study of human as an observer and reporter of events in life. It’s about how detailed and accurate we register what is happening, how well we remember what we observed, what causes us to forget and remember the mistakes, and our ability to assess the reliability and credibility of others' stories. It is the study of observation and memory for large and small events in life, from everyday trivialities to the dramatic and traumatic events that shook our lives (Magnussen, 2010)


'''Basic concepts
''' 

The eyewitness identification literature has developed a number of definitions and concepts that require explanation. Each definition and concept is described below.
 
A ''lineup'' is a procedure in which a criminal suspect (or a picture of the suspect) is placed among other people (or pictures of other people) and shown to an eyewitness to see if the witness will identify the suspect as the culprit in question. The term suspect should not be confused with the term culprit. A suspect might or might not be the culprit, a suspect is suspected of being the culprit (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003)

''Fillers'' are people in the lineup who are not suspects. Fillers, sometimes called foils or distractors, are known-innocent members of the lineup. Therefore, the identification of filler would not result in charges being brought against the filler. A culprit-absent lineup is one in which an innocent suspect is embedded among fillers and a culprit-present lineup is one in which a guilty suspect (culprit) is embedded among fillers. The primary literature sometimes calls these target-present and target-absent lineups (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).

A ''simultaneous lineup'' is one in which all lineup members are presented to the eyewitness at once and is the most common lineup procedure in use by law enforcement. A sequential lineup, on the other hand, is one in which the witness is shown only one person at a time but with the expectation that there are several lineup members to be shown (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).

A ''lineup’s functional size'' is the number of lineup members who are “viable” choices for the eyewitness. For example, if the eyewitness described the culprit as being a tall male with dark hair and the suspect is the only lineup member who is tall with dark hair, then the lineup’s functional size would be 1.0 even if there were 10 fillers. Today functional size is used generically to mean the number of lineup members who fit the eyewitness’s description of the culprit (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).

''Mock witnesses'' are people who did not actually witness the crime but are asked to pick a person from the lineup based on the eyewitness’s verbal description of the culprit. They are shown the lineup and are asked to indicate who is the offender. Mock witnesses are used to test the functional size of the lineup (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).

The ''diagnosticity of suspect identification'' is the ratio of accurate identification rate with a culprit-present lineup to the inaccurate identification rate with a culprit- absent lineup. The diagnosticity of “not there” is the ratio of “not there” response rates with culprit-absent lineups to “not there” response rates with culprit-present lineups. The diagnosticity of filler identifications is the ratio of filler identification rates with culprit-absent lineups to filler identification rates with culprit-present lineups (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003)

Among variables that affect eyewitness identification accuracy, a system variable is one that is, or could be, under control of the criminal justice system, while an estimator variable is one that is not. Estimator variables include lighting conditions at the time of witnessing and whether the witness and culprit are of the same or of different races. System variables include instructions given to eyewitnesses prior to viewing a lineup and the functional size of a lineup. The distinction between estimator and system variables has assumed great significance in the eyewitness identification literature since it was introduced in the late 1970s . In large part, the prominence of this distinction attests to the applied nature of the eyewitness identification literature. Whereas the development of a literature on estimator variables permits some degree of post diction that might be useful for assessing the chances of mistaken identification after the fact, the development of a system variable literature permits specification of how eyewitness identification errors might be prevented in the first place (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003). 


'''History and Reliability
''' 

The criminal justice system relies heavily on eyewitness identification for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Psychology has built the only scientific literature on eyewitness identification and has warned the justice system of problems with eyewitness identification evidence. Recent DNA exoneration cases have corroborated the warnings of eyewitness identification researchers by showing that mistaken eyewitness identification was the largest single factor contributing to the conviction of innocent people (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).
 
Psychological researchers who began programs in the 1970s, however, have consistently articulated concerns about the accuracy of eyewitness identification. Using various methodologies, such as filmed events and live staged crimes, eyewitness researchers have noted that mistaken identification rates can be surprisingly high and that eyewitnesses often express certainty when they mistakenly select someone from a lineup. Although their findings were quite compelling to the researchers themselves, it was not until the late 1990s that criminal justice personnel began taking the research seriously. This change in attitude about the psychological literature on eyewitness identification arose primarily from the development of forensic DNA tests in the 1990s (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003). More than 100 people who were convicted prior to the advent of forensic DNA have now been exonerated by DNA tests, and more than 75% of these people were victims of mistaken eyewitness. The apparent prescience of the psychological literature regarding problems with eyewitness identification has created a rising prominence of eyewitness identification research in the criminal justice system. Because most crimes do not include DNA-rich biological traces, reliance on eyewitness identification for solving crimes has not been significantly diminished by the development of forensic DNA tests. The vast criminal justice system itself has never conducted an experiment on eyewitness identification (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).  


'''Research'''

The experimental method has dominated the eyewitness literature, and most of the experiments are lab based. Lab-based experimental methods for studying eyewitness issues have strengths and weaknesses. The primary strength of experimental methods is that they are proficient at establishing cause–effect relations. This is especially important for research on system variables, because one needs to know in fact whether a particular system manipulation is expected to cause better or worse performance. In the real world, many variables can operate at the same time and in interaction with one another (Wells, Memon &amp; Penrod, 2006)

Multicollinearity can be quite a problem in archival/field research, because it can be very difficult to sort out which (correlated) variables are really responsible for observed effects. The control of variables that is possible in experimental research can bring clarity to causal relationships that are obscured in archival research.  For example, experiments on stress during witnessing have shown, quite compellingly, that stress interferes with the ability of eyewitnesses to identify a central person in a stressful situation. However, when Yuille and Cutshall (1986) studied multiple witnesses to an actual shooting, they found that those who reported higher stress had better memories for details than did those who reported lower stress. Why the different results? In the experimental setting, stress was manipulated while other factors were held constant; in the actual shooting, those who were closer to the incident reported higher levels of stress (presumably because of their proximity) but also had a better view. Thus, in the actual case, stress and view covaried. The experimental method is not well suited to post diction with estimator variables—that is, there may be limits to generalizing from experiments to actual cases. One reason is that levels of estimator variables in experiments are fixed and not necessarily fully representative of the values observed in actual cases. In addition, it is not possible to include all interesting and plausible interactions among variables in any single experiment (or even in a modest number of experiments). Clearly, generalizations to actual cases are best undertaken on the basis of a substantial body of experimental research conducted across a wide variety of conditions and employing a wide variety of variables. Nevertheless, the literature is largely based on experiments due to a clear preference by eyewitness researchers to learn about cause and effect. Furthermore, ‘‘ground truth’’ (the actual facts of the witnessed event) is readily established in experiments, because the witnessed events are creations of the experimenters. This kind of ground truth is difficult, if not impossible, to establish when analyzing actual cases (Wells et al. 2006). 


'''Memory'''
 
The world is complex. All natural situations or scenes contains infinitely more physical and social information than the brain is able to detect. The brain’s ability to record information is limited.  In studies of immediate memory for strings of numbers that have been read once, it turns out that most people begin to go wrong if the number of single digits exceeds five (Nordby, Raanaas &amp; Magnussen, 2002). The limitations of what humans are capable to process, leads to an automatically selection of information. This selection is partially controlled by external factors, the factors in our environment that captures our attention (Magnussen, 2010). In the witness psychology we often talk about the weapon focus, in which eyewitnesses attend to the weapon, which reduces their memory for other information (Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2010). The selection of information in a cognitive overload situation is also governed by psychological factors, the characteristics of the person who is observing. It is about the emotional state and the explicit and implicit expectations of what will happen. Psychologists call such expectations cognitive schemas. Cognitive schemas forms a sort of hypotheses or map of the world based on past experiences. These hypotheses or mental maps of the world determines what the brain chooses of the information, and how it interprets and if it will be remembered. When information is uncertain or ambiguous, the psychological factors are strong (Magnussen, 2010).

Eyewitness testimony can be distorted via confirmation bias, i.e., event memory is influenced by the observer’s expectation.  A study made by Lindholm and Christianson (1998), Swedish and immigrant students saw a videotaped simulated robbery in which the perpetrator seriously wounded a cashier with a knife. After watching the video, participants were shown color photographs of eight men – four Swedes and the remainder immigrants. Both Swedish and immigrant participants were twice as likely to select an innocent immigrant as an innocent swede. Immigrants are overrepresented in Swedish crime statistics, and this influenced participants’ expectations concerning the likely ethnicity of the criminal (Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2010)

Bartlett (1932) explained why our memory is influenced by our expectations. He argued that we possess numerous schemas or packets of knowledge stored in long-term memory. These schemas lead us to form a certain expectations and can distort our memory by causing us to reconstruct an event details based on “what must have been true”(Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2010). What we select of information, and how we interpret information is partially controlled by cognitive schemas. Many cognitive schemas are generalized, and for a large automated and non-conscious, as the expectation that the world around us is stable and does not change spontaneously. Such generalized expectations are basic economic and making sure we do not have to devote so much energy to monitor the routine events of daily life, but they also contribute to the fact that we in certain situations may overlook important, but unexpected information, or supplement the memory with details who is form consistent, but who actually don´t exist (Magnussen, 2010).


'''Estimator variables
'''

First, estimator variables are central to our understanding of when and why eyewitnesses are most likely to make errors. Informing police, prosecutors, judges, and juries about the conditions that can affect the accuracy of an eyewitness account is important. Second, our understanding of the importance of any given system variable is, at least at the extreme, dependent on levels of the estimator variables. Consider a case in which a victim eyewitness is abducted and held for 48 hours by an unmasked perpetrator; the witness has repeated viewings of the perpetrator, lighting is good, and so on. We have every reason to believe that this witness has a deep and lasting memory of the perpetrator’s face. Then, within hours of being released, the eyewitness views a lineup. Under these conditions, we would not expect system variables to have much impact. For instance, a lineup that is biased against an innocent suspect is not likely to lead this eyewitness to choose the innocent person, because her memory is too strong to be influenced by lineup bias. On the other hand, when an eyewitness’s memory is weaker, system variables have a stronger impact. Psychologists have investigated the effects on identification accuracy of a large number of estimator variables, witness, crime, and perpetrator characteristics. Here we recount findings concerning several variables that have received significant research attention and achieved high levels of consensus among experts (based on items represented in a survey by Kassin, Tubb, Hosch, &amp; Memon, 2001) or have been the subject of interesting recent research (Wells et al. 2006).

*an egg
*vinegar
*A beaker
*Some water
*a pin

==What to do==

[[Image:Egginbeaker.png|right|120px]]
Step one. Put the egg carefully into a beaker of vinegar.

Step two. Leave the egg overnight.

Step three.Take the egg out of the vinegar and the shell would have gone.

Step four.Put your egg that doesn't have any shell on it into a bowl of clean water and leave over night.

Step five.The egg will swell up and then poke it with a pin and it will squirt out like a fountain.

==Principle==

Vinegar, due to its acidity, will break down the calcium carbonate shell of the egg. This can be clearly visible in a change of the vinegar color. When you put the egg into water, a process called osmosis happens. The egg tries to maintain a balance of water inside the egg to that outside of the egg, so it will take in large amounts of the water it is currently in, making it swell.

==Principle==

The principle of this experiment is density. Density is the ratio between volume and mass. When different substances of different densities are added to a container, one frequently floats on top of the other because it has lower density. The perfect example of this is oil on top of gasoline.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do you like spying? If you do that's very good. We are going to make a periscope today. 

'''You will need''': 
*2 small mirrors 
*sticky tape 
*scissors 
*rectangular box

'''Directions'''
# First, cut out a hole just big enough to fit the mirror into the bottom of one side. 
# Then do the same on the top of the other side. Place the mirrors into the holes so that they fit snuggly in the corner, and use the tape to keep them there. 
# when you look through one slit, you should see out the other.

== General Overview ==

The '''''Hog's Head Inn''''' is a &quot;small, dingy&quot; pub in the Village of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

There are two pubs in Hogsmeade, one, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the ''Three Broomsticks'']], which caters to the general population, and one which is mostly frequented by those living on the Wizarding outskirts. The Hog's Head is the latter. It is a much grimier place than the Three Broomsticks, and there are many fewer restrictions; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] comments in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] that he could probably buy a Firewhiskey there without being questioned about his age.

Many events occurring in the Hog's Head are apparently somewhat on the shady side.
* This pub is where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] interviews [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Sybill Trelawney]] for the post of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination Teacher]], where she gives the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] about Harry, and is where that prophecy is overheard.
* It is in the Hog's Head that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] joins a card game with a man who never lowers his hood, and &quot;wins&quot; a dragon's egg in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]. Ron comments, on first seeing the inside of the place, that it is the sort of place where someone not lowering their hood would be understandable.
* The Hog's Head is home to the first meeting of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and is where plans for that organization are overheard.
* The innkeeper of the Hog's Head is seen to consider purchasing probably stolen goods from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are nearly captured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], it is the innkeeper at the Hog's Head who rescues them, pulling them into the bar and claiming to have cast the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] that the Death Eaters had seen. We overhear discussion then between the innkeeper and the Death Eaters where it is more than suggested that the reason the Hog's Head remains undisturbed by Death Eaters is because it provides a safe haven for their under-the-table dealings. We later learn that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], called upon to provide food for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], had created a secret passage which terminated in an upstairs room at the Hog's Head.

Though never stated outright in the first six books, there are clues suggesting that Professor Dumbledore's brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], is the landlord at the Hog's Head. The author confirmed this on her web site, and stated it explicitly in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

== Analysis ==

A major source of our understanding of the Wizarding world's seedy underbelly and the establishments its denizens typically frequent is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], properly introduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. Before that, of course, we had learned of the places the underworld would frequent with our visit to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. The Hog's Head Inn is another such establishment, though not as actively evil as much of what we have seen in Knockturn Alley. To a lesser extent, most pubs will attract some unsavory patrons; for instance in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], Harry thinks he notices a hag patronizing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Leaky Cauldron|The Leaky Cauldron]].

The importance of this type of location to the story cannot be overlooked. In ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Harry needs some place away from the school and the malign influence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], where he can meet with other students to plan rebellion. While The Three Broomsticks serves this purpose usually, it is far too public for such a large group to gather without raising questions. The perceived lawlessness of the Hog's Head serves the purpose admirably, giving us also the opportunity to have Harry overheard by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Willy Widdershins|Willy Widdershins]] and Mundungus Fletcher, characters who have their own reasons for wanting to limit the spread of information about the meetings to only a very select few &amp;ndash; those who will pay for the information, and those who are engaged in protecting Harry, respectively. It is this same lawlessness that will make the Hog's Head a safe haven for the Trio, even if only briefly, in the seventh book.

More to the point, the Hog's Head and its denizens fill a void far too often left in heroic fantasy. Always, there is a hero, and often forces arrayed on his side; always there is a villain, equally with forces of some sort; and there is a population of lesser characters to be oppressed or rescued. Many authors do not take much time to consider how the lesser characters live their lives when they are not being beaten down or lifted up. Here, with the Hog's Head and the character of Mundungus Fletcher, we see that the Wizarding world is not only made up of the Order, Death Eaters, and drones. There is a criminal class, who would be working around and under the laws of the land no matter which group promulgated them. Fletcher is, in this series, our archetypal petty grifter, and the Hog's Head his native environment &amp;ndash; or it would be had he not been banned. The continuing existence of both Fletcher and the Hog's Head implies strongly that other instances of the underworld, both persons and places, exist. It is this attention to detail that brings the Wizarding world alive for us. If Mundungus and the Hog's Head were not part of the story, we likely would not miss them, but it would significantly weaken our belief in the story, as their absence would make the fictional world far less real for us.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|returning from a mission]] to retrieve a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] floating over the school's Astronomy Tower. Reaching the top of the tower, a weakened Dumbledore sends Harry down for help, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrifies]] Harry when he hears someone coming. Harry helplessly watches as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], arrives and immediately [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Dumbledore. Dumbledore determines that Draco is there to kill him, and almost manages to talk him out of it, when four [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] enter the scene and start egging Draco on. Finally, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] reaches the top of the tower, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Dumbledore.

As the Death Eaters retreat down the staircase, Harry Petrifies one of them. As he reaches the main floor, he finds a few members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] and a few members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]] battling Death Eaters, and hears Snape call the Death Eaters off. Harry chases Snape and Draco, but although he is nearly able to catch up to them, he is unable to Jinx Snape. The Death Eaters escape, and Harry must return to the school and explain what had happened.

== Event Details ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] from their quest to find a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Dumbledore is very weak from the after-effects of potion, and is asking Harry to get [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] for him. They are met in the street by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], who alerts them of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] floating above the Astronomy Tower at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|summons]] brooms from inside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]], and flies with Dumbledore to the Astronomy Tower. Once at the top of the tower, Dumbledore is too weak to head down the stairs to the battle. He sends Harry, concealed by his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] to fetch Snape, but before Harry can reach the door, footsteps are heard approaching the door from the other side, and Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|immobilizes]] Harry. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], bursting onto the scene, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Dumbledore, and Harry must look on silently as Dumbledore almost convinces Malfoy to change sides. Dumbledore correctly determines that Draco is motivated by fear for his family and himself, and plays on that, and his understanding that Draco is not totally evil.

Four [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] now arrive, and approach a weakened Dumbledore. While they jeer at Draco and try to egg him on, he seems, at the end incapable of killing Dumbledore. The Death Eaters also refrain from killing Dumbledore, as they have apparently received instructions from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] that this is Draco's job, that he must do it on his own. 

Finally, Snape arrives, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Dumbledore. The Death Eaters turn to leave; Harry finds himself freed from the body-binding spell and runs after them, Petrifying one as he hurries to catch Snape. Snape has sounded the retreat, and the Death Eaters are now fighting a rearguard action as they head out of Hogwarts. Harry has to guess whether Snape and Draco are intending to try to exit through the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], that being how they had gotten in, or through the front door. Guessing, he uses every shortcut he knows on the way to the front door, seeing bloody footprints to reassure him he is headed in the right direction. As he exits the front doors, with Snape and Draco before him, and several other Death Eaters behind, he tries to Jinx Snape several times but is repeatedly blocked. One of the Death Eaters behind him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Curses]] him, and he falls and loses his wand, but the curse is stopped by Snape, who says that Voldemort wants Harry for himself.

The Death Eaters leave the school and vanish outside the gates. Harry helps [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] extinguish his burning hut, and returns to where Dumbledore's body lies. There, he recovers the locket Horcrux that he and Dumbledore had found, and discovers that it is not a Horcrux at all, but instead contains a note from one &quot;R. A. B.&quot; who had evidently already retrieved the Horcrux and left this locket in its place. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] guides Harry up to the Hospital Wing, where Harry relates the events of the top of the Astronomy Tower to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and the others gathered there.

In the aftermath, we learn that casualties were light; a large blond Death Eater, identified in a later book as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]], had been flinging [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curses]] around randomly and had hit his fellow Death Eater, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gibbon|Gibbon]]. On the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] side, apart from Dumbledore, the only casualty was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who had been bitten severely by an un-transformed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and would likely retain facial scars for the rest of his life. The toll would almost certainly have been higher except for Harry's forethought in setting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] to watch the Room of Requirement, and giving Ron and Ginny some of his precious [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]] potion. Draco, finding the room watched when he had emerged, had used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Instant Darkness powder]] to prevent Ron, Ginny, and Neville from seeing the Death Eaters entering, but had luckily not Jinxed any of them. The students had luckily managed to find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who had brought the Order members at the school, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], and Bill Weasley, into the battle. Professor McGonagall had sent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] to fetch Snape; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], stationed outside Snape's office, had heard something fall, and Snape, spotting them as he departed, said Flitwick had fallen and they should take care of him. The combatants in the hall under the Astronomy Tower had let him go past, thinking he was one of them, and had tried to follow him up the tower where the Death Eaters had gone, but the magical barrier across the stairs, which Snape had passed as if it were not present, still stopped the Order members. When Snape had returned down the stairs with Draco, the Order members, believing he was on their side, had again allowed him to pass unmolested.

== Notable Consequences ==

Dumbledore is killed. Another of Harry's defenders and father figures has passed; Harry decides that he is not going to shield himself behind anyone else, he is going to have to tackle Voldemort himself, directly. This marks a vital stage in Harry's increasing maturity; rather than accepting guidance from others, Harry decides he will now choose his own path.

With the death of Dumbledore, the Headmaster's job will also be open. Whether this post will be offered to Professor McGonagall, currently the Deputy Headmaster and acting Headmaster in Dumbledore's absence, or not is as yet uncertain; it is the Board of Governors who appoint the Headmaster, and it is by no means certain that McGonagall, a Gryffindor, will be appointed following Dumbledore, who was apparently also a Gryffindor.

Now that Snape has effectively declared his loyalties and fled, the position of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher is again available. With Snape's departure, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] will become head of Slytherin house. Slughorn, though a Slytherin through and through, is not a Voldemort partisan, and may be somewhat less likely to encourage Slytherin students to follow him.

Draco Malfoy has declared himself to be firmly on the side of Voldemort. However, he has also funked the job he was given. His father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]], has now failed Voldemort three times, first by using the diary Horcrux irresponsibly and having it be destroyed, then by being involved in the failed plot to retrieve the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] which ended with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Bode]] being left insane, and finally failing to retrieve the Prophecy despite having twelve Death Eaters against six students, and incidentally alerting the Wizarding world to Voldemort's return, and getting himself imprisoned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Voldemort expects Draco to fail, as we see when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|his mother Narcissa]] visits Snape early in the book. Narcissa, at that point, hopes that if Dumbledore dies, whether it be by Draco's hand or Snape's, that Draco will at least have a chance to survive. However, the outcome of the battle will lower the Malfoy family in Voldemort's estimation, as now the two remaining Malfoy family members have failed him: Narcissa by talking to other Death Eaters about Voldemort's plans, and Draco by failing to carry out orders.

Harry determines that Dumbledore had believed in Snape's loyalty because Snape, having reported the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] concerning Harry to Voldemort, had then returned to Dumbledore and informed Dumbledore of his actions.

Bill's injury, while not fatal, is disfiguring, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] assumes that it will mean the end of the planned wedding between Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]. Fleur angrily denies this, however, and takes over nursing Bill from Mrs. Weasley. This revelation that there are unsuspected depths to Fleur wins Mrs. Weasley over. Until now, she had been putting up with Fleur solely for Bill's sake; now, she finally fully accepts Fleur as daughter-in-law.

In the aftermath of the battle, Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks re-open what is apparently an old conversation for them, as to whether they should marry. Lupin believes that it is not a safe time to bring a child into the world, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], perhaps surprisingly, comes down on Tonks' side of the argument, saying there never is a completely safe time. It appears that this may be enough to sway Lupin, as we will later see that Tonks is once again looking animated, and her hair color is returning to its earlier wild shades.

== Analysis ==

One of the keys to an extended story such as the Harry Potter series is that the reader must care about the hero. When the story is extended and episodic, the challenges that the hero faces must increase over time, so that despite his increasing strength, the reader feels that the hero is still challenged to the very brink of his abilities at each new crisis. In this one battle, we see Harry's greatest challenge to date, namely Severus Snape, who overtly declares himself a Death Eater by killing Dumbledore, and who then repeatedly thwarts Harry's attempts to attack him. Yet Harry manages to survive where Dumbledore did not. Looking back on this battle, of course, we see that Harry was not heavily involved; he seems to be at least partly protected by Snape, who says that Voldemort wants Harry for himself. Where Harry's strength is called for is not his physical or magical strength, but his strength of mind. He must support the weakened Dumbledore from the cave and back to the school, he must function despite witnessing the death of Dumbledore, and he must persevere to make plans for the eventual direct battle against Voldemort.

The death of Dumbledore, who until now had seemed indestructible and imperturbable, seems to put Harry entirely on his own; with Dumbledore gone, Harry's last apparent protector is gone. The readers can see that this is not entirely true; both Ron and Hermione volunteer to come with him and assist in the struggle to come. But while Ron and Hermione are of age, none of them have completed school yet, none of them are at their full powers. Is this going to be enough? We cannot know. It is certain that with Dumbledore gone, Voldemort's path to power is almost unobstructed.

For one who has made any study of heroic fiction of this nature, Dumbledore's fall, though saddening, is not unexpected. The hero must, in the end, proceed alone; with others shielding him, he cannot be a hero, after all. One of the major strengths of this particular instance is the nature of Dumbledore's fall, killed by one that he trusts, and has repeatedly said that he trusts. One fixed point in the series to this point is how consistently Dumbledore has been right. Up to this point, Dumbledore has made very few mistakes, though of course at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], he does admit to a fairly large error of omission, which he then proceeds to rectify. Now, he is seen to have made an extremely major error, in trusting Snape. We don't yet know what effect this will have on Harry's feelings towards Dumbledore, and the mission that Dumbledore has apparently left Harry to complete.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Board, now likely dominated by Death Eaters, will want to put one of their own into Hogwarts as headmaster, and Voldemort, who has long wanted control of Hogwarts, will want to put one of his most trusted servants into that position. Professor McGonagall will remain at the school, but it will be Severus Snape, his fortunes restored by the fall of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] to Voldemort and the subsequent demonization of Harry, who will become headmaster. Death Eaters will be placed in the school as instructors of Defence Against the Dark Arts and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]], topics in which Voldemort wishes to change the agenda to suit his own ambitions.

It is only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that we learn the truth of this particular battle. It is there, in Snape's memories, that we learn that the events on the tower top had been, to a certain extent, planned. Dumbledore knew that the curse which had withered his wand hand was only contained for a while, and within a year would break free and kill him. He also had known that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him. With these two things in mind, Dumbledore had arranged that when Draco tried and failed to kill Dumbledore, Snape would finish the job. It is worth mentioning that this conversation occurs prior to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] Snape made to Narcissa Malfoy, so that the vow simply reinforces what Snape had already promised Dumbledore. Dumbledore had also requested that Snape &quot;take care of his school&quot;; Snape's becoming Headmaster may have been in part due to Snape's own politicking within the Death Eater organization to secure that position for himself pursuant to Dumbledore's wishes.

Learning, at the same time, why Dumbledore had trusted Snape, we will come to understand that Snape was worthy of the trust Dumbledore had placed in him, right to the end. Harry's understanding of why Dumbledore trusted Snape is correct, but incomplete; he, and we, will discover the full reason for Snape's revealing Voldemort's intent to Dumbledore in the final book.

Hallo Aschoeke,

Ich mache ein [[WB:RFA|RfA]], weil ich auch glaube dass die &quot; speedy deletions&quot; nicht sehr schnell sind.

We are &quot;wikibookians&quot; (sorry that I read your message to SBJohnny). Many of the templates that say &quot;wikipedians&quot; were copied over from wikipedia, and never got changed. If you would like to change them, that would be great. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

I apologize if I was causing problems with my work on the preview template.  I'm still getting used to the system.  I will try to use the preview button more often as you suggest.

Hello Aschoeke, thanks for your comment. I'm a little confused about the directory structure of Wikibooks. I'm new to Wikibooks but contributed a lot to Wikipedia a couple of years ago. As I remember it, it's worth thinking twice before creating a new entry in the main namespace because normal users can't change them easily. That's why I started developing a plan for a Windows=&gt;Linux book on my user page. Any useful advice, or could you point me towards documentation that explains the standard structure of Wikibooks well? - [[User:Pir|Pir]] 12:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

As the title suggests, we assume you have prior knowledge of differential equations and linear algebra separately.

The book is structured into three main chapters, each with an important introduction that itself introduces material (So don't just skim over it thinking it's part of an outline) and then leads into method-heavy subsections.  Other than that, enjoy!

I'd like to add some examples using the matrix format.  I'm working on the Differential Equations book at the same time.  Down the road I would like to merge them with this book becoming a chapter in that one, but the Differential Equations book needs a lot of work before that

==Summary of the Act==

==General Description==
The Conservation Use Act allows property owners to designate all or portions of their property for “bona fide conservation use” which will entitle the land owner to tax breaks on undeveloped land.
  
==Qualifying Uses==
Qualifying uses may include wetlands, storm-water wetlands and runoff areas, groundwater recharge areas, river and stream corridors and buffers, habitat for endangered species, wildlife habitat in its natural state, high elevation areas such as ridge tops and crests, and farmland.

==Requirements==
To qualify, the landowner must agree to have the land continuously devoted to a qualifying use for ten years.  There is a 2,000 acre maximum.  To maintain conservation use status, the property owner must submit an annual inspection report from a licensed engineer certifying that the property is being maintained in the state for which it was intended.  Property subject to this current use assessment shall be separately classified from other property on the tax digest.

==History of the Act==


==Specific provisions of the Act==

==General Description==
This Act provides for the regulation and inspection of dams.  The Director of EPD has the responsibility for ensuring that all dams are designed by a competent engineer, approving plans for inspection and maintenance, and otherwise monitoring the condition of the dam.

==Permitting==
Anyone wishing to construct a dam must obtain a permit from EPD.  Permission is also required before removing a dam.  Dams receiving federal funds or under federal regulation are not governed by this act.  Small artificial barriers, less than six feet high are also outside the act.

==Dam Classification==
Dams are classified into two categories.  Category I is where improper operation or dam failure would probably cause loss of human life.  Category II is where dam failure would be unlikely to cause deaths.  Category I dams are monitored more closely by EPD.

==Summary of the Act==
The Chapter deals with beach erosion caused by dredging for navigation purposes in tidal inlets, rivers, and harbors.  It is Georgia state policy that there should be no net loss of sand from the island beaches because of dredging.  If feasible, any sand dug out of navigation channels is to be used to replenish adjacent coastal beaches.  If the sand is dumped somewhere else, then sand from an alternate location must be brought in to replenish coastal beaches if the dredging has caused beach erosion.  The sand replenishment activity must be done with the approval of the Department of Natural Resources and the local authority and must be done in a way that protects coastal marshlands and nesting sea turtles.

I think that the picture of Europa and Zeus is a little too much for children. Europa's almost naked, and although it does not show anything explicit, I think it should be replaced with a better picture. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

: Do you have a replacement in mind?  Looking through the alternatives in Commons, I didn't notice one that seemed better.  This one is colorful, has the relevant characters in it, doesn't have other spurious characters in it, and is less explicit than most alternatives.  Any picture in which Europa is wearing more has other characters serving no other apparent purpose than to have someone in the picture wearing less; artists seem to consider this necessary for scenes from classical mythology.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:10, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

This should probably be a separate section; trying to fit it into the intro at the top looks strange.

      <comment>/* 20th Century and the Cognitive Revolution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Imagine the following situation: A young man, let’s call him Knut, is sitting at his desk, reading some papers which he needs to complete a psychology assignment. In his right hand he holds a cup of coffee. With his left one he reaches for a bag of sweets without removing the focus of his eyes from the paper. Suddenly he stares up to the ceiling of his room and asks himself:
“What is happening here?” 

Probably everybody has had experiences like the one described above. Even though at first sight there is nothing exciting happening in this everyday situation, a lot of what is going on here is highly interesting particularly for researchers and students in the field of Cognitive Psychology. They are involved in the study of lots of incredibly fascinating processes which we are not aware of in this situation. Roughly speaking, an analysis of Knut's  situation by Cognitive Psychologists would look like this:

Knut has a problem; he really needs to do his assignment. To solve this problem, he has to perform loads of cognition. The light reaching his eyes is transduced into electrical signals traveling through several stations to his visual cortex. Meanwhile, complex nets of neurons filter the information flow and compute contrast, colour, patterns, positions in space, motion of the objects in Knut's environment. Stains and lines on the screen become words; words get meaning; the meaning is put into context; analyzed on its relevance for Knut's problem and finally maybe stored in some part of his memory. At the same time an appetite for sweets is creeping from Knut's [[w:Hypothalamus|hypothalamus]], a region in the brain responsible for controlling the needs of an organism. This appetite finally causes Knut to reach out for his sweets.

Now, let us take a look into the past to see how Cognitive Psychologists developed its terminology and methods to interpret ourselves on the basis of brain, behaviour and theory.

==History of Cognitive Psychology==

Early thoughts claimed that knowledge was stored in the brain.

===Renaissance and Beyond===

Renaissance philosophers of the 17th century generally agreed with Nativists and even tried to show the structure and functions of the brain graphically. But also empiricist philosophers had very important ideas. According to [[w:David_Hume|David Hume]], the internal representations of knowledge are formed obeying particular rules. These creations and transformations take effort and time. Actually, this is the basis of much current research in Cognitive Psychology. In the 19th Century [[w:Wilhelm_Wundt|Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[w:Donders|Franciscus Cornelis Donders]] made the corresponding experiments measuring the reaction time required for a response, of which further interpretation gave rise to Cognitive Psychology 55 years later.

===20th Century and the Cognitive Revolution===

During the first half of the 20th Century, a radical turn in the investigation of cognition took place. Behaviourists like [[w:B._F._Skinner|Burrhus Frederic Skinner]] claimed that such mental internal operations - such as attention, memory, thinking – are only hypothetical constructs that cannot be observed or proven.  Therefore, Behaviorists asserted, mental constructs are not as important and relevant as the study and experimental analysis of behaviour (directly observable data) in response to some stimulus. According to Watson and Skinner, man could be objectively studied only in this way. The popularity of Behavioralist theory in the psychological world led investigation of mental events and processes to be abandoned for about 50 years. 

In the 1950s scientific interest returned again to attention, memory, images, language processing, thinking and consciousness. The “failure” of Behaviourism heralded a new period in the investigation of cognition, called [[w:Cognitive_revolution|Cognitive Revolution]]. This was characterized by a revival of already existing theories and the rise of new ideas such as various communication theories.  These theories emerged mainly from the previously created information theory, giving rise to experiments in signal detection and attention in order to form a theoretical and practical understanding of communication.  

Modern linguists suggested new theories on language and grammar structure, which were correlated with cognitive processes. [[w:Chomsky|Chomsky’s]] Generative Grammar and Universal Grammar theory, proposed language hierarchy, and his critique of Skinner’s “Verbal Behaviour” are all milestones in the history of Cognitive Science. Theories of memory and models of its organization gave rise to models of other cognitive processes. Computer science, especially artificial intelligence, re-examined basic theories of problem solving and the processing and storage of memory, language processing and acquisition. 

[[w:Neuroinformatics|Neuroinformatics]], which is based on the natural structure of the human nervous system, tries to build neuronal structures by the idea of artificial neurons. In addition to that, Neuroinformatics is used as a field of evidence for psychological models, for example models for memory. The artificial neuron network “learns” words and behaves like “real” neurons in the brain. If the results of the artificial neuron network are quite similar to the results of real memory experiments, it would support the model. In this way psychological models can be “tested”. Furthermore it would help to build artificial neuron networks, which posses similar skills like the human such as face recognition. 

If more about the ways humans process information was understood, it would be much simpler to build artificial structures, which have the same or similar abilities. The area of cognitive development investigation tried to describe how children develop their cognitive abilities from infancy to adolescence. The theories of knowledge representation were first strongly concerned with sensory inputs. Current scientists claim to have evidence that our internal representation of reality is not a one-to-one reproduction of the physical world. It is rather stored in some abstract or neurochemical code. Tolman, Bartlett, Norman and Rumelhart made some experiments on cognitive mapping. Here, the inner knowledge seemed not only to be related to sensory input, but also to be modified by some kind of knowledge network modeled by past experience. 

Newer methods, like [[w:Electroencephalography|Electroencephalography (EEG)]] and [[w:fmri|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] have given researchers the possibility to measure brain activity and possibly correlate it to mental states and processes. All these new approaches in the study of human cognition and psychology have defined the field of Cognitive Psychology, a very fascinating field which tries to answer what is quite possibly the most interesting question posed since the dawn of reason. There is still a lot to discover and to answer and to ask again, but first we want to make you more familiar with the concept of Cognitive Psychology.

==What is Cognitive Psychology?==

The easiest answer to this question is: “Cognitive Psychology is the study of thinking and the processes underlying mental events.” Of course this creates the new problem of what a mental event actually is. There are many possible answers for this:

Let us look at Knut again to give you some more examples and make the things clearer. He needs to focus on reading his paper. So all his attention is directed at the words and sentences which he perceives through his visual pathways. Other stimuli and information that enter his cognitive apparatus - maybe some street noise or the fly crawling along a window - are not that relevant in this moment and are therefore attended much less. Many higher cognitive abilities are also subject to investigation. Knut’s situation could be explained as a classical example of problem solving: He needs to get from his present state – an unfinished assignment – to a goal state - a completed assignment - and has certain operators to achieve that goal. Both Knut’s short and long term memory are active. He needs his short term memory to integrate what he is reading with the information from earlier passages of the paper. His long term memory helps him remember what he learned in the lectures he took and what he read in other books. And of course Knut’s ability to comprehend language enables him to make sense of the letters printed on the paper and to relate the sentences in a proper way. 

This situation can be considered to reflect mental events like perception, comprehension and memory storage. Some scientists think that our emotions cannot be considered separate from cognition, so that hate, love, fear or joy are also sometimes looked at as part
of our individual minds. Cognitive psychologists study questions like: How do we receive information about the outside world? How do we store it and process it? How do we solve problems? How is language represented? Here is a more detailed overview:

We hope you now have some idea what Cognitive Psychology is and what is involved in it.

==Relations to Neuroscience==

===Cognitive Neuropsychology===

Of course it would be very convenient if we could understand the nature of cognition without the nature of the brain itself. But unfortunately it is very difficult if not impossible to build and prove theories about our thinking in absence of neurobiological constraints. Neuroscience comprises the study of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, brain functions and related psychological and computer based models. For years, investigations on a neuronal level were completely separated from those on a cognitive or psychological level. The thinking process is so vast and complex that there are too many conceivable solutions to the problem of how cognitive operation could be accomplished.

Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact. The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research. It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions. The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before. This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand processes in our mind. As neuroscience is not always able to explain all the observations made in laboratories, neurobiologists turn towards Cognitive Psychology in order to find models of brain and behaviour on an interdisciplinary level – Cognitive Neuropsychology. This “inter-science” as a bridge connects and integrates the two most important domains and their methods of research of the human
mind. Research at one level provides constraints, correlations and inspirations for research at another level.

===Neuroanatomy Basics===

The basic building blocks of the brain are a special sort of cells called [[w:Neuron|neurons]]. There are approximately 100 billion neurons involved in information processing in the brain. When we look at the brain superficially, we can't see these neurons, but rather look at two halves called the [[w:Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]]. The hemispheres themselves may differ in size and function, as we will see later
in the book, but principally each of them can be subdivided into four parts called the lobes: the [[w:Temporal_lobe|temporal]], [[w:Parietal_lobe|parietal]], [[w:Occipital_lobe|occipital]] and [[w:Frontal_lobe|frontal lobe]]. This division of modern neuroscience is supported by the up- and down-bulging structure of the brain's surface. The bulges are called gyri (singular gyrus), the creases sulci (singular sulcus). They are also involved in information processing. The different tasks performed by different subdivisions of the brain as attention,
memory and language cannot be viewed as separated from each other, nevertheless some parts play a key role in a specific task. For example the parietal lobe has been shown to be responsible for orientation in space and the relation you have to it, the occipital lobe is mainly responsible for visual perception and imagination etc. Summed up, brain anatomy poses some basic constraints to what is possible for us and a better understanding will help us to find better therapies for cognitive deficits as well as guide research for cognitive psychologists. It is one goal of our book to present the complex interactions between the different levels on which the brain that can be described, and their implications for Cognitive Neuropsychology.

===Methods===

Newer methods, like EEG and fMRI etc. allow researchers to correlate the behaviour of a participant in an experiment with the brain activity which is measured simultaneously. It is possible to record neurophysiological responses to certain stimuli or to find out which brain areas are involved in the execution of certain mental tasks. EEG measures the electric potentials along the skull through electrodes that are attached to a cap. While its spatial resolution is not very precise, the temporal
resolution lies within the range of milliseconds. The use of fMRI benefits from the fact the increased brain activity goes along with increased blood flow in the active region. The [[w:Haemoglobin|haemoglobin]] in the blood has magnetic properties that are registered by the fMRI scanner. The spatial resolution of fMRI is very precise in comparison to EEG. On the other hand, the temporal resolution is in the range of just 1-2 seconds.

==Conclusion==

Remember the scenario described at the beginning of the chapter. Knut was asking himself “What is happening here?” It should have become clear that this question cannot be simply answered with one or two sentences. We have seen that the field of Cognitive Psychology comprises a lot of processes and phenomena of which every single one is subject to extensive research to understand how cognitive abilities are produced by our brain. In the following chapters of this WikiBook you will see how the different areas of research in Cognitive Psychology are trying to solve the initial question raised by Knut.

Translation:

We call an expression in the form

'''X'''' = '''A''' &amp;sdot; '''X''' + '''G'''(t)

'''homgeneous''' if '''G'''(t)≡0. Now, in previous methods of differential equations, it turned out that '''X''' had an exponential of the transcendental number e in its form, so if a uniqueness theorem is developed, we can define a possible answer with this form, set it in the equation, and determine if this answer works and if so how to obtain the answer and its corresponding exponentials.

=Existance and Uniqueness Theorem=

=Results=

So, because the exponential function appeared many times in simpler differential equations, we will guess that the solution for '''X''' is '''X''' = '''u''' &amp;sdot; &lt;math&gt;e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''u''' is a coefficient matrix.

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda \mathbf{u} e^{\lambda t} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{u} e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lambda e^{\lambda t} = \mathbf{A} e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A}-\lambda \mathbf{I})\mathbf{u} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

There is a lie here, we're also going to make one more assumption:  a constant matrix for '''A'''; but this is the definition for an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair!  Thus with a two-by-two matrix there are two linearly independent solutions, and thus by the principle of superposition the constant matrix multiplication by an augmented matrix of these two solutions makes the fundamental set of solutions of which we are trying to look for.

However, due to the property of these eigenvalues (and that we want real-solutions to help analysis in physical models utilizing these differential techniques), there are different ways of creating the fundamental set of solutions with regards to the three possible cases that the pair of eigenvalues could fall under:

* [[/Real, Distinct Eigenvalues Method/]]

* [[/Imaginary Eigenvalues Method/]]

* [[/Repeated Eigenvalue Method/]]

==Background==
Named for Moritz Kaposi, a Hungarian dermatologist, who described the condition in 1872.
&lt;br&gt;Caused by infection with HHV-8.

Three types:
*Classic - affects elderly Mediterranean and Eastern European men
*:Typically begins on the hands and feet and spreads centrally over many years
*Endemic - in parts of Africa
*Epidemic (AIDS-associated) 
*Immunosuppression-associated (a.k.a. transplantation-associated)

==Presentation==
*Classic KS
**Violaceous macules, progressing to plaques, then to nodules. Ultimate phase is hyperkeratotic or ulcerative.
**Classic type is slowly progressive
**A second primary malignancy (usually lyphoproliferative) may develop in up to 1/3 of patients
*Endemic KS
**Has 3 forms:
***Indolent nodular - behaves similarly to classic KS
***Locally aggressive
***Disseminated aggressive

==Staging==
Multiple staging systems exist. 


*I - locally indolent cutaneous lesions
*II - locally invasive lesions
*III - disseminated mucocutaneous form with LN involvement
*IV - disseminated mucocutaneous form with visceral involvement
*Each stage is further subdivided into A or B according to presence or absence of systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss &gt; 10%), similar to the Ann Arbor staging system for lymphomas

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following exercises test your understanding of infinite [[Calculus/Sequences|sequences]] and [[Calculus/Series|series]]. You may want to review that material before trying these problems.

Each question is followed by a &quot;Hint&quot; (usually a quick indication of the most efficient way to work the problem), the &quot;Answer only&quot; (what it sounds like), and finally a &quot;Full solution&quot; (showing all the steps required to get to the right answer). These should show up as &quot;collapsed&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot; sections (click on the title to display the contents), but some older web browsers might not be able to display them correctly (i.e., showing the content when it should be hidden). If this is true for your browser (or if you're looking at a printed version), you should take care not to &quot;see too much&quot; before you start thinking of how to work each problem.

==Sequences==

Consider the [[Calculus/Sequences|infinite sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=n/2^n,\ n=1,\ldots,\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

* Is the sequence monotonically increasing or decreasing?
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Hint|answer=
compare adjacent terms algebraically or take a derivative
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Answer only|answer=
monotonically decreasing (strictly decreasing starting with the second term)
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Full solution|answer=
One may either consider how &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; compares to &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; algebraically and try to show that one is greater than the other, or take the derivative of &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and check where it is positive or negative.

Algebraically, since
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}-a_n=\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}-\frac{n}{2^n}=\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}-\frac{2n}{2^{n+1}}=\frac{1-n}{2^{n+1}},&lt;/math&gt;
we see that &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}&lt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. That is, starting from the second term, the sequence is strictly decreasing. It is easy to check how the first two terms compare by just plugging in &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;a_1=1/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2=2/4=1/2&lt;/math&gt;
The first two terms are equal and thereafter the terms are strictly decreasing. Therefore, the sequence is monotonically decreasing.

Using calculus,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dn}\,\frac{n}{2^n}=\frac{2^n\cdot1-n\cdot2^n\ln2}{(2^n)^2}=\frac{2^n(1-n\ln2)}{2^{2n}}=\frac{1-n\ln2}{2^n},&lt;/math&gt;
which is negative for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1/\ln2\approx1.44&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The rest of the argument is the same as before.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* Is the sequence bounded from below, from above, both, or neither?
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Hint|answer=
consider what kind of values are taken on by the numerator and denominator, and use the previous answer
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Answer only|answer=
bounded from below and from above (both)
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Full solution|answer=
The sequence is bounded from below because the terms are clearly positive (greater than 0) for all values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Also, since the sequence is decreasing (see the previous problem), the maximum value of the sequence must be the value of the first term. So the sequence is bounded from above (by the value 1/2), as well.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* Does the sequence converge or diverge?
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Hint|answer=
use the previous two answers to make a conclusion, or take a limit
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Answer only|answer=
converges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Full solution|answer=
By the previous two answers, the sequence is bounded from below and monotonically decreasing, thus by a theorem it must converge.

To show this directly, consider the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n}{2^n}=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{2^n\ln2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The two limits are equal by [[Calculus/L'Hôpital's Rule|L'Hôpital's Rule]], since the numerator and denominator of the expression in the first limit both grow to infinity.

Since the limit exists, it is the number to which the sequence converges.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

==Partial sums==

Assume that the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; partial sum of a [[Calculus/Infinite series|series]] is given by &lt;math&gt;s_n=2-\frac{1}{3^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

* Does the series converge? If so, to what value?
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Hint|answer=
take a limit
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Answer only|answer=
converges to 2
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Full solution|answer=
The series converges to 2 since
:&lt;math&gt;s=\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(2-\frac{1}{3^n}\right)=2.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* What is the formula for the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; term of the series?
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
&lt;math&gt;s_n=a_1+\cdots+a_{n-1}+a_n=s_{n-1}+a_n&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
&lt;math&gt;a_n=\frac{2}{3^n}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
&lt;math&gt;a_n=s_n-s_{n-1}=\left(2-\frac{1}{3^n}\right)-\left(2-\frac{1}{3^{n-1}}\right)=\frac{1}{3^{n-1}}-\frac{1}{3^n}=\frac{3}{3^n}-\frac{1}{3^n}=\frac{2}{3^n}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the series turns out to be geometric, since
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=2\,(1/3)^n=a\,r^n.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

== Sums of infinite series ==

Find the value to which each of the following series converges.

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{3}{4^n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
sum of an infinite geometric series
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
4
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
The series is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 3\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
and so is geometric with first term &lt;math&gt;a=3&lt;/math&gt; and common ratio &lt;math&gt;r=1/4&lt;/math&gt;. So
:&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{a}{1-r}=\frac{3}{1-1/4}=4.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2}{e}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
sum of an infinite geometric series
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{e-2}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{2/e}{1-2/e}=\frac{2}{e-2}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2-n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
telescoping series
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
1
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
Note that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2-n} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n-1)} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{n-1}-\frac{1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
by [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Supplementary/Partial Fractions|partial fractions]]. So
:&lt;math&gt;s = \lim_{N\to\infty} s_N = \lim_{N\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}\right) + \ldots + \left(\frac{1}{N-1}-\frac{1}{N}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
All but the first and last terms cancel out, so
:&lt;math&gt;s = \lim_{N\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n 2^{n-1}}{3^n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
rewrite so that all exponents are ''n''
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
&amp;minus;1/5
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
The series simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n 2^n}{3^n \cdot 2} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{-2}{3}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
and so is geometric with common ratio &lt;math&gt;r=-2/3&lt;/math&gt; and first term &lt;math&gt;-1/3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{-1/3}{1-(-2/3)}=-1/5.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

==Convergence and divergence of infinite series==

Determine whether each the following series converges or diverges. (''Note:'' Each &quot;Hint&quot; gives the convergence/divergence test required to draw a conclusion.)

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
''p''-series
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This is a ''p''-series with &lt;math&gt;p=2&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;p&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the series converges.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
geometric series
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This is a geometric series with common ratio &lt;math&gt;r=1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and so converges since &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{n^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
limit comparison test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
diverges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This series can be compared to a ''p''-series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{n^2+1} \sim \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{n^2} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
The &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; symbol means the two series are &quot;asymptotically equivalent&quot;—that is, they either both converge or both diverge because their terms behave so similarly when summed as ''n'' gets very large. This can be shown by the [[Calculus/Series#Limit comparison test|limit comparison test]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \left( \frac{n}{n^2+1} \div \frac{1}{n} \right) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( \frac{n}{n^2+1} \cdot \frac{n}{1} \right) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n^2}{n^2+1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
Since the limit is positive and finite, the two series either both converge or both diverge. The simpler series diverges because it is a ''p''-series with &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; (harmonic series), and so the original series diverges by the limit comparison test.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
direct comparison test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
diverges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This series can be compared to a smaller ''p''-series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln n} \ge \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
The ''p''-series diverges since &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; (harmonic series), so the larger series diverges by the appropriate [[Calculus/Series#Direct comparison tests|direct comparison test]].
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n!}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
divergence test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
diverges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
The terms of this series do not have a limit of zero. Note that when &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{2^n} = \frac{n}{2}\cdot\left[\frac{n-1}{2}\cdot\frac{n-2}{2}\dots\frac{2}{2}\right]\cdot\frac{1}{2} \ge \frac{n}{2}\cdot(1)\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \frac{n}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
To see why the inequality holds, consider that when &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; none of the fractions in the square brackets above are actually there; when &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt; only 2/2 (which is the same as &lt;math&gt;[n-1]/2&lt;/math&gt;) is in the brackets; when &lt;math&gt;n=4&lt;/math&gt; only 3/2 (equal to &lt;math&gt;[n-1]/2&lt;/math&gt;) and 2/2 (equal to &lt;math&gt;[n-2]/2&lt;/math&gt;) are there; when &lt;math&gt;n=5&lt;/math&gt;, only 4/2, 3/2, and 2/2 are there; and so forth. Clearly none of these fractions are less than 1 and they never will be, no matter what &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is used.

The fact that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n}{4} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
then implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n!}{2^n} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore the series diverges by the divergence test.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos\pi n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
alternating series test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This is an alternating series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos\pi n}{n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;|a_n|=\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
decreases to 0, the series converges by the alternating series test.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n\ln n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
alternating series test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
Since the terms alternate, consider the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;|a_n|=\frac{1}{n\ln n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
This sequence is clearly decreasing (since both ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;\ln n&lt;/math&gt; are increasing — one may also show that the derivative (with respect to ''n'') of the expression is negative for &lt;math&gt;n\ge2&lt;/math&gt;) and has limit zero (the denominator goes to infinity), so the series converges by the alternating series test.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

==Absolute and conditional convergence==

Determine whether each the following series converges conditionally, converges absolutely, or diverges. (''Note:'' Each &quot;Hint&quot; gives the test or tests that most easily lead to the final conclusion.)

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
alternating series test and either direct comparison test or integral test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges conditionally
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This series alternates, so consider the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;|a_n|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
Since this sequence is clearly decreasing to zero, the original series is convergent by the alternating series test. Now, consider the series formed by taking the absolute value of the terms of the original series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum |a_n|=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
This new series can be compared to a ''p''-series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \ge \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the smaller series diverges, the larger one diverges. But this means the original (alternating) series was not absolutely convergent. (This last fact can also be shown using an integral test.) Therefore, the original series is only conditionally convergent.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n \ln n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
alternating series test and either integral test or direct comparison test
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges conditionally
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This series alternates, so consider the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;|a_n|=\frac{\ln n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
This sequence has a limit of zero by, for example, L'Hospital's Rule.
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\ln n}{n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1/n}{1}=0&lt;/math&gt;
That the sequence is decreasing can be verified by, for example, showing that as a continuous function of ''x'', its derivative is negative.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\,\frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{1 - \ln x}{x^2} &lt; 0 \mbox{ if } x &gt; e&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the terms definitely decrease starting with the second term (&lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, the series starting at &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt; is convergent by the alternating series test; clearly, then, the series starting at &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; also converges (since the two series only differ by one term).
Now, consider the series formed by taking the absolute value of the terms of the original series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum |a_n|=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
This new series of positive terms only can be compared to a ''p''-series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln n}{n} \ge \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the smaller series diverges, the larger one diverges.
Alternatively, the integral test can be used to test the convergence of the series of positive terms, since &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{\ln x}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is clearly a continuous, positive function on &lt;math&gt;[2,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and, as we have just verified, is also decreasing:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln x}{x}\,dx = \lim_{t\to\infty} \int_{2}^{t} \frac{\ln x}{x}\,dx = \lim_{t\to\infty} \int_{\ln 2}^{\ln t} u\,du&lt;/math&gt;
by the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=\ln x&lt;/math&gt;; and this last expression becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty} \Bigl(\frac{1}{2} u^2\bigr|_{\ln 2}^{\ln t}\Bigr) = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{2}(\ln t)^2 - \frac{1}{2} (\ln 2)^2 = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Since the improper integral diverges, the series of positive terms diverges.

Either way you test it, the series with all positive terms diverges, and this means the original (alternating) series was not absolutely convergent. Thus, the original series is only conditionally convergent.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n n}{(\ln n)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;
{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=

{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=

}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
This series is alternating, but note that by L'Hospital's Rule
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n}{(\ln n)^2} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{2(\ln n)(1/n)} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n}{2\ln n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ } = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{2/n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n}{2} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Which implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(-1)^n n}{(\ln n)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
does not exist, and hence by the divergence test, the series diverges.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n 2^n}{e^n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Question-answer|question=Show hint|answer=
limit comparison test with geometric series
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=
converges absolutely
}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
While this alternating series can be shown to converge by the alternating series test, it can also be shown that the absolute value of the terms form a convergent series, and this is sufficient to conclude absolute convergence of the original series. Thus we will skip the former test and show only the latter.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{e^n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
This series of positive terms is asymptotically geometric with &lt;math&gt;r=2/e&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{e^n-1} \sim \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (2/e)^n&lt;/math&gt;
The equivalence of these series is shown by using a limit comparison test:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \left[\frac{2^n}{e^n-1} \div (2/e)^n\right] = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{2^n}{2^n}\cdot\frac{e^n}{e^n-1}\right) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{1-1/e^n} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
Since the limit is positive and finite, and since the simpler series converges because it geometric with &lt;math&gt;r=2/e&lt;/math&gt; (the absolute value of which is less than 1), then the series of positive terms converges by the limit comparison test. Thus the original alternating series is absolutely convergent.

Note, by the way, that a direct comparison test in this case is more difficult (although still possible to do), since
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{e^n-1} \ge \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (2/e)^n&lt;/math&gt;
and we need the inequality to go the other way to get a conclusion, since the geometric series converges.

This can be fixed by choosing the new series more carefully:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{e^n-1} \le \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{e^n-.5e^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{.5e^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2(2/e)^n&lt;/math&gt;
Comparing the original series to the new (convergent geometric) series gives the desired result.

{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
Since this is an alternating series, we can try the alternating series test. Consider the absolute value of the terms:
:&lt;math&gt;|a_n|=\frac{1}{\sin^2 n}&lt;/math&gt;
Because
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \sin^2 n&lt;/math&gt;
does not exist (since it continually oscillates within the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; as ''n'' gets larger)
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{\sin^2 n}&lt;/math&gt;
doesn't exist either. Thus the alternating series test ''fails'' (it is inconclusive).

However, in such a situation we can use the ''divergence test'' instead. Since
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{\sin^2 n}&lt;/math&gt;
also does not exist (and thus the terms of the series do converge to 0), the original series diverges by the divergence test.

{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
Because of the factorials in this series, we try the ratio test:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)!}{[2(n+1)]!}\div\frac{(-1)^n n!}{(2n)!}\right| = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(n+1)!}{n!}\cdot\frac{(2n)!}{(2n+2)!} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(n+1)}{(2n+2)(2n+1)} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{2(2n+1)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Since the limit is less than 1, the series converges absolutely by the ratio test.
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n e^{1/n}}{\arctan n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:2.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;

}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show answer only|answer=

}}
{{Question-answer|question=Show full solution|answer=
Although this is an alternating series, neither the numerator nor the denominator have infinite limits, so it is likely that a divergence test will work.

Note that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{e^{1/n}}{\arctan n} = \frac{e^0}{\pi/2} = \frac{2}{\pi} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{(-1)^n e^{1/n}}{\arctan n} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, the latter limit does not exist. So, by the divergenve test, the series diverges.

[[File:Needle.jpg|50px]]
[[File:Aluminium foil booster bag-2.JPG|150px]]
[[File:Righello.jpg|150px]]
[[File:Scissors.svg|150px]]

&lt;big&gt;You will need these things:
&lt;/big&gt;
*A Long Box (The longer the box the bigger the picture will be)
*A Pin or Needle
*Some Glue
*Some Tin Foil
*A Ruler
*A Pair of Scissors

== How to Make the Pinhole Camera ==
&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; Cut a square hole in the top of the box on the smaller end that is about 1 inch by 1 inch (use your ruler!)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Draw a line around the hole with some glue, then put a square on tinfoil on top so that the hole is covered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; Once the glue is dried, poke a tiny hole in the tin foil with the pin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 4:&lt;/b&gt; Cut a hole on the long side of the box so that you can see the bottom of the inside of the box.&lt;br&gt;


== How to Use the Pinhole Camera ==

Next time you know there is going to be a solar eclipse, point your pinhole camera towards the sun. The light will shine in through the pinhole and out onto the bottom of the box. Looking right at the sun can hurt your eyes, so using a Pinhole Camera is a fun and safe way to watch eclipses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What you need to do==
[[Image:Raisendance.jpg|right]]
===Step 1===
Get a clear drinking glass (or beaker). Fill it with a bubbly and clear drink like Sprite.

===Step 2===
Get raisins and add them slowly and keep putting them in the beaker.

==What Happens?==
The raisins rise up to the top, then fall down, and then rise to the top again. It's like they're dancing.

==The Science Bit==
The bubbly drink that you used is packed full of a gas called Carbon Dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). There's so much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it bubbles out of the drink. That's what makes it fizzy.

When you drop the raisins in, some of the bubbles stick to the raisins. Since the bubbles are trying to rise up out of the drink, they pull the raisins along for the ride. Once a raisin gets to the top, the bubbles come out of the drink and pop. Since the raisin doesn't have bubbles holding it up anymore, it falls back down where the process starts all over again.

Don't forget to clean up! You can still eat the raisins and drink the soda.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why is Computer Science under natural science?


The definition of a natural science is:
In science, natural science is the application of logic to the study of the universe - so universe is understood as obeying rules or laws of natural origin. The term natural science is also used to distinguish those fields that use the scientific method to study nature from the social sciences, which use the scientific method to study human behavior and society, and from the formal sciences, such as mathematics and logic, which use a different methodology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===How to get photorealistic images from 3D Studio MAX without really trying.===
by Bill Harbison.

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of modeling and rendering within 3D Studio MAX amd have a basic knowledge of the user interface.

With basic modeling and simple lighting using HDRI maps we will create a photorealistic image with smooth shading and soft shadows. Once this part is complete we will create some realistic chrome, glass and reflective shaders to add to the scene ending with a high quality image.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Class Methods==

It says currently on the module (under class methods of course):

''&quot;Class methods are declared the same way as normal methods, except that they are prefixed by '''self''' followed by a period. These methods are executed at the Class level and may be called without an object instance. They cannot access instance variables but do have access to class variables.&quot;''

'Self' is fine, but maybe it should be made clear that class methods are prefixed with the class Name, which is what self would represent.

While self is advantagious, afterall, you only need to change the class name and all class methods will role into action without needing to be changed with it, there is also supposed to be an issue with using self aswell (some form of comflict between classes and subclass. I'm, still pretty new to ruby so I don't really know.) so maybe the pros and cons can be weighed out somewhere for using self?

      <text xml:space="preserve">===What are HDRI images?===
High Dynamic Range Image. A series of photos that are taken at different exposure levels then combined into a HighRange image format. The HDR stores the amount of light every pixel represents instead of on-screen colors that normal bitmaps do. The advantage is greater dynamic range of light and color. Photorealistic lighting at its best.

==Why should I use them with MentalRay?== 

*There is no need to spend time lighting your scenes with multiple lighting rigs. 
*You can create photorealistic illumination and environment reflections in your 3D scenes. 
*Wide-range luminosity data can drastically change the overall lighting of your scene.

==Introduction==
Religion was central to early political control of society. By assuming the authority of higher beings, priests and princes were able to suppress dissent without constant recourse to military terrorism. The more successful leaders realized that internal legal harmonization bought significant advantages, and most judicial systems are religiously inspired. Both English Common law and Roman Codex systems exeunt across Europe used to presume that 'all law is known to God' and the law court is merely a forum in which we lesser beings might 'discover the mind of God. Since 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has guided most western judiciaries. The British monarch is still enthroned &quot;By the grace of God, Defender of the Faith&quot; and British coins bear the legend &quot;Deo Gratia, Fid Def&quot; around the royal image  as a constant reminder to British subjects of this divine providence!

Some people have argued for a strong religious influence on the workings of modern governments while others have detected little for no religious influence at all. Nations throughout the world have differed widely in terms of their ideas of religion and its place in the state.  Some of these nations have failed while others have produced notable success, but religious influences in choosing the system of governance can usually be traced back to one of three central political philosophers. 

The ideologies of John Calvin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Joseph Priestley all are similar in some aspects, but an area in which they differ is in their notions of the proper role of religion in 'westernized' (non theocratic or liberal) societies.  

===John Calvin===
John Calvin was an influential French theologian and pastor during the Protestant Reformation (circa 1520) who insisted that the church be free from political interference. While he expected government officials to be Godly men he would allow them nothing to do with a theocracy.   

===Rousseau===
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a major philosopher, writer, and composer of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. His political philosophy influenced the French Revolution and the development of modern political and educational thought. His work has been widely quoted as one of the pillars of early political theory, and his positions on religion and the social contract influenced many of the more modern political thinkers to follow.

===Priestley===
Joseph Priestley was an 18th-century British theologian, Dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, educator, and political theorist who published over 150 works and is also credited with the discovery of oxygen. His arguments against state interference in religion are still very widely followed in today’s world as it is one of the founding doctrines upon which the basis for the United States’ policy of the formal separation of church and state is grounded. 

As can be seen when analyzing the works of these men, their general attitudes towards a central, public religion evolves with time. Calvin, the earliest of the three, champions religion as a powerful, governing institution.  Rousseau, who came nearly 200 years later, took a more middle of the road approach in discussing the topic. And Priestley, who followed Rousseau, took an approach nearly opposite of John Calvin’s design of hundreds of years before. As debate on the role of Religion is still raging today, it is valuable to look at each proposal to try and reevaluate the philosophies of each man to fully understand how and why religion evolved over the years in terms of its political significance.

==Calvin==

===Historical background===
Born in 1509 to upper middle class parents in France, Calvin became one of the most influential figures in the Reformation era.  He was heavily influenced by humanist movements of his time as could be seen in his establishment of the church of Geneva in 1535.  After serving for three years at a church for French Huguenots in Strasbourg due to being exiled from Geneva, Calvin returned to impose a strict moral code on the citizens of Geneva based on his literal, extreme interpretations of the bible.  He set up a moral censorship complete with spies and confidants, and also made governmental decisions the role of the Clergy.  Calvin established four categories of governmental offices, all with a clerical influence.  These offices consisted of Doctors, Pastors, Deacons, and Elders, all of which held power over the actions of the citizens both in religious and public aspects of their lives.  Calvin’s theocratic rule served as one of the earliest attempts to unite the government of man with the government of God, a point Calvin stresses earnestly in his piece On Civil Government.

===''On Civil Government''===
In this work, Calvin outlines his ideas on how government and religion should interrelate.  He also reinforces and commits to paper the austere ethics he holds as central to the civic and religious life that he constructed in Geneva.  Although Calvin writes that the laws of religion are to be held higher than the laws of society, he clarifies that there is a place for both in the state.  He furthers this notion by saying that these two law-making bodies are not in opposition to one another, but in a way work together, the government of religion picking up where the government of man fails as long as the public authority does not use its laws to pollute Christianity.  When speaking of the magistracy is his Geneva government as aforementioned, Calvin writes that leaders should focus on divinity and worship above all else, then look to apply theses religious aspects to upholding the law of man.  With such direction, it can be seen that John Calvin was a staunch supporter of the government and government officials looking to religion as a basis and example of how to properly govern a state.  This view was not an uncommon one at the time, meaning Calvin’s philosophy was in part a product of the era in which he lived.

==Jean-Jacques Rousseau==

===Historical background===
Born in 1712, Rousseau spent most of his childhood with his Aunts and in an apprenticeship as an engraver.  He studied in Paris and joined the likes of Voltaire and Diderot to pursue writing, poetry, and opera.  In 1750, Rousseau published his first discourse, bringing his work to the rest of the world.  Rousseau followed this with many other pieces, including the influential The Social Contract.  He also did some important work regarding the concept of inequality among men as outlined in his second discourse published four years after his first.  He distinguished between natural inequalities as opposed to political inequalities, recognizing how they differ as well as how they relate.  By the time of his death in 1778, Rousseau had written on many topics such as the arts, the enlightenment, and sovereignty, making him one of the foremost political theorists in the world.  

===''The Social Contract''===
Rousseau touches on the issue of civil religion towards the end of his piece.  He takes a more moderate position in regards to the role of religion in government, distinguishing between three “types” of religion.  The first, he writes, is the religion of man which is a sort of personal religion involving only the individual and god or the divine.  As related to Calvin, this view of spirituality is much more progressive.  The second type of religion Rousseau describes is that of the religion of the citizen.  This is the state/public religion and is more of an institution that combines the interests of the state and the religion itself.  Rousseau writes that such an institution may breed corruption as well as intolerance for the religions and cultures of other nations and governments.  The last type is religion based in the style of the catholic church, in which two sets of laws are made, one for religious purposes and one for civil purposes.  Rousseau condemns this type in the style of the Catholic church and instead offers a compromise between the first two types listed.  He writes that the people of the state should be free to worship in whatever manner they want as long as it does not affect the well-being of others; but also states that these citizens must pledge allegiance to a central religion that upholds the basic guidelines for a just state.  In this way Rousseau falls into the middle by taking some Calvinist aspects (i.e. the state/civil religion), as well as some more progressive aspects (i.e. religious freedom) of religion and its role in governance.  This idea of individual religious tolerance was later expanded upon by Joseph Priestley.

==Joseph Priestley==

===Historical background===
Joseph Priestley was born in 1733 outside of Leeds in England.  Today, he is known more for his endeavors in the physical sciences (namely chemistry), but also provided many influential writings on philosophy, education, politics, economics, and theology.  In the Revolutionary period, Priestley was a supporter of the U.S. colonies uprising from England, writing of the injustices levied upon the colonists by the British in his piece The Present State of Liberty.  He later moved to America, setting up a colony for English Dissenters near Philadelphia with the help of his son and friend Thomas Cooper.  He continued to influence American political policy and religion until his death in 1804.

===''First Principles of Government''===
In this work, Priestley discusses the issue of religious liberty and toleration in section five towards the middle of the piece.  Essentially, Priestley argues that societies that have enjoyed the most success are those that have not interfered with or tried to establish religion.  He writes that religion should be as free as the air we breathe, and should not be regulated or enforced in any way by the central government.  In order to promote truth and the progression of the state, Priestley advocates toleration towards all religions and sects in the eyes of the government as long as they promote the common good.  This sentiment is reflected in many areas of society in his writings due to the fact that his greatest concern for the state was the freedom and well-being of the citizens as individuals.  Priestley’s political influence is apparent in the U.S. still today, even though he isn’t widely quoted as being one of the main contributors to American political policy.

==Conclusion== 
As can be seen from viewing the lives and philosophical and political writings of these three men, their views on religion and its role in the state as an institution changes with time.  In Calvin’s era, the majority of the nations that surrounded him generally acted as hierarchical theocracies, which in his opinion worked best.  Rousseau lived during a transitional period in Europe, and this is reflected strongly in his many contributions to the theory of politics.  Priestley, the most modern of the three, lived through the Enlightenment Revolution and witnessed firsthand the negative effects that religion can have on a nation's ability to legitimize the suppression of intellectual exploration and authorize bloody war in pursuit of worldly wealth and power.  

Priestley’s writings are still for the most part influential in regulating how the United States handles religion, but the line dividing the institutions of religion and government is becoming more and more blurred as states take on some formerly 'religious' social obligations and religions construct non-government organizations (NGOs) to both provide relieg welfare and promulgate their religious views.  

Whether this is a positive or negative depends on one’s personal beliefs, but the reemergence of religion as a powerful political tool cannot be denied, especially in English speaking regions, when American and British leaders often feel obliged to conform to some form conventional religious doctrine and perform regular acts of worship publicly. 

Both George Bush and Tony Blair paraded their ostensibly deep religious convictions, but saw no disgrace in earning the outright condemnation of the United Nations General Assembly nor shame in their use of religious propaganda which suited their purpose, nor eventually with their unleashing of war upon oil-rich Iraq.  

Similarly, supposedly devout Muslim clerics routinely order political assassinations and attempt to overthrow legitimate governments and install brutal, quasi-religious theocracies.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (and its daughter conventions) is far from perfect, but it is perhaps a 'neutral' foundation forged in deadly warfare on which we might usefully build a better multi-cultural civilisation?

      <text xml:space="preserve">By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

==Dividing and Factoring Polynomials==

===Remainder Theorem===
If you have a polynomial f(x) divided by x - c, the remainder is equal to f(c). Note if the equation is x + c then you need to negate c: f(-c).

===The Factor Theorem===
A polynomial f(x) has a factor x - c if and only if f(c) = 0. Note if the equation is x + c then you need to negate c: f(-c).

==Formula For Exponential and Logarithmic Function==

===The Laws of Exponents===

# &lt;math&gt;b^xb^y = b^{x+y}\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{b^x}{b^y} = b^{x-y}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(b^x\right)^y = b^{xy}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;a^n b^n = \left(ab\right)^n\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;b^{-n}=\frac{1}{b^n}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;b^ \frac {c}{x} = \left( \sqrt[x] b \right)^c&lt;/math&gt; where c is a constant
# &lt;math&gt;b^1=b\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;b^0=1\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Logarithmic Function===
The inverse of &lt;math&gt;y = b^x\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x = b^y \,&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;y = \log_b x\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Change of Base Rule: &lt;math&gt;\log_a x\,&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;\frac { \log_b x}{ \log_b a}&lt;/math&gt;

===Laws of Logarithmic Functions===
When X and Y are positive.

* &lt;math&gt;\log_bXY = \log_bX + \log_bY\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\log_b \frac{X}{Y} = \log_bX - \log_bY\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\log_b X^k = k \log_bX\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Circles and Angles==

===Conversion of Degree Minutes and Seconds to a Decimal===
&lt;math&gt;X + \frac{Y}{60}+ \frac{Z}{3600}&lt;/math&gt; where X is the degree, y is the minutes, and z is the seconds.

===Arc Length===
&lt;math&gt;s= \theta r\,&lt;/math&gt; Note: θ need to be in radians

===Area of a Sector===
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;Note: θ need to be in radians.

===The Law of Cosines===
&lt;math&gt;a^2=b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;b^2=a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos \beta \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;c^2=a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

===The Law of Sines===
&lt;math&gt;\frac {a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac {c}{\sin \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

===Area of a Triangle===
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}ac \sin \beta \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin \gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;



===Trigonometric Identities===
&lt;math&gt;\sin ^2 \theta + \cos ^2 \theta = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

==Integration==
===Integration Rules===
The reason that we add a + C when we compute the integral is because the derivative of a constant is zero, therefore we have an unknown constant when we compute the integral.
&lt;math&gt;\int x^n\, dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C,\ (n \ne -1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int kx^n\, dx = k \int x^n\, dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int \left\{ f^'(x) + g^'(x)\right\}\, dx = f(x) + g(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int \left\{ f^'(x) - g^'(x)\right\}\, dx = f(x) - g(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Rules of Definite Integrals===
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = F \left ( b \right ) - F \left ( a \right )&lt;/math&gt;, F is the anti derivative of f such that F' = f
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = - \int_{b}^{a} f \left ( x \right )\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{a} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;
#Area between a curve and the x-axis is &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} y\, dx\ ( \mbox{for}\ y \ge 0)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
#Area between a curve and the y-axis is &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} x\, dy\ ( \mbox{for}\ x \ge 0)&lt;/math&gt;
#Area between curves is &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b}\begin{vmatrix} f\left(x\right) - g\left(x\right) \end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;

===Trapezium Rule===
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b y \,dx \approx \frac{1}{2} h \left \{\left (y_0 + y_n \right )  + 2\left (y_1 + y_2 + \ldots + y_{n-1} \right ) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Where: &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Midpoint Rule===
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f \left (x \right ) \,dx \approx = h \left [ f \left (x_1 \right ) + f \left (x_2 \right ) + \ldots + f \left (x_n \right )\right ]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Where: &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt; n is the number of strips.&lt;p&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac{1}{2} \left [ \left( a +\left \{i - 1 \right \} h \right) + \left (a + ih \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">To begin I would like to state a few things. This book is not meant to be a dry reference manual, because it's about washing cars! Make it lively and personable. Also at the same time go through great pains to make sure that the text describes in detail and with vivid imagery the techniques. Include pictures to accompany the text as well.

==House Rules==

*No mention of product names in any way shape or fashion in the body of the actual article. Outside links have more leniancy as long as they do not link directly to a sales page.</text>

==Angular Measurement and Circular Sectors==
A section of a circle is known as a sector. One side of the sector is the radius. The portion of the cirumference that is included in the sector is known as an arc.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:SectorArc.png]]

===Angular Degree===
A circle has 360 degrees. Each degree can have 60 minutes (designated as ' ) and each minute can have 60 seconds (designated as &quot; ). Since we can not convert minutes or seconds into radians directly we need to convert the minutes and seconds into a decimal number. Here is the formula:&lt;p&gt;
Convert &lt;math&gt;X^\circ&lt;/math&gt; Y' Z&quot; into degrees.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;X + \left (Y \times \frac{1}{60} \right ) + \left (Z \times \frac{1}{3600} \right ) = X + \frac{Y}{60}+ \frac{Z}{3600}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For a practical example, convert &lt;math&gt;23^\circ&lt;/math&gt; 18' 38&quot; into degrees.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;23 + \frac{18}{60}+ \frac{38}{3600} = 23.3106&lt;/math&gt;

===Angular Radian===
A radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc of its circumference equal in length to the radius of the circle. Since we know that that the formula for the circumference of a circle is &lt;math&gt;C = 2 \pi r&lt;/math&gt; we can determine that there are &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt; radians in a circle. We abbreviate radians as rad.

===Conversion Between Degrees and Radians===
Mathematics requires us to use radians for most angular measurments. Therefore we need to know how to convert from degrees to radians Since we know that there are &lt;math&gt;360^\circ&lt;/math&gt; degrees or &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt; radians in a circle. We can determine these equations:
&lt;math&gt;1^\circ = \frac {\pi }{180}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1\ radian = \frac {180}{\pi }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So we can write these general formulae.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;X^\circ = \frac {X \times \pi }{180}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;X\ radian \left(s \right ) = \frac {X \times 180}{\pi }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here is an example convert &lt;math&gt;20^\circ&lt;/math&gt; into radians&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;20^\circ = \frac {20 \times \pi }{180} = \frac{1}{9} \pi\ rad&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Convert &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9} \pi&lt;/math&gt; into degrees.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9} \pi\ radian \left(s \right ) = \frac {\frac{1}{9} \pi \times 180}{\pi } = 20^\circ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

===Arc Length===
In most cases it is very difficult to measure the length of an arc with a ruler. Therefore we need to use a formula in order to determine the length of the arc. The formula that we use is:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Arc\ Length = ( \theta\ in\ radians)(radius)\,&lt;/math&gt; in symbols this is &lt;math&gt;s= \theta r\,&lt;/math&gt;. Note: θ need to be in radians&lt;p&gt;
Here is an example, determine the length of the arc created by a sector with a 6cm radius and an angle of &lt;math&gt;53^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
The first thing we need to do is convert θ from degrees to radians.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;53^\circ = \frac {53 \pi}{180}rad&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we can calcuate the length of the arc.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;s = \frac {53 \pi}{180} \times 6 \approx 5.55cm&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

===Area of a Sector===
The area of a sector can be found using this formula:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;Note: θ need to be in radians.&lt;p&gt;
Calculate the area of a sector with a 3cm radius and an angle of 2π.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}3^2 \times 2 \pi \approx 28.3cm^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 Screen(windowPtr,'PutImage',imageArray,[rect],[copyMode])

Copy ''imageArray'' to a window, slowly. ''imageArray'' may be double or uint8. Its values, which should be non-negative integers, are copied to the window, by [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:CopyBits|CopyBits]] or [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:CopyBitsQuickly|CopyBitsQuickly]]. ''imageArray'' can be an MxN array (for any window) or MxNx3 array (only if the window pixelSize is 16 or 32 bits). In the latter case the three r g b components are combined, as appropriate for the window pixelSize, to form a single value that is copied to the window. In 16-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 5 bits. In 32-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 8 bits.

''rect'' is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to ''rect'', scaling if necessary. The rect default is the imageArray's rect, centered in the window. The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of MATLAB's numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper left, and the rows are horizontal. Unless you specify a ''Quickly'' copyMode,
PutImage inherits the behavior of [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:CopyBits, scaling the image into the rect.

The copyMode argument is a string variable that is passed to the VideoToolbox CopyWindows routine. copyMode can be 'srcCopy' (default) or 'bltFast'. 

The copying is done in two stages. First, slowly, from the image array into a temporary offscreen window, and then, quickly, from there to the window designated by ''windowPtr''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 Screen(windowPtr,'FillRect',[color],[rect])

Fill ''rect''. ''color'' is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default ''rect'' is entire screen, so you can use this function to clear the screen.

Draw a line. ''color'' is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel. Default is black. Default ''penWidth'' and ''penHeight'' is 1. ''penMode'' specifies the drawing mode: The Win32 GDI interface does not have support for Copyin the Or and xOr modes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 hz=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'FrameRate',[hz])

Frame rate, in Hz, as most recently measured for this screen (typically when you
first opened it). 

MacOS:
FrameRate counts frames over some measured period and calculates the rate. Setting ''hz'' doesn't affect the screen, only the returned value. Setting ''hz'' to NaN or [] forces SCREEN to remeasure it now, eg after you use a Control Panel to change the screen resolution. The cached value is flushed when you close the last window on this screen. 

Windows:
The returned value is the nominal frame rate, not the measured rate. The returned value is always current.  FrameRate will accept an argument, for compatibility with the MacOS implementation, but it ignores the value passed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 imageArray=Screen(windowPtr,'GetImage',[rect])

Slowly copy an image from a window, returning a MATLAB uint8 array. If the window's ''pixelSize''&gt;8 then the returned ''imageArray'' has three layers, an RGB image. ''rect'' is in window coordinates, and its default is the whole window.

As of April, 1998, ''imageArray'' is now uint8 instead of double to save space (a factor of 8). However, MATLAB will issue an error if you try to do math on a uint8 array, so you may need to use DOUBLE to convert it, e.g. imageArray/255 will produce an error, but double(imageArray)/255 is ok.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 [windowPtr,rect]=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'OpenOffscreenWindow',[color],[rect],[pixelSize]);

Open an offscreen window (offscreen surface in DirectDraw). This is simply an area in memory that is treated as a window. Offscreen windows are very useful for creating images for subsequent display, because copying between windows is very fast. You may specify a screen (a ''screenNumber''&gt;=0) or no screen (''screenNumber''=-1). If you do designate a screen then the offscreen window is attached to the DirectDraw object associated with that screen. You may specify no screen (''screenNumber''=-1), but any real screen must already have an open SCREEN window when you call [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:OpenOffscreenWindow|OpenOffscreenWindow]]. ''color'' is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default is white. ''rect'' specifies the size of the offscreen window and what part of the screen the offscreen window is aligned with. If supplied, ''rect'' must contain at least one pixel. If a ''screenNumber'' is supplied then ''rect'' is in screen
coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the size of that screen. If a ''screenNumber'' of -1 is supplied then ''rect'' defaults to the size of the main screen. (In all cases, subsequent references to this new offscreen window will use its coordinates: origin at its upper left.) ''pixelSize'' sets the depth (in bits) of each pixel. If you specify a screen (''screenNumber''&gt;=0) and a ''pixelSize''&gt;0 then they must be consistent. If you specify no screen (''screenNumber''=-1) then the default ''pixelSize''' is the same as the main screen, but you can specify any legal depth: 8, 16, 24, 32. A ''pixelSize'' of 0 or [] is replaced by the default.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 [windowPtr,rect]=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'OpenWindow',[color],[rect],[pixelSize]);

Open an onscreen window. Specify a screen by a ''windowPtr'' or a ''screenNumber'' (0 is the main screen, with menu bar). ''color'' is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default is white. If supplied, ''rect'' must contain at least one pixel. If a ''windowPtr'' is supplied then ''rect'' is in the window's coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole window. If a ''screenNumber'' is supplied then ''rect'' is in screen coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole screen. (In all cases, subsequent references to this new window will use its coordinates: origin at its upper left.) ''pixelSize'' sets the depth (in bits) of each pixel; default is to leave depth unchanged. Opening or closing a window takes about a second.

 oldBoolean=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutCallsWaitBlanking',[boolean])

 oldFrames=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutSimulatesBlankingInterrupts',[frames])

Get/set various preferences. The first four are general, the rest are related to [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:WaitBlanking|WaitBlanking]] or [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:SetClut|SetClut]] and are screen-specific. ''boolean'' values are 1 (nonzero) for Yes and 0 for No. Preferences are volatile: They're set by SCREEN when you first use each screen, and they're flushed by closing the last SCREEN window (e.g. by [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:Close]], [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:CloseAll]], or flushing SCREEN.mex by typing ''clear screen''). So do any preference setting after calling 'OpenWindow'. 

'''Warning''': These settings allow you to access all the internal parameters that determine SCREEN's behavior. As a result the set of parameters is ever-changing, as SCREEN evolves to deal with an ever-changing environment (e.g. video drivers that don't wait for blanking, and Rush's high priority).

Feel free to play with these expert controls, but, if you do, realize that you may have to tweak your 'Preference' calls with each new release of the PsychToolbox.

* SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking reports whether the monitor's video driver waits for blanking. Usually read-only, you can also set/clear this on the PowerMac 7300/7500/7600/8500/8600 built-in driver.
* SetClutQuickly specifies your preference for whether to use a custom SetEntriesQuickly.c driver (if available for this device) in place of the standard video driver. The SetEntriesQuickly drivers don't wait for blanking.
* SetClutCallsWaitBlanking determines whether WaitBlanking should be called after each call to SetClut.
* SetClutSimulatesBlankingInterrupts sets/gets the number of blanking interrupts to simulate after each SetClut, to make up for interrupts missed during the SetClut call.
* WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt specifies a preference for whether WaitBlanking should use SetClut (original driver) or the screen's blanking interrupt to wait for blanking. See 'WaitBlanking'.
* MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt specifies the maximum priority at which the hardware blanking interrupt still works. Normally this is 1, but it's reduced to 0.5 (on non-PCI Macs) if necessary for timing the 3-ms interval during which spurious VBL interrupts are ignored. Your programs can override this setting, but your computer is likely to hang unless you really know what you're doing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 Screen(windowPtr,'PutImage',imageArray,[rect],[copyMode])

Copy ''imageArray'' to a window, slowly. ''imageArray'' may be double or uint8. Its values, which should be non-negative integers, are copied to the window, by CopyBits or CopyBitsQuickly. ''imageArray'' can be an MxN array (for any window) or MxNx3 array (only if the window pixelSize is 16 or 32 bits). In the latter case the three r g b components are combined, as appropriate for the window pixelSize, to form a single value that is copied to the window. In 16-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 5 bits. In 32-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 8 bits.

''rect'' is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to ''rect'', scaling if necessary. The rect default is the imageArray's rect, centered in the window. The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of MATLAB's numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper left, and the rows are horizontal. Unless you specify a ''Quickly'' copyMode, PutImage inherits the behavior of CopyBits, scaling the image into the rect.

The copyMode argument is a string variable that is passed to the VideoToolbox CopyWindows routine. copyMode can be 'srcCopy' (default) or 'bltFast'. 

The copying is done in two stages. First, slowly, from the image array into a temporary offscreen window, and then, quickly, from there to the window designated by ''windowPtr''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 err=Screen(windowPtr,'SetClut',clut,[startEntry],[bits])

Set the DirectDraw palette for the screen.

The palette is set immediately, without waiting for the vertical blanking.

The ''clut'' argument is a MATLAB matrix with 3 columns. The number of entries written is the number of rows in ''clut''. Each RGB entry in the hardware CLUT is loaded with a row of ''clut''. Each ''clut'' value should be in the range 0 to 255 for an 8-bit CLUT. Argument startEntry is optional and determines which CLUT entry to load first (entries are numbered from 0 up), to load just a subset of the CLUT's entries.  We suggest that ''startEntry'' always be zero or greater. 

The ''bits'' argument specifies how many bits you want to write to the CLUT. Typically it will be 8, which is the default value. If you set it to some other value, the range of allowable entries scales accordingly. Thus if you use a 9-bit CLUT, then each entry should be between 0 and 511, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usage:

 Screen(windowPtr,'SetDrawingRegion',shapeSpec,[shapeFlag])

Make subsequent drawing to the window visible only if it is within the specified region. This does not apply to [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:PutImage|PutImage]] or [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:CopyWindow|CopyWindow]] operations.  Call with ''rect'' equal to ''screenRect'' to reestablish the entire screen. Drawing outside the region is suppressed, but still takes the normal amount of time to complete.

* If ''shapeFlag'' == 0 [default], shapeSpec is a rect, region is rectangular.
* If ''shapeFlag'' == 1, shapeSpec is a rect, region is oval.
* If ''shapeFlag'' == 2, shapeSpec is a point list, region is polygonal.

The default font (set by Windows) is 1 (the System font) for both on-screen and off-screen windows.

Get/set text copy mode of this window.

''copyMode'' can be an integer or a string: 'srcCopy' (default), 'srcOr', 'srcXor', 'srcBic', 'notSrcCopy', 'notSrcOr', 'notSrcXor', 'notSrcBic', 'patCopy', 'patOr', 'patXor', 'patBic', 'notPatCopy', 'notPatOr', 'notPatXor', 'notPatBic'. On the Windows version, this function does nothing, since there is no apparent options on Windows that correspond to the Mac text modes.

Wait specified number of blankings (frame endings). Call with ''waitFrames''=1 (actually that's the default) to wait for the beginning of the next frame. Video cards mark the end of each video frame by briefly reducing the voltage to the Vertical Blanking Level (VBL), which &quot;blanks&quot; the screen to black. We do all video timing relative to the beginning of blanking. You may want to run
WaitBlanking at high priority (see Rush and Priority) for reliable timing. To keep this routine as fast as possible, no value is returned unless you supply an argument to receive it. When processor priority is at or below MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt the WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt 'Preference' controls, for each screen, whether WaitBlanking calls [[Psychtoolbox:Screen Commands:SetClut|SetClut]] (default) or waits for a blanking interrupt. When processor priority is above MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt, WaitBlanking always uses SetClut (i.e.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I noticed many omissions and a few falsehoods that I cleaned up, would appreciate some help expanding the list under authoritarian regime forms. Clearly this text is not yet done and I would love to collaborate with whomever is currently working on it.

on the definition of Kleptocracy, Saddam Hussein is given as example. I think this example is rather exagerated, and there is not enough evidence to support it (unless you consider american news channels evidence). As an example of Kleptocracy i would suggest some african countries, like Rwanda in 2002 for instance.

:I agree.  If Saddam CAN be called a Kleptocrat, the term is only applicable during the sanction period.  Further proof that sanctions only serve to strengthen dictators and weaken opposition. [[User:Josterhage|Josterhage]] ([[User talk:Josterhage|talk]]) 17:07, 6 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every programming book should start out with a &quot;Hello World&quot; program, just to get you started. This book's author sees no reason not to follow this &quot;standard&quot; so we will do just that.


===Create a new project===

Start gambas
You will be greeted with this screen:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:gambas_1st.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After that follow the steps as described below(no screen-shots)&lt;br&gt;
Click &quot;New Project&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
Click &quot;Next&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
Select &quot;Create a graphical project&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
Click &quot;Next&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
In the &quot;Select the name of the project&quot; insert Hello_World&lt;br&gt;
In the &quot;Select the title of the project&quot; insert Hello World&lt;br&gt;
Click &quot;Ok&quot; to create the project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Create the Form(Window)===
Ok, now we should have gambas started with a fresh, new project. You are now looking at the Gambas GUI, which is where we will do all our Gambas work. When you look at the interface, it seems pretty useless; No windows, No buttons or what have you. Let's change that right away. &lt;br&gt;
On your left side, you'll see a tree view, right click on the Forms folder, and choose &quot;New --&gt; Form&quot;(the --&gt; indicates that you choose New, and follow the   submenu to Form).&lt;br&gt;

In the Create form dialog, just click &quot;Ok&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
As you noticed, quite a few things happened. A new Form(Window) was created, and some other new things showed up. /*NOTE*/In gambas &quot;Windows is called &quot;Forms&quot; and I will use the term Form(s)in the rest of the book.&lt;br&gt;

The grey Form that just got created looks a bit ugly(tiny dots all over the place) but don't worry about that. The dots are there for your aid in placing your objects in the Form.&lt;br&gt;
To your right you should see the &quot;ToolBox&quot;. That's where you can choose what objects you want in your form. In our &quot;Hello World&quot; program, we'll need one label(marked as &quot;A&quot; in the toolbox) and one button(marked as &quot;Ok&quot; in the toolbox). Let's start with the label. Click on the label in the toolbox, and move the new form. In the form, hold down the left mouse button, and &quot;draw&quot; the label on there. Once done, you will have a label in your form with the text &quot;Label1&quot; in it. Now you can change this text with the &quot;Hello Word&quot; phrase.

The next step is to put some code in the Ok Button (you must change the text to &quot;OK&quot; of this button as you changed in the Label). After changing the text please double click the button so we can enter the exit code in the event click of this button. Type QUIT in the click event and that's all you've created your Hello World Application

      <text xml:space="preserve">i have a table Table1 i have entered the Date field as Dat now i want to change it to Date how can i do that as alter and modify commands are not helping? -- (Anon)

:It is not a good idea to call any field, ''Date'', since '''DATE''' is an Oracle reserved word and dealing with that will complicate your life unnecessarily. However if you ''insist'' on calling it, ''Date'', you can do so. Whenever you use the name of the field you will have to enclose it in quotes like this -- &quot;Date&quot; -- so that Oracle knows that you don't mean '''DATE''', you really mean ''Date''. Is it really worth the hassle when you could have avoided it by choosing a different name for the field? -- [[User:Derek Ross|Derek Ross]] 23:21, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

On another issue, I notice that the article defines functions and procedures using '''IS'''. My experience is that this never works: you have to use '''AS''' instead. Comments ? Am I doing something wrong or does the article need fixing? -- [[User:Derek Ross|Derek Ross]] 23:21, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

:You are probably thinking of a &quot;view&quot; instead of a &quot;procedure&quot;, which works like the following:

 CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_view (EMPLOYEE_ID,NAME,EMAIL)
 AS
 SELECT employee_id, name, email FROM employee
 /

:I've been using PL/SQL procedures for a couple years and am certain that the use of IS is correct.

==Parameters==

Need some discussion of IN/OUT/IN OUT - is it copy in/copy out, or call by address (for OUT and IN/OUT), or even Algol60 style call-by-name which requires thunks!

Is an OUT parameter always overwritten on return to the caller even if not assigned
within the procedure?  What happens when you read from an OUT parameter before you first
write to it in a procedure? -- &lt;asked someone who didn't sign&gt;

In/Out are designates that a parameter is or is not able to be modified within a procedure.
Example:    

In the CALLING procedure (assuming variables declared to match, wherever they need declaring)

... code snippet
MyVar1 := 'Jane Doe'; -- possible employee name
MyVar2 := 0; -- age in years of employee
MyVar3 := '234598' ; -- an employee id
Some_Proc_Name (MyVar1, MyVar3, MyVar2);
... end of snippet

MyVar1 may now still be &quot;Jane Doe&quot; (if that is employee #234598's name).
MyVar2 now has Jane's current age.

In the CALLED procedure can be found stuff like ...

(CREATE OR REPLACE)
Procedure Some_Proc_Name (Param1 in out ParamType,  -- here this is Varchar2
                          Param2 in ParamType,      -- either Varchar2 or integer
                          Param3 in out nocopy ParamType) -- this is number
-- nocopy tells compiler to use same external memory location for this variable
-- no need to take more memory for a second copy within the procedure
IS
... Variable declarations
var_date_Birth Date;
-- because Params1 and 3 are &quot;in out&quot; they can be treated as variables WITHIN the procedure
-- and there is no need for additional variables.

BEGIN -- start of whole procedure
  Begin -- isolated trap for retrieval of data
    select first_name||' '||last_name, DOB into Param1, var_date_Birth
      from Employees
     where EmpID = Param2
  exception
    when NO_DATA_FOUND then Param1 := 'Emp no longer exists.'; -- age still zero
    when others then Param1 := SQLERRM; -- passes back info to calling proc
  end;
  if var_date_Birth is not null then -- calculate age
    Param3 := CASE Sysdate &gt; var_date_Birth then (Sysdate - var_date_birth)
              ELSE 0 END; -- just in case someone has entered a bad date.
-- you can fine tune the date calc to just be years, but I can't remember how just now.
  end if;
END Some_Proc_name;

-- &lt;answered someone else who didn't sign&gt;

== DDL ==

This is the best collection of simplified SQL syntax, that I’ve come across.  I would move sections 1.5.1 Setting Constraints on a Table, 1.5.2 Unique Index on a Table, and 1.6 Sequences to the DDL section.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: sufficent → sufficient using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Zombie''' is an exceptionally strong cocktail made of fruit juices and rum, so named for its perceived effects on the drinker. It first appeared in the mid-1930s, invented by [[w:Donn Beach|Donn Beach]] (formerly Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gannt) of Hollywood's ''[[w:Don the Beachcomber|Don the Beachcomber]]'' restaurant.  He concocted it one afternoon in the mid-1930s for a friend who had dropped by his restaurant before flying to San Francisco.  The friend left after having consumed three of them.  He returned several days later to say that he had been turned into a zombie for his entire trip.  Its smooth, fruity taste works to conceal its extremely high alcohol content.  For many years the Don the Beachcomber restaurants limited their customers to 2 zombies apiece.

There are countless variations on the Zombie; every bar, chain restaurant, and individual seems to have their own take on it. The following are some of many possible zombies but is not as potent as the original recipe:

==Zombie #1==

===Ingredients===
* 1 oz light rum
* 1 oz golden rum
* 1 oz dark rum
* 1 oz apricot brandy
* 1 oz pineapple juice
* 1 oz papaya juice
* Dash of Grenadine or other syrup
* 1/2 oz 151-proof rum

Note: 1 oz equals 30 ml

===Procedure===
#Shake all ingredients except the 151-proof rum in a shaker with ice.
#Strain into a collins or hurricane glass filled with ice cubes. 
#Float the 151-proof rum on top. 
#Garnish with pineapple and cherry.

==Zombie #2==

Here is another recipe that is probably close to what the original version was.  Don the Beachcomber originally used 5 or 6 kinds of Caribbean rum that are no longer easily available in the United States, so generic rums have been specified.

The following ingredients are supposedly for 1 drink but, with sufficient ice in 2 or 3 glasses, can actually make 2 or 3 very potent drinks.

===Ingredients===

*4 oz. (½ cup) water
*3/4 oz. (1½ tbs.) fresh lime juice
*1 oz. (2 tbs.) fresh grapefruit juice
*1/2 oz. (1 tbs.) sugar syrup
*1 oz. (2 tbs.) dark rum
*1 oz. (2 tbs.) golden rum
*1 oz. (2 tbs) white rum   
*1 oz. (2 tbs) 151-proof rum
*1-1/4 oz. (2½ tbs) spiced golden rum
*3/4 oz. (1½ tbs.) Cherry Heering
*1/2 oz. (1 tbs.) Falernum syrup
*2 dashes (½ tsp.) Pernod or other anisette-flavored pastis
*3 dashes (¾ tsp) Grenadine

===Procedure===

Shake with 4 ice cubes, then pour into 1, 2, or 3 highball glasses that have been filled with crushed ice.

==Zombie #3==

===Ingredients===

*1 oz. dark Jamaica rum
*2 oz. gold label rum
*1 oz. light rum
*1/2 oz. apricot brandy
*2 oz. papaya nectar
*1 1/2 oz. pineapple juice
*1/2 oz. lime juice
*1/2 oz. simple syrup
*1 or 2 tsp. 151-proof rum
*green cherry (for garnish)
*pineapple stick (for garnish)
*red cherry (for garnish)
*mint sprig (for garnish)
*powdered sugar (for garnish)

===Procedure===

Pour all ingredients, except the garnishes and 151-proof rum, into a cocktail shaker two-thirds filled with ice. Shake well; pour into a zombie glass (or hurricane glass), along with the ice from the shaker. Float a few teaspoons of 151-proof rum on the top of the drink. (You may wish to pour it over the back of a spoon, so it floats.) Put the green cherry, pineapple stick, and red cherry (in that order) on a toothpick, and set on the edge of the glass. Add the mint sprig. Sprinkle powdered sugar over everything. Add a straw and, if desired, a cocktail umbrella.

Be sure not to sip the Zombie through the straw at first. Otherwise, you will miss the pleasure of drinking the extra high-proof rum floating on the top!

==Zombie Punch (Don the Beachcomber's original 1934 recipe)==
As described in &quot;Sippin' Safari&quot; by Jeff &quot;Beachbum&quot; Berry.

===Ingredients===

*3/4 oz. fresh lime juice
*1/2 oz Don's Mix (see below)
*1/2 oz falernum
*1 1/2 oz Lowndes Jamaican rum (sub Appleton V/X)
*1 1/2 oz gold Puerto Rican rum
*1 oz 151-proof Demerara rum
*Dash Angostura bitters
*Dash Grenadine
*Dash Absinthe (sub Herbsaint or Pernod)
*6 oz crushed ice

===Procedure===

Put everything into a blender, saving ice for last. Blend at high speed for no more than 5 seconds. Pour into a chimney glass. Add ice to fill. Garnish with a mint sprig.

Don's Mix: 2 parts grapefruit juice, 1 part cinnamon-infused sugar syrup

Absolutely none for the classic designs, or even something branded normally.

      <comment>/* Can't connect to window server - not enough permissions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Broken Pipe ===
A current app I'm working freezes up for about a minute when calling editingContext.saveChanges. The following message is added to the system output:

  &lt;WorkerThread3&gt; &lt;WOWorkerThread id=3 socket=Socket[addr=/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,port=51634,localport=51563]&gt;
 Exception while sending response: java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe

The odd thing is that no exception is actually being thrown and the changes are saved to the database. Any clues out there about what this message means?

==== Chuck Hill ====
This message means that the woadaptor did not receive a response from your application within the alloted amount of time. At this point, the woapdator hangs up on your application assuming that it is dead or overly busy. If you have multiple instances running, the woadaptor will then forward the request to another instance. For component actions this will produce a session expired or can't restore page error message.

When your application finally finishes processing the request it attempts to return the result to the woadaptor only to discover that it has hung up on it (aka closed the socket, broken the pipe). At this point the exception above is output to the log.

There are a few ways to avoid this:

* Optimize your application so that the request is processed more quickly.
* Use the WOLongReponsePage to handle long running requests.
* Increase the Connect Timeout and Receive Timeout values in JavaMonitor so that the woadaptor will wait long enough for your application to provide the response.

'''Note:''' If this message happens in other contexts (i.e. not when a request takes a long time to process) it might just mean that the user hit stop in their browser or clicked another link.

=== Where's my stderr!? ===
Wotaskd launches new WOA instances using a script called SpawnOfWotaskd.sh that is located in  /System/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/Contents/Resources/SpawnOfWotaskd.sh on OS X.  For some reason, this script was written to throw away stderr.  This means that if you ever want to get a thread stack dump, you're out of luck.  Fortunately this is an easy fix.  If you edit SpawnOfWotaskd.sh, the stock version looks like:

  #!/bin/sh
  $@ 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; 

Notice that stream 1 goes to /dev/null, and stream 2 writes to stream 1.  Boo.  Change it to:

  #!/bin/sh
  $@ 1&gt;&gt;/var/log/webobjects.err 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; 

The one problem now is that typically WebObjects apps run as appserver user, which means they won't be able to write to this file.  To fix this, you can 'touch /var/log/webobjects.err' as root, and then chown the blank file to whatever user your WebObjects apps run as.

=== Can't connect to window server - not enough permissions ===
Ah yes, the joys of AWT.  If you touch any AWT class (even the ones that don't make sense, like Dimension, or Rectangle), an AWT Toolkit will be created (in a static block) and AWT will attempt to connect to the window server.  Of course when you ran in development mode, you had access to the window server and everything was peachy.  As soon as you tried to deploy as the appserver user, all hell broke loose.  You have a couple of options for fixing this one:

* Just stop using them.  This is the most sure fire way to not get hit by this problem.  Don't use AWT classes when you don't need to.  Obviously this is often easier said than done.
* Add -Djava.awt.headless=true to your VM launch parameters.  This tells AWT to use headless mode.  If you are using older versions of Apple's JVM, this may still cause issues (weird debug statements requesting for you to hit a key on the console).
* [http://www.eteks.com/pja/en/ PJA Toolkit].  This is actually kind of a cool library.  It's a pure java implementation of an AWT toolkit.  On a normal system, your AWT implementation is JNI (to talk to your native window system).  PJA provides pura java implementations of all of the capabilities a normal AWT toolkit would attempt to perform.  Obviously it doesn't actually use the window server, rather it's working akin to a VNC server with a virtual frame buffer.
* Run as root.  This is not generally recommended, but you can modify your /System/Library/StartupItems/WebObjects/WebObjects script to run WO as root instead of appserver user.  You'll find the instructions on doing so inside of that script.

=== Java Monitor Issues ===
For those who have problem with the monitor on Mac OS X please check the following parameters:

* Check that the machine is properly identified in the DNS including the reverse lookup.
* Verify that when you added the machine in the monitor you included the fully qualifier name i.e. &quot;machine.domain.com&quot; and not only &quot;machine&quot; using the shorter version may appear to work but it does not (this is documented by Apple).
* Check the adaptor configuration (/System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache/apache.conf) and in particular the instance discovery method: this needs to be in accordance with the command line launch of wotaskd (see the script in /System/Library/StartupItems/). You may need to modify the script by hand.
* When everything is setup properly reboot. It should work.

=== WOtaskd Didn't Start ===
In older versions of OS X server, WOtaskd and JavaMonitor were launched using the StartupItems system.  In more recent versions of OS X server and WebObjects, Apple uses its new launchd framework instead.  If you install WebObjects with developer tools, you typically only end up with the Startupitem scripts, so you should follow those instructions.

==== WOtaskd/WOMonitor LaunchDaemon ====
For an overview of launchd, you can read [http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html Apple's documentation].

The WebObjects launch daemon items are disabled by default, so the first thing you will need to do is enable them:
# cd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons
# edit &quot;com.apple.womonitor.plist&quot; and &quot;com.apple.wotaskd.plist&quot;
# change the Disabled key from &quot;true&quot; to &quot;false&quot;
# save and exit

Next you will need to load the launch daemon items manually:
# Run &quot;launchctl&quot; as root
# &quot;list&quot; and look for com.webobjects.womonitor and com.webobjects.wotaskd
# If they do exist, you will need to load them manually
## &quot;load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.wotaskd.plist&quot;
## &quot;load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.womonitor.plist&quot;
# &quot;list&quot; again and verify they both appear
# &quot;start com.webobjects.wotaskd&quot;
# &quot;start com.webobjects.womonitor&quot;
# Quit launchctl (ctrl-c it)

wotaskd and womonitor should now both be running.  You can test monitor by going to http://localhost:56789.

If this does not work, check for file system permissions on /Library/WebObjects/Configuration, which should be appserver:appserverusr or at least they should have write permission to this directory.

Running this following command in a terminal window will tell you exactly why wotaskd is not launching...

sudo -u appserver /System/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/Contents/Resources/javawoservice.sh -appPath /System/ Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/wotaskd

==== WOtaskd/WOMonitor StartupItems ====
On developer installs and older Mac OS X Server installs, WebObjects is launched using the old StartupItems system.  By default, wotaskd and womonitor are disabled.  Fortunately, enabling them is easy:

# cd /System/Library/StartupItems/WebObjects
# Edit &quot;WebObjects&quot;
# Search for &quot;-appPath&quot; and you will find four commented out lines in this area of the script.
#* To run WebObjects as root, uncomment the first two commands (you should see a WOTASKD and a WOMONITOR line)
#* To run WebObjects as another user (appserver user by default), uncomment the second set of the lines
# Save and exit
# Start the WebObjects service using one of the two methods:
#* sudo systemstarter start &quot;WebObjects Services&quot;
#* ./WebObjects start

After these changes, wotaskd and womonitor will autostart after a reboot.

Note: Do not follow these instructions on a MacOS X 10.4.* Server machine with WO 5.3.*. There, the process is started as LaunchDeamon (described above). If you enable the Startup Item, the system tries to start wotaskd twice which leads to nothing working at all.

=== Dealing with Deadlocks/Application Hanging ===
There are several techniques for dealing with deadlocks and application hangs.

If you are using a [[Programming:WebObjects/Web_Applications/Development/Profiling_WO_Apps|profiler]] or debugger, you can generally pause execution and see where exactly your application is dying.

If you are using JDK 1.4, you can send your application a QUIT signal and it will dump all active threads.  On OS X, find the pid of your application, then execute a 'kill -QUIT yourAppPID'.  The thread stack traces will dump out to the log files.  If you do not see any output in your logs, see the ''Where's my stderr!?'' above for possible reasons.

If you are using JDK 1.5, in addition to being to send the application a QUIT signal, you can also attach to it (as root or the launching user) and get the thread stack dumps using the 'jstack' application by calling 'jstack yourAppPID'.

If you see hangs in WOWorkerThreads waiting to restore a session, this generally means a previous request threw an exception from a location that didn't properly check its session back in.  Session access in WebObjects is single-threaded.  Common cases that can cause this are throwing exceptions from your awake methods as well as throwing exceptions from DirectAction methods.

In JDK 1.4, you will be able to see the list of object locks that each stack trace is holding.  You can find deadlocks by looking for multiple threads that contain two or more overlapping locks.  In JDK 1.5, the VM detects deadlock situations and will identify them in the thread stack dumps.

''&quot;It's hard to make predictions - especially about the future.&quot;''
Robert Storm Petersen


== Introduction / Until now ==
Developing from the information processing approach, present cognitive psychology differs from classical psychological approaches in the methods used as well as in the interdisciplinary connections to other sciences. Apart from rejecting introspection as a valid method to analyse mental phenomena, cognitive psychology introduces further, mainly computer-based, techniques which have not been in the range of classical psychology by now.

By using brain-imaging-techniques like fMRI, cognitive psychology is able to analyse the relation between the physiology of the brain and mental processes. In the future cognitive psychology will concentrate on computer-related methods even more than it is already. Hereby it will profit from improvements in the area of IT. E.g. fMRI scans nowadays still have lots of possible error sources, which should be solved in the future. Thereby the technique becomes more powerful and precise. In addition to that the computational approach can be combined with the classical behavioural approach, where one infers a participant's mental states from the behaviour that is shown.

Cognitive psychology however is not only using methods developed by other sciences, of course it collaborates with topic-related sciences like artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics and the philosophy of mind as well. The advantage is clear: different perspectives on the topic make it possible to confirm results from a field or to eventually gain new accesses to the study of the mind. Modern studies of cognitive psychology more and more criticise the classical information processing approach, which leaves room for other approaches to acquire more importance  E.g. the classical approach is modified to a parallel information processing approach, which is thought to be closer to the actual functioning of the brain.

== Today's approaches ==

=== The momentary usage of brain imaging ===
How are the known brain imaging methods used? What kind of information can be derived using this methods?

==== fMRI ====
fMRI is an non-invasive imaging method that pictures active structures of the brain in a high spatial resolution. 
For that the participant has to lie in a tube and his brain is pictured. While doing a task active structures in the brain of the participant can be recognised on the recordings.
 
'''How?'''&lt;br&gt;
If parts of the brain are active, the metabolism is also stimulated. The blood, that has an important function in the metabolic transport is flowing to the active nerve cells. The haemoglobin in the red blood cells carries oxygen (oxyhaemogliobin) when flowing to the part that is active and that needs oxygen, to consume and work. With consumption the haemoglobin „delivers“ the oxygen (desoxyhaemoglobin). This leads to local changes in the relative concentration of oxyhemoglobin and desoxyhemoglobin and changes in local blood volume and the blood flow. While haemoglobin is oxygenated it is diamagnetic (what means that the material tends to leave the magnetic field), but paramagnetic (what is the opposite of diamagnetic; the material tends to migrate into the magnetic field) while desoxygenated. The magnetic resonance signal of blood is therefore slightly different depending on the level of oxygenation.

By being able to detect the magnetic properties mentioned above, the fMRI-scanner is able to determine alterations in blood flow and blood volume, and constructing a picture. This picture shows the brain and its activated parts. While the participant is doing a task the researcher can derive, which brain regions are involved. But that is indirect measured data, because in a way the metabolism is measured and not the neuronal activity. Furthermore this imaging method has as a consequence of the principle a low temporal resolution.

==== EEG ====
The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is another non-invasive brain imaging method. Electronic signals from the human brain are recorded while the participant is doing a task. The electronic activity of the neuronal cells, that is adding can be measured. 

The electronic activity is measured by attaching electrodes to the skin of the head. In most cases the electrodes are installed on a cap, that the participant  wears. It is very time-consuming to install the cap correct on the head of the participant, but it is very important for the outcome, that everything is in the right place. To assure the adding of the signals the electrodes have to be installed geometric and in a parallel configuration. This technique is applied to measure the event-related potential (ERP), potential changes. They are correlated temporal to an emotional, sensoric, cognitive or motoric event. In the experiment a certain event has to be repeated again and again. The type ERP then can be extracted and calculated. This method is not only time-consumptive, also a lot of disrupting factors complicate the measuring. Moreover this method has a very high temporal resolution, but a very low spatial resolution. It is hardly possible to measure activity in deeper brain regions or to detect the source of the activity interpreting only the recordings.

=== Interdisciplinary Approaches ===


==== Cognitive Science ====
Cognitive science is multidisciplinary science. It comprises areas of cognitive psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, cognitive anthropology, computer science and philosophy. Cognitive science concentrates to study the intelligent behaviour of humans, which includes perception, learning, memory, thought and language. Research in cognitive sciences are based on naturalistic research methods such as cognitive neuropsychology, introspection, psychological experimentation, mathematical modelling and philosophical argumentation.

In the beginning of the cognitive sciences the most common method was introspection. It meant that the test subject evaluated his or her own cognitive thinking. In these experiments the researchers were using experienced subjects because they had to analyse and report their own cognitive thinking. Problems can occur when the results are interpreted and the subject has different reports from the same action. Obviously a clear separation is needed between the matters that can be studied by introspection and the ones that are not adequate for this method.

Computational modelling in cognitive science means that the mind is seen as a machine. This approach seeks to express theoretical ideas through computational modelling that generate behaviour similar to humans. Mathematical modelling is based on flow charts. The model's quality is very important to ensure the equivalence of the input and results.

Nowadays the researchers in cognitive sciences use often theoretical and computational models. &quot;This does not exclude their primary method of experimentation with human participants. In cognitive sciences it is also important to bring the theories and the experimenting together. Because it comprises so many fields of science it is important to bring together the most appropriate methods from all these fields. The psychological experiments should be interpreted through a theory that expresses mental representations and procedures. The most productive and revealing way to perform research in cognitive sciences is to combine different approaches and methods together. This ensures overall picture from the research area and it comprises the viewpoints of all the different fields.&quot; (Thagard, Cognitive Science) Nevertheless Cognitive Science has not yet managed to succeed in bringing the different areas together. Nowadays it is criticised for not establishing a science on its own. Rather few scientist really address themselves as cognitive scientists. Furthermore the basic metaphor of the brain functioning like a computer is challenged as well as the distinctions between their models and nature (cf. Eysenck &amp; Keane, Cognitive Psychology, pp. 519-520).
This of course brings up a lot of work for the future. Cognitive Science has to work on better models that explain natural processes and that are reliably able to make predictions. Furthermore these models have to combine multiple mental phenomena. In addition to that a general &quot;methodology for relating a computational model's behaviour to human behaviour&quot; has to be worked out. Hereby the strength of such models can be increased. Apart from that Cognitive Science needs to establish an identity with prominent researchers that avow themselves to Cognitive Science. And finally its biggest goal, the creation of a general unifying theory of human cognition (see Theory Part), has to be reached (cf. ibid, p. 520). 

===== Experimental Cognitive Psychology =====
Psychological experimentation studies mental functions. This is done with indirect methods meaning reasoning. These studies are performed to find causal relations and the factors influencing behaviour. The researcher observes visible actions and makes conclusions based on these observations. Variables are changed one at a time and the effect of this change is being observed. The benefits of experimental researching are that the manipulated factors can be altered in nearly any way the researcher wants. From this point it is finally possible to find causal relations.

In being the classical approach within the field of Cognitive Psychology, experimental studies have been the basis for the development of numerous modern approaches within contemporary Cognitive Psychology. It's empirical methods have been developed and verified over time and the gained results were a foundation for many enhancements contributed to the field of psychology.

Taking into consideration the established character of experimental cognitive psychology, one might think that methodological changes are rather negligible. But recent years came up with a discussion concerning the question, whether the results of experimental CP remain valid in the “real world” at all. A major objection is the fact that the artificial environment in an experiment might cause that certain facts and coherences are unintentionally ignored, which is due to the fact that for reasons of clarity numerous factors are suppressed.  (cf. Eysenck &amp; Keane, Cognitive Psychology, pp.514-515). A possible example for this is the research concerning attention. Since the attention of the participant is mainly governed by the experimenter’s instructions, it’s focus is basically determined. Therefore &quot;relatively little is known of the factors that normally influence the focus of attention.&quot; (ibid, p.514) Furthermore it turns out to be problematic that mental phenomena are often examined in isolation. While trying to make the experimental setup as concise as possible (in order to get clearly interpretable results) one decouples the aspect at issue from adjacent and interacting mental processes. This leads to the problem that the results turn out to be valid in the idealised experimental setting only but not in “real life”. Here multiple mental phenomena interact with each other and numerous outer stimuli influence the behaviour of mental processes. The validity gained by such studies could only be characterised as an internal validity (which means that the results are valid in the special circumstances created by the experimenter) but not as an external validity (which means that the results stay valid in changed and more realistic circumstances) (cf. ibid, p.514). These objections lead to experiments which have been developed to refer closer to &quot;real life&quot;. According to these experiments &quot;real-world&quot; phenomena like 'absent-mindedness', 'everyday memory' or 'reading' gain importance. Nevertheless the discussion remains whether such experiments really deliver new information about mental processes. And whether these 'everyday phenomenon studies' really become broadly accepted greatly depends on the results current experiments will deliver.

Another issue concerning experimental setups in cognitive psychology is the way individual differences are handled. In general the results from an experiment are generated by an analysis of variance. This causes that results which are due to individual differences are averaged out and not taken into further consideration. Such a procedure seems to be highly questionable, especially if put into the context of an investigation of Bowers in 1973, which showed that over 30% of the variance in such studies are due to individual differences or their interaction with the current situation (cf. ibid, p.515). Based on such facts one challenge for future experimental cognitive psychology is the analysis of individual differences and finding way to include knowledge about such differences in general studies.

===== Cognitive Neuroscience =====
Another approach towards a better understanding of human cognition is cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience lies at the interface between traditional cognitive psychology and the brain sciences. It is a science whose approach is characterised by attempts to derive cognitive level theories from various types of information, such as computational properties of neural circuits, patterns of behavioural damage as a result of brain injury or measurements of brain activity during the execution of cognitive tasks (cf. www.psy.cmu.edu). Cognitive neuroscience helps to understand  how the human brain supports thought, perception, affection, action, social process and other aspects of cognition and behaviour, including how such processes develop and change in the brain over time (cf. www.nsf.gov).

Cognitive neuroscience has emerged in the last decade as an intensely active and influential discipline, forged from interactions among the cognitive sciences, neurology, neuroimaging, physiology, neuroscience, psychiatry, and other fields. New methods for non-invasive functional neuroimaging of subjects performing psychological tasks have been of particular importance for this discipline. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging includes: positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), optical imaging (near infra-red spectroscopy or NIRS), anatomical MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  The findings of cognitive neuroscience are directed towards enabling a basic scientific understanding of a broad range of issues involving the brain, cognition and behaviour.  (cf. www.nsf.gov).

Cognitive neuroscience becomes a very important approach to understand human cognition, since results can clarify functional brain organisation, such as the operations performed by a particular brain area and the system of distributed, discrete neural areas supporting a specific cognitive representation. These findings can reveal the effect on brain organization of individual differences (including even genetic variation) (cf. www.psy.cmu.edu, www.nsf.gov).
Another importance of cognitive neuroscience is that cognitive neuroscience provides some ways that allow us to &quot;obtain detailed information about the brain structures involved in different kinds of cognitive processing&quot; (Eysenck &amp; Keane, Cognitive Psychology, p. 521). Techniques such as MRI and CAT scans have proved of particular value when used on patients to discover which brain areas are damaged. Before non-invasive methods of cognitive neuroscience were developed localisation  of &quot;brain damage could only be established by post mortem examination&quot; (ibid). Knowing which brain areas are related to which cognitive process would surely lead to obtain a clearer view of brain region, hence, in the end would help for a better understanding of human cognition processes.
Another strength of cognitive neuroscience is that it serves as a tool to demonstrate the reality of theoretical distinctions. For example, it has been argued by many theorists that implicit memory can be divided into perceptual and conceptual implicit memory; support for that view has come from PET studies, which show that perceptual and conceptual priming tasks affected different areas of the brain (cf. ibid, pp. 521-522). However, cognitive neuroscience is not that perfect to be able to stand alone and answer all questions dealing with human cognition. Cognitive neuroscience has some limitations, dealing with data collecting and data validity. In most neuroimaging studies, data is collected from several individuals and then averaged. Some concern has arose about such averaging because of the existence of significant individual differences. Though the problem was answered by Raichle (1998), who stated that the differ in individual brain should be appreciated, however general organising principles emerge that transcend these differences, a broadly accepted solution to the problem has yet to be found (cf. ibid, p. 522).

===== Cognitive Neuropsychology =====
Cognitive Neuropsychology maps the connection between brain functions and cognitive behaviour. Patients with brain damages have been the most important source of research in neuropsychology. Neuropsychology also examines dissociation (“forgetting”), double dissociation and associations (connection between two things formed by cognition). Neuropsychology uses technological research methods to create images of the brain functioning. There are many differences in techniques to scan the brain. The most common ones are EEG (Electroencephalography), MRI and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography).

Cognitive Neuropsychology became very popular since it delivers good evidence. Theories developed for normal individuals can be verified by patients with brain damages. Apart from that new theories could have been established because of the results of neuropsychological experiments. Nevertheless certain limitations to the approach as it is today cannot be let out of consideration. First of all the fact that people having the same mental disability often do not have the same lesion needs to be pointed out (cf. ibid, pp.516-517). In such cases the researchers have to be careful with their interpretation. In general it could only be concluded that all the areas that the patients have injured could play a role in the mental phenomenon. But not which part really is decisive. Based on that future experiments in this area tend to make experiments with a rather small number of people with pretty similar lesion respectively compare the results from groups with similar syndromes and different lesions. In addition to that the situation often turns out to be vice versa. Some patients do have pretty similar lesions but show rather different behaviour (cf. ibid, p.517). One probable reason therefore is that the patients differ in their age and lifestyle (cf. Banich, Neuropsychology, p.55). With better technologies in the future one will be better able to distinguish the cases in which really the various personalities make the difference or in which cases the lesions are not entirely equal. In addition to that the individual brain structures which may cause the different reactions to the lesions will become a focus of research. Another problem for Cognitive Neuropsychology is that their patients are rare. The patients which are interesting for such research have lesions of an accident or suffered during war. But in addition there are differences in the manner of the lesion. Often multiple brain regions are damaged which makes it very hard to determine which of them is responsible for the examined phenomenon. The dependency on chance whether there are available patients will remain in future. Thereby predictions concerning this aspect of the research are not very reliable.
Apart from that it is not possible yet to localise some mental processes in the brain. Creative thought or organisational planning are examples (cf. Eysenck &amp; Keane, Cognitive Psychology, p.517). A possible outcome of the research is that those activities rely on parallel processing. This would support the idea of the modification of the information processing theory that will be discussed later on. But if it shows up that a lot of mental processes depend on such parallel processing it would turn out to be a big drawback for Cognitive Psychology since its core is the modularization of the brain and the according phenomena. In this context the risk of overestimation and underestimation has to be mentioned. The latter occurs because Cognitive Psychology often only identifies the most important brain region for the mental task. Other regions that are related thereto could be ignored. This could turn out to be fundamental if really parallel processing is crucial to many mental activities. Overestimation occurs when fibers that only pass the damaged brain region are lesioned, too. The researcher concludes that the respective brain region plays an important role in the phenomenon he analyses even though only the deliverance of the information passed that region (cf. ibid). Modern technologies and experiments here have to be developed in order to provide valid and precise results.

==== Unifying Theories ====

A unified theory of cognitive science serves the purpose to bring together all the vantage points one can take toward the brain/mind. If a theory could be formed which incorporates all the discoveries of the disciplines mentioned above a full understanding would be tangible. 

===== ACT-R =====

ACT-R is a Cognitive Architecture, an acronym for Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational.
It provides tools which enable us to model the human cognition. It consists mainly of five components: 
Perceptual-motor modules, declarative memory, procedural memory, chunks and buffers.
The declarative memory stores facts in “knowledge-units”, the chunks.
These are transmitted through the modules respective buffers, which contain one chunk at a time.
The procedural memory is the only one without an own buffer, but is able to access the contents of the other buffers. For example those of the perceptual-motor modules, which are the interface with the (simulated) outer world.
Production is accomplished by predefined rules, written is LISP.
The main character behind it is John R. Anderson who tributes the inspiration to Allan Newell.

===== SOAR =====

SOAR is another Cognitive Architecture, an acronym for State, Operator And Result.
It enables one to model complex human capabilities. Its goal is to create an agent with human-like behaviour. The working principles are the following:
Problem-solving is a search in a problem-space.
Permanent Knowledge is represented by production rules in the production memory.
Temporary Knowledge is represented by objects in the working memory.
New Goals are created only if a dead end is reached.
The learning mechanism is Chunking.
Chunking: If SOAR encounters an impasse and is unable to resolve it with the usual technique, it uses “weaker” strategies to circumvent the dead end. In case one of these attempts leads to success,
the respective route is saved as a new rule, a chunk, preventing the impasse to occur again. 
SOAR was created by John Laird, Allen Newell and Paul Rosenbloom.

==== Neural Networks ====

There are two types of neural networks: biological and artificial.

A biological NN  consists of neurons which are physically or functionally connected with each other. Since each neuron can connect to multiple other neurons the number of possible connections is exponentially high. The connections between neurons are called synapses. Signalling along these synapses happens via electrical signalling or chemical signalling, which induces electrical signals.
The chemical signalling  works by  various neurotransmitters.

Artificial NN  are divided by their goals. One is that of artificial intelligence and the other cognitive modelling. 
Cognitive modelling NN try to simulate biological NN in order to gain better understanding of them, for example the brain. Until now the complexity of the brain and similar structures has prevented a complete model from being devised, so the cognitive modelling focuses on smaller parts like specific brain regions.
NNs in artificial intelligence are used to solve distinct problems.
But though their goals differ the methods applied are very similar.
An artificial NN consist of artificial neurons (nodes) which are connected by mathematical functions.
These functions can be of other functions which in turn can be of yet other functions and so on.
The actual work is done by following the connections according to their weights.
Weights are properties of the connections defining the probability of the specific route to be taken by the program and can be changed by it, thus optimizing the main function.
Hereby it is possible to solve problems for which it is impossible to write a function “by hand”.

== Future Research ==
 
==== Brain imaging/activity measuring ====

As described in section 2.1. and 2.2. there are disadvantages of the brain imaging methods. fMRI has a low temporal resolution, but EEG a low spatial resolution. An interdisciplinary attempt is to combine both methods, to reach both a high spatial and temporal resolution. 
This technique (simultaneous EEG-measuring in the fMR) is used for instance in studying children with extratemporal epilepsy. It is important to assign the temporal progress to a region in which the epileptic seizure has its roots. 
In December of 2006 a conference in Munich discussed another idea of this mixture of methods: the study of Alzheimer's disease. It could be possible to recognise this disease very early. This could lead to new therapies to reduce the speed and the amount of cell-dead. In December of 2006 a conference in Munich discussed this eventuality.
Brain imaging methods are not only useful in medical approaches. Other disciplines could benefit from the brain imaging methods and derive new conclusions. For instance for social psychologist the brain imaging methods are interesting. Experiments with psychopathic personalities are only one possibility to explore the behaviour of humans.
For literature scientists there could be a possibility to study stylistic devices and their effect of humans while reading a poem.
Another attempt in future research is to synchronise the direction of sight and the stimuli, that was trigger for the change of direction. This complex project needs data from eye-tracking experiments and data from fMRI-studies.


==== Unifying theories more unifying. ====

Since the mind is a single system it should be possible to explain it as such without having to take different perspectives for every approach (neurological,psychological,computational).
Having such a theory would enable us to understand our brain far more thorough than now, and might eventually lead an everyday application. 
But until now there is no working Unifying Theory of Cognition, which fulfils the requirements stated by Allen Newell in his book Unified Theories of Cognition. Accordingly a UTC has to explain:
How intelligent organisms respond flexibly to the environment. 
How they exhibit goal-directed behaviour and choose goals rationally (and in response to interrupts: see previous point). 
How they use symbols. 
How they learn from experience. 
Even Newells own implementation SOAR does not reach these goals.

=== Promising experiments ===

Here I collected the abstracts of a few recent findings, feel free to modify or add to them.   
     
&gt;&gt;Unintentional language switch [] Kho, K.H., Duffau, H., Gatignol, P., Leijten, F.S.S., Ramsey, N.F., van Rijen, P.C. &amp; Rutten, G-J.M. (2007) Utrecht
Abstract [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WC0-4MV19P2-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=466519e5f384258e86463c21dea2774c]

We present two bilingual patients without language disorders in whom involuntary language switching was induced. The first patient switched from Dutch to English during a left-sided amobarbital Wada-test. 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging yielded a predominantly left-sided language distribution similar for both languages. 
The second patient switched from French to Chinese during intraoperative electrocortical stimulation of the left inferior frontal gyrus.
We conclude that the observed language switching in both cases was not likely the result of a selective inhibition of one language, but the result of a temporary disruption of brain areas that are involved in language switching.
These data complement the few lesion studies on (involuntary or unintentional) language switching, and add to the functional neuroimaging studies of switching, monitoring, and controlling the language in use. 

&gt;&gt;Bilateral eye movement -&gt; memory
Parker, A. &amp; Dagnall, N. (2007) Manchester Metropolitan University, 
One hundred and two participants listened to 150 words, organised into ten themes (e.g. types of vehicle), read by a male voice. 
Next, 34 of these participants moved their eyes left and right in time with a horizontal target for thirty seconds (saccadic eye movements); 34 participants moved their eyes up and down in time with a vertical target; the remaining participants stared straight ahead, focussed on a stationary target.
After the eye movements, all the participants listened to a mixture of words: 40 they'd heard before, 40 completely unrelated new words, and 10 words that were new but which matched one of the original themes.
In each case the participants had to say which words they'd heard before, and which were new.
The participants who'd performed sideways eye movements performed better in all respects than the others: they correctly recognised more of the old words as old, and more of the new words as new. 
Crucially, they were fooled less often by the new words whose meaning matched one of the original themes - that is they correctly recognised more of them as new.
This is important because mistakenly identifying one of these 'lures' as an old word is taken as a laboratory measure of false memory. The performance of the participants who moved their eyes vertically, or who stared ahead, did not differ from each other.
Episodic memory improvement induced by bilateral eye movements is hypothesized to reflect enhanced interhemispheric interaction, which is associated with superior episodic memory (S. D. Christman &amp; R. E. Propper. 2001).
Implications for neuropsychological mechanisms underlying eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (F. Shapiro, 1989, 2001), a therapeutic technique for posttraumatic stress disorder, are discussed

&gt;&gt;is the job satisfaction–job performance relationship spurious? A meta-analytic examination

Nathan A. Bowling(Department of Psychology, Wright State University) Abstract [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WMN-4NH7F2K-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=04%2F16%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3d7f02d9e5864f3bc9b742b2bb798fc1]

The job satisfaction–job performance relationship has attracted much attention throughout the history of industrial and organizational psychology. Many researchers and most lay people believe that a causal relationship exists between satisfaction and performance.
In the current study, however, analyses using meta-analytic data suggested that the satisfaction–performance relationship is largely spurious.
More specifically, the satisfaction–performance relationship was partially eliminated after controlling for either general personality traits (e.g., Five Factor Model traits and core self-evaluations) or for work locus of control and was almost completely eliminated after controlling for organization-based self-esteem.
The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. 

&gt;&gt;Mirror-touch synesthesia is linked with empathy

Michael J Banissy &amp; Jamie Ward (Department of Psychology, University College London)

Abstract [http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n7/abs/nn1926.html]
Watching another person being touched activates a similar neural circuit to actual touch and, for some people with 'mirror-touch' synesthesia, can produce a felt tactile sensation on their own body. 
In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of this type of synesthesia and show that it correlates with heightened empathic ability. 
This is consistent with the notion that we empathize with others through a process of simulation.

=== Discussion points ===

Where are the limitations of research? 
Can we rely on our intuitive idea of our mind?
What impact could a complete understanding of the brain have on everyday life?



==== Brain activity as a false friend ====

In several experiments the outcome is not unambiguous. This hinders a direct derivation from the data. In experiments with psychopathic personalities researchers had to weaken their thesis, that persons with missing activity in the frontal lobe are predetermined for being violent psychopathic people, that are unethical murderers. 
Missing activity in the frontal lobe leads to a disregulation of threshold for emotional, impulsive or violent actions. But this also advantages for example fire fighters or policemen, who have to withstand strong pressures and who need a higher threshold. So missing activity is not a sufficient criterion for psychopathic personalities. 

== Conclusion ==

Today's work in the field of Cognitive Psychology gives several hints how future work in this area may look like. In practical applications improvements will probably mainly be driven by the limitations one faces today. Here in particular the newer subfields of Cognitive Psychology will develop quickly. How such changes look like heavily depends on the character of future developments in technology. Especially improvements in Cognitive Neuropsychology and Cognitive Neuroscience depend on the advancements of the imaging techniques.
In addition to that the theoretical framework of the field will be influenced by such developments. The parallel processing theory may still be modified according to new insights in computer science. Thereby or eventually by the acceptance of one of the already existing overarching theories the theoretical basis for the current research could be reunified.
But if it takes another 30 years to fulfil Newell's dream of such a theory or if it will happen rather quick is still open. As a rather young science Cognitive Psychology still is subject to elementary changes. All its practical and theoretical domains are steadily modified. Whether the trends mentioned in this chapter are just dead ends or will cause a revolution of the field could only be predicted which definitely is hard.

==1. What is meant by the term &quot;heredity&quot;?==
''Heredity'' refers to the transfer of biological characteristics from a parent organism to offspring, and is practically a synonym for genetics, as genes are now recognized as the carriers of biological information.

A simpler way to describe &quot;heredity&quot; is simply how traits are passed on from parent to offspring.

==2. Draw a picture of an animal cell and label the following parts: Cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, nuclear membrane, golgi bodies, ribosomes.==
[[Image:Cell_parts.png]]

==3A. What is a chromosome and where are they located?==
A chromosone is a threadlike linear strand of DNA and associated proteins in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells that carries the genes and functions in the transmission of hereditary information. Chromosomes are located in the nucleus.

==3B. What is a gene and where is it found?==
It is a segment of a chromosome responsible for a trait,it is also a piece of DNA with specific sequence which is responsible for a phenotype and any change (mutation) in the sequence results in respective change in the phenotype, and it is a sequence of DNA that contains the information for (&quot;Codes for&quot;) the construction of a protein (genotype).Genes are located on the chromosomes.

==4A. What is meant by the term &quot;allele&quot;?==
An allele is any one of a number of viable DNA codings of the same gene occupying a given position on a chromosome.  Humans have paired chromosomes in their somatic cells, and these contain two copies of each gene.  In some cases the two copies of the gene are identical — that is, have the same allele.  In other cases, the two copies are different.  Humans inherit two copies of every gene, one copy comes from the mother, and the other comes from the father.

==4B. How does a dominant allele differ from a recessive allele?==
Characteristics associated with a certain allele can sometimes be dominant or recessive, but often they are neither. A dominant trait will be expressed when at least one allele of its associated type is present, whereas a recessive trait will be expressed only when both alleles are of its associated type.

==4C. Determine which allele you have of the following genetic traits:==
[[Image:Widpeak.jpg|thumb|Widow's Peak]]
;Widow's Peak: A widow's peak is a descending V-shaped point in the middle of the hairline (above the forehead). The trait is inherited genetically and dominant. The term comes from English folklore, where it was believed that this hair formation was a sign of a woman who would outlive her husband.


[[Image:Earlobes_free_attached.jpg|thumb|Free earlobe(left) and attached earlobe (right)]]
;Free earlobe: The free earlobe is a dominant trait, and its counterpart, the attached earlobe, is recessive.  Geneticists are unsure if it is the result of a single gene or if multiple genes are involved.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

[[File:Asian girl with dimples.jpg|thumb|Dimpled cheeks]]
;Dimples: Dimples are small indentations in the cheeks most evident when a person possessing this trait smiles.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

;Curved thumb: Giving the &quot;hitchhikers thumb&quot; the end section of the thumb where the thumbnail is located is not 90 degrees straight up and down with the rest of the thumb. It points farther backwards than 90 degrees. It is a commonly dominant trait. 

;Bent pinky: Holding your hand up in front of you, palm outwards, fingers extended you will notice that your pinky finger may or may not bend towards your ring finger. 

;Digit hair: Digits refer to your fingers and toes. Dominant traits possess hair (even if it is very fine hair) on the section of the digit closest to the body or foot. Recessive traits have no hair. 

;Rolling tongue: It was once taught with certainty that the ability to roll one's tongue into the shape of a tube was a dominant trait, however; based on the research data kept by Genome Research, this may not be the case. In 1952 Matlock and again in 1975 Martin realized that identical twins are no more likely to be able to roll their tongues than are fraternal twins. From the evidence, it appears that the ability to roll one's tongue may not be a genetic trait after all.

[[Image:Mortons toe.JPG|thumb|Mortons Toe]]
;Second toe longer: Morton's toe is the common term for the second toe (second from innermost) extending further than the great toe (Hallux). Morton's toe is typically due to a lengthened second metatarsal. The Metatarsus is the five long bones of the foot. Although commonly described as a disorder, it is sufficiently common to be considered a normal variant of foot shape (around 10% of feet worldwide have this form). The main symptom experienced due to Morton's toe is discomfort and callusing of the second metatarsal head. Morton's toe is hereditary. If one of your parents has a second toe that is longer than big toe, you may have inherited your Morton’s toe from him or her.

==4D. Using a punnet square, predict the ratio of offspring produced from these monohybrid crosses: TT (tall) crossed with tt (short), Tt (tall) crossed with Tt (tall), Tt (tall) crossed with tt (short).==
A punnet square is a genetic diagram used to determine the probability of an offspring expressing a particular genotype.  An allele can be dominant or recessive.  If a dominant allele (represented as a capital letter) is present, the trait will be expressed.  The recessive trait will be expressed only of both alleles are recessive (represented as a lower case letter).   

In our example, tallness is the dominant allele and it is represented by the capital 'T'.  Shortness is the recessive allele, and it is represented as a lowercase 't' (not by an S). First we construct a table showing the alleles of the parents.  The mother (with alleles TT) is generally shown across the top, and the father (with alleles tt) is shown down the left column:

{| border=1 cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center
|-
|
| T
| T
|-
| t
|
|
|-
| t
|
|
|}

Next we copy the alleles from the mother's row and the father's column, placing the dominant allele ahead of the recessive one (so we would always show Tt rather than tT).  In this case, all four outcomes are identical: Tt.

{| border=1 cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center
|-
|
| T
| T
|-
| t
| Tt
| Tt
|-
| t
| Tt
| Tt
|}

Next we show a Tt mother and a Tt father.  In this case, the pair has produced one TT, two Tt's, and one tt.  

{| border=1 cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center
|-
| 
| T 
| t
|-
| T
| TT
| Tt
|-
| t
| Tt
| tt
|}

Finally, we show the cross between a Tt and a tt.  In this case, we get two Tt's, and one tt.
{| border=1 cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center
|-
| 
| T 
| t
|-
| t
| Tt
| tt
|-
| t
| Tt
| tt
|}

So what does all this mean?  A TT individual has two dominant alleles for tallness.  All of that individual's offspring will be tall, but all will not necessarily be TT.  A Tt individual will also be tall, but can have short offspring if crossed with either another Tt (75% tall, 25% short), or if crossed with a tt (50%-50%).  Only individuals with tt alleles will be short, but if crossed with a TT or a Tt, can still have tall offspring (though all offspring will be carriers for shortness).

==5A. What does the process of mitosis accomplish?==
[[Image:Mitosis by Elspeth.jpg|thumb|center|600px|'''Mitosis.''' Click to enlarge.]]
''Mitosis'' is the scientific term for ''cell division''.  Before mitosis begins, the cell will have already made two copies of its genetic material.  Mitosis is the separation of these two copies into two new cells.
{{clear}}

==5B. Draw a sequence of cells that shows the process of mitosis including: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.==
===Prophase===
[[Image:Prophase.jpg|right|frame|'''Prophase:''' The two round objects above the nucleus are the centrosomes. Note the condensed chromatin.]]
Normally, the genetic material in the nucleus is in a loosely bundled coil called chromatin. When prophase begins, chromatin condenses together into a highly ordered structure called a chromosome. Since the genetic material has already been duplicated earlier, the chromosomes have two sister chromatids, bound together at the centromere by a protein.  Just outside the nucleus are two centrosomes. The two centrosomes sprout ''microtubules'' (which may be thought of as cellular ropes or poles). By repulsive interaction of these microtubules with each other, the centrosomes push themselves to opposite ends of the cell.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
===Metaphase===
[[Image:Metaphase.jpg|right|frame|'''Metaphase:''' The chromosomes have aligned at the metaphase plate.]]
The nuclear envelope dissolves, the microtubules enter the nucleus, and attach to points on the chromatids.  As microtubules find and attach to these points, the centromeres of the chromosomes gather on an imaginary line called the ''metaphase plate'' that is equidistant from the two centrosome poles. This even alignment is due to the counterbalance of the pulling powers generated by the opposing kinetochores, analogous to a tug of war between equally strong people.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
===Anaphase===
[[Image:Anaphase.jpg|right|frame|'''Anaphase:''' Microtubules shorten.]]
During anaphase, two events occur in order:

#The proteins that bind sister chromatids together are split, allowing them to separate. These sister chromatids turned sister chromosomes are pulled apart because the microtubules attached to the chromosomes become shorter, pulling them toward the centrosomes to which they are attached.
#The unattached microtubules elongate, pushing the centrosomes (and the set of chromosomes to which they are attached) apart to opposite ends of the cell.

At the end of anaphase, the cell has succeeded in separating identical copies of the genetic material into two distinct populations.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
===Telophase===

Telophase is a reversal of the prophase events. It &quot;cleans up&quot; the aftereffects of mitosis. At telophase, the unattached microtubules continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. Corresponding sister chromosomes attach at opposite ends of the cell. A new nuclear envelope forms around each set of separated sister chromosomes. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclei, unfold back into chromatin.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==5C. Briefly explain how the DNA in the chromosomes is copied during this process.==
The DNA is copied during transcription with the help of enzymes. The strands unwind, are copied, then are rewound back into the double helix shape.

==6A. What does the process of meiosis accomplish and how does it differ from mitosis?==
Meiosis is employed to create gametes (sex cells), and occurs ''only'' for the creation of sex cells, not body cells. Mitosis is used for the creation of all other cells in the body.

Mitosis is the process in which a cell duplicates its chromosomes to generate two, identical cells. It is generally followed by cytokinesis which divides the cytoplasm and cell membrane. This results in two identical cells with an equal distribution of organelles and other cellular components.

A primary difference between meiosis and mitosis is that meiosis will have the haploid number of chromosomes (n) and mitosis will have the diploid number of chromosomes (2n).

==6B. Draw a sequence of cells that shows the process of meiosis including: prophase I &amp;II, metaphase I &amp;II, anaphase I &amp;II, and telophase I &amp;II.==

The Process of meiosis is actually split into two processes, meiosis I and meiosis II, each of which have a prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.  To see an illustration of meiosis, click on the diagram to enlarge.

{{clear}}

===Meiosis I===
This is the process by which a diploid cell divides into two haploid cells.  These two haploid cells still have duplicated chromosomes, however, so the two cells must enter Meiosis II following.
====Prophase I====
During Prophase I, the chromosomes cross over and the centrioles move to opposite ends of the cell and begin to form the mitotic spindle.
====Metaphase I====
The chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate, and the microtubules from each centriole grab one chromosome from each homologous pair.
====Anaphase I====
The microtubules pull the chromosome pairs apart, so that each centriole gets one chromosome from each pair.
====Telophase I====
The cell membrane constricts in order to cut off the two cells, and nuclei begin to form around the chromosomes.  &lt;u&gt;The chromosomes are still duplicated&lt;/u&gt;, so now the cells undergo Meiosis II.
===Meiosis II===
This is the process by which the two haploid cells (with duplicated chromosomes; produced during Meiosis I) split into two more cells, so that the final product of Meiosis is four haploid cells.
====Prophase II====
The centrioles duplicate again and move to opposite ends of the cells, and the spindles begin to form.
====Metaphase II====
The chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate and the spindles from the centrioles attach to each chromosome.
====Anaphase II====
The centrioles pull the chromosomes apart, much like in mitosis, and each centriole gets one half of each chromosome.
====Telophase II====
The cell membranes constrict and a nuclear membrane forms around the chromosomes.  The end result of meiosis is four cells with only one chromosome from each homologous pair.  These are called gametes.

==6C. Do the cells resulting from meiosis remain haploid?  Explain.==
Yes. Haploid cells are gametes and must remain haploid to produce viable offspring.

==7. Describe how DNA encodes the specific proteins that result in genetic traits.  Demonstrate your knowledge of this process by using diagrams or paper models.==

See [[W:protein biosynthesis|Protein Synthesis]] for more information on this.

In transcription DNA copies codes of thymine, adenine, cytosine and guanine into sequences that result in the formation of genes. An example of a sequence is AT-CG-AT-TA-TA-CG-GC-GC-AT representing base pairs of adenine/thymine and guanine cytosine.

Thymine will bond with adenine and only adenine. And cytosine will bond with guanine and only guanine.

===Demonstrate this by using diagrams or paper models.===
Ideas for doing this include using the candy &quot;dots&quot; or &quot;Mike and Ike's.&quot; You can use them with a toothpick to hold them together representing the bond and place them end to end to make a double helix around a dowel. Cytosine - red / Adenine - yellow / Thymine - orange / Guanine - green

==8. What is mutation?  Using diagrams or models created in question 7,  illustrate the effect of a mutation on the genetic trait.==

Mutation is any change in an organism's genetic material (DNA) caused by a [[w:Mutagen|mutagen]], which is any material that drives this change.

Mutation can cause changes both big and small in a gene, either by [[w:Point mutation|point mutations]] and insertion/deletion of nucleotides on the small end of the scale or by mutations that have larger effects such as the duplication of a certain gene, the [[w:Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] of a certain chromosome, or the inversion of a chromosomal segment.

Many mutations are meaningless and inneffective as there are up to four triplet codes that each code for the same amino acid, and so if one base is changed, the overall result is unchanged, and the protein will be as if the mutation never happened.  However, if multiple mutations occur on the same DNA or RNA strand, this can result in improperly built RNA which translates into improperly formed proteins and even malformed body structures and uncontrolled cell growth (cancer).  See [[W:protein biosynthesis|Protein Synthesis]] for more information on this.

A mutation is a shift in base pairs (which is the CG / AT) during transcription. It can be a deletion, subtraction or translocation.

==10. Is Biological Heredity the only factor contributing to your character, i.e., what makes you who you are?==

Biological Heredity is not the only factor contributing to your character- it is proven in studies that a personality of a person, and who they are, is determined by not only their genes, but also by their environment (way they are brought up).

As Adventists and Pathfinders we must also include our parents, our faith and by temptations and sin which can change our character.

== Introduction ==

&quot;Language is the way we interact and communicate, so, naturally, the means of communication and the conceptual background that’s behind it, which is more important, are used to try to shape attitudes and opinions and induce conformity and subordination. Not surprisingly, it was created in the more democratic societies.&quot; - Chomsky

Language is a central part of everyday life and communication a natural human necessity. For those reasons there has been a high interest in their properties. However describing the processes of language turns out to be quite hard.

We can define language as a system of communication through which we code and express our feelings, thoughts, ideas and experiences.[1]

Already Plato was concerned with the nature of language in his dialogue “Cratylus”, where he discussed first ideas about nowadays important principles of linguistics namely morphology and phonology. Gradually philosophers, natural scientists and psychologists became interested in features of language.

Since the emergence of the cognitive science in the 50's and Chomsky´s criticism on the behaviourist view, language is seen as a cognitive ability of humans, thus incorporating linguistics in other major fields like computer science and psychology. Today, psycho-linguistics is a discipline on its own and its most important topics are acquisition, production and comprehension of language.

Especially in the 20th century many studies concerning communication have been conducted, evoking new views on old facts. New techniques, like CT, MRI and fMRI or EEG, as described in Methods of Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods, made it possible to observe brain during communication processes in detail.

Later on an overview of the most popular experiments and observed effects is presented. But in order to understand those one needs to have a basic idea of semantics and syntax as well as of linguistic principles for processing words, sentences and full texts.

Finally some questions will arise: How is language affected by culture? Or in philosophical terms, the discussion about the relationship between language and thoughts has to be developed.

== Historical review on Psycholinguistics &amp; Neurolinguistics ==

Starting with philosophical approaches, the nature of the human language had ever been a topic of interest. Galileo in the 16th century saw the human language as the most important invention of humans. Later on in the 18th century the scientific study of language began by psychologists. Wilhelm Wundt (founder of the first laboratory of psychology) saw language as the mechanism by which thoughts are transformed into sentences. The observations of Wernike and Broca (see chapter 9) were milestones in the studies of language as a cognitive ability. In the early 1900s the behaviouristic view influenced the study of language very much. In 1957 B.F.Skiner published his book &quot;Verbal Behaviour&quot;, in which he proposed that learning of language can be seen as a mechanism of reinforcement. Noam Chomsky (quoted at the beginning of this chapter) published in the same year &quot;Syntactic Structures&quot;. He proposed that the ability to invent language is somehow coded in the genes. That led him to the idea that the underlying basis of language is similar across cultures. There might be some kind of universal grammar as a base, independent of what kind of language (including sign language) might be used by humans. Further on Chomsky published a review of Skinner´s &quot;Verbal Behaviour&quot; in which he presented arguments against the behaviouristic view. There are still some scientists who are convinced that it does not need a mentalist approach like Chomsky proposed, but in the meantime most agree that human language has to be seen as a cognitive ability.
[edit] Current goals of Psycholinguistics

A natural language can be analysed at a number of different levels. In linguistics we differ between phonology (sounds), morphology (words), syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (use). Linguists try to find systematic descriptions capturing the regularities inherent in the language itself. But a description of natural language just as a abstract structured system, can not be enough. Psycholinguists rather ask, how the knowledge of language is represented in the brain, and how it is used. Today's most important research topics are:

# comprehension: How humans understand spoken as well as written language, how language is processed and what interactions with memory are involved.
# speech production: Both the physical aspect of speech production, and the mental process that stands behind the uttering of a sentence.
# acquisition: How people learn to speak and understand a language.
==  Characteristic features ==

What is a language? What kinds of languages do exist? Are there characteristic features that are unique in human language?

There are plenty of approaches how to describe languages. Especially in computational linguistics researchers try to find formal definitions for different kinds of languages. But for psychology other aspects of language than its function as pure system of communication are of central interest. Language is also a tool we use for social interactions starting with the exchange of news up to the identification of social groups by their dialect. We use it for expressing our feelings, thoughts, ideas etc.

Although there are plenty ways to communicate (consider Non-Human-Language) humans expect their system of communication - the human language to be unique. But what is it that makes the human language so special and unique?

Four major criteria have been proposed by Professor Franz Schmalhofer from the University of Osnabrück as explained below:

* semanticity
* displacement
* creativity
*  structure dependency

Semanticity means the usage of symbols. Symbols can either refer to objects or to relations between objects. In the human language words are the basic form of symbols. For example the word &quot;book&quot; refers to an object made of paper on which something might be written. A relation symbol is the verb &quot;to like&quot; which refers to the sympathy of somebody to something or someone.

The criterion of displacement means that not only objects or relations at presence can be described but there are also symbols which refer to objects in another time or place. The word &quot;yesterday&quot; refers to day before and objects mentioned in a sentence with &quot;yesterday&quot; refer to objects from another time than the present one. Displacement is about the communication of events which had happened or will happen and the objects belonging to that event.

Having a range of symbols to communicate these symbols can be newly combined. Creativity is the probable most important feature. Our communication is not restricted to a fixed set of topics or predetermined messages. The combination of a finite set of symbols to an infinite number of sentences and meaning. With the infinite number of sentences the creation of novel messages is possible. How creative the human language is can be illustrated by some simple examples like the process that creates verbs from nouns. New words can be created, which do not exist so far, but we are able to understand them.

Examples:

leave the boat on the beach -&gt; beach the boat

keep the aeroplane on the ground -&gt; ground the aeroplane

write somebody an e-mail -&gt; e-mail somebody

Creative systems are also found in other aspects of language, like the way sounds are combined to form new words. i.e. prab, orgu, zabi could be imagined as names for new products.

To avoid an arbitrary combination of symbols without any regular arrangement &quot;true&quot; languages need structure dependency. Combining symbols the syntax is relevant. A change in the symbol order might have an impact on the meaning of the sentence. For example “The dog bites the cat” has obviously a different meaning than “The cat bites the dog” based on the different word arrangement of the two sentences.
[edit] Non-Human Language - Animal Communication
[edit] Forms of Communication

As mentioned before human language is just one of quite a number of communication forms. Different forms of communication can be found in the world of animals. From a little moth to a giant whale, all animals appear to have the use of communication.

Not only humans use facial expression for stressing utterances or feeling, facial expressions can be found among apes. The expression, for example &quot;smiling&quot; indicates cooperativeness and friendliness in both the human and the ape world. On the other hand an ape showing teeth indicates the willingness to fight.

Posture is a very common communicative tool among animals. Lowering the front part of the body and extending the front legs is a sign of dogs that they are playful whereas lowering the full body is a dog’s postural way to show its submissiveness. Postural communication is known in both human and non-human primates.

Besides facial expression, gesture and posture that are found in human communication, there are other communicative devices which are either just noticeable by the sub-consciousness of humans like scent or cannot be found amongst humans like light, colour and electricity. The chemicals which are used for a communicative function are called pheremones. Those pheremones are used to mark territorial or to signal its reproductive readiness. For animals scent is a very important tool which predominates their mating behaviour. Humans are influenced in their mating behaviour by scent as well but there are more factors to that behaviour so that scent is not predominating.

The insects use species-dependent light patterns to signal identity, sex and location. For example the octopus changes colour for signalling territorial defence and mating readiness. In the world of birds colour is wide spread, too. The male peacock has colourful feathering to impress female peahens as a part of mating behaviour. These ways of communication help to live in a community and survive in certain environment.
[edit] Characteristic Language Features in Animal Communication

As mentioned above it is possible to describe the uniqueness of human language by four criteria (semanticity, displacement, creativity and structural dependency) which are important devices in the human language to form a clear communication between humans. To see if these criteria exist in animal communication - i.e. if animals possess a &quot;true&quot; language - several experiments with non-human primates were performed. Non-human primates were taught American Sign Language (ASL) and a specially developed token language to detect in how far they are capable of linguistic behaviour. Can semanticity, displacement, creativity and structure dependency be found in non-human language?

Experiments

# Human language In 1948, in Orange Park, Florida, Keith and Cathy Hayes tried to teach English words to a chimpanzee named Viki. She was raised as if she were a human child. The chimpanzee was taught to &quot;speak&quot; easy English words like &quot;cup&quot;. The experiment failed since with the supralanyngal anatomy and the vocal fold structure that chimpanzees have it is impossible for them to produce human speech sounds. The failure of the Viki experiment made scientists wonder how far are non-human primates able to communicate linguistically.
# Sign language From 1965 to 1972 the first important evidence showing rudiments of linguistic behaviour was &quot;Washoe&quot;, a young female chimpanzee. The experimenters Allen and Beatrice Gardner conducted an experiment where Washoe learned 130 signs of the American Sign Language within three years. Showing pictures of a duck to Washoe and asking WHAT THAT? she combined the symbols of WATER and BIRD to create WATER BIRD as she had not learned the word DUCK (the words in capital letters refer to the signs the apes use to communicate with the experimenter).

It was claimed that Washoe was able to arbitrarily combine signs spontaneously and creatively. Some scientists criticised the ASL experiment of Washoe because they claimed that ASL is a loose communicative system and strict syntactic rules are not required. Because of this criticism different experiments were developed and performed which focus on syntactic rules and structure dependency as well as on creative symbol combination.

A non-human primate named &quot;Kanzi&quot; was trained by Savage-Rumbaugh in 1990. Kanzi was able to deal with 256 geometric symbols and understood complex instructions like GET THE ORANGE THAT IS IN THE COLONY ROOM. The experimenter worked with rewards.

A question which arose was whether these non-human primates were able to deal with human-like linguistic capacities or if they were just trained to perform a certain action to get the reward.

For more detailed explanations of the experiments see The Mind of an Ape.

Can the characteristic language features be found in non-human communication?

Creativity seems to be present in animal communication as amongst others Washoe showed with the creation of WATER BIRD for DUCK. Although some critics claimed that creativity is often accidental or like in the case of Washoe’s WATER BIRD the creation relays on the fact that water and bird were present. Just because of this presence Washoe invented the word WATER BIRD.

In the case of Kanzi a certain form of syntactic rules was observed. In 90% of Kanzi’s sentences there was first the invitation to play and then the type of game which Kanzi wanted to play like CHASE HIDE, TICKLE SLAP and GRAB SLAP. The problem which was observed was that it is not always easy to recognise the order of signs. Often facial expression and hand signs are performed at the same time. One ape signed the sentence I LIKE COKE by hugging itself for “like” and forming the sign for “coke” with its hands at the same time. Noticing an order in this sign sentence was not possible.

A certain structural dependency could be observed at Kanzi’s active and passive sentences. When Matata, a fellow chimpanzee was grabbed Kanzi signed GRAB MATATA and when Matata was performing an action such as biting Kanzi produced MATATA BITE. It has not yet been proved that symbolic behaviour is occurring. Although there are plenty evidences that creativity and displacement occur in animal communication some critics claim that these evidences can be led back to dressage and training. It was claimed that linguistic behaviour cannot be proved as it is more likely to be a training to correctly use linguistic devices. Apes show just to a little degree syntactic behaviour and they are not able to produce sentences containing embedded structures. Some linguists claim that because of such a lack of linguistic features non-human communication cannot be a “true” language. Although we do not know the capacity of an ape's mind it does not seem that the range of meanings observed in ape's wild life approach the capaciousness of semanticity of human communication. Furthermore apes seem not to care to much about displacement as it appears that they do not communicate about imaginary pasts or futures.

All in all non-human primate communication consisting of graded series of communication shows little arbitrariness. The results with non-human primates led to a controversial discussion about linguistic behaviour. Many researchers claimed that the results were influenced by dressage.

For humans language is a communication form suited to the patterns of human life. Other communication systems are better suited for fellow creatures and their mode of existence.

Now that we know that there is a difference between animal communication and human language we will see detailed features of the human language.
[edit] Language Comprehension &amp; Production
[edit] Language features – Syntax and Semantics

In this chapter the main question will be “how do we understand sentences?”. To find an answer to that problem it is necessary to have a closer look at the structure of languages. The most important properties every human language provides are rules which determine the permissible sentences and a hierarchical structure (phonemes as basic sounds, which constitute words, which in turn constitute phrases, which constitute sentences, which constitute texts). These feature of a language enable humans to create new unique sentences. The fact that all human languages have a common ground even if they developed completely independent from one another may lead to the conclusion that the ability to process language must be innate. Another evidence of a inborn universal grammar is that there were observations of deaf children who were not taught a language and developed their own form of communication which provided the same basic constituents. Two basic abilities human beings have to communicate is to interpret the syntax of a sentence and the knowledge of the meaning of single words, which in combination enables them to understand the semantic of whole sentences. Many experiments have been done to find out how the syntactical and semantical interpretation is done by human beings and how syntax and semantics works together to construct the right meaning of a sentence. Physiological experiments had been done in which for example the event-related potential (ERP) in the brain was measured as well as behavioristic experiments in which mental chronometry, the measurement of the time-course of cognitive processes, was used. Physiological experiments showed that the syntactical and the semantical interpretation of a sentence takes place separately from each other. These results will be presented below in more detail.

== Physiological Approach ==

[[File:Cpnp2.jpg|Semantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes a N400 in the ERP]]

Semantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes an N400 in the ERP The exploration of the semantic sentence processing can be done by the measurement of the event-related potential (ERP) when hearing a semantical correct sentence in comparison to a semantical incorrect sentence. For example in one experiment three reactions to sentences were compared:

Semantically correct: “The pizza was too hot to eat.” Semantically wrong: “The pizza was too hot to drink.” Semantically wrong: “The pizza was too hot to cry.”

In such experiments the ERP evoked by the correct sentence is considered to show the ordinary sentence processing. The variations in the ERP in case of the incorrect sentences in contrast to the ERP of the correct sentence show at what time the mistake is recognized. In case of semantic incorrectness there was observed a strong negative signal about 400ms after perceiving the critical word which did not occure, if the sentence was semantically correct. These effects were observed mainly in the paritial and central area. There was also found evidence that the N400 is the stronger the less the word fits semantically. The word “drink” which fits a little bit more in the context caused a weaker N400 than the word “cry”. That means the intensity of the N400 correlates with the degree of the semantic mistake. The more difficult it is to search for a semantic interpretation of a sentence the higher is the N400 response.

[[File:Cpnp4.jpg|Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence can evoce an ELAN (early left anterior negativity) in the electrodes above the left frontal lobe after 120ms.]]

To examine the syntactical aspects of the sentence processing a quite similar experiment as in the case of the semantic processing was done. There were used syntactical correct sentences and incorrect sentences, such as (correct:)“The cats won´t eat…” and (incorrect:)“The cats won´t eating…”. When hearing or reading a syntactical incorrect sentence in contrast to a syntactical correct sentence the ERP changes significantly on two different points of time. First of all there a very early increased response to syntactical incorrectness after 120ms. This signal is called the ‘early left anterior negativity’ because it occurs mainly in the left frontal lobe. This advises that the syntactical processing is located amongst others in Broca's area which is located in the left frontal lobe. The early response to syntactical mistakes also indicates that the syntactical mistakes are detected earlier than semantic mistakes.

The other change in the ERP when perceiving a syntactical wrong sentence occurs after 600ms in the paritial lobe. The signal is increasing positively and is therefore called P600. Possibly the late positive signal is reflecting the attempt to reconstruct the grammatical problematic sentence to find a possible interpretation.
File:Cpnp3001.jpg
Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence evokes after 600ms a P600 in the electrodes above the paritial lobe.

To summarize the three important ERP-components: First of all there occurs the ELAN at the left frontal lobe which shows a violation of syntactical rules. After it follows the N400 in central and paritial areas as a reaction to a semantical incorrectness and finally there occurs a P600 in the paritial area which probably means a reanalysis of the wrong sentence.

== Behavioristic Approach – Parsing a Sentence ==

Behavioristic experiments about how human beings parse a sentence often use syntactically ambiguous sentences. Because it is easier to realize that sentence-analysing mechanisms called parsing take place when using sentences in which we cannot automatically constitute the meaning of the sentence. There are two different theories about how humans parse sentences. The syntax-first approach claims that syntax plays the main part whereas semantics has only a supporting role, whereas the interactionist approach states that both syntax and semantics work together to determine the meaning of a sentence. Both theories will be explained below in more detail.

The Syntax-First Approach of Parsing The syntax-first approach concentrates on the role of syntax when parsing a sentence. That humans infer the meaning of a sentence with help of its syntactical structure (Kako and Wagner 2001) can easily be seen when considering Lewis Carroll´s poem ‘Jabberwocky’:

&quot;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.&quot;

Although most of the words in the poems have no meaning one may ascribe at least some sense to the poem because of its syntactical structure.

There are many different syntactic rules that are used when parsing a sentence. One important rule is the principle of late closure which means that a person assumes that a new word he perceives is part of the current phrase. That this principle is used for parsing sentences can be seen very good with help of a so called garden-path sentence. Experiments with garden-path sentences have been done by Frazier and Fayner 1982. One example of a garden-path sentence is: “Because he always jogs a mile seems a short distance to him.” When reading this sentence one first wants to continue the phrase “Because he always jogs” by adding “a mile” to the phrase, but when reading further one realizes that the words “a mile” are the beginning of a new phrase. This shows that we parse a sentence by trying to add new words to a phrase as long as possible. Garden-path sentences show that we use the principle of late closure as long it makes syntactically sense to add a word to the current phrase but when the sentence starts to get incorrect semantics are often used to rearrange the sentence. The syntax-first approach does not disregard semantics. According to this approach we use syntax first to parse a sentence and semantics is later on used to make sense of the sentence.

Apart from experiments which show how syntax is used for parsing sentences there were also experimens on how semantics can influence the sentence processing. One important experiment about that issue has been done by Daniel Slobin in 1966. He showed that passive sentences are understood faster if the semantics of the words allow only one subject to be the actor. Sentences like “The horse was kicked by the cow.” and “The fence was kicked by the cow.” are grammatically equal and in both cases only one syntactical parsing is possible. Nevertheless the first sentence semantically provides two subjects as possible actors and therefore it needs longer to parse this sentence. By measuring this significant difference Daniel Slobin showed that semantics play an important role in parsing a sentence, too.

== The Interactionist Approach of Parsing ==

The interactionist approach ascribes a more central role to semantics in parsing a sentence. In contrast to the syntax-first approach, the interactionist theory claims that syntax is not used first but that semantics and syntax are used simultanuasly to parse the sentence and that they work together in clearifying the meaning. There have been made several experiments which provide evidence that semantics are taking into account from the very beginning reading a sentence. Most of these experiments are working with the eye-tracking techniques and compare the time needed to read syntactical equal senences in which critical words cause or prohibit ambiguitiy by semantics. One of these experiments has been done by John Trueswell and coworkers in 1994. He measured the eye movement of persons when reading the following two sentences:

The defendant examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable. The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable.

He observed that the time needed to read the words “by the lawyer” took longer in case of the first sentence because in the first sentence the semanics first allow an interpretation in which the defendant is the one who examines, while the evidence only can be examined. This experiment shows that the semantics also play a role while reading the sentence which supports the interactionist approach and argues against the theory that semantics are only used after a sentence has been parsed syntactically.
[edit] Inferences Creates Coherence

Coherence is the semantic relation of information in different parts of a text to each other. In most cases coherence is achieved by inference; that means that a reader draws information out of a text that is not explicitly stated in this text. For further information the chapter [Neuroscience of Text Comprehension] should be considered.

==  Situation Model ==

A situation model is a mental representation of what a text is about. This approach proposes that the mental representation people form as they read a story does not indicate information about phrases, sentences, paragraphs, but a representation in terms of the people, objects, locations, events described in the story (Goldstein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;374)

For a more detailed description of situation models, see [[Situation Models]]
== Using Language ==

Conversations are dynamic interactions between two or more people (Garrod &amp;Pickering, 2004 as cited in Goldstein 2005). The important thing to mention is that conversation is more than the act of speaking. Each person brings in his or her knowledge and conversations are much easier to process if participants bring in shared knowledge. In this way, participants are responsible of how they bring in new knowledge. H.P. Grice proposed in 1975 a basic principle of conversation and four “conversational maxims.” His cooperative principle states that “the speaker and listener agree that the person speaking should strive to make statements that further the agreed goals of conversation.” The four maxims state the way of how to achieve this principle.

1. Quantity: The speaker should try to be informative, no over-/underinformation.

2. Quality: Do not say things which you believe to be false or lack evidence of.

3. Manner: Avoiding being obscure or ambiguous.

4. Relevance: Stay on topic of the exchange.

An example of a rule of conversation incorporating three of those maxims is the given-new-contract. It states that the speaker should construct sentences so that they include given and new information. (Haviland &amp; Clark, 1974 as cited in Goldstein, 2005). Consequences of not following this rule were demonstrated by Susan Haviland and Herbert Clark by presenting pairs of sentences (either following or ignoring the given-new-contract) and measuring the time participants needed until they fully understood the sentence. They found that participants needed longer in pairs of the type:

    We checked the picnic supplies. 
    The beer was warm.
 
    Rather than:
    We got some beer out of the trunk. 
    The beer was warm.

The reason that it took longer to comprehend the second sentence of the first pair is that inferencing has to be done (beer has not been mentioned as being part of the picnic supplies). (Goldstein, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;377-378)
== Language, Culture and Cognition ==

In the parts above we saw that there has been a lot of research of language, from letters through words and sentences to whole conversations. Most of the research described in the parts above was processed by English speaking researchers and the participants were English speaking as well. Can those results be generalised for all languages and cultures or might there be a difference between English speaking cultures and for example cultures with Asian or African origin?

Imagine our young man from the beginning again: Knut! Now he has to prepare a presentation with his friend Chang for the next psychology seminar. Knut arrives at his friend’s flat and enters his living-room, glad that he made it there just in time. They have been working a few minutes when Chang says: ”It has become cold in here!“ Knut remembers that he did not close the door, stands up and...”stop! What is happening here?!“

This part is concerned with culture and its connection to language. Culture, not necessarily in the sense of &quot;high culture&quot; like music, literature and arts but culture is the &quot;know-how&quot; a person must have to tackle his or her daily life. This know-how might include high culture but it is not necessary.

== Culture and Language ==

Scientists wondered in how far culture affects the way people use language. In 1991 Yum studied the indirectness of statements in Asian and American conversations. The statement &quot;Please shut the door&quot; was formulated by Americans in an indirect way. They might say something like &quot;The door is open&quot; to signal that they want to door to be shut. Even more indirect are Asian people. They often do not even mention the door but they might say something like &quot;It is somewhat cold today&quot;. Another cultural difference affecting the use of language was observed by Nisbett in 2003 in observation about the way people pose questions. When American speaker ask someone if more tea is wanted they ask something like &quot;More tea?&quot;. Different to this Asian people would ask if the other one would like more drinking as for Asians it seems obvious that tea is involved and therefore mentioning the tea would be redundant. For Americans it is the other way round. For them it seems obvious that drinking is involved so they just mention the tea.

This experiment and similar ones indicate that people belonging to Asian cultures are often relation orientated. Asians focus on relationships in groups. Contrasting, the Americans concentrate on objects. The involved object and its features are more important than the object's relation to other objects. These two different ways of focusing shows that language is affected by culture.

A experiment which clearly shows these results is the mother-child interaction which was observed by Fernald and Morikawa in 1993.They studied mother-child talk of Asian and American mothers. An American mother trying to show and explain a car to her child often repeated the object &quot;car&quot; and wants the child to repeat it as well. The mother focuses on the features of the car and labels the importance of the object itself. The Asian mother shows the toy car to her child, gives the car to the child and wants it to give the car back. The mother shortly mentions that the object is a car but concentrates on the importance of the relation and the politeness of giving back the object.

Realising that there are plenty differences in how people of different cultures use language the question arises if languages affects the way people think and perceive the world.
== What is the connection between language and cognition? ==

=== Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis ===

In the 1950s Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf proposed the hypothesis that the language of a culture affects the way people think and perceive. The controversial theory was question by Elenor Rosch who studied colour perception of Americans and Danis who are members of an stone-age agricultural culture in the Iran. Americans have several different categories for colour as for example blue, red, yellow and so on. Danis just have two main colour categories. The participants were ask to recall colours which were shown to them before. That experiment did not show significant differences in colour perception and memory as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis presumes.
File:Color-naming exp.jpg
Color-naming experiment by Roberson et al. (2000)

=== Categorical Perception ===

Nevertheless a support for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was Debi Roberson's demonstration for categorical perception based on the colour perception experiment by Rosch. The participants, a group of English-speaking British and another group of Berinmos from New Guinea were ask to name colours of a board with colour chips. The Berinmos distinguish between five different colour categories and the denotation of the colour names is not equivalent to the British colour denotation. Apart from these differences there are huge differences in the organisation of the colour categories. The colours named green and blue by British participants where categorised as nol which also covers colours like light-green, yellow-green, and dark blue. Other colour categories differ similarly.

The result of Roberson's experiment was that it is easier for British people to discriminate between green and blue whereas Berinmos have less difficulties distinguishing between Nol and Wap. The reaction to colour is affected by language, by the vocabulary we have for denoting colours. It is difficult for people to distinguish colours from the same colour category but people have less trouble differentiating between colours from different categories. Both groups have categorical colour perception but the results for naming colours depends on how the colour categories were named. All in all it was shown that categorical perception is influenced by the language use of different cultures.

These experiments about perception and its relation to cultural language usage leads to the question whether thought is related to language with is cultural differences.
== Is thought dependent on, or even caused by language? ==

=== Historical theories ===

An early approach was proposed by J.B. Watson‘s in 1913. His peripheralist approach was that thought is a tiny not noticeable speech movement. While thinking a person performs speech movements as he or she would do while talking. A couple year later, in 1921 Wittgenstein poses the theory that the limits of a person's language mean the limits of that person's world. As soon as a person is not able to express a certain content because of a lack of vocabulary that person is not able to think about those contents as they are outside of his or her world. Wittgenstein's theory was doubted by some experiments with babies and deaf people.

=== Present research ===

To find some evidence for the theory that language and culture is affecting cognition Lian-hwang Chiu designed an experiment with American and Asian children. The children were asked to group objects in pairs so that these objects fit together. On picture that was shown to the children there was a cow, a chicken and some grass. The children had to decided which of the two objects fitted together. The American children mostly grouped cow and chicken because of group of animals they belong to. Asian children more often combined the cow with the grass as there is the relation of the cow normally eating grass.

In 2000 Chui repeated the experiment with words instead of pictures. A similar result was observed. The American children sorted their pairs taxonomically. Given the words &quot;panda&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot; and &quot;banana&quot; American children paired &quot;panda&quot; and monkey&quot;. Chinese children grouped relationally. They put &quot;monkey&quot; with &quot;banana&quot;. Another variation of this experiment was done with bilingual children. When the task was given in English to the children they grouped the objects taxonomically. A Chinese task caused a relational grouping. The language of the task clearly influenced on how to group the objects. That means language may affects the way people think.

The results of plenty experiments regarding the relation between language, culture and cognition let assume that culture affects language and cognition is affected by language.Our way of thinking is influenced by the way we talk and thought can occur without language but the exact relation between language and thought remains to be determined.

== Introduction ==
''&quot;Language is the way we interact and communicate, so, naturally, the means of communication and the conceptual background that’s behind it, which is more important, are used to try to shape attitudes and opinions and induce conformity and subordination. Not surprisingly, it was created in the more democratic societies.&quot;'' - Chomsky

Language is a central part of everyday life and communication a natural human necessity. For those reasons there has been a high interest in their properties.
However describing the processes of language turns out to be quite hard.

We can define language as a system of communication through which we code and express our feelings, thoughts, ideas and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Goldstein, &quot;Cognitive Psychology - Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience&quot; (2005), page 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Already Plato was concerned with the nature of language in his dialogue “Cratylus”, where he discussed first ideas about nowadays important principles of linguistics namely morphology and phonology.
Gradually philosophers, natural scientists and psychologists became interested in features of language.
 
Since the emergence of the cognitive science in the 50's and Chomsky´s criticism on the behaviourist view, language is seen as a cognitive ability of humans, thus incorporating linguistics in other major fields like computer science and psychology. Today, psycho-linguistics is a discipline on its own and its most important topics are acquisition, production and comprehension of language.

Especially in the 20th century many studies concerning communication have been conducted, evoking new views on old facts. New techniques, like CT, MRI and fMRI or EEG, as described in 
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Behavioural_and_Neuroscience_Methods Methods of Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods], made it possible to observe brain during communication processes in detail. 

Later on an overview of the most popular experiments and observed effects is presented. But in order to understand those one needs to have a basic idea of semantics and syntax as well as of linguistic principles for processing words, sentences and full texts. 

Finally some questions will arise: How is language affected by culture? Or in philosophical terms, the discussion about the relationship between language and thoughts has to be developed.

== Language as a cognitive ability ==
=== Historical review on Psycholinguistics &amp; Neurolinguistics ===
Starting with philosophical approaches, the nature of the human language had ever been a topic of interest. Galileo in the 16th century saw the human language as the most important invention of humans. Later on in the 18th century the '''scientific''' study of language began by psychologists. Wilhelm Wundt (founder of the first laboratory of psychology) saw language as the mechanism by which thoughts are transformed into sentences. The observations of Wernike and Broca (see chapter 9) were milestones in the studies of language as a cognitive ability. In the early 1900s the behaviouristic view influenced the study of language very much. In 1957 B.F.Skiner published his book &quot;Verbal Behaviour&quot;, in which he proposed that learning of language can be seen as a mechanism of reinforcement. Noam Chomsky (quoted at the beginning of this chapter) published in the same year &quot;Syntactic Structures&quot;. He proposed that the ability to invent language is somehow coded in the genes. That led him to the idea that the underlying basis of language is similar across cultures. There might be some kind of universal grammar as a base, independent of what kind of language (including sign language) might be used by humans. Further on Chomsky published a review of Skinner´s &quot;Verbal Behaviour&quot; in which he presented arguments against the behaviouristic view. There are still some scientists who are convinced that it does not need a mentalist approach like Chomsky proposed, but in the meantime most agree that human language has to be seen as a cognitive ability.

=== Current goals of Psycholinguistics ===
A natural language can be analysed at a number of different levels. In linguistics we differ between phonology (sounds), morphology (words), syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (use). Linguists try to find systematic descriptions capturing the regularities inherent in the language itself. But a description of natural language just as a abstract structured system, can not be enough. Psycholinguists rather ask, how the knowledge of language is represented in the brain, and how it is used. Today's most important research topics are:

1) comprehension: How humans understand spoken as well as written language, how language is processed and what interactions with memory are involved.

2) speech production: Both the physical aspect of speech production, and the mental process that stands behind the uttering of a sentence.

3) acquisition: How people learn to speak and understand a language.

=== Characteristic features ===

What is a language? What kinds of languages do exist? Are there characteristic features that are unique in human language?

There are plenty of approaches how to describe languages. Especially in computational linguistics researchers try to find formal definitions for different kinds of languages. But for psychology other aspects of language than its function as pure system of communication are of central interest. Language is also a tool we use for social interactions starting with the exchange of news up to the identification of social groups by their dialect. We use it for expressing our feelings, thoughts, ideas etc.

Although there are plenty ways to communicate (consider Non-Human-Language) humans expect their system of communication - the human language to be unique. But what is it that makes the human language so special and unique?

Four major criteria have been proposed by Professor Franz Schmalhofer from the University of Osnabrück as explained below: 

-semanticity

-displacement

-creativity

-structure dependency

'''Semanticity''' means the usage of symbols. Symbols can either refer to objects or to relations between objects. In the human language words are the basic form of symbols. For example the word &quot;book&quot; refers to an object made of paper on which something might be written. A relation symbol is the verb &quot;to like&quot; which refers to the sympathy of somebody to something or someone.
 
The criterion of '''displacement''' means that not only objects or relations at presence can be described but there are also symbols which refer to objects in another time or place. The word &quot;yesterday&quot; refers to day before and objects mentioned in a sentence with &quot;yesterday&quot; refer to objects from another time than the present one. Displacement is about the communication of events which had happened or will happen and the objects belonging to that event.

Having a range of symbols to communicate these symbols can be newly combined. '''Creativity''' is the probable most important feature. Our communication is not restricted to a fixed set of topics or predetermined messages. The combination of a finite set of symbols to an infinite number of sentences and meaning. With the infinite number of sentences the creation of novel messages is possible. How creative the human language is can be illustrated by some simple examples like the process that creates verbs from nouns. New words can be created, which do not exist so far, but we are able to understand them.

Examples:

leave the boat on the beach -&gt; beach the boat

keep the aeroplane on the ground -&gt; ground the aeroplane

write somebody an e-mail -&gt; e-mail somebody

Creative systems are also found in other aspects of language, like the way sounds are combined to form new words. i.e. prab, orgu, zabi could be imagined as names for new products. 

To avoid an arbitrary combination of symbols without any regular arrangement &quot;true&quot; languages need '''structure dependency'''. Combining symbols the syntax is relevant. A change in the symbol order might have an impact on the meaning of the sentence. For example “The dog bites the cat” has obviously a different meaning than “The cat bites the dog” based on the different word arrangement of the two sentences.

== Non-Human Language - Animal Communication ==
=== Forms of Communication ===

As mentioned before human language is just one of quite a number of communication forms. Different forms of communication can be found in the world of animals. From a little moth to a giant whale, all animals appear to have the use of communication.

Not only humans use facial expression for stressing utterances or feeling, facial expressions can be found among apes. The expression, for example &quot;smiling&quot; indicates cooperativeness and friendliness in both the human and the ape world. On the other hand an ape showing teeth indicates the willingness to fight.

Posture is a very common communicative tool among animals. Lowering the front part of the body and extending the front legs is a sign of dogs that they are playful whereas lowering the full body is a dog’s postural way to show its submissiveness. Postural communication is known in both human and non-human primates.

Besides facial expression, gesture and posture that are found in human communication, there are other communicative devices which are either just noticeable by the sub-consciousness of humans like scent or cannot be found amongst humans like light, colour and electricity. The chemicals which are used for a communicative function are called pheremones. Those pheremones are used to mark territorial or to signal its reproductive readiness. For animals scent is a very important tool which predominates their mating behaviour. Humans are influenced in their mating behaviour by scent as well but there are more factors to that behaviour so that scent is not predominating.

The insects use species-dependent light patterns to signal identity, sex and location. For example the octopus changes colour for signalling territorial defence and mating readiness. In the world of birds colour is wide spread, too. The male peacock has colourful feathering to impress female peahens as a part of mating behaviour. These ways of communication help to live in a community and survive in certain environment. 

=== Characteristic Language Features in Animal Communication ===

As mentioned above it is possible to describe the uniqueness of human language by four criteria
(semanticity, displacement, creativity and structural dependency) which are important devices in the human language to form a clear communication between humans. To see if these criteria exist in animal communication - i.e. if animals possess a &quot;true&quot; language - several experiments with non-human primates were performed. Non-human primates were taught American Sign Language (ASL) and a specially developed token language to detect in how far they are capable of linguistic behaviour. Can semanticity, displacement, creativity and structure dependency be found in non-human language?

'''Experiments'''

'''1. Human language'''
In 1948, in Orange Park, Florida, Keith and Cathy Hayes tried to teach English words to a chimpanzee named Viki. She was raised as if she were a human child. The chimpanzee was taught to &quot;speak&quot; easy English words like &quot;cup&quot;. The experiment failed since with the supralanyngal anatomy and the vocal fold structure that chimpanzees have it is impossible for them to produce human speech sounds. The failure of the Viki experiment made scientists wonder how far are non-human primates able to communicate linguistically.

'''2. Sign language'''
From 1965 to 1972 the first important evidence showing rudiments of linguistic behaviour was &quot;Washoe&quot;, a young female chimpanzee. The experimenters Allen and Beatrice Gardner conducted an experiment where Washoe learned 130 signs of the American Sign Language within three years. Showing pictures of a duck to Washoe and asking WHAT THAT? she combined the symbols of WATER and BIRD to create WATER BIRD as she had not learned the word DUCK (the words in capital letters refer to the signs the apes use to communicate with the experimenter).

It was claimed that Washoe was able to arbitrarily combine signs spontaneously and creatively. Some scientists criticised the ASL experiment of Washoe because they claimed that ASL is a loose communicative system and strict syntactic rules are not required. Because of this criticism different experiments were developed and performed which focus on syntactic rules and structure dependency as well as on creative symbol combination.

A non-human primate named &quot;Kanzi&quot; was trained by Savage-Rumbaugh in 1990. Kanzi was able to deal with 256 geometric symbols and understood complex instructions like GET THE ORANGE THAT IS IN THE COLONY ROOM. The experimenter worked with rewards. 

A question which arose was whether these non-human primates were able to deal with human-like linguistic capacities or if they were just trained to perform a certain action to get the reward. 

For more detailed explanations of the experiments see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_of_an_ape The Mind of an Ape].

'''Can the characteristic language features be found in non-human communication?''' 

Creativity seems to be present in animal communication as amongst others Washoe showed with the creation of WATER BIRD for DUCK. Although some critics claimed that creativity is often accidental or like in the case of Washoe’s WATER BIRD the creation relays on the fact that water and bird were present. Just because of this presence Washoe invented the word WATER BIRD.
 
In the case of Kanzi a certain form of syntactic rules was observed. In 90% of Kanzi’s sentences there was first the invitation to play and then the type of game which Kanzi wanted to play like CHASE HIDE, TICKLE SLAP and GRAB SLAP. The problem which was observed was that it is not always easy to recognise the order of signs. Often facial expression and hand signs are performed at the same time. One ape signed the sentence I LIKE COKE by hugging itself for “like” and forming the sign for “coke” with its hands at the same time. Noticing an order in this sign sentence was not possible.

A certain structural dependency could be observed at Kanzi’s active and passive sentences. When Matata, a fellow chimpanzee was grabbed Kanzi signed GRAB MATATA and when Matata was performing an action such as biting Kanzi produced MATATA BITE. It has not yet been proved that symbolic behaviour is occurring. Although there are plenty evidences that creativity and displacement occur in animal communication some critics claim that these evidences can be led back to dressage and training. It was claimed that linguistic behaviour cannot be proved as it is more likely to be a training to correctly use linguistic devices. Apes show just to a little degree syntactic behaviour and they are not able to produce sentences containing embedded structures. Some linguists claim that because of such a lack of linguistic features non-human communication cannot be a “true” language. Although we do not know the capacity of an ape's mind it does not seem that the range of meanings observed in ape's wild life approach the capaciousness of semanticity of human communication. Furthermore apes seem not to care to much about displacement as it appears that they do not communicate about imaginary pasts or futures.

All in all non-human primate communication consisting of graded series of communication shows little arbitrariness. The results with non-human primates led to a controversial discussion about linguistic behaviour. Many researchers claimed that the results were influenced by dressage. 

For humans language is a communication form suited to the patterns of human life. Other communication systems are better suited for fellow creatures and their mode of existence.

Now that we know that there is a difference between animal communication and human language we will see detailed features of the human language.

== Language Comprehension &amp; Production ==
=== Language features – Syntax and Semantics ===

In this chapter the main question will be “how do we understand sentences?”. To find an answer to that problem it is necessary to have a closer look at the structure of languages. The most important properties every human language provides are rules which determine the permissible sentences and a hierarchical structure (phonemes as basic sounds, which constitute words, which in turn constitute phrases, which constitute sentences, which constitute texts). These feature of a language enable humans to create new unique sentences. 
The fact that all human languages have a common ground even if they developed completely independent from one another may lead to the conclusion that the ability to process language must be innate. Another evidence of a inborn universal grammar is that there were observations of deaf children who were not taught a language and developed their own form of communication which provided the same basic constituents. 
Two basic abilities human beings have to communicate is to interpret the syntax of a sentence and the knowledge of the meaning of single words, which in combination enables them to understand the semantic of whole sentences. Many experiments have been done to find out how the syntactical and semantical interpretation is done by human beings and how syntax and semantics works together to construct the right meaning of a sentence. Physiological experiments had been done in which for example the event-related potential (ERP) in the brain was measured as well as behavioristic experiments in which mental chronometry, the measurement of the time-course of cognitive processes, was used. Physiological experiments showed that the syntactical and the semantical interpretation of a sentence takes place separately from each other. These results will be presented below in more detail.

'''Physiological Approach'''

'''Semantics'''
[[File:cpnp2.jpg|thumbnail|Semantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes a N400 in the ERP]]
Semantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes an N400 in the ERP
The exploration of the semantic sentence processing can be done by the measurement of the event-related potential (ERP) when hearing a semantical correct sentence in comparison to a semantical incorrect sentence. For example in one experiment three reactions to sentences were compared:

Semantically correct: “The pizza was too hot to eat.” 
Semantically wrong: “The pizza was too hot to drink.” 
Semantically wrong: “The pizza was too hot to cry.”

In such experiments the ERP evoked by the correct sentence is considered to show the ordinary sentence processing. The variations in the ERP in case of the incorrect sentences in contrast to the ERP of the correct sentence show at what time the mistake is recognized. In case of semantic incorrectness there was observed a strong negative signal about 400ms after perceiving the critical word which did not occure, if the sentence was semantically correct. These effects were observed mainly in the paritial and central area. There was also found evidence that the N400 is the stronger the less the word fits semantically. The word “drink” which fits a little bit more in the context caused a weaker N400 than the word “cry”. That means the intensity of the N400 correlates with the degree of the semantic mistake. The more difficult it is to search for a semantic interpretation of a sentence the higher is the N400 response.

'''Syntax'''
[[Image:cpnp4.jpg|thumbnail|
Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence can evoce an ELAN (early left anterior negativity) in the electrodes above the left frontal lobe after 120ms.]]

To examine the syntactical aspects of the sentence processing a quite similar experiment as in the case of the semantic processing was done. There were used syntactical correct sentences and incorrect sentences, such as (correct:)“The cats won´t eat…” and (incorrect:)“The cats won´t eating…”. When hearing or reading a syntactical incorrect sentence in contrast to a syntactical correct sentence the ERP changes significantly on two different points of time. First of all there a very early increased response to syntactical incorrectness after 120ms. This signal is called the ‘early left anterior negativity’ because it occurs mainly in the left frontal lobe. This advises that the syntactical processing is located amongst others in Broca's area which is located in the left frontal lobe. The early response to syntactical mistakes also indicates that the syntactical mistakes are detected earlier than semantic mistakes.

The other change in the ERP when perceiving a syntactical wrong sentence occurs after 600ms in the paritial lobe. The signal is increasing positively and is therefore called P600. Possibly the late positive signal is reflecting the attempt to reconstruct the grammatical problematic sentence to find a possible interpretation.

[[Image:cpnp3001.jpg|thumbnail|
Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence evokes after 600ms 
a P600 in the electrodes above the paritial lobe.]]

To summarize the three important ERP-components: First of all there occurs the ELAN at the left frontal lobe which shows a violation of syntactical rules. After it follows the N400 in central and paritial areas as a reaction to a semantical incorrectness and finally there occurs a P600 in the paritial area which probably means a reanalysis of the wrong sentence.

'''Behavioristic Approach – Parsing a Sentence'''

Behavioristic experiments about how human beings parse a sentence often use syntactically ambiguous sentences. Because it is easier to realize that sentence-analysing mechanisms called parsing take place when using sentences in which we cannot automatically constitute the meaning of the sentence. There are two different theories about how humans parse sentences. 
The syntax-first approach claims that syntax plays the main part whereas semantics has only a supporting role, whereas the interactionist approach states that both syntax and semantics work together to determine the meaning of a sentence. Both theories will be explained below in more detail.

'''The Syntax-First Approach of Parsing'''
The syntax-first approach concentrates on the role of syntax when parsing a sentence. That humans infer the meaning of a sentence with help of its syntactical structure (Kako and Wagner 2001) can easily be seen when considering Lewis Carroll´s poem ‘Jabberwocky’:

&quot;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.&quot;

Although most of the words in the poems have no meaning one may ascribe at least some sense to the poem because of its syntactical structure.

There are many different syntactic rules that are used when parsing a sentence. One important rule is the principle of late closure which means that a person assumes that a new word he perceives is part of the current phrase. That this principle is used for parsing sentences can be seen very good with help of a so called garden-path sentence. Experiments with garden-path sentences have been done by Frazier and Fayner 1982. One example of a garden-path sentence is: “Because he always jogs a mile seems a short distance to him.” When reading this sentence one first wants to continue the phrase “Because he always jogs” by adding “a mile” to the phrase, but when reading further one realizes that the words “a mile” are the beginning of a new phrase. This shows that we parse a sentence by trying to add new words to a phrase as long as possible. Garden-path sentences show that we use the principle of late closure as long it makes syntactically sense to add a word to the current phrase but when the sentence starts to get incorrect semantics are often used to rearrange the sentence. The syntax-first approach does not disregard semantics. According to this approach we use syntax first to parse a sentence and semantics is later on used to make sense of the sentence.

Apart from experiments which show how syntax is used for parsing sentences there were also experimens on how semantics can influence the sentence processing. One important experiment about that issue has been done by Daniel Slobin in 1966. He showed that passive sentences are understood faster if the semantics of the words allow only one subject to be the actor. Sentences like “The horse was kicked by the cow.” and “The fence was kicked by the cow.” are grammatically equal and in both cases only one syntactical parsing is possible. Nevertheless the first sentence semantically provides two subjects as possible actors and therefore it needs longer to parse this sentence. By measuring this significant difference Daniel Slobin showed that semantics play an important role in parsing a sentence, too.

'''The Interactionist Approach of Parsing'''

The interactionist approach ascribes a more central role to semantics in parsing a sentence. In contrast to the syntax-first approach, the interactionist theory claims that syntax is not used first but that semantics and syntax are used simultanuasly to parse the sentence and that they work together in clearifying the meaning. There have been made several experiments which provide evidence that semantics are taking into account from the very beginning reading a sentence. Most of these experiments are working with the eye-tracking techniques and compare the time needed to read syntactical equal senences in which critical words cause or prohibit ambiguitiy by semantics. One of these experiments has been done by John Trueswell and coworkers in 1994. He measured the eye movement of persons when reading the following two sentences:

The defendant examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable. The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable.

He observed that the time needed to read the words “by the lawyer” took longer in case of the first sentence because in the first sentence the semanics first allow an interpretation in which the defendant is the one who examines, while the evidence only can be examined. This experiment shows that the semantics also play a role while reading the sentence which supports the interactionist approach and argues against the theory that semantics are only used after a sentence has been parsed syntactically.

=== Inferences Creates Coherence ===
Coherence is the semantic relation of information in different parts of a text to each other. In most cases coherence is achieved by inference; that means that a reader draws information out of a text that is not explicitly stated in this text. For further information the chapter [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Situation Models and Inferencing#Neuropsychology of Inferencing Neuroscience of Text Comprehension] should be considered.

=== Situation Model ===
A situation model is a mental representation of what a text is about. This approach proposes that the mental representation people form as they read a story does not indicate information about phrases, sentences, paragraphs, but a representation in terms of the people, objects, locations, events described in the story (Goldstein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;374)

For a more detailed description of situation models, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Situation Models and Inferencing Situation Models]

== Using Language ==
Conversations are dynamic interactions between two or more people (Garrod &amp;Pickering, 2004 as cited in Goldstein 2005). The important thing to mention is that conversation is more than the act of speaking. Each person brings in his or her knowledge and conversations are much easier to process if participants bring in shared knowledge. In this way, participants are responsible of how they bring in new knowledge.
H.P. Grice proposed in 1975 a basic principle of conversation and four “conversational maxims.” His cooperative principle states that “the speaker and listener agree that the person speaking should strive to make statements that further the agreed goals of conversation.” The four maxims state the way of how to achieve this principle.

1. '''Quantity''': The speaker should try to be informative, no over-/underinformation.

2. '''Quality''': Do not say things which you believe to be false or lack evidence of.

3. '''Manner''': Avoiding being obscure or ambiguous.

4. '''Relevance''': Stay on topic of the exchange.

An example of a rule of conversation incorporating three of those maxims is the given-new-contract. It states that the speaker should construct sentences so that they include given and new information. (Haviland &amp; Clark, 1974 as cited in Goldstein, 2005). Consequences of not following this rule were demonstrated by Susan Haviland and Herbert Clark by presenting pairs of sentences (either following or ignoring the given-new-contract) and measuring the time participants needed until they fully understood the sentence. They found that participants needed longer in pairs of the type:

     We checked the picnic supplies. 
     The beer was warm.

     Rather than:
     We got some beer out of the trunk. 
     The beer was warm.

The reason that it took longer to comprehend the second sentence of the first pair is that inferencing has to be done (beer has not been mentioned as being part of the picnic supplies). (Goldstein, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;377-378)

== Language, Culture and Cognition ==

In the parts above we saw that there has been a lot of research of language, from letters through words and sentences to whole conversations. Most of the research described in the parts above was processed by English speaking researchers and the participants were English speaking as well. Can those results be generalised for all languages and cultures or might there be a difference between English speaking cultures and for example cultures with Asian or African origin?

Imagine our young man from the beginning again: Knut! Now he has to prepare a presentation with his friend Chang for the next psychology seminar. Knut arrives at his friend’s flat and enters his living-room, glad that he made it there just in time. They have been working a few minutes when Chang says: ”It has become cold in here!“ Knut remembers that he did not close the door, stands up and...”stop! What is happening here?!“

This part is concerned with culture and its connection to language. Culture, not necessarily in the sense of &quot;high culture&quot; like music, literature and arts but culture is the &quot;know-how&quot; a person must have to tackle his or her daily life. This know-how might include high culture but it is not necessary.

'''Culture and Language'''

Scientists wondered in how far culture affects the way people use language. In 1991 Yum studied the indirectness of statements in Asian and American conversations. The statement &quot;Please shut the door&quot; was formulated by Americans in an indirect way. They might say something like &quot;The door is open&quot; to signal that they want to door to be shut. Even more indirect are Asian people. They often do not even mention the door but they might say something like &quot;It is somewhat cold today&quot;. Another cultural difference affecting the use of language was observed by Nisbett in 2003 in observation about the way people pose questions. When American speaker ask someone if more tea is wanted they ask something like &quot;More tea?&quot;. Different to this Asian people would ask if the other one would like more drinking as for Asians it seems obvious that tea is involved and therefore mentioning the tea would be redundant. For Americans it is the other way round. For them it seems obvious that drinking is involved so they just mention the tea.

This experiment and similar ones indicate that people belonging to Asian cultures are often relation orientated. Asians focus on relationships in groups. Contrasting, the Americans concentrate on objects. The involved object and its features are more important than the object's relation to other objects. These two different ways of focusing shows that language is affected by culture.

A experiment which clearly shows these results is the mother-child interaction which was observed by Fernald and Morikawa in 1993.They studied mother-child talk of Asian and American mothers. An American mother trying to show and explain a car to her child often repeated the object &quot;car&quot; and wants the child to repeat it as well. The mother focuses on the features of the car and labels the importance of the object itself. The Asian mother shows the toy car to her child, gives the car to the child and wants it to give the car back. The mother shortly mentions that the object is a car but concentrates on the importance of the relation and the politeness of giving back the object.

Realising that there are plenty differences in how people of different cultures use language the question arises if languages affects the way people think and perceive the world.

=== What is the connection between language and cognition? ===

'''Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis'''

In the 1950s Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf proposed the hypothesis that the language of a culture affects the way people think and perceive. The controversial theory was question by Elenor Rosch who studied colour perception of Americans and Danis who are members of an stone-age agricultural culture in the Iran. Americans have several different categories for colour as for example blue, red, yellow and so on. Danis just have two main colour categories. The participants were ask to recall colours which were shown to them before. That experiment did not show significant differences in colour perception and memory as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis presumes. 

[[File:Color-naming exp.jpg|thumbnail|Color-naming experiment by Roberson et al. (2000)]]
'''Categorical Perception'''

Nevertheless a support for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was Debi Roberson's demonstration for ''categorical perception'' based on the colour perception experiment by Rosch. The participants, a group of English-speaking British and another group of Berinmos from New Guinea were ask to name colours of a board with colour chips. The Berinmos distinguish between five different colour categories and the denotation of the colour names is not equivalent to the British colour denotation. Apart from these differences there are huge differences in the organisation of the colour categories. The colours named ''green'' and ''blue'' by British participants where categorised as nol which also covers colours like ''light-green'', ''yellow-green'', and ''dark blue''. Other colour categories differ similarly.

The result of Roberson's experiment was that it is easier for British people to discriminate between green and blue whereas Berinmos have less difficulties distinguishing between Nol and Wap. The reaction to colour is affected by language, by the vocabulary we have for denoting colours. It is difficult for people to distinguish colours from the same colour category but people have less trouble differentiating between colours from different categories. Both groups have categorical colour perception but the results for naming colours depends on how the colour categories were named. All in all it was shown that categorical perception is influenced by the language use of different cultures.

These experiments about perception and its relation to cultural language usage leads to the question whether thought is related to language with is cultural differences.

=== Is thought dependent on, or even caused by language? ===
''' Historical theories'''

An early approach was proposed by J.B. Watson‘s in 1913. His peripheralist approach was that thought is a tiny not noticeable speech movement. While thinking a person performs speech movements as he or she would do while talking. A couple year later, in 1921 Wittgenstein poses the theory that the limits of a person's language mean the limits of that person's world. As soon as a person is not able to express a certain content because of a lack of vocabulary that person is not able to think about those contents as they are outside of his or her world. Wittgenstein's theory was doubted by some experiments with babies and deaf people.

'''Present research'''

To find some evidence for the theory that language and culture is affecting cognition Lian-hwang Chiu designed an experiment with American and Asian children. The children were asked to group objects in pairs so that these objects fit together. On picture that was shown to the children there was a cow, a chicken and some grass. The children had to decided which of the two objects fitted together. The American children mostly grouped cow and chicken because of group of animals they belong to. Asian children more often combined the cow with the grass as there is the relation of the cow normally eating grass.

In 2000 Chui repeated the experiment with words instead of pictures. A similar result was observed. The American children sorted their pairs taxonomically. Given the words &quot;panda&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot; and &quot;banana&quot; American children paired &quot;panda&quot; and monkey&quot;. Chinese children grouped relationally. They put &quot;monkey&quot; with &quot;banana&quot;. Another variation of this experiment was done with bilingual children. When the task was given in English to the children they grouped the objects taxonomically. A Chinese task caused a relational grouping. The language of the task clearly influenced on how to group the objects. That means language may affects the way people think.

The results of plenty experiments regarding the relation between language, culture and cognition let assume that culture affects language and cognition is affected by language.''Our way of thinking is influenced by the way we talk and thought can occur without language but the exact relation between language and thought remains to be determined.''

      <comment>/* Logic gates with more than 2 inputs */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Digital Circuits Page}}

Logic gates are one of the fundamental units of a digital circuit. They can be made from only a handful of transitors each, and they can implement any logical function, and therefore build any digital device. At the most basic level, all digital circuits are combination of logic gates.

==Logic Gates==

AND, OR and NOT gates are the fundamental functions, out of which the other functions are built. The other functions available are
*NAND: an inversion of AND's output.
*NOR: an inversion of OR's output.
*XOR (exclusive-OR): outputs high only if just one input is high.
*XNOR: inversion of the output of XOR.

In total then, we have seven basic gates. Although there are sixteen possible outputs from two input logic gates, the other functions not represented here are usually made up of these seven. This idea can even be extended further - NOR or NAND are each capable of producing all the other functions and are sometimes called the &quot;universal gates&quot; (see [[../NOR Logic/]] and [[../NAND Logic/]] for more information). At the transistor level, many devices consist only of one of these gates. That said, by using the other gates, we make conceptualising and designing digital circuits much easier, and loses no generality, as the conversion to the relevant type of gate will be done by automatic tools if needed.

Only the NOT gate and the buffer (which just copies the input to the output) have one input. The other basic gates have two inputs, although we will later look at how to extend the concept to more inputs.

==Logic gates with more than 2 inputs==

We can seperate and make a group of 2 and work on it.
for eg:

Y=A+B+C then
Y is also equal to X+C where X=A+B.

== Half Adder ==

Consider adding two binary numbers together:
[[File:Binary Addition.svg|center]]

We see that the bit in the &quot;two's&quot; column is generated when the addition carried over. A half-adder is a circuit which adds two bits together and outputs the sum of those two bits. The half-adder has two outputs: '''sum''' and '''carry'''. Sum represents the remainder of the integer division A+B/2, while carry is the result. This can be expressed as follows:
:*&lt;math&gt;\mbox{S} = A \oplus B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C} = AB\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Full Adder ==

Half-adders have a major limitation in that they cannot accept a carry bit from a previous stage, meaning that they cannot be chained together to add multi-bit numbers. However, the two output bits of a half-adder can also represent the result A+B=3 as sum and carry both being high.

As such, the full-adder can accept three bits as an input. Commonly, one bit is referred to as the carry-in bit. Full adders can be cascaded to produce adders of any number of bits by daisy-chaining the carry of one output to the input of the next.

The full-adder is usually shown as a single unit. The sum output is usually on the bottom on the block, and the carry-out output is on the left, so the devices can be chained together, most significant bit leftmost:

[[File:Full Adder Block.svg|center]]

== Ripple-Carry Adder ==

A ripple carry adder is simply several full adders connected in a series so that the carry must propagate through every full adder before the addition is complete. Ripple carry adders require the least amount of hardware of all adders, but they are the slowest.

The following diagram shows a four-bit adder, which adds the numbers A[3:0] and B[3:0], as well as a carry input, together to produce S[3:0] and the carry output.

[[File:4-Bit Ripple Adder.svg|center]]

===Propagation Delay in Full Adders===
[[File:Full-Adder Propagation Delay.svg|right]]
Real logic gates do not react instantaneously to the inputs, and therefore digital circuits have a maximum speed. Usually, the delay through a digital circuit is measured in gate-delays, as this allows the delay of a design to be calculated for different devices. AND and OR gates have a nominal delay of 1 gate-delay, and XOR gates have a delay of 2, because they are really made up of a combination of ANDs and ORs.

A full adder block has the following worst case propagation delays:
*From ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or ''B''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;: 4 gate-delays (XOR → AND → OR)
*From ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or ''B''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: 4 gate-delays (XOR → XOR)
*From ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;: 2 gate-delays (AND → OR)
*From ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: 2 gate-delays (XOR)

Because the carry-out of one stage is the next's input, the worst case propagation delay is then:
*4 gate-delays from generating the first carry signal (''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).
*2 gate-delays per intermediate stage (''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; → ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;).
*2 gate-delays at the last stage to produce both the sum and carry-out outputs (''C''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''C''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;).

So for an ''n''-bit adder, we have a total propagation delay, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of:
:&lt;math&gt;t_{p} = 4+2(n-2)+2 = 2n+2&lt;/math&gt;
This is linear in ''n'', and for a 32-bit number, would take 66 cycles to complete the calculation. This is rather slow, and restricts the word length in our device somewhat. We would like to find ways to speed it up.

== Carry-Lookahead Adder ==

A fast method of adding numbers is called carry-lookahead. This method doesn't require the carry signal to propagate stage by stage, causing a bottleneck. Instead it uses additional logic to expedite the propagation and generation of carry information, allowing fast addition at the expense of more hardware.

In a ripple adder, each stage compares the carry-in signal, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, with the inputs ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and generates a carry-out signal ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; accordingly. In a carry-lookahead adder, we define two new functions.

The generate function, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, indicates whether that stage causes a carry-out signal ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to be generated if no carry-in signal exists. This occurs if both the addends contain a 1 in that bit:
::&lt;math&gt;G_i = A_i \cdot B_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

The propagate function, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, indicates whether a carry-in to the stage is passed to the carry-out for the stage. This occurs if either the addends have a 1 in that bit:
::&lt;math&gt;P_i = A_i + B_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that both these values can be calculated from the inputs in a constant time of a single gate delay. Now, the carry-out from a stage occurs if that stage generates a carry (''G''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1) or there is a carry-in and the stage propagates the carry (''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;·''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1):

::&lt;math&gt;C_{i+1} = A_iB_i + A_i C_i + B_i C_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C_{i+1} = A_iB_i + (A_i + B_i)C_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C_{i+1} = G_i + P_i C_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

The table below summaries this:

We can extend the expression for the carry-out by substituting the expression for the carry-out of the previous stage:

::&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1} = G_i + P_i c_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1} = G_i + P_i \left(  G_{i-1} + P_{i-1} c_{i-1} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1} = G_i + P_iG_{i-1} + P_i P_{i-1} \left(  G_{i-2} + P_{i-2} c_{i-2} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1} = \quad \vdots&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1} = G_i + P_iG_{i-1} + P_i P_{i-1} G_{i-2} + P_i P_{i-1} P_{i-2} G_{i-3} + \ldots + P_i P_{i-1}
 \cdots P_1 P_0 c_0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this does not require the carry-out signals from the previous stages, so we don't have to wait for changes to ripple through the circuit. In fact, a given stage's carry signal can be computed once the propagate and generate signals are ready with only two more gate delays (one AND and one OR). Thus the carry-out for a given stage can be calculated in constant time, and therefore so can the sum.

{| class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:left; margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
!Operation!!Required Data!!Gate Delays
|-
|Produce stage generate and propagate signals
|Addends (''a'' and ''b'')
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;| 1
|-
|Produce stage carry-out signals, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
|''P'' and ''G'' signals, and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|2

|Carry signals and addends
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|3
|-
|colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;|'''Total'''
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|'''6'''
|}

The ''S'', ''P'', and ''G'' signals are all generated by a circuit called a &quot;partial full adder&quot; (PFA), which is similar to a full adder.

[[File:Partial Full-Adder.svg|center]]

For a slightly smaller circuit, the propagate signal can be taken as the output of the first XOR gate instead of using a dedicated OR gate, because if both A and B are asserted, the generate signal will force a carry. However, this simplifiaction means that the propagate signal will take two gate delays to produce, rather than just one.

A carry lookahead adder then contains ''n'' PFAs and the logic to produce carries from the stage propagate and generate signals:

[[File:4-Bit CLA Adder.svg|center]]

Two numbers can therefore be added in constant time, O(1), of just 6 gate delays, regardless of the length, ''n'' of the numbers. However, this requires AND and OR gates with up to ''n'' inputs. If logic gates are available with a limited number of inputs, trees will need to be constructed to compute these, and the overall computation time is logarithmic, O(ln(''n'')), which is still much better than the linear time for ripple adders.

=== Cascading Carry-Lookahead Adders ===

A basic carry-lookahead adder is very fast but has the disadvantage that it takes a very large amount of logic hardware to implement. In fact, the amount of hardware needed is approximately quadratic with ''n'', and begins to get very complicated for ''n'' greater than 4.

Due to this, most CLAs are constructed out of &quot;blocks&quot; comprising 4-bit CLAs, which are in turn cascaded to produce a larger CLA.

== Carry-Save Adder ==

{{Digital Circuits Stub}}

A carry-save adder is a kind of adder with low propagation delay (critical path), but instead of adding two input numbers to a single sum output, it adds three input numbers to an output pair of numbers.  When its two outputs are then summed by a traditional carry-lookahead or ripple-carry adder, we get the sum of all three inputs.

When adding three or more numbers together, a sequence of carry-save adders terminated by a single carry-lookahead adder provides much better propagation delays than a sequence of carry-lookahead adders.  In particular, the propagation delay of a carry-save adder is not affected by the width of the vectors being added.

Carry-save adders are really completely parallel arrays of full adder circuits, with the each bit of the three input vectors loaded into each full adder's A, B, and Cin inputs.  Each full adder's output S is connected to the corresponding output bit of one output, and its output Cout is connected to the next higher output bit of the second output; the lowest bit of the second output is fed directly from the carry-save's Cin input.

== What is a Transistor? ==
A transistor is an electronic control device, where an electrical signal input can control another electrical signal.
The very name derives from the fact that this control action was seen as an input current flowing into one resistor (base-emitter) causing a larger current in an other resistor (collector-emitter).  The early named for this device was the '''trans'''fer-re'''sistor''' and hence transistor.

There are many different variations of transistors that are appropriate for a wide variety of applications. The transistors that are used in modern digital electronics are generally pairs of [[MOSFET|MOSFETs]], but bipolar transistors are occasionally used.

== Transistor Functions ==

In digital circuits, transistors are always used as a switch.

Like a common lightswitch, the ideal digital transistor is, at any one instant, either &quot;off&quot; with zero current flowing through it, or &quot;on&quot; with nearly zero voltage across it.
There are occasional transitions between the two states, but in this book we ignore the details of what happens during the transition.

== Transistor Circuits ==

Transistors may be put together in configurations that allow more flexibility than simply diodes. With two diodes and a resistor, you can construct an AND gate and an OR gate. If we add transistors into the mix, we can construct the three basics, the AND, OR, and NOT gates. The NOT gate allows us to expand further into NAND and NOR gates.

== Propagation Delay ==

In all transistors today, there is a certain amount of latency between the time that a control signal is applied and the time that the output is affected. This delay is called propagation delay. These delays can be broken up into two parts.

• t&lt;sub&gt;PLH&lt;/sub&gt; This is the delay time resulting from a LOW to HIGH transition&lt;br /&gt;
• t&lt;sub&gt;PHL&lt;/sub&gt; This is the delay time resulting from a HIGH to LOW transition&lt;br /&gt;

Keep in mind: These two values may not be the same and are usually defined on the device's datasheet.

Propagation delay can be influenced by capacitance in the circuit. Propagation delay is also a rough indicator of effective speed of the device. For example, a gate with a 5 nanosecond propagation delay will respond much faster than a gate with a 120 nanosecond propagation delay.

Propagation delay is measured at the 50% mark and measures the time elapsed between the input and output signal changes.

== Further Reading ==

For details of what transistors are really made of, see [[Semiconductors]].

In digital circuits, we are mainly focusing on transistors that are in cutoff or saturation. For details of behavior of transistors when they are forced into an &quot;in-between&quot; state between fully off and fully on, see [[Analogue Electronics]].

I saw your name in the Digital Circuits book history, and I just wanted to give you a heads-up. I went through the book today and flattened out the page naming scheme, and I renamed the pages to conform to the &quot;forward slash&quot; naming convention. Also, I went through and made sure that every page had at least 4 headings on it, because It's my opinion that if you don't have at least 4 things to say on a subject, then the subject shouldn't get it's own page. Other then that, I wanted to thank you for the work that you have done of this book so far. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Finite State Machines ==
Abstractly, a '''finite state machine''' is a system that can be described by the '''states''' it can assume, the state it starts in, the input it receives, and how it changes state. A state machine will change state dependent upon its current state and also current factors impacting the system, namely, inputs. One state is designated the '''initial''' (or start) '''state.''' Beginning with this state, the inputs are sampled periodically, and the machine changes state dependent on both the inputs and its present state. This state may be observed and treated as an output; the present input may also influence the output.

Concretely, we are interested in creating a system that produces certain outputs under certain conditions. What is special about finite state machines is that they have memory, in a sense. Unlike a logic gate, where the current output depends only on the current input, a finite state machine's output depends on both past input&amp;mdash;through the state it has moved to over time from its initial state&amp;mdash;and current input. We accomplish this through flip-flops. Note, too, that the state only changes at discrete times; thus, we are creating a sequential circuit.

== Transition Tables ==
To understand the workings of a finite state machine, you must understand how it changes state. In a given state, a given output produces a change of state (perhaps to the same state). We can represent the finite state machine, then, as a function mapping an input and state to a state. We can describe this '''transition function''' using a '''transition table''' in a way similar to a truth table: label rows with the distinct inputs, columns with the distinct states, and in each input-state cell, put the label for the state the machine transitions to when given the row's input while in the column's state.

In a digital circuit, the inputs will be binary values, the transition function will be implemented by using the inputs and the outputs of the flip-flops at a given clock pulse to affect the state of the flip-flops, and the new state will be the new state of the flip-flops after the clock pulse.

== State Diagrams ==
An alternative representation of a finite state machine is that of a '''state diagram.''' Here, the states are designated by labeled circles. An arrow is drawn from one state to another whenever the machine is able to transition in one step from the state at the arrow's tail to the state at its head. The arrow is labeled with the input that prompts the transition.

State diagrams are very useful for producing the state transition table and ensuring that all possible input transitions are accounted for. Because they can be simpler than the corresponding transition table (when several different input combinations produce the same transition, they are all used to label only a single arrow, rather than each given their own entry), they are also useful in grasping the functioning of a system.

== Mealy Machines ==
A Mealy machine is a machine whose output is a function of the current state of memory and the current input.

== Moore Machines ==
A Moore machine is a machine whose output is a function of the current state of memory.

== Similar States ==
== Coloring ==
== State Minimization ==

While a correctly-designed state machines has an unambiguous behaviour, there can be more than one way on implementing that same behaviour. Consider the two FSMs below:

[[File:FSM Odd Parity Detector.svg|center]]

Generally speaking, we want to find the implementation of an FSM which have fewest state, and therefore require fewest resources, be this size of a ROM device or LEs in an FPGA.

===Implication Charts===

Implication charts are a common way of reducing an FSM. It works by finding states that have identical transitions to each other. It is a graphical method suitable for fast computation by hand.

First, lets consider a grid of size N×N, where N is the number of states. Each cell represents a pair of states. As this is an unordered pair, the cell (i, j) is equivalent to (j,i), so it can be omitted (green squares). Also, the state is of course equivalent to itself (blue squares). We can then eliminate the upper right triangle and the diagonal. For a seven-state machine, we will have the following implication chart outline:

[[File:Implication Chart Setup.svg|center]]

Note that there are N−1 squares in each direction, and that in any cell, M&amp;lt;N.

In order to begin optimising an FSM, we need a state transition table. For this example, we will take as an example the FSM that implements the following:

===Reduction Method===

#Draw the implication chart. You have one cell for each possible combination of states. The aim is to eliminate all non-equivalent pairs of states. Elimination is indicated by &quot;marking&quot; the cell with a cross. Once all non-equivalent states have been removed, all remaining state-pairs must be equivalent.
#The first step is to go through every cell in the implication chart. For each cell, refer to the two states in the state transition table and look at the outputs for each input.
#*If the outputs are different, place a cross in the cell. Look at the output for each input − they must be the same. The states cannot be equivalent if they have different outputs.
#*If the output are the same, the states may be equivalent − this will occur if the next states are also the same. In the cell, write the next states of each of the two state represented by that cell. For example, if cell (2,5):
#::For an input of X=0: State 2 → 7, State 5 → 3.
#::For an input of X=1: State 2 → 0, State 5 → 1.
#:Therefore, we write &quot;7−3&quot; in the top of cell (2,5) and &quot;0−1&quot; on the bottom. We are writing the next state pairs for each output. Figure 1 below shows the implication chart at the end of this stage.
#The next stage is to go through the chart again. This time we look at the state pairs listed in every unmarked cell. Consider each of the next-state pairs separately. If the cell representing the next-state pair has been marked, mark the current state also (you may have to reverse the order of the states). If '''any''' of the next state-pairs are not equivalent, the current state cannot be equivalent. If the cell contains an entry &quot;i−i&quot;, ignore it, as a state must be equivalent to itself. For example:
#::For an input of 0: State 3 → 0, State 5 → 3.
#::For an input of 1: State 3 → 7, State 5 → 1.
#:Now, the states 0 and 3 are not equivalent (call (0,3) has been marked). Now, if the next states are not equivalent, then the current state also isn't. Therefore, we mark (3,5). Figure 2 shows the result after the first pass, with new marks shown in red.
#Repeat Step 3 until you check every unmarked cell and cannot mark any of them. In this case, this has already happened.
#Now, search through every unmarked cell (i, j). Write equations &quot;i = j&quot;. If you have alreay put one of the terms in an equation and not the other, add it to that equation instead. In this case:
#:*0=1=4
#:*2=5=6
#:*3=7
#We have now reduced the state machine to far fewer states (three from eight).

We can write a new state transition table, using just one of the (equivalent) states from each equation − we'll choose 0, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter which ones you choose, and you can renumber them afterwards, but we won't bother here.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Discussion.jpg|thumb|left|101px]]
Why do we live in cities? Why do we often choose to work together? Why do we enjoy sharing our spare time with others? 
These are questions of Social Cognition and its [[w:Evolution|evolutionary development]]. 

The term Social Cognition describes all abilities necessary to act adequately in a social system. Basically, it is the study of how we process social information, especially its storage, retrieval and application to social situations. Social Cognition is a common skill among various species. 

In the following, the focus will be on Social Cognition as a human skill. Important concepts and the development during childhood will be explained. Having built up a conceptional basis for the term, we will then take a look at this skill from an evolutionary perspective and present the common theories on the origin of Social Cognition.

The publication of [[w:Michael Tomasello|Michael Tomasello]] ''et al.'' in the journal [[w:Behavioral and Brain Sciences|Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] (2005) &lt;ref name=&quot;Tomasello&quot;&gt;Tomasello, M. et al (2005). Understanding and sharing intentions: The origins of cultural cognition. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 28(5), 675–735.&lt;/ref&gt; will serve as a basis for this chapter.

==Social Cognition==
===''The human faculty of Social Cognition''===
[[image:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|Playing football as a complex social activity]]
Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others. That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or desire. Among these abilities, understanding the [[w:intention|intention]] of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions. For example, if you were to see someone breaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger’s car. He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into. Humans also collaborate and interact culturally. We perform complex collaborative activities, like building a house together or playing football as a team. Over time this led to powerful concepts of organizational levels like societies and states. The reason for this intense development can be traced back to the concept of ''Shared Intentionality''.

===''Shared Intentionality''===
An intentional action is an organism’s intelligent behavioural interaction with its environment towards a certain goal state. This is the concept of [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective|Problem Solving]], which was already described in the previous chapter. 

The social interaction of agents in an environment which understand each other as acting intentionally causes the emergence of Shared Intentionality. This means that the agents work together towards a shared goal in collaborative interaction. They do that in coordinated action roles and mutual knowledge about themselves. The nature of the activity or its complexity is not important, as long as the action is carried out in the described fashion. It is important to mention that the notion of ''shared goals'' means that the internal goals of each agent include the intentions of the others. This can easily be misinterpreted. For example take a group of apes on a hunt. They appear to be acting in a collaborative way, however, it is reasonable to assume that they do not have coordinated action roles or a shared goal – they could just be acting towards the same individual goal. Summing up, the important characteristics of the behaviour in question are that the agents are mutually responsive, have the goal of achieving something together and coordinate their actions with distributed roles and action plans. 

The strictly human faculty to participate in collaborative actions that involve shared goals and socially coordinated action plans is also called ''Joint Intention''. This requires an understanding of the goals and perceptions of other involved agents, as well as sharing and communicating these, which again seems to be a strictly human behaviour. Due to our special motivation to share psychological states , we also need certain complex cognitive representations. These representations are called ''dialogic cognitive representations'', because they have as content mostly social engagement. This is especially important for the concept of joint intentions, since we need not only a representation for our own action plan, but also for our partner's plan. Joint Intentions are an essential part of Shared Intentionality.

Dialogic cognitive representations are closely related with the communication and use of linguistic symbols. They allow in some sense a form of ''collective intentionality'', which is important to construct social norms, conceptualize beliefs and, most importantly, share them. In complex social groups the repeated sharing of intentions in a particular interactive context leads to the creation of habitual social practices and beliefs. That may form normative or structural aspects of a society, like government, money, marriage, etc. Society might hence be seen as a product and an indicator of Social Cognition. 


The social interaction that builds ground for activities involving Shared Intentionality is proposed to be divided into three groups:

* '''Dyadic engagement''': The simple sharing of emotions and behaviour, by means of interaction and direct mutual response between agents. Dyadic interaction between human infants and adults are called ''protoconversations''. These are turn-taking sequences of touching, face expressions and vocalisations. The exchange of emotions is the most important outcome of this interaction.

* '''Triadic engagement''': Two agents act together towards a shared goal, while monitoring the perception and goal-direction of the other agent. They focus on the same problem and coordinate their actions respectively, which makes it possible to predict following events. 

* '''Collaborative engagement''': The combination of Joint Intentions and attention. At this point, the agents share a goal and act in complementary roles with a complex action plan and mutual knowledge about the [[w:selective attention|selective attention]] and the intentions of one another. The latter aspect allows the agents to assist each other and reverse or take over roles. 


These different levels of social engagement require the understanding of different aspects of intentional action, as introduced above, and presuppose the motivation to share psychological states with each other.

===''Development of Social Cognition during childhood''===
[[Image:Children_with_instrument.jpg|thumb|150px|Children making social experiences]]
A crucial point for Social Cognition is the comprehension of intentional action. Children's understanding of intentional action can basically be divided into three groups, each representing a more complex level of grasp.
 
# The first one to be mentioned is the identification of animate action. This means that after a couple of months, babies can differentiate between motion that was caused by some external influence and actions that an organism has performed by itself, as an animate being. At this stage, however, the child has not yet any understanding of potential goals the observed actor might have, so it is still incapable of predicting the behaviour of others. 
# The next stage of comprehension includes the understanding that the organism acts with persistence towards achieving a goal. Children can now distinguish accidental incidents from intentional actions and failed from successful attempts. This ability develops after about 9 months. With this new perspective, the child also learns that the person it observes has a certain perception - thus a certain amount of predicting behaviour is possible. This is an essential difference between the first and the second stage. 
# After around 14 months of age, children fully comprehend intentional action and the basics of rational decision making. They realise, that an actor pursuing a goal may have a variety of action plans to achieve a goal, and is choosing between them. Furthermore, a certain sense for the selective attention of an agent develops. This allows a broad variety of predictions of behaviour in a certain environment. In addition to that, children acquire the skill of cultural learning: when they observe how an individual successfully reaches a goal, they memorise the procedure. Hence, they can use the methods to reach their own goals. This is called imitative learning, which turns out to be an extremely powerful tool. By applying this technique, children also learn how things are conventionally done in their culture.

==Evolutionary perspective on Social Cognition==
So far we discussed what Social Cognition is about. But how could this behaviour develop during evolution? At first glance, [[w:Darwin|Darwin]]’s theory of the [[w:survival of the fittest|survival of the fittest]] does not support the development of social behaviour. Caring for others, and not just for oneself, seems to be a decrease of fitness.
Nevertheless, various theories have been formulated which try to explain Social Cognition from an evolutionary perspective. We will present three influential theories which have been formulated by Steven Gaulin and Donald McBurney&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaulin&quot;&gt;Gaulin, S. J. C, &amp; McBurney, D. H. (2003). ''Evolutionary Psychology''. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''Group Selection''===
[[image:Moai_Rano_raraku.jpg|thumb|Moai at Rano Raraku]]
[[w:V.C._Wynne-Edwards|Vero Wynne-Edwards]] first proposed this theory in the 1960's. From an evolutionary perspective, a group is a number of individuals which affect the fitness of each other. Group Selection means that if any of the individuals of a group is doing benefit to its group, the group is more likely to survive and pass on its predisposition to the next generation. This again improves the chance of the individual to spread its genetic material. So in this theory a social organism is more likely to spread its genes than a selfish organism. The distinction to the classical theory of evolution is that not only the fittest individuals are likely to survive, but also the fittest groups. 

An example would be the history of the Rapa Nui. The Rapa Nui were the natives of Easter Island which handled their resources extremely wasteful in order to build giant heads made of stone. After a while, every tree on the island was extinct because they needed the trunks to transport the stones. The following lack of food led to the breakdown of their civilization. 

A society which handles their resources more moderate and provident would not have ended up in such a fate. However, if both societies would have lived on one island, the second group would not have been able to survive because they would not have been able to keep the resources. 

This indicates the problem of the Group Selection: it needs certain circumstances to describe things properly. Additionally, every theory about groups should include the phenomenon of migration. So in this simple form, the theory is not capable of handling selfish behaviour of some agents in altruistic groups: Altruistic groups which include selfish members would turn into pure selfish ones over time, because altruistic agents would work for selfish agents, thereby increasing the cheaters' fitness while decreasing their own. Thus, Group Selection may not be a sufficient explanation for the development of Social Cognition.

===''Kin Selection''===
Since altruistic populations are vulnerable to cheaters, there must exist a mechanism that allows altruism to be maintained by natural selection. The [[w:Kin Selection|Kin Selection]] approach provides an explanation how altruistic genes can spread without being eliminated by selfish behaviour. The theory was developed by [[w:William D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] and John M. Smith in 1964 &lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton&quot;&gt;Hamilton, W. D. (1964). The genetical evolution of social behaviour I and II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'', 7, 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt;. The basic principle of Kin Selection is to benefit somebody who is genetically related, for example by sharing food. For the altruistic individual, this means a reduction of its own fitness by increasing the fitness of its relative. However, the closer the recipient is related to the altruist, the more likely he shares the altruistic genes. The loss of fitness can be compensated since the genes of the altruistically behaving agent have then the chance to be spread indirectly through the recipient: The relative might be able to reproduce and pass the altruistic genes over to the next generation. 

In principle, the disadvantage for the giver should always be less than the increased fitness of the addressee. This relation between costs and benefit is expressed by Hamilton's rule taking additionally the relatedness of altruist and recipient into account: 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;r \cdot b &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:Fire_ants02.jpg|thumb|Ant colonies provide evidence for Kin Selection]]
where

:'''r''' shows the genetic relatedness between altruist and recipient (coefficient between zero and one),

:'''b''' is the reproductive benefit or increased fitness for the recipient and

:'''c''' are the altruist's reproductive costs or the reduction of his fitness in the performed action.


If the product of relatedness and benefit outweighs the costs for the giver, the altruistic action should be performed. The closer the recipient is genetically related, the higher costs are acceptable.

Examples for kin-selected altruism can be found in populations of social insects like ants, termites or bees. An ant colony, for instance, consists of one fertile queen and several hundreds or more of sterile female workers. While the queen is the only one reproducing, the workers are among other things responsible for brood care. The workers are genetically closer related to the sisters they raise (75%) than they would be to their own offspring (50%). Therefore, they are passing on more of their genes than if they bred on their own. 

According to Hamilton's rule, altruism is only favoured if directed towards relatives, that is &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Kin Selection theory accounts only for genetic relatives. Altruism however occurs among not related individuals as well. This issue is addressed by the theory of Reciprocal Altruism.

===''Reciprocal Altruism''===
The theory of Reciprocal Altruism describes beneficial behaviour in expectation of future reciprocity. This form of altruism is not a selfless concern for the welfare of others but it denotes mutual cooperation of repeatedly interacting species in order to maximise their individual utility. In social life an individual can benefit from mutual cooperation, but each one can also do even better by exploiting the cooperative efforts of others. [[w:Game Theory|Game Theory]] allows a formalisation of the strategic possibilities in such situations. It can be shown, that altruistic behaviour can be more successful (in terms of [[w:utility|utility]]) than purely self-interested strategies and therefore will lead to better fitness and survivability.

In many cases social interactions can be modelled by the [[w:Prisoner's Dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma]], which provides the basis of our analysis. The classical prisoner’s dilemma is as follows: Knut and his friend are arrested by the police. The police has insufficient evidence for a conviction, and, having separated both prisoners, visits each of them to offer the same deal: if one testifies for the prosecution against the other and the other remains silent, the betrayer goes free and the silent accomplice receives the full ten-year sentence. If both stay silent, the police can sentence both prisoners to only six months in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each will receive a two-year sentence.


{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ Possible outcomes of the Prisoner's Dilemma:
! Prisoner 1 / Prisoner 2
! Cooperate
! Defect
|- 
! Cooperate
| 6 months each
| 10 years / free
|-
! Defect
| free / 10 years
| 2 years each
|-
|}



Each prisoner has two strategies to choose from, to remain silent (cooperate) or to testify (defect). Assume Knut wants to minimize his individual durance. If Knut’s friend cooperates, it is better to defect and go free than to cooperate and spend six months in jail. If Knut’s friend defects, then Knut should defect too, because two years in jail are better than ten. The same holds for the other prisoner. So defection is the dominant strategy in the prisoner’s dilemma, even though both would do better, if they cooperated. In a one-shot game a rational player would always defect, but what happens if the game is played repeatedly?

One of the most effective strategies in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma is the mixed strategy called [[w:Tit for Tat|Tit for Tat]]: Always cooperate in the first game, then do whatever your opponent did in the previous game. Playing Tit for Tat means to maintain cooperation as long as the opponent does. If the opponent defects he gets punished in succeeding games by defecting likewise until cooperation is restored. With this strategy rational players can sustain the cooperative outcome at least for indefinitely long games (like life) &lt;ref name=&quot;Aumann&quot;&gt;Aumann, R. J. (1959). Acceptable Points in General Cooperative n-Person Games. ''Contributions to the Theory of Games IV, Annals of Mathematics Study'', 40, 287-324.&lt;/ref&gt;. Clearly Tit for Tat is only expected to evolve in the presence of a mechanism to identify and punish cheaters.

Assuming species are not able to choose between different strategies, but rather that their strategical behaviour is hard-wired, we can finally come back to the evolutionary perspective. In The Evolution of Cooperation [[w:Robert Axelrod|Robert Axelrod]] formalised Darwin’s emphasis on individual advantage in terms of game theory&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot;&gt;Axelrod, R. (1984). ''The Evolution of Cooperation''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the concept of an [[w:evolutionary stable strategy|evolutionary stable strategy]] in the context of the prisoner’s dilemma game he showed how cooperation can get started in an asocial world and can resist invasion once fully established.

==Conclusion==
Summing up, Social Cognition is a very complex skill and can be seen as the fundament of our current society. On account of the concept of Shared Intentionality, humans show by far the most sophisticated form of social cooperation. Although it may not seem obvious, Social Cognition can actually be compatible with the theory of evolution and various reasonable approaches can be formulated. These theories are all based on a rather selfish drive to pass on our genetic material - so it may be questionable, if deep-rooted altruism and completely selfless behaviour truly exists.

== digital pro==
Sampling is the process of recording the values of a signal at given points in time. For A/D converters, these points in time are equidistant. The number of samples taken during one second is called the sample rate. Keep in mind that these samples are still analogue values.
The mathematic description of the ideal sampling is the multiplication of the signal with a sequence of dirac pulses.
In real A/D converters the sampling is carried out by a sample-and-hold buffer. The sample-and-hold buffer splits the sample period in a sample time and a hold time. In case of a voltage being sampled, a capacitor is switched to the input line during the sample time. During the hold time it is detached from the line and keeps its voltage.

[[Image:Analog Waveform.svg|center|400px]]

[[Image:Sampled Waveform.svg|center|400px]]

== Quantization ==
Quantization is the process of representing the analog voltage from the sample-and-hold circuit by a fixed number of bits.  The input analog voltage (or current) is compared to a set of pre-defined voltage (or current) levels.  Each of the levels is represented by a unique binary number, and the binary number that corresponds to the level that is closest to the analog voltage is chosen to represent that sample.  This process rounds the analog voltage to the nearest level, which means that the digital representation is an approximation to the analog voltage.  There are a few methods for quantizing samples. The most commonly used ones are the dual slope method and the successive approximation.

[[Image:Digital Waveform.svg|center|400px]]

=== Dual Slope ===
=== Successive Approximation ===

== Reconstruction ==
Reconstruction is the process of creating an analog voltage (or current) from samples.  A digital-to-analog converter takes a series of binary numbers and recreates the voltage (or current) levels that corresponds to that binary number.  Then this signal is filtered by a lowpass filter.  This process is analogous to interpolating between points on a graph, but it can be shown that under certain conditions the original analog signal can be reconstructed exactly from its samples.  Unfortunately, the conditions for exact reconstruction cannot be achieved in practice, and so in practice the reconstruction is an approximation to the original analog signal.

[[Image:Reconstructed Waveform.svg|center|400px]]

== Aliasing ==

Aliasing is a common problem in digital media processing applications. Many readers have heard of &quot;anti-aliasing&quot; features in high-quality video cards. This page will explain what Aliasing is, and how it can by avoided.

Aliasing is an effect of violating the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory. During sampling the base band spectrum of the sampled signal is mirrored to every multifold of the sampling frequency. These mirrored spectra are called alias. If the signal spectrum reaches farther than half the sampling frequency base band spectrum and aliases touch each other and the base band spectrum gets superimposed by the first alias spectrum.
The easiest way to prevent aliasing is the application of a steep sloped low-pass filter with half the sampling frequency before the conversion.

== Nyquist Sampling Rate ==
The Nyquist Sampling Rate is the lowest sampling rate that can be used without having aliasing.  The sampling rate for an analog signal must be at least two times the bandwidth of the signal.  So, for example, an audio signal with a bandwidth of 20 kHz must be sampled at least at 40 kHz to avoid aliasing.  In audio CD's, the sampling rate is 44.1 kHz, which is about 10% higher than the Nyquist Sampling Rate to allow cheaper reconstruction filters to be used.

== Anti-Aliasing ==
The sampling rate for an analog signal must be at least two times as high as the highest frequency in the analog signal in order to avoid aliasing.  Conversely, for a fixed sampling rate, the highest frequency in the analog signal can be no higher than one half of the sampling rate.  Any part of the signal or noise that is higher than one half of the sampling rate will cause aliasing.  In order to avoid this problem, the analog signal is usually filtered by a lowpass filter prior to being sampled, and this filter is called an anti-aliasing filter.  Sometimes the reconstruction filter after a digital-to-analog converter is also called an anti-aliasing filter.

== Converters ==

As a matter of professional interest, we will use this page to briefly discuss Analog-to-Digital (A2D) and Digital-to-Analog (D2A) converters, and how they are related to the field of digital signal processing. Strictly speaking, this page is not important to the core field of DSP, so it can be skipped at the reader's leisure. 

A2D converters are the bread and butter of DSP systems. A2D converters change analog electrical data into digital signals through a process called '''sampling'''. 

D2A converters attempt to create an analog output waveform from a digital signal. However, it is nearly impossible to create a smooth output curve in this manner, so the output waveform is going to have a wide bandwidth, and will have jagged edges. Some techniques, such as '''interpolation''' can be used to improve these output waveforms.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Maintaining the surface of your vehicle is as important as maintaining the vehicle's engine.  A car that runs great and looks good may actually bring in a higher resale value than a vehicle that runs great but has a poor appearance.  A clean vehicle's paint will last longer and need fewer expensive repairs than paint that is allowed to become dull and thin due to oxidation.  

In today's modern industrial environment the surface of a vehicle is subjected to daily abuse.  The sun beats down on your car all day every day, pollutants and dirt deeply embed themselves into your paint, and minute slivers of metal become lodged into your paint which eventually rust.  If you have owned a white vehicle or have observed one then you may have noticed specks of rust.  Those metal slivers are the cause.

Car washing techniques vary amongst individual vehicle owners. Car washing is an essential function of [[Wikipedia:preventive maintenance|preventive maintenance]]. Keeping the exterior of a vehicle clean prevents [[Wikipedia:rust|rust]] and [[Wikipedia:oxidation|oxidation]] and also reduces the occurrence of fine scratches. This article attempts to relay the most common method and the significance of this [[Wikipedia:pastime|pastime]]. Washing a vehicle with soap and a sponge is not the main body of work. In fact, this is only the preparation for the real cleaning.  Soap and sponge will not remove all contaminants from a vehicle's surface. Other products will be required such as clay bars, cleaner wax, polish, etc.

It is recommended that you read the section in your [[Wikipedia:Owners manual|owners manual]] about washing your car. There you will find specific instructions and cautions for cleaning the equipment in your particular model, such as prohibiting the use of acid based wheel cleaners.

In the next section we discuss the various equipment that you will need.

== Digital Sound ==
===Sampling Frequency===
Sound in the digital realm is stored in one or more arrays of discrete samples, with each array of samples correlating to a channel (e.g. stereo sound requires two channels, and thus two arrays of samples). The interval of time between each sample is a constant, and is determined by the type of data to be represented. Since we are interested in sound, and the extreme upper limit of human hearing is generally accepted as 20kHz, the [[Wikipedia:Nyquist-Shannon_sampling_theorem|Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]] can be used to determine the interval between samples to accurately re-construct the signals we're interested in.

This theorem states that
{{cquote|Exact reconstruction of a continuous-time [[wikipedia:baseband|baseband]] signal from its samples is possible if the signal is [[wikipedia:bandlimited|bandlimited]] and the [[wikipedia:sampling_frequency|sampling frequency]] is greater than twice the signal bandwidth.}}
Essentially what this means is a signal that is limited to a certain range (audible sound: ~20Hz to 20kHz) can be reconstructed without error if it is sampled at a rate that is greater than twice the bandwidth. The [[wikipedia:Red_Book_%28audio_CD_standard%29|Red Book]] audio CD standard sets the sampling rate at 44,100 Hz. This frequency was chosen to leave ample overhead (as required by the Nyquist-Shannon theorem), but could support at least up to 22kHz.

44.1kHz is the general standard for sampling rates in digital audio on consumer level equipment, however 48kHz is common when working with film or video. Also, many recording engineers prefer to record classical or otherwise complex music at 88.2 or 96kHz -- some claim to be able to perceive a difference.

When converting from 48kHz to 44.1kHz a sonic blurring effect can sometime occur, because the math is floating point, which is inherently imprecise on a computer. The conversion from 88.2kHz to 44.1kHz or 96kHz to 48kHz is simpler to perform, since the computer, or device, doing the conversion only has to disregard half the samples. To bypass this problem, a high-quality [[wikipedia:Digital-to-analog_converter|digital-to-analog converter]] can be used to bring, for example, a 48kHz signal back to its analog form, and then is fed into another high-quality [[wikipedia:Analog-to-digital_converter|analog-to-digital converter]] to re-sample the signal at 44.1kHz. This technique is common practice in recording studios where high-end equipment can be trusted to do the conversion flawlessly, however in other situations, the sonic distortion caused by converting the audio in software or hardware may be of little concern.

===Bits Per Sample===
While sampling frequency determines the time component of an audio signal, the number of bits per sample is used to describe the amplitude. [[wikipedia:Red_Book_%28audio_CD_standard%29|Red Book]] audio CDs store each sample as a 16 bit signed integer. This means that when an audio signal is converted for use on a CD, each sample's value is quantized as an integer to fit in the range -32768 to +32767.

== Wave Files ==
Wave files contain data which is a representation of audio sound. This format for storing data is an uncompressed format. This means the data can be sent to the digital-to-analog processor for playback without an added step of decompression. This also means that this format will consume a great deal of memory.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Head CT scan.jpg|right|thumb|Ct-Scan]]
[[Image:Gehirn, lateral - Lobi + Stammhirn + Cerebellum eng.svg|left|thumb|human brain lobes]]
[[w:behaviour|Behavioural]] and [[w:Neuroscience|Neuroscientific]] Methods were invented by Shay M. Anderson and are used to get a better understanding of how our [[w:brain|brain]] influences the way we think, feel, and act.
There are many different methods which help us to analyze the brain and as well to give us an overview of the relationship between brain and behaviour.Well-known techniques are the EEG (Electroencephalography) which records the brain’s electrical activity and the fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) method which tells us more about brain functions. Other methods, such as the [[w:lesion|lesion]] method, are not as well-known but still very influential in today's neuroscientific research.

Methods can be summed up in the following categories: There are techniques for assessing brain [[w:anatomy|anatomy]] and others for assessing physiological functions. Furthermore there are techniques for modulating brain activity, analyzing behaviour or for modeling brain-behaviour. In the lesion method, patients with brain damage are examined to determine which brain structures were damaged and to that extent this influences the patient's behaviour.

==Lesion method==
The concept of the lesion method is based on the idea to find a correlation between a specific brain area and an occurring behaviour. From experiences and research observations it can be concluded that the loss of a brain part causes behavioural changes or interfere in performing a specific task. This can be noted in such a way that a patient with a lesion in the parietal-temporal-occipital association area has an [[w:agraphia|agraphia]], that means that he is not able to write although he has no deficits in motor skills. Consequently generally speaking researchers deduce that if structure X is damaged and changes in behaviour Y occur X has a relation to Y.

In humans lesion are often caused by tumours or strokes. With the upcoming methods it is possible to determine which area was damaged for example by a stroke and therefore deduce a relation between the loss of the ability to speak and this specific damaged brain area. Lesions caused purposely in the laboratory with animals offer a lot of advantages. 

First the animals did all grow up in the same environment and have the same age when the surgery is performed. Second on each animal a before-after comparison of performing a task can be observed. And third the control groups can be watched who either did not undergo surgery or who did have surgery in another brain area. These benefits also increase the accuracy of the hypothesis being tested which is more difficult in human research because the before-after comparison and control experiments drop out. 
[[Image:Phineas Gage CGI.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Visualization of iron rod passing through brain of Phineas Gage]] 
In order to upgrade the probability of the hypothetical relationship between a brain area and a task performance a method called [[w:double dissociation|double dissociation]] is carried out. The goal of this method is to prove if two dissociations are independent. More precisely if two patients have each a brain lesion and they show a contradictory disease pattern the ambition of the scientists will be to prove that the two tasks are realized in two different brain areas. Lesions in the Broca-, respectively [[w:Wernicke area|Wernicke area]] can serve as an example. The [[w:Broca area|Broca area]] in the brain is responsible for language processing, comprehension and speech production. Patients with a lesion in this area have a brain damage called [[w:Broca's aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] or non-fluent aphasia. They are not able to speak fluent any more, a sentence produced by them could be: I ... er ... wanted ... ah ... well ... I ... wanted to ... er ... go surfing ... and ..er ... well... Contradictory Wernicke's area is responsible for analysing spoken language. A patient with a lesion in this area has a so-called [[w:Wernicke's aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]]. He is able to hear language but is no longer able to understand it and therefore cannot produce any meaningful sentences any more. He talks 'word salad', like for instance: ' I then did this chingo for some hours after my dazi went through meek and been sharko'. A difficulty which occurs with Wernicke's aphasia patients is that they are often not aware of their lack of ability to speak correctly because they cannot understand what they are saying and think they are holding a normal conversation.   

Certainly one of the famous &quot;lesion&quot; cases was that of [[w:Phineas Gage|Phineas Gage]].  On 13 September 1848 Gage, a railroad construction foreman, was using an iron rod to tamp an explosive charge into a body of rock when premature explosion of the charge blew the rod through his left jaw and out the top of his head. Miraculously, Gage survived, but reportedly underwent a dramatic personality change as a result of destruction of one or both of his [[w:frontal lobes|frontal lobes]]. The uniqueness of Gage case (and the ethical impossibility of repeating the treatment in other patients) makes it difficult to draw generalizations from it, but it does illustrate the core idea behind the lesion method.  Further problems stem from the persistent distortions in published accounts of Gage—see the Wikipedia article [[w:Phineas Gage|Phineas Gage]].

==Techniques for Assessing Brain Anatomy / Physiological Function==

===CAT===
[[Image:Morbus_Bechterew.jpg|left|200px|thumb|X-ray picture.]]
CAT scanning was invented in 1972 by the British engineer Godfey N. Hounsfield and the South African (later American) physicist Alan Cromack.

CAT (Computed Axial Tomography) is an x-ray procedure which combines many x-ray images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views, and when needed 3D images of the internal organs and structures of the human body. A large donut-shaped x-ray machine takes x-ray image at many different angles around the body. Those images are processed by a computer to produce cross-sectional picture of the body. In each of these pictures the body is seen as an x-ray ‘slice’ of the body, which is recorded on a film. This recorded image is called [[w:tomography|tomogram]]. 

CAT scans are performed to analyze, for example, the head, where traumatic injuries (such as blood clots or skull fractures), tumors, and infections can be identified. In the spine the bony structure of the vertebrae can be accurately defined, as can the anatomy of the spinal cord. ATC scans are also extremely helpful in defining body organ anatomy, including visualizing the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, aorta, kidneys, uterus, and ovaries.
The amount of radiation a person receives during CAT scan is minimal. In men and non-pregnant women it has not been shown to produce any adverse effects. However, doing a CAT test hides some risks. If the subject or the patient is pregnant it maybe recommended to do another type of exam to reduce the possible risk of exposing her fetus to radiation. Also in cases of [[w:asthma|asthma]] or [[w:allergies|allergies]] it is also recommended to avoid this type of scanning. Since the CAT scan requires a contrast medium, there's a slight risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast medium. Having certain medical conditions; [[w:diabetes|Diabetes]], asthma, heart disease, kidney problems or thyroid conditions also increases the risk of a reaction to contrast medium.

===MRI===


Although CAT scanning was a breakthrough, in many cases it was substituted by Magnetic resonance imaging (also known as MRI) since magnetic resonance imaging is a method of looking inside the body without using [[w:x-rays|x-rays]], harmful dyes or surgery. Instead, radio waves and a strong magnetic field are used in order to provide remarkably clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues.
[[Image:MRI head side.jpg|left|200px|thumb|MRI head side]]
'''History and Development of MRI'''

MRI is based on a physics phenomenon, called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford university) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University). In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals. In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis. Four years later a patent was granted, which was the worlds first patent issued in the field of MRI. In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole-body” MRI scanner, which he called the ”Indomitable”.
The medical use of magnetic resonance imaging has developed rapidly. The first MRI equipment in health was available at the beginning of the 1980s. In 2002, approximately 22000 MRI scanners were in use worldwide, and more than 60 million MRI examinations were performed.

[[Image:Modern_3T_MRI.JPG|right|250px|thumb|A full size MRI-Scanner.]]
'''Common Uses of the MRI Procedure'''

Because of its detailed and clear pictures, MRI is widely used to diagnose sports-related injuries, especially those affecting the knee, elbow, shoulder, hip and wrist. Furthermore, MRI of the heart, aorta and blood vessels is a fast, non-invasive tool for diagnosing artery disease and heart problems. The doctors can even examine the size of the heart-chambers and determine the extent of damage caused by a heart disease or a heart attack. Organs like lungs, liver or spleen can also be examined in high detail with MRI. Because no radiation exposure is involved, MRI is often the preferred diagnostic tool for examination of the male and female reproductive systems, pelvis and hips and the bladder.

'''Risks'''

An undetected metal implant may be affected by the strong magnetic field. MRI is generally avoided in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Scientists usually use other methods of imaging, such as ultrasound, on pregnant women unless there is a strong medical reason to use MRI.

===DT-MRI===
[[Image:DTI-sagittal-fibers.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Reconstruction of nerve fibers]]
There has been some further development of the MRI:
The DT-MRI (diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging) enables the measurement of the restricted [[w:diffusion|diffusion]] of water in tissue and gives a 3-dimensional image of it.
History:
The principle of using a magnetic field to measure diffusion was already described in 1965 by the chemist Edward O. Stejskal and John E. Tanner. After the development of the MRI, Michael Moseley introduced the principle into MR Imaging in 1984 and further fundamental work was done by Dennis LeBihan in 1985. In 1994 the engineer Peter J. Basser published optimized mathematical models of an older diffusion-tensor model.&lt;ref name=Filler2009b&gt; Filler, AG: The history, development, and impact of computed imaging in neurological diagnosis and neurosurgery: CT, MRI, DTI: [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3267/version/4 Nature Precedings DOI: 10.1038/npre.2009.3267.4].&lt;/ref&gt; This model is commonly used today and supported by all new MRI-devices. 

The DT-MRI technique takes advantage of the fact that the mobility of water molecules in brain tissue is restricted by obstacles like cell membranes. In nerve fibers mobility is only possible alongside the axons. So measuring the diffusion gives rise to the course of the main nerve fibers. All the data of one diffusion-tensor are too much to process in a single image, so there are different techniques for visualization of different aspects of this data:
- Cross section images
- tractography (reconstruction of main nerve fibers)
- tensor glyphs (complete illustration of diffusion-tensor information)

The diffusion manner changes by patients with specific diseases of the central nervous system in a characteristic way, so they can be discerned by the diffusion-tensor technique. Diagnosis of apoplectic strokes and medical research of diseases involving changes of the white matter, like Alzheimer's disease or Multiple sclerosis are the main applications. Disadvantages of DT-MRI are that it is far more time consuming than ordinary MRI and produces
large amounts of data, which first have to be visualized by the different methods to be interpreted.

===fMRI===
The fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance) Imaging is based on the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The way this method works is the following: All atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons have a [[w:nuclear spin|nuclear spin]]. A strong magnetic field is put around the tested object which aligns all spins parallel or antiparallel to it. There is a resonance to an oscillating magnetic field at a specific frequency, which can be computed in dependence on the atom type (the nuclei’s usual spin is disturbed, which induces a voltage s (t), afterwards they return to the equilibrium state). At this level different tissues can be identified, but there is no information about their location. Consequently the magnetic field’s strength is gradually changed, thereby there is a correspondence between frequency and location and with the help of Fourier analysis we can get one-dimensional location information. Combining several such methods as the [[w:Fourier analysis|Fourier analysis]] it is possible to get a 3D image.
[[Image:FMRI.jpg|left|270px|thumb|fMRI picture]]
The central idea for fMRI is to look at the areas with increased blood flow. [[w:hemoglobin|Hemoglobin]] disturbs the magnetic imaging, so areas with an increased blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) can be identified. Higher BOLD signal intensities arise from decreases in the concentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin. An fMRI experiment usually lasts 1-2 hours. The subject will lie in the magnet and a particular form of stimulation will be set up and MRI images of the subject's brain are taken. In the first step a high resolution single scan is taken. This is used later as a background for highlighting the brain areas which were activated by the stimulus. In the next step a series of low resolution scans are taken over time, for example, 150 scans, one every 5 seconds. For some of these scans, the stimulus will be presented, and for some of the scans, the stimulus will be absent. The low resolution brain images in the two cases can be compared, to see which parts of the brain were activated by the stimulus. The rest of the analysis is done using a series of tools which correct distortions in the images, remove the effect of the subject moving their head during the experiment, and compare the low resolution images taken when the stimulus was off with those taken when it was on. The final statistical image shows up bright in those parts of the brain which were activated by this experiment. These activated areas are then shown as coloured blobs on top of the original high resolution scan. This image can also be rendered in 3D. 

fMRI has moderately good [[w:spatial resolution|spatial resolution]] and bad temporal resolution since one fMRI frame is about 2 seconds long. However, the temporal response of the blood supply, which is the basis of fMRI, is poor relative to the electrical signals that define neuronal communication. Therefore, some research groups are working around this issue by combining fMRI with data collection techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto encephalography (MEG), which has much higher temporal resolution but rather poorer spatial resolution.

===PET===
Positron emission tomography, also called PET imaging or a PET scan, is a diagnostic examination that involves the acquisition of physiologic images based on the detection of radiation from the emission of [[w:positrons|positrons]]. It is currently the most effective way to check for cancer recurrences. Positrons are tiny particles emitted from a [[w:radioactive|radioactive substance]] administered to the patient. This radiopharmaceutical is injected to the patient and its emissions are measured by a PET scanner. A PET scanner consists of an array of detectors that surround the patient. Using the gamma ray signals given off by the injected radionuclide, PET measures the amount of metabolic activity at a
site in the body and a computer reassembles the signals into images. PET's ability to measure [[w:metabolism|metabolism]] is very useful in diagnosing Altsheimer's disease, [[w:Parkinson|Parkinson's disease]], epilepsy and other neurological conditions, because it can precisely illustrate areas where brain activity differs from the norm. It is also one of the most accurate methods available to localize areas of the brain causing epileptic seizures and to determine if surgery is a treatment option. PET is often used in conjunction with an MRI or CT scan through &quot;fusion&quot; to give a full three-dimensional view of an organ.

==Electromagnetic Recording Methods==
The methods we have mentioned up to now examine the metabolic activity of the brain. But there are also other cases in which one wants to measure electrical activity of the brain or the magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity. The methods we discussed so far do a great job of identifying where activity is occurring in the brain. A disadvantage of these methods is that they do not measure brain activity on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis. This measuring can be done by electromagnetic recording methods, for example by single-cell recording or the Electroencephalography (EEG). These methods measure the brain activity really fast and over a longer period of time so that they can give a really good temporal resolution. 

===Single cell===
When using the single-cell method an electrode is placed into a cell of the brain on which we want to focus our attention. Now, it is possible for the experimenter to record the electrical output of the cell that is contacted by the exposed electrode tip. That is useful for studying the underlying ioncurrents which are responsible for the cell’s [[w:resting potential|resting potential]]. The researchers’ goal is then to determine for example, if the cell responds to sensory information from only specific details of the world or from many stimuli. So we could determine whether the cell is sensitive to input in only one sensory modality or is multimodal in sensitivity. One can also find out which properties of a stimulus make cells in those regions fire. Furthermore we can find out if the animal’s attention towards a certain stimulus influences in the cell’s respond.

Single cell studies are not very helpful for studying the human brain, since it is too invasive to be a common method. Hence, this method is most often used in animals. There are just a few cases in which the single-cell recording is also applied in humans. People with [[w:epilepsy|epilepsy]] sometimes get removed the epileptic tissue. A week before surgery electrodes are implanted into the brain or get placed on the surface of the brain during the surgery to better isolate the source of seizure activity. So using this method one can decrease the possibility that useful tissues will be removed. Due to the limitations of this method in humans there are other methods which measure electrical activity. Those we are going to discuss next.

===EEG===
[[File:EEG mit 32 Electroden.jpg|right|200|thumb|EEG with test peron]] 
[[Image:EEG electrode places.svg|left|400|thumb|Placement of electrodes]]
[[Image:Sleep EEG Stage 1.jpg|right|250|thumb|EEG record during sleep]]

One of the most famous techniques to study brain activity is probably the Electroencephalography (EEG). Most people might know it as a technique which is used clinically to detect aberrant activity such as epilepsy and disorders.

In an experimental way this technique is used to show the brain activity in certain psychological states, such as alertness or drowsiness. To measure the brain activity mental electrodes are placed on the scalp. Each electrode, also known as lead, makes a recording of its own. Next, a reference is needed which provides a baseline, to compare this value with each of the recording electrodes. This electrode must not cover muscles because its contractions are induced by electrical signals. Usually it is placed at the “mastoid bone” which is located behind the ear. 

During the EEG electrodes are places like this. Over the right hemisphere electrodes are labelled with even numbers. Odd numbers are used for those on the left hemisphere. Those on the midline are labelled with a z. The capital letters stands for the location of the electrode(C=central, F=frontal, Fop= frontal pole, O= occipital, P= parietal and T= temporal).
 
After placing each electrode at the right position, the [[w:electrical potential|electrical potential]] can be measured. This electrical potential has a particular voltage and furthermore a particular frequency. Accordingly, to a person’s state the frequency and form of the EEG signal can differ. If a person is awake, beta activity can be recognized, which means that the frequency is relatively fast. Just before someone falls asleep one can observe alpha activity, which has a slower frequency. The slowest frequencies are called delta activity, which occur during sleep.
Patients who suffer epilepsy show an increase of the amplitude of firing that can be observed on the EEG record. In addition EEG can also be used to help answering experimental questions. In the case of emotion for example, one can see that there is a greater alpha suppression over the right frontal areas than over the left ones, in the case of depression. One can conclude from this, that depression is accompanied by greater activation of right frontal regions than of left frontal regions. 

The disadvantage of EEG is that the [[w:electric conductivity|electric conductivity]], and therefore the measured electrical potentials vary widely from person to person and, also during time. This is because all tissues (brain matter, blood, bones etc.) have other conductivities for electrical signals. That is why it is sometimes not clear from which exact brain-region the electrical signal comes from.

===ERP===
Whereas EEG recordings provide a continuous measure of brain activity, event-related potentials (ERPs) are recordings which are linked to the occurrence of an event. A presentation of a stimulus for example would be such an event. When a stimulus is presented, the electrodes, which are placed on a person’s scalp, record changes in the brain generated by the thousands of neurons under the electrodes.
By measuring the brain's response to an event we can learn how different types of information are processed. Representing the word eats or bake for example causes a positive potential at about 200msec. From this one can conclude, that our brain processes these words 200 ms after presenting it. This positive potential is followed by a negative one at about 400ms. This one is also called N400 (whereas N stands for negative and 400 for the time). So in general one can say that there is a letter P or N to denote whether the deflection of the electrical signal is positive or negative. And a number, which represent, on average, how many hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus presentation the component appears.
The event-related- potential shows special interest for researchers, because different components of the response indicate different aspects of cognitive processing. For example, presenting the sentences “The cats won’t eat” and “The cat won’t bake”, the N400 response for the word “eat” is smaller than for the word “bake”. From this one can draw the conclusion that our brain needs 400 ms to register information about a word’s meaning. Furthermore, one can figure out where this activity occurs in the brain, namely if one looks at the position on the scalp of the electrodes that pick up the largest response.

===MEG===

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is related to electroencephalography (EEG). However, instead of recording electrical potentials on the scalp, it uses magnetic potentials near the scalp to index brain activity. To locate a dipole, the magnetic field can be used, because the dipole shows excellently the intensity of the magnetic field. By using devices called SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference device) one can record these magnetic fields.

MEG is mainly used to localize the source of epileptic activity and to locate primary sensory cortices. This is helpful because by locating them they can be avoided during neurological intervention.
Furthermore, MEG can be used to understand more about the [[w:neurophysiology|neurophysiology]] underlying psychiatric disorders such as [[w:schizophrenia|schizophrenia]]. In addition, MEG can also be used to examine a variety of cognitive processes, such as language, object recognition and spatial processing among others, in people who are neurologically intact.

MEG has some advantages over EEG. First, magnetic fields are less influenced than electrical currents by conduction through brain tissues, cerebral spinal fluid, the skull and scalp. Second, the strength of the magnetic field can tell us information about how deep within the brain the source is located. However, MEG also has some disadvantages. The magnetic field in the brain is about 100 million times smaller than that of the earth. Due to this, shielded rooms, made out of aluminum, are required. This makes MEG more expensive. Another disadvantage is that MEG cannot detect activity of cells with certain orientations within the brain. For example, magnetic fields created by cells with long axes radial to the surface will be invisible.

==Techniques for Modulating Brain Activity==

===TMS===

'''History:'''
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important technique for modulating brain activity. The first modern TMS device was developed by Antony Baker in the year 1985 in Sheffield after 8 years of research. The field has developed rapidly since then with many researchers using TMS in order to study a variety of brain functions. Today, researchers also try to develop clinical applications of TMS, because there are long lasting effects on the brain activity it has been considered as a possible alternative to antidepressant medication.

'''Method:'''
TMS utilizes the principle of electromagnetic induction to an isolated brain region. A wire-coil electromagnet is held upon the fixed head of the subject. When inducing small, localized, and reversible changes in the living brain tissue, especially the directly under laying parts of the motor cortex can be effected. By altering the firing-patterns of the neurons, the influenced brain area is disabled. The repetitive TMS (rTMS) describes, as the name reveals, the application of many short electrical stimulations with a high frequency and is more common than TMS. The effects of this procedure last up to weeks and the method is in most cases used in combination with measuring methods, for example: to study the effects in detail.

'''Application:'''
The TMS-method gives more evidence about the functionality of certain brain areas than measuring methods on their own. It was a very helpful method in mapping the motor cortex. For example: While rTMS is applied to the prefrontal cortex, the patient is not able to build up short term memory. That determines the prefrontal cortex, to be directly involved in the process of short term memory. By contrast measuring methods on their own, can only investigate a correlation between the processes. Since even earlier researches were aware that TMS could cause suppression of visual perception, speech arrest, and paraesthesias, TMS has been used to map specific brain functions in areas other than motor cortex. Several groups have applied TMS to the study of visual information processing, language production, memory, attention, reaction time and even more subtle brain functions such as mood and emotion. Yet long time effects of TMS on the brain have not been investigated properly, Therefore experiments are not yet made in deeper brain regions like the hypothalamus or the hippocampus on humans. Although the potential utility of TMS as a treatment tool in various neuropsychiatric disorders is rapidly increasing, its use in depression is the most extensively studied clinical applications to date. For instance in the year 1994, George and Wassermann hypothesized that intermittent stimulation of important prefrontal cortical brain regions might also cause downstream changes in neuronal function that would result in an antidepressant response. Here again, the methods effects are not clear enough to use it in clinical treatments today. Although it is too early at this point to tell whether TMS has long lasting therapeutic effects, this tool has clearly opened up new hopes for clinical exploration and treatment of various psychiatric conditions. Further work in understanding normal mental phenomena and how TMS affects these areas appears to be crucial for advancement. A critically important area that will ultimately guide clinical parameters is to combine TMS with functional imaging to directly monitor TMS effects on the brain. Since it appears that TMS at different frequencies has divergent effects on brain activity, TMS with functional brain imaging will be helpful to better delineate not only the behavioral neuropsychology of various psychiatric syndromes, but also some
of the pathophysiologic circuits in the brain.

===tDCS===

'''transcranial Direct Current Stimulation:'''
The principle of tDCS is similar to the technique of TMS. Like TMS this is a non-invasive and painless method of stimulation. The excitability of brain regions is modulated by the application of a weak electrical current.

'''History and development:'''
It was first observed that electrical current applied to the skull lead to an alleviation of pain. Scribonius Largus, the court physician to the Roman emperor Claudius, found that the current released by the electric ray has positive effects on headaches. In the Middle Ages the same property of another fish, the electrical catfish, was used to treat epilepsy. Around 1800, the so-called galvanism (it was concerned with effects of today’s electrophysiology) came up. Scientists like Giovanni Aldini experimented with electrical effects on the brain. A medical application of his findings was the treatment of melancholy. During the twentieth century among neurologists and psychiatrists electrical stimulation was a controversial but nevertheless wide spread method for the treatment of several kinds of mental disorders (e.g. Electroconvulsive therapy by Ugo Cerletti).

'''Mechanism:'''
The tDCS works by fixation of two electrodes on the skull. About 50 percent of the direct current applied to the skull reaches the brain. The current applied by a direct current battery usually is around 1 to 2 mA. The modulation of activity of the brain regions is dependent on the value of current, on the duration of stimulation and on the direction of current flow. While the former two mainly have an effect on the strength of modulation and its permanence beyond the actual stimulation, the latter differentiates the modulation itself. The direction of the current (anodic or cathodic) is defined by the polarity and position of the electrodes. Within tDCS two distinct ways of stimulation exist. With the anodal stimulation the anode is put near the brain region to be stimulated and analogue for the cathodal stimulation the cathode is placed near the target region. The effect of the anodal stimulation is that the positive charge leads to depolarization in the membrane potential of the applied brain regions, whereas hyperpolarisation occurs in the case of cathodal stimulation due to the negative charge applied. The brain activity thereby is modulated. Anodal stimulation leads to a generally higher activity in the stimulated brain region. This result can also be verified with MRI scans, where an increased blood flow in the target region indicates a successful anodal stimulation.

'''Applications:'''
From the description of the TMS method it is should be obvious that there are various fields of appliances. They reach from identifying and pulling together brain regions with cognitive functions to the treatment of mental disorders. Compared to TMS it is an advantage of tDCS to not only is able to modulate brain activity by decreasing it but also to have the possibility to increase the activity of a target brain region. Therefore the method could provide an even better suitable treatment of mental disorders such as depression. The tDSC method has also already proven helpful for apoplectic stroke patients by advancing the motor skills.

==Behavioural Methods==

Besides using methods to measure the brain’s physiology and anatomy, it is also important to have techniques for analyzing behaviour in order to get a better insight on cognition. Compared to the neuroscientific methods, which concentrate on neuronal activity of the brain regions, behavioural methods focus on overt behaviour of a test person. This can be realized by well defined behavioural methods (e.g. eye-tracking), test batteries (e.g. IQ-test) or measurements which are designed to answer specific questions concerning the behaviour of humans. Furthermore, behavioural methods are often used in combination with all kinds of neuroscientific methods mentioned above. Whenever there is an overt reaction on a stimulus (e.g. picture) these behavioural methods can be useful. Another goal of a behavioural test is to examine in what terms damage of the central nervous system influences cognitive abilities.
===A Concept of a behavioural test===
The tests are performed to give an answer to certain questions about human behaviour. In order to find an answer to that question, a test strategy has to be developed. First it has to be carefully considered, how to design the test in the best way, so that the measurement results provide an accurate answer to the initial question. How can the test be conducted so that founding variables are minimal and the focus really is on the problem? When an appropriate test arrangement is found, the defining of test variables is the next part. The test is now conducted and probably repeated until a sufficient amount of data is collected. The next step is the evaluation of the resulting data, with the suitable methods of statistics. If the test reveals a significant result, it might be the case that further questions arise about neuronal activity underlying the behaviour. Then neuroscientific methods are useful to investigate correlating brain activities. Methods, which proved to provide good evidence to a certain recurrent question about cognitive abilities of subjects, can bring together in a test battery.

'''Example:'''
Question: Does a noisy surrounding affect the ability to solve a certain problem?

Possible test design: Expose half of the subject to a silent environment while solving the same task as the other half in a noisy environment. In this example founding variables might be different cognitive abilities of the participants. Test variables could be the time needed to solve the problem and the loudness of the noise etc. 
If statistical evaluation shows significance: Probable further questions: How does noise affect the brain activities on a neuronal level?

===Test batteries===
A neuropsychological assessment can be achieved through the test battery approach, which gives an overview on a person’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses by analyzing different cognitive abilities. A neuropsychological test battery is used by neurophysiologists to discover brain dysfunctions, arisen from neurological or psychiatric disorders. Such batteries do not only test various mental functions, but also the overall intelligence of a person. 

The purpose of the following batteries is to find out, whether a person suffers from a brain damage or not, and they work well in discriminating persons with brain damage from neurologically impaired patients, but worse when it comes to discriminating them from persons with psychiatric disorders. The '''Halstead-Reitan battery''' is the most popular one, where the abilities tested range from basic sensory processing to tests that require complex reasoning. Furthermore, the Halstead- Reitan battery gives information concerning what caused the damage, the brain areas that were harmed, and it provides information about the stage the damage has reached. Such information is very helpful for the development of a rehabilitation program. Another test battery, the '''Luria-Nebraska battery''', is as twice as fast to administer than the Halstead-Reitan, and the tests are ordered according to twelve content scales (e.g. motor functions, reading, memory etc.). These test batteries do not only focus on the data results, which assesses the absolute level of performance, but beyond that, they give attention to data on the qualitative manner of performance, and this is useful in gaining a better understanding of the cognitive impairment.

Another example for test batteries is the determination of intelligence (IQ-test). The most common used tests to estimate the intelligence of a person are the '''Wechsler family intelligence tests'''. Here is an example for one of them: The '''WAIS-III test''', in which various cognitive abilities of children between 6 and 16 years are tested. Firstly, the verbal-comprehension index, which is assessed according to performance on vocabulary, similarities and information, secondly, the perceptualcortex index analyzing non-verbal abilities (e.g. visual-motor integration), thirdly, the workingmemory index being evaluated according to a person’s digit span, arithmetical performance andobject assembly subtests, at last there is the processing-speed index according to digit symbol coding and letter-number sequencing.

===The Eye Tracking Procedure===

Another important procedure for analyzing behavior and cognition is Eye-tracking. This is a procedure of measuring either where we are looking (the point of gaze) or the motion of an eye relative to the head. There are different techniques for measuring the movement of the eyes and the instrument that does the tracking is called the tracker. The first non-intrusive tracker was invented by George Buswell.

The eye tracking is a study with a long history, starting back in the 1800s. In 1879 Louis Emile Javal noticed that reading does not involve smooth sweeping of the eye along the text but rather series of short stops which are called fixations. This observation is one of the first attempts to examine the eye’s directions of interest. The book of Alfred L. Yarbus which he published in 1967 after an important eye tracking research is one of the most quoted eye tracking publications ever. The eye tracking procedure is not that complicated. Video based eye trackers are frequently used. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records the movements while the viewer looks at some stimulus. The most modern eye trackers use contrast to locate the center of the pupil and create corneal reflections using infrared or near-infrared non-collimated light. 

There are also two general types of eye tracking techniques. The first one – the Bright Pupil is an effect close to the red eye effect and it appears when the illuminator source is onset from the optical path while when the source is offset from the optical path, the pupil appears to be dark (Dark Pupil). The Bright Pupil creates great contrast between the iris and the pupil which allows tracking in light conditions from dark to very bright but it is not effective for outdoor tracking. There are also different eye tracking setup techniques. Some are head mounted, some require the head to be stable, and some automatically track the head during motion. The sampling rate of the most of them is 30 Hz. But when we have rapid eye movement, for example during reading, the tracker must run at 240, 350 or even 1000-1250 Hz in order to capture the details of the movement. Eye movements are divided to fixations and saccades. When the eye movement pauses in a certain position there is a fixation and saccade when it moves to another position. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a scan path. Interestingly most information from the eye is received during a fixation and not during a saccade. Fixation lasts about 200 ms during reading a text and about 350 ms during viewing of a scene and a saccade towards new goal takes about 200 ms. Scan paths are used in analyzing cognitive intent, interest and salience.

Eye tracking has a wide range of application – it is used to study a variety of cognitive processes, mostly visual perception and language processing. It is also used in human-computer interactions. It is also helpful for marketing and medical research. In recent years the eye tracking has generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. The commercial eye tracking studies present a target stimulus to consumers while a tracker is used to record the movement of the eye. Some of the latest applications are in the field of the automotive design. Eye tracking can analyze a driver’s level of attentiveness while driving and prevent drowsiness from causing accidents.

==Modeling Brain-Behaviour==

Another major method, which is used in cognitive neuroscience, is the use of [[w:neural networks|neural networks]] (computer modelling techniques) in order to simulate the action of the brain and its processes. These models help researchers to test [[w:theory|theories]] of [[w:neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] functioning and to derive principles viewing brain-behaviour relationships.
[[Image:Neuronal_Network_scheme.JPG|right|500px|thumb|A basic neural network.]]
In order to simulate '''mental functions''' in humans, a variety of '''computational models''' can be used. The basic component of most such models is a “unit”, which one can imagine as showing neuron-like behaviour. These units receive input from other units, which are summed to produce a net input. The net input to a unit is then transformed into that unit’s output, mostly utilizing a [[w:sigmoid function|sigmoid function]]. These units are connected together forming layers. Most models consist of an input layer, an output layer and a “hidden” layer as you can see on the right side.  The input layer simulates the taking up of information from the outside world, the output layer simulates the response of the system and the “hidden” layer is responsible for the transformations, which are necessary to perform the computation under investigation. The units of different layers are connected via connection weights, which show the degree of influence that a unit in one level has on the unit in another one.

The most interesting and important about these models is that they are able to &quot;learn&quot; without being provided specific rules. This ability to “learn” can be compared to the human ability e.g. to learn the [[w:native language|native language]], because there is nobody who tells one “the rules” in order to be able to learn this one. The computational models learn by extracting the regularity of relationships with repeated exposure. This exposure occurs then via “training” in which input patterns are provided over and over again. The adjustment of “the connection weights between units” as already mentioned above is responsible for learning within the system. Learning occurs because of changes in the interrelationships between units, which occurrence is thought to be similar in the [[w:nervous system|nervous system]].

There are a number of items that aid in making car-washing an enjoyable and convenient practice. Old clothes and shoes are recommended in order to avoid soiling preferred clothing. If the [[Wikipedia:weather|weather]] feels hot then it is preferable to wait until later in the afternoon. The vehicle could also be relocated to a shaded area such as under a tree, but do not leave a clean vehicle under a tree overnight as a combination of [[Wikipedia:Sap (plant)|tree sap]], [[Wikipedia:pollen|pollen]] [http://detailingwiki.com/index.php5?title=Pollen], and fallen [[Wikipedia:leaf|leaves]] may collect on it. If the weather is too cold, then the risk of contracting [[Wikipedia:hypothermia|hypothermia]] (or simply experiencing discomfort) exists, and the water may freeze onto the car. Also, if [[Wikipedia:rain|rain]] is forecasted for when the vehicle is scheduled to be washed or for shortly after, then postpone until the threat of rain has passed. A fresh dose of rain can leave dirt and [[Wikipedia:water spot|water spot]]s &amp;mdash; [http://detailingwiki.com/index.php5?title=Removal_of_%27Water_spots%27] grayish circles that form on the vehicle after a rainstorm.

The most common car-washing equipment:

#Two clean [[Wikipedia:bucket|bucket]]s.  One bucket has the car-washing soap and the other bucket has water for rinsing the sponge in order to avoid washing your car with dirty water.
#A [[Wikipedia:sponge|sponge]] or wash mitt made of thick soft foam (not a dishwashing sponge).  Diapers, cloths, shirts, etc. are not recommended.  
#Some car-washing [[Wikipedia:soap|soap]]. Never use [[Wikipedia:dish|dish]] [[Wikipedia:detergent|detergent]]s; they are far too harsh and will strip any applications of wax. Another reason to not use dish or laundry detergent is that they are harder to rinse off with cold water and may therefore leave soap scum behind. 
#A water [[Wikipedia:hose|hose]] that is long enough to reach around the vehicle without having to be draped over the trunk or hood.
#A [[Wikipedia:chamois leather|chamois]], which is a super-absorbent cloth that does not leave lint on the vehicle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">HI Anna, 
tschuldigung dass ich noch nicht früher geschrieben habe...

Also zu eurem Text:
Als erstes erst einmal ist euer Text zu kurz, Schmalhofer will 500Wörter und ihr habt bloß 201 ( das ganze kann man einfach in Word unter Extras und 'Wörter zählen' finden!).
Ich weiß, dass es schwierig ist den Text schon so lang zu haben ohne die Kapitel geschrieben zu haben.
Aber an sich ist euer Text inhaltich schon gut, womit ich meine, dass ihr eine gute Ahnung zu scheinen habt, worüber ihr schreiben werdet. Was ich noch verbessern würde, ist die Verbindung der einzelnen Absätze. Sie hören sich noch nicht flüssig in einander überlaufend an (Wie in einem Buch solls halt sein). So könnt ihr auch noch ne Menge Wörter gut machen. 
Ich hoffe ihr habt nicht mehr zu viel Arbeit hier mit! Bei weiteren Fragen fragt halt nochma nach!
LG Imme

Hallo,
es ist irgendwie schwer für uns ein Review zu schreiben wenn ihr ständig updates macht. Wir wollen natürlich immer über die neuste Version von euch was schreiben, damit das dann nicht schon wieder veraltert ist. Außerdem ist eure erste Version ja nicht so wirklich viel gewesen. Wär schön wenn ihr kurz schreiben könntet bis wann ihr soweit fertig seid, dass wir n review schreiben können?

mfg sven

Hallo,
lass dich nicht täuschen, es wird im text inhaltlich ja nicht so viel verändert,
dadurch wird dein review auch nicht viel besser.

Hi all of you. You have a very good beginning, but in the middle you should invest some work. You've got the most colorful chapter so far :D I like it :) --[[User:Aschoeke|Aschoeke]] 12:10, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

After the proper equipment has been gathered, the vehicle needs to be in a proper location (preferably in a shaded area, away from direct sunlight). A flat, dry, and clean surface such as a driveway or parking lot is prime; however, a [[Wikipedia:gravel|gravel]] lot that is relatively clean will suffice. If neither are accessible, surfaces such as grass or dirt will work; however, [[Wikipedia:mud|mud]] may splash onto the vehicle when the hose is aimed at the [[Wikipedia:tire|tire]]s. If the vehicle is washed on grass or dirt then the vehicle should be left until the ground and vehicle are both dry before the vehicle is moved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Procedure==

Wash, wax and detail in the following order:
#Brush, vacuum, and clean the interior.  Either prior to, after, or on the same day.
#Clean wheels and tires.  To avoid splash back from the wheels.  Also, use tire brushes and never use them for the body of the car!
#Wash exterior
#Apply tire dressing
#Polish wheels
#Clean &amp; Treat exterior trim
#Polish and then wax exterior paints

==Clean the interior==

Because washing a car thoroughly can be an all day job you can opt to clean the interior the day before or the day after.  It would depend on how much discipline you have.  See the Detailing Wiki article on interior cleaning for more info. [http://detailingwiki.com/index.php5?title=Techniques_%26_Methods#Interior_Car_Care]

==Clean the Exterior==

===Washing the Paintwork===

In order to avoid deep scratches, the vehicle must be rinsed thoroughly before a sponge is applied. To do this, always begin at the top of the vehicle and rinse down. If the weather is particularly hot that day, the process will most likely require repeating, even after just a few minutes. Always make sure that the section of the vehicle that is being washed is wet.  If possible park the car in a shady area.  Also, morning or afternoon are preferable times.

Pour a liberal amount of soap into the bucket (making sure it is free of [[Wikipedia:debris|debris]] first) and then fill it up with water. Follow the manufacturers recommended instructions for which quantities of soap and water to use. Dip the sponge into the water and wait for it to absorb as much soapy water as it can. Squeeze the sponge repeatedly while swirling it around in the water. Squeeze excess water out of the sponge and then apply it to the roof of the vehicle. Always wipe the vehicle's surface in straight motions (to avoid making fine swirl marks), remember to begin with the roof and work down the sides to the bottom of the vehicle. If the weather is hot, then soap the vehicle in small sections (I.E. a panel at a time), and then rinse immediately. If not, the heat can dry the soap onto the vehicle's paint.

===Washing the Wheels===

It is highly recommended to use a different set of equipment (sponge, bucket etc.) for the wheels. This will reduce the risk of scratching other parts of the paint work, as the wheels are usually the dirtiest part of a vehicle.

There are two common ways to clean the wheels of a vehicle.

The first way is to clean them with soap and a wheel brush. The choice of brush rests largely on the design of the hubcaps or wheels.

First, ensure that the wheels have been rinsed with water. Next, scrub them with the wheel brush being careful not scratch the hubcaps' paint. Note: hubcaps with grooves in them can contain a lot of brake dust, as can alloy wheels. These problem areas can require extra time and scrubbing.

The second method is to use ''spray on, rinse off'' chemicals. Directions for these should be found on the bottle.

===Rinsing and drying the vehicle===

An important step is rinsing all of the soap off of the vehicle. Begin at the top and spray downward to avoid splashing soap back up to the top of the vehicle. If your finish has a good coat of [http://detailingwiki.com/index.php5?title=Waxes wax], make your final rinse with water of a moderate volume and low pressure about an inch above the surface rather than a high pressure spray. This will create a sheet of water producing fewer small water beads and will improve your drying results.

Afterward, dry the vehicle with a clean, plush [http://detailingwiki.com/index.php5?title=Micro_fibre_(Micofiber)_Towels microfiber towel]. Microfiber towels are superior to chamois or terry towels and will prevent new scratches from appearing in the paint. As much as possible, dry the vehicle thoroughly including the nooks and crannies (door jambs, under the hood, trunk lid, etc.) to prevent water spots and premature corrosion. It is not recommended to allow the vehicle to dry naturally as [[Wikipedia:minerals|minerals]] in the water will be left behind as the water itself evaporates.

===Polishing===
Many products are available on the market which claim to polish paint to restore luster. Some are more effective than others, consult your owners manual or vehicle manufacturer for a recommendation for your particular car. A popular polishing tool with many enthusiasts is the clay bar. Most polishes should be applied sparingly, usually no more than once or twice per year.  Never use a polishing compound on a car with a clear coat.  These compounds are far too abrasive and will remove the clear coat.

To use a clay bar, the surface of the vehicle must ''always'' be lubricated. Never rub the bar on dry paint, it will scratch. Additionally, if the clay bar is dropped on the ground, it must be discarded. The contamination it picks up would subsequently be ground into the paint if it continues to be used.

===Waxing===
Most car wash solutions claim to have wax in them, however the amount they contain is usually not enough to offer significant protection to your vehicle. It is therefore recommended that a &quot;hard&quot; wax be used. These can come in a variety of forms, including pastes, liquids, and sprays. If water applied to your paint forms very large droplets or does not bead at all, it should be waxed. A general rule of thumb is to apply wax when the beads become larger than 2.5 centimeters (1 in).

Since there are a wide variety of products, follow the instructions for application on your particular product. Apply wax to one section of the car at a time, and let haze. Once this occurs, remove the wax by buffing with a folded microfiber towel. Changing to different folds often will make removal of the excess wax easier. After removal, it may be necessary to open the doors to remove wax residue at the edges of the panels.

Car-washing is an activity often referenced in [[Wikipedia:Film|movie]]s, [[Wikipedia:song|song]]s, and other [[media|media]]. Keeping a clean vehicle goes a long way toward improving the appearance of the vehicle, even if it is a few years old. Regular washing and waxing will prolong the [[Wikipedia:shine|shine]] of the vehicle's [[Wikipedia:paint|paint]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wie verprochen nochmal ein Review bevor ihr die Bewertung fuer euer Kapitel bekommt. Neben der Tatsache, die euch bestimmt bewusst ist, dass ihr noch zu wenig an Text auf der Seite stehen habt, ist die Einleitung und auch der Schlussteil sehr gut geworden. Im mittleren Teil waren die Formulierungen in Englisch noch zu Deutsch, ich habe versucht das etwas zu verbessern ohne euren Text an sich zu aendern. Trotzdem ist der Teil noch etwas zu stueckelig. Ideen fuer irgendwelche Bilder? Ich denke das muesste hier einfacher sein als z.B. fuer die Decision Making group. Achja nicht uebertreiben mit den Verlinkungen zu Wikipedia (z.B. Romans sind keine Bereicherung fuer das Thema 'Cognitive Psychology and the Brain'). --[[User:Iroewer|Iroewer]] 18:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

Hi,
der Eintrag vom 12:04, 27 July 2006 88.73.105.62 (Talk) ist von mir (Imme). Wenn es also Fragen gibt richtet euch an mich. Der Inhalt ist immer noch derselbe aber ich habe die Formulierungen verbessert  --[[User:Iroewer|Iroewer]] 12:10, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

Hi ihr!! 
Ihr habt zwar mit den drei Unterbereichen 'Einführung', 'methods' und 'populations of research participants' genug Worte zusammen (Schmalhofer möchte 500), aber der Stil stimmt so noch nicht.
Ihr zeigt zwar, dass ihr eine Idee habt was ihr schreiben wollt, aber diese 'Introduction' soll auch die für das Buch später sein. Daher soll diese Einführung schon einmal das Konzept eures Themas behandeln und zwar in ''einem'' fließenden Text! Schreibt nicht im Wikipedia stil über die verschiedenen Teile, vergisst nicht es soll ein Buch werden!
Bei weiteren Fragen wendet euch eifnach an mich!
LG Imme

So, what about brain anatomy? Methods is in chapter 4, btw.
I think we should rather make the &quot;and the brain&quot; part the center of this chapter. First explaining the crucial role it plays in cognitive psychology and thereby explaining what cogpsy actually is (we could put the history part in there, something like in behaviourism there was no brain and then there come cogpsy), then going ahead and introducing its functions (or parts, or both). What do you think about that?

Ich wollte nur anmerken, dass selbst &quot;fließende Text&quot;e manchmal Überschriften besitzen und nicht nur Wikipediaartikel in Sinnabschnitte zergliedert sind sondern auch Bücher(und selbst Einleitungen zu Büchern). Vielen aufrichtigen dank für die konstruktiven Hinweise, ich werde vesuchen sie zu beherzigen. [[User:Tbittlin|Merlin]]

Ich hab das nicht mehr weitergeschrieben, als ich sah, was Merlin im laufe des Abends hochgeladen hatte. Trotzdem wollte ich das veröffentlichen, sei's nur für ein paar Stunden. Vielleicht lässt sich das alles ja auch igendwie zusammenbasteln.
Da ich mittendrin aufgehört hab, ist es noch nicht sehr ausgefeilt, besonders das Beispiel gefällt mir noch nicht ganz.
Weitergehen sollte die Geschichte mit der Erläuterung ein paar kognitiver Funktionen, ein bisschen wie bei Goldstein, und so zum thema &quot;brain&quot; überleiten.
Was haltet ihr davon, es so zu machen? Oder ist es nicht scientific genug?
please comment. Alex.

Grüß Gott!
Also ich finde das cool was du geschrieben hast und man kann doch gut darauf aufbauen. Wieso hat mein Upload dich unterbrochen? Passt doch alles ganz gut zusammen und es ist ja auch ein ganz anderes Thema wie das was ich geschrieben habe... Findest du, dass das nicht zusammen passt? Ich würde sagen, dass du das unbedingt stehen lassen solltest. Es würde sich doch anbieten von dort aus zur &quot;History&quot; überzuleiten und von dort zum Hirnkaschterl an sich... was ist deine/eure Meinung? Grüße [[User:Tbittlin|Merlin]].

So, ich finde ich habe meinen Teil beigetragen. 
Wir haben jetzt viel zu viele Wörter, 1489, um genau zu sein. Ich hab das nicht alles zusammenbringen können, also irgendwas muss raus. Ich überlass das euch, macht mit meinem Text was ihr wollt, ich hoffe das guckt sich noch jemand vor 12 an.
schöne grüße, Alex.

Sodele...
Der dialektische Dialog als Wesen des Wikigedankens nimmt ja langsam Form an. Hab die Überschriften wieder eingeführt, weil es ohne einfach scheiße ist. Den Table of contents können wir ja erstmal ausgeblended lassen, damit sich niemand an einen Wikipediaartikel erinnert fühlt... Ich finde wir sollten aber noch an der inhaltlichen Aussagekraft des BUCHkapitels arbeiten. Vielleicht könnten wir auch was über ethische Verantwortung schreiben, hab mal nen link zu den &quot;ethic code&quot; der APA hinzugefügt. Grüße [[User:Tbittlin|merlin]]

== Sources in text ==

The sources need to be explicitly stated inside of the text. There are some issues with language usage which makes some of the skews facts. I changed a few areas to more accuratly represent the truth, such as the fact that Chomsky wasn't the only reason for the fall of behavioral dominance in America; just one of the major reasons.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, some notes...
First the good parts. The collection of themes are good. You get a lot of information in a clear way.

Just some hints before the final date: What you still need are pictures. Either pictures of our brain, there are many colorful pictures or the machines themselves. Maybe you could show the difference between the old x-ray pictures in comparison to today's modern ones. A part I didn't quite understand was the part about MRI. What is the difference with parallel and antiparallel magnetic fields. Maybe it would be possible for you to somehow rewrite this part. Another suggestion would be that you have some kind of sum up of the used techniques and when they are applied. This could be as well done at the beginning. It would be nicer to have a more open beginning as it is for example done in the first chapter. Here you could introduce a patient and discuss which method would be probably the right one.
&quot;Der rote Faden&quot; couldn't be found in your text, but I'm aware that it is quite hard to get evolution and usefulness into this chapter. But what might me still possible is to draw some connection to other chapters. For example in which of the psychological research is which method used. If you have still questions just ask!

      <comment>/* Some Chemicals to Test */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An acid and base indicator is a chemical that shows whether different chemicals are '''acids''' (like lemon juice) or '''bases''' (like baking powder). This is called a chemical's '''pH'''. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice. The cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is. 

We often use a test like this to make sure swimming pools are kept at the right pH. If the water in a swimming pool is too acidic or too basic (alkaline), it can damage pool equipment, bathing suits, or stop the chlorine that keeps pools clean from working properly. 

pH is measured on a scale of 1 to 14. Neutral chemicals have a pH of 7. Acidic chemicals have a pH of 1-6. Basic (alkaline) chemicals have a pH of 8-14.

==The Experiment==
===Safety===
As with all experiments, you should consult an adult before beginning. Some acids and bases can hurt your skin, so you should wear:
* Rubber gloves
* An apron
* Safety glasses (regular glasses, sunglasses or swimming goggles are okay if you don't have glasses).
 
If you get chemicals on your hands or gloves, do not touch your eyes! Wash your hands after completing the experiment.

===What You Need===
* A red cabbage
* A knife or grater
* A medium sized bowl
* At least 4 small cups
* Chemicals to test such as lemon juice and baking powder or soda 
[[Image:Knifeoncabbage.png|200px|right]]
===Step 1===
[[Image:Red_Cabbage_Cups.jpg|300px|right]]
[[Image:Spotting tile.png|150px|right]]
* Have a parent, guardian, or teacher help you cut or grate between a quarter or a half of the cabbage into small pieces.
* Put the cabbage into a medium sized bowl.
* Pour water over the cabbage. You can use cold water, warm or boiling water. Boiling water will work the fastest, but only boil the water if you have an adult to help you.
* Let the cabbage sit in the water for a while (30-45 minutes), until the water turns a deep purple colour. You can stir the mixture to speed up the process.

===Step 2===
* Using a coffee filter or a fine sieve, strain the juice into a cup. It should be deep bluish purple in colour.
* Pour equal amounts of the strained liquid into small plastic cups. These are your 'test tubes' in which you will test different chemicals.

===Step 3===
* Set one of your cups ('test tubes') aside. This is your control. It already contains water, which usually has a pH of 7. This means that water is neither an acid nor a base.
* Assemble some testing chemicals (some good ones to try are below)
* Label each cup with the name of the test chemical each cup will contain, so you will remember what you put in each cup.
* Which chemical do you think is the most acidic?

===Step 4===
* Pour, drip or spoon a small quantity of each test chemical into the cup labeled with its name.  
* Observe the change in colour of the juice. If the juice turns reddish, the chemical you are testing is an acid. If the water turns bluish, the chemical you are testing is a base. If it stays the same, the chemical is neutral, like water. 


==Some Chemicals to Test==
* Lemon juice
* Baking powder or soda
* Milk
* Yogurt
* Vinegar
* Soap

==Observations==
* Arrange your cups from pink to red to violet to purple to blue to green. You might not have all of these colours. 
* The cup that is most red is the most acidic. The cup that is the most blue or green is the most basic (alkaline). Which chemical is the most acidic? Which is the most basic (alkaline)?

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm new to Blender and also I don't use Wikibooks, and I'd feel weird editing something when I'm just a stranger, but they never tell you to switch to vertex mode. If I haven't done 3D modeling before, I would've been very lost. From the previous lesson, you're working with the faces. And this one introduces vertexes without even telling them to switch.

Has the name changed? This page refers to &quot;3D Transform Widgets&quot; but it looks to me like this is now called &quot;Use 3D Transform Manipulator&quot;. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 23:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)


The hand icon mentioned in the quickie model page is a hand with only one finger up. 
I'm currently using os x so it may be different in this version.

== Hand icon needs to be updated ==

I'm using Blender 2.42a (Ubuntu Linux 6.10 packaged version), and the 3D transform manipulator is represented by a hand with just one finger up. The image needs to be updated.

== Axis indicator lock ==

Selecting &quot;Active Object&quot; Didn't prevent the blue dot and arrows (axis indicators) from going onto the vertex I wish to select. I used &quot;3D Cursor&quot; instead, making the indicators remain in the center, since the 3D cursor is there.

Using version 2.43 on Kubuntu 7.04.


= Selecting vertices =

I've tidied up the sentence about vertex colours in non-default GUI themes, but I'm not sure it even needs to be there. This guide is for noobs, right? So I don't think it's right to start confusing people with the suggestion of changing themes etc. as it distracts the reader from the point. Anyway I've tidied the sentence up. Chop it out, I say.

== Redundant Page ==

This page has been almost completely covered by earlier pages in the guide.  Perhaps it should be taken out and those other pages updated with the video, and some of the details that this page has?

As a newbie, I basically skipped over it, due to the earlier hands-on version of this page.  There were a couple of tidbits that hadn't been covered, but with the earlier instruction sets under my belt, I didn't need this page.  

I know.. it's up to me to change it, but I'm totally new to blender, so I'm not going to presume that I know better about what and how I need to learn the information.  SO I'm just putting this out there, in the hopes that wiser heads will prevail.

== Doesn't Work ==

If you extrude downwards and then merge the top it'll also merge the middle for some reason. This probably has something to do with the fact that when you select only the top vertices, both edges are selected on the vertical side. I got around this by just making a ring after making it taller and then joining the top.</text>

== My thoughts on &quot;Motivation and Emotion&quot; ==

I don't doubt that the author of this page knows his/her stuff when it comes to &quot;Motivation and Emotion.&quot;  My problem is with how the majority of the sentences are constructed.  Basic rules of grammar are broken at every turn.  Now if this was prose by F. Scott Fitzgerald, then I'd leave it alone.  However, this is supposed to be more like a textbook if I'm not mistaken.  One example of syntax error is a sentence that I edited.  It read, &quot;If a person is depleted of energy, dehydrated, or freezing...&quot;  I'm going to sound nitpicky here, but as far as I'm concerned rules are rules, and the way this sentence was written makes it sound like a person could be depleted of dehydrated.  It's as if energy is the first in a series of things of which a person could be depleted.  When it comes to what the reader might be thinking, the writer should take nothing for granted.  So I edited the beginning of that sentence and it now reads, &quot;If a person is dehydrated, freezing, or exhausted...&quot;  I think that sounds much better and makes more sense.  

I sent an email to the powers that be at wikibooks about such grammatical mistakes, but that was before I realized that I could give my thoughts in this method.  I'm not trying to belittle anyone's writing.  I'm just trying to make things better.  I'm sure you all take pride in the knowledge you have on the various subjects displayed here.  I think you should also take pride in the way you communicate such knowledge to people like me.  When in doubt about the correctness of a sentence, just ask someone.  

I applaud the hard work put forth by anyone who shares their knowledge on a subject like psychology so please keep up the good work.  Who knows, if I could assemble all of my knowledge on grammar and English, maybe I could provide an addition to the Language section of wikibooks.

Thank you for your consideration...

== Introduction ==  	 
 		 
What is happening inside my head when I listen to a sentence? How do I process written words? This chapter will take a closer look on brain processes concerned with language comprehension. Dealing with natural language understanding, we distinguish between the neuroscientific and the psycholinguistic approach. As text understanding spreads through the broad field of cognitive psychology, linguistics, and neurosciences, our main focus will lay on the intersection of two latter, which is known as neurolinguistics.

Different brain areas need to be examined in order to find out how words and sentences are being processed. For long time scientist were restricted to draw conclusions from certain brain lesions to the functions of corresponding brain areas. During the last 40 years techniques for brain imaging and ERP-measurement have been established which allow for a more accurate identification of brain parts involved in language processing.  

Scientific studies on these phenomena are generally divided into research on auditory and visual language comprehension; we will discuss both. Not to forget is that it is not enough to examine English: To understand language processing in general, we have to look at non-Indo-European and other language systems like sign language. But first of all we will be concerned with a rough localization of language in the brain. 


== Lateralization of language ==

Although functional lateralization studies and analyses find individual differences in personality or cognitive style don't favor one hemisphere or the other, some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left and attention on the right (Nielson, Zielinski, Ferguson, Lainhart &amp; Anderson, [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0071275 2013]). There is a lot of evidence that each brain hemisphere has its own distinct functions in language comprehension. Most often, the right hemisphere is referred to as the non-dominant hemisphere and the left is seen as the dominant hemisphere. This distinction is called lateralization (from the Latin word lateral, meaning sidewise) and reason for it first was raised by experiments with split-brain patients. Following a top-down approach we will then discuss the right hemisphere which might have the mayor role in higher level comprehension, but is not quite well understood. Much research has been done on the left hemisphere and we will discuss why it might be dominant before the following sections discuss the fairly well understood fundamental processing of language in this hemisphere of the brain.

=== Functional asymmetry ===

''' Anatomical differences between left and right hemisphere '''

Initially we will consider the most apparent part of a differentiation between left and right hemisphere: Their differences in shape and structure. As visible to the naked eye there exists a clear asymmetry between the two halves of the human brain: The right hemisphere typically has a bigger, wider and farther extended frontal region than the left hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is bigger, wider and extends farther in it’s occipital region (M. T. Banich,&quot;Neuropsychology&quot;, ch.3, pg.92). Significantly larger on the left side in most human brains is a certain part of the temporal lobe’s surface, which is called the planum temporale. It is localized near Wernicke’s area and other auditory association areas, wherefore we can already speculate that the left hemisphere might be stronger involved in processes of language and speech treatment.

In fact such a left laterality of language functions is evident in 97% of the population (D. Purves, &quot;Neuroscience&quot;, ch.26, pg.649). But actually the percentage of human brains, in which a &quot;left-dominance&quot; of the planum temporale is traceable, is only 67% (D. Purves, &quot;Neuroscience&quot;, ch.26, pg.648). Which other factors play aunsolved yet. 

''' Evidence for functional asymmetry from &quot;split brain&quot; patients '''

In hard cases of epilepsy a rarely performed but popular surgical method to reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures is the so-called corpus callosotomy. Here a radical cut through the connecting &quot;communication bridge&quot; between right and left hemisphere, the corpus callosum, is done; the result is a &quot;split-brain&quot;. For patients whose corpus callosum is cut, the risk of accidental physical injury is mitigated, but the side-effect is striking: Due to this eradicative transection of left and right half of the brain these two are not longer able to communicate adequately. This situation provides the opportunity to study differentiation of functionality between the hemispheres. First experiments with split-brain patients were performed by Roger Sperry and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology in 1960 and 1970 (D. Purves, &quot;Neuroscience&quot;, ch.26, pg.646). They lead researchers to sweeping conclusions about laterality of speech and the organization of the human brain in general.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 style=&quot;background:#99CCCC&quot;
| '''A digression on the laterality of the visual system''' 
|- 
|
[[Image:Gray722.png|thumbnail|Visual system]]A visual stimulus, located within the left visual field, projects onto the nasal (inner) part of the left eye’s retina and onto the temporal (outer) part of the right eye’s retina. Images on the temporal retinal region are processed in the visual cortex of the same side of the brain (ipsilateral), whereas nasal retinal information is mapped onto the opposite half of the brain (contralateral).
The stimulus within the left visual field will completely arrive in the right visual cortex to be processed and worked up. In &quot;healthy&quot; brains this information furthermore attains the left hemisphere via the corpus callosum and can be integrated there. In split-brain patients this current of signals is interrupted; the stimulus remains &quot;invisible&quot; for the left hemisphere. 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

[[Image:SplitBrainExperiments.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Split Brain Experiments]]The experiment we consider now is based on the laterality of the visual system: What is seen in the left half of the visual field will be processed in the right hemisphere and vice versa. Aware of this principle a test operator presents the picture of an object to one half of the visual field while the participant is instructed to name the seen object, and to blindly pick it out of an amount of concrete objects with the contralateral hand.
It can be shown that a picture, for example the drawing of a die, which has only been presented to the left hemisphere, can be named by the participant (&quot;I saw a die&quot;), but is not selectable with the right hand (no idea which object to choose from the table). Contrarily the participant is unable to name the die, if it was recognized in the right hemisphere, but easily picks it out of the heap of objects on the table with the help of the left hand.  

These outcomes are clear evidence of the human brain’s functional asymmetry. The left hemisphere seems to dominate functions of speech and language processing, but is unable to handle spatial tasks like vision-independent object recognition. The right hemisphere seems to dominate spatial functions, but is unable to process words and meaning independently. In a second experiment evidence arose that a split-brain patient can only follow a written command (like &quot;get up now!&quot;), if it is presented to the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere can only &quot;understand&quot; pictorial instructions.

The following table (D. Purves, &quot;Neuroscience&quot;, ch.26, pg.647) gives a rough distinction of functions: 

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| '''Left Hemisphere''' 
| '''Right Hemisphere''' 
|- 
| 
* analysis of right visual field
* language processing
** writing
** speech
|
* analysis of left visual field
* spatial tasks
* visuospatial tasks
* object and face recognition
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

First it is important to keep in mind that these distinctions comprise only functional dominances, no exclusive competences. In cases of unilateral brain damage, often one half of the brain takes over tasks of the other one. Furthermore it should be mentioned that this experiment works only for stimuli presented for less than a second. This is because not only the corpus callosum, but as well some subcortical comissures serve for interhemispheric transfer. In general both can simultaneously contribute to performance, since they use complement roles in processing.

{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 style=&quot;background:#99CCCC&quot;
| '''A digression on handedness''' 
|- 
|
An important issue, when exploring the different brain organization, is handedness, which is the tendency to use the left or the right hand to perform activities. Throughout history, left-handers, which only comprise about 10% of the population, have often been considered being something abnormal. They were said to be evil, stubborn, defiant and were, even until the mid 20th century, forced to write with their right hand.

One most commonly accepted idea, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labour. Since both speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, the presumption here is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. The theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labour. 

In right handers, verbal processing is mostly done in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Therefore, 95% of speech output is controlled by the left brain hemisphere, whereas only 5% of individuals control speech output in their right hemisphere. Left-handers, on the other hand, have a heterogeneous brain organization. Their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right handers, the opposite way, or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. But usually, in 70% of the cases, speech is controlled by the left-hemisphere, 15% by the right and 15% by either hemisphere. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it appears that left-handers are less lateralized. 

After, for example, damage occurs to the left hemisphere, it follows that there is a visuospatial deficit, which is usually more severe in left-handers than in right-handers. Dissimilarities may derive, in part, from differences in brain morphology, which concludes from asymmetries in the planum temporale. Still, it can be assumed that left-handers have less division of labour between their two hemispheres than right-handers do and are more likely to lack neuroanatomical asymmetries.

There have been many theories as to find out why people are left-handed and what its consequences may be. Some people say that left-handers have a shorter life span or higher accident rates or autoimmune disorders. According to the theory of Geschwind and Galaburda, there is a relation to sex hormones, the immune system, and profiles of cognitive abilities that determine, whether a person is left-handed or not. Concludingly, many genetic models have been proposed, yet the causes and consequences still remain a mystery (M.T.Banich, &quot;Neuropsychology&quot;, ch.3, pg. 119).  
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== The right hemisphere ===

''' The role of the right hemisphere in text comprehension '''

The experiments with &quot;split-brain&quot; patients and evidence that will be discussed soon suggest that the right hemisphere is usually not (but in some cases, e.g. 15% of left handed people) dominant in language comprehension. What is most often ascribed to the right hemisphere is cognitive functioning. When damage is done to this part of the brain or when temporal regions of the right hemisphere are removed, this can lead to cognitive-communication problems, such as impaired memory, attention problems, and poor reasoning (L. Cherney, 2001). Investigations lead to the conclusion that the right hemisphere processes information in a gestalt and holistic fashion, with a special emphasis on spatial relationships. Here, an advantage arises for differentiating two distinct faces because it examines things in a global manner and it also reacts to lower spatial, and also auditory, frequency. The former point can be undermined with the fact that the right hemisphere is capable of reading most concrete words and can make simple grammatical comparisons (M. T. Banich,“Neuropsychology“, ch.3, pg.97). But in order to function in such a way, there must be some sort of communication between the brain halves.

''' Prosody - the sound envelope around words '''

Consider how different the simple statement &quot;She did it again&quot; could be interpreted in the following context taken from Banich:
LYNN: Alice is way into this mountain-biking thing. After breaking her arm, you'd think she'd be a little more cautious. But then yesterday, she went out and rode Captain Jack's. That trail is gnarly - narrow with lots of tree roots and rocks. And last night, I heard that she took a bad tumble on her way down.
SARA: ''She did it again''
Does Sara say that with rising pitch or emphatically and with falling intonation? In the first case she would ask whether Alice has injured herself again. In the other case she asserts something she knows or imagines: That Alice managed to hurt herself a second time. Obviously the sound envelope around words - prosody - does matter.

Reason to belief that recognition of prosodic patterns appears in the right hemisphere arises when you take into account patients that have damage to an anterior region of the right hemisphere. They suffer from '''aprosodic''' speech, that is, their utterances are all at the same pitch. They might sound like a robot from the 80ties. There is another phenomena appearing from brain damage: '''dysprosodic''' speech. In that case the patient speaks with disordered intonation. This is not due to a right hemisphere lesion, but arises when damage to the left hemisphere is suffered. The explanation is that the left hemisphere gives ill-timed prosodic cues to the right hemisphere, thus proper intonation is affected. 

''' Beyond words: Inference from a neurological point of view '''

On the word level, the current studies are mostly consistent with each other and with findings from brain lesion studies. But when it comes to the more complex understanding of whole sentences, texts and storylines, the findings are split. According to E. C. Ferstl’s review “The Neuroanatomy of Text Comprehension. What’s the story so far?” (2004), there is evidence for and against right hemisphere regions playing the key role in pragmatics and text comprehension. On the current state of knowledge, we cannot exactly say how and where cognitive functions like building situation models and inferencing work together with “pure” language processes.

As this chapter is concerned with the neurology of language, it should be remarked that patients with right hemisphere damage have difficulties with inferencing. Take into account the following sentence:

''With mosquitoes, gnats, and grasshoppers flying all about, she came across a small black bug that was being used to eavesdrop on her conversation.''

You might have to reinterpret the sentence until you realize that &quot;small black bug&quot; does not refer to an animal but rather to a spy device. People with damage in the right hemisphere have problems to do so. They have difficulty to follow the thread of a story and to make inferences about what has been said. Furthermore they have a hard time understanding non-literal aspects of sentences like metaphors, so they might be really horrified when they hear that someone was &quot;Crying her eyes out&quot;.

===  The left hemisphere ===

''' Further evidence for left hemisphere dominance: The Wada technique '''

Before concerning concrete functionality of the left hemisphere, further evidence for the dominance of the left hemisphere is provided. Of relevance is the so-called Wada technique, allowing testing which hemisphere is responsible for speech output and usually being used in epilepsy patients during surgery. It is not a brain imaging technique, but simulates a brain lesion. One of the hemispheres is anesthetized by injecting a barbiturate (sodium amobarbital) in one of the patient’s carotid arteries. Then he is asked to name a number of items on cards. When he is not able to do that, despite the fact that he could do it an hour earlier, the concerned hemisphere is said to be the one responsible for speech output. This test must be done twice, for there is a chance that the patient produces speech bilaterally. The probability for that is not very high, in fact, according to Rasmussen &amp; Milner 1997a (as referred to in Banich, p.293) it occurs only in 15 % of the left-handers and none of the right-handers. (It is still unclear where these differences in left-handers’ brains come from.)

That means that in most people, only one hemisphere “produces” speech output – and in 96% of right-handers and 70% of left-handers, it is the left one. The findings of the brain lesion studies about asymmetry were confirmed here: Normally (in healthy right-handers), the left hemisphere controls speech output.

''' Explanations of left hemisphere dominance '''

Two theories why the left hemisphere might have special language capacities are still discussed. The first states that dominance of the left hemisphere is due to a specialization for '''precise temporal control of oral and manual articulators'''. Here the main argument is that gestures related to a story line are most often made with the right and therefore by the left hemisphere controlled hand whilst other hand movements appear equally often with both hands. The other theory says that the left hemisphere is dominant because it is specialized for '''linguistic processing''' and is due to a single patient - a speaker of American Sign Language with a left hemisphere lesion. He could neither produce nor comprehend ASL, but could still communicate by using gestures in non-linguistic domains.

''' How innate is the organisational structure of the brain? '''

Not only cases of left-handers but also brain imaging techniques have shown examples of bilateral language processing: According to ERP studies (by Bellugi et al. 1994 and Neville et al. 1993 as cited in E. Dabrowska, &quot;Language, Mind an Brain&quot; 2004, p.57), people with the Williams’ syndrome (WS) also have no dominant hemisphere for language. WS patients have a lot of physical and mental disorders, but show, compared to their other (poor) cognitive abilities, very good linguistic skills. And these skills do not rely on one dominant hemisphere, but both of them contribute equally. So, whilst the majority of the population has a dominant left hemisphere for language processing there are a variety of exceptions to that dominance. That there are different “organisation possibilities” in individual brains Dabrowska (p.57) suggests that the organisational structure in the brain could be less innate and fixed as it is commonly thought.

== Auditory Language Processing ==

This section will explain where and how language is processed. To avoid intersections with visual processes we will firstly concentrate on spoken language.
Scientists have developed three approaches of conceiving information about this issue. The first two approaches are based upon brain lesions, namely aphasia, whereas the recent approach relies on results of on modern brain-image techniques.

=== Neurological Perspective ===

The Neurological Perspective describes which pathways language follows in order to be comprehended. Scientists revealed that there are concrete areas inside the brain where concrete tasks of language processing are taking place. The most known areas are the Broca and the Wernicke Area.

''' Broca’s aphasia '''

[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumbnail|Broca's and Wernicke's area]] One of the most well-known aphasias is Broca’s aphasia that causes patients to be unable to speak fluently. Moreover they have a great difficulty producing words. Comprehension, however, is relatively intact in those patients. Because these symptoms do not result from motoric problems of the vocal musculature, a region in the brain that is responsible for linguistic output must be lesioned. Broca discovered that the brain region causing fluent speech is responsible for linguistic output, must be located ventrally in the frontal lobe, anterior to the motor strip. Recent research suggested that Broca`s aphasia results also from subcortical tissue and white matter and not only cortical tissue.

&lt;/center&gt;

''' Wernicke‘s aphasia '''

Another very famous aphasia, known as Wernicke`s aphasia, causes opposite syndromes. Patients suffering from Wernicke`s aphasia usually speak very fluently, words are pronounced correctly, but they are combined senselessly – “word salad” is the way it is most often described. Understanding what patients of Wernicke`s aphasia say is especially difficult, because they use paraphasias (substitution of a word in verbal paraphasia, of word with similar meaning in semantic paraphasia, and of a phoneme in phonemic paraphasia) and neologisms. With Wernicke`s aphasia the comprehension of simple sentences is a very difficult task. Moreover their ability to process auditory language input and also written language is impaired. With some knowledge about the brainstructure and their tasks one is able to conclude that the area that causes Wernicke`s aphasia, is situated at the joint of temporal, parietal and occipital regions, near Heschl`s gyrus (primary auditory area), because all the areas receiving and interpreting sensory information (posterior cortex), and those connecting the sensory information to meaning (parietal lobe) are likely to be involved.

&lt;/center&gt;

''' Conduction aphasia '''

Wernicke supposed that an aphasia between Broca‘s area and Wernicke‘s area, namely conduction aphasia, would lead to severe problems to repeat just heard sentences rather than having problems with the comprehension and production of speech. Indeed patients suffering from this kind of aphasia show an inability to reproduce sentences since they often make phonemic paraphasias, may substitute or leave out words, or might say nothing. Investigations determined that the &quot;connection cable&quot;, namely the arcuate fasciculus between Wernicke‘s and Broca‘s area is almost invariably damaged in case of a conduction aphasia. That is why conduction aphasia is also regarded as a disconnection syndrome (the behavioural dysfunction because of a damage to the connection of two connected brain regions).

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

''' Transcortical motor aphasia and global aphasia '''

Transcortical motor aphasia, another brain lesion caused by a connection disruption, is very similar to Broca`s aphasia, with the difference that the ability to repeat is kept. In fact people with a transcortical motor aphasia often suffer from echolalia, the need to repeat what they just heard. Usually patients` brain is damaged outside Broca`s area, sometimes more anterior and sometimes more superior. Individuals with transcortical sensory aphasia have similar symptoms as those suffering from Wernicke`s aphasia, except that they show signs of echolalia. 
Lesions in great parts of the left hemisphere lead to global aphasia, and thus to an inability of both comprehending and producing language, because not only Broca`s or Wenicke`s area is damaged. (Barnich, 1997, pp.276-282)

=== Psychological Perspective ===

Since the 1960‘s psychologists and psycholinguists tried to resolve how language is organised and represented inside the brain. Patients with aphasias gave good evidence for location and discrimination of the three main parts of language comprehension and production, namely phonology, syntax and semantics.  

''' Phonology ''' 

Phonology deals with the processing of meaningful parts of speech resulting from the mere sound. More over there exists a differentiation between a phonemic representation of a speech sound which are the smallest units of sounds that leads to different meanings (e.g. the /b/ and /p/ in bet and pat) and phonetic representation. The latter means that a speech sound may be produced in a different manner at different situations. For instance the /p/ in pill sounds different than the /p/ in spill since the former /p/ is aspirated and the latter is not.

Examining which parts are responsible for phonetic representation, patients with Broca`s or Wernicke`s aphasia can be compared. As the speech characteristic for patients with Broca`s aphasia is non-fluent, i.e. they have problems producing the correct phonetic and phonemic representation of a sound, and people with Wernicke`s aphasia do not show any problems speaking fluently, but also have problems producing the right phoneme. This indicates that Broca`s area is mainly involved in phonological production and also, that phonemic and phonetic representation do not take place in the same part of the brain. Scientists examined on a more precise level the speech production, on the level of the distinctive features of phonemes, to see in which features patients with aphasia made mistakes. 

A distinctive feature describes the different manners and places of articulation. /t/ (like in touch) and /s/ (like in such) for example are created at the same place but produced in different manner. /t/ and /d/ are created at the same place and in the same manner but they differ in voicing. 

Results show that in fluent as well as in non-fluent aphasia patients usually mix up only one distinctive feature, not two. In general it can be said that errors connected to the place of articulation are more common than those linked to voicing. Interestingly some aphasia patients are well aware of the different features of two phonemes, yet they are unable to produce the right sound. This suggests that though patients have great difficulty pronouncing words correctly, their comprehension of words is still quite good. This is characteristic for patients with Broca`s aphasia, while those with Wernicke`s aphasia show contrary symptoms: they are able to pronounce words correctly, but cannot understand what the words mean. That is why they often utter phonologically correct words (neologisms) that are not real words with a meaning. 
 
''' Syntax ''' 

Syntax describes the rules of how words must be arranged to result in meaningful sentences. 
Humans in general usually know the syntax of their mother tongue and thus slip their tongue if a word happens to be out of order in a sentence. People with aphasia, however, often have problems with parsing of sentences, not only with respect to the production of language but also with respect to comprehension of sentences. Patients showing an inability of comprehension and production of sentences usually have some kind of anterior aphasia, also called agrammatical aphasia. This can be revealed in tests with sentences. These patients cannot distinguish between active and passive voice easily if both agent and object could play an active part. For example patients do not see a difference between “The boy chased the girl” and “The boy was chased by the girl”, but they do understand both “The boy saw the apple” and “The apple was seen by the boy”, because they can seek help of semantics and do not have to rely on syntax alone. Patients with posterior aphasia, like for example Wernicke`s aphasia, do not show these symptoms, as their speech is fluent. Comprehension by mere syntactic means would be possible as well, but the semantic aspect must be considered as well. This will be discussed in the next part.

''' Semantics ''' 

Semantics deals with the meaning of words and sentences. 
It has been shown that patients suffering from posterior aphasia have severe problems understanding simple texts, although their knowledge of syntax is intact. The semantic shortcoming is often examined by a Token Test, a test in which patients have to point to objects referred to in simple sentences. As might have been guessed, people with anterior aphasia have no problems with semantics, yet they might not be able to understand longer sentences because the knowledge of syntax then is involved as well.

&lt;/center&gt;


In general studies with lesioned people have shown that anterior areas are needed for speech output and posterior regions for speech comprehension. As mentioned above anterior regions are also more important for syntactic processing, while posterior regions are involved in semantic processing. But such a strict division of the parts of the brain and their responsibilities is not possible, because posterior regions must be important for more than just sentence comprehension, as patients with lesions in this area can neither comprehend nor produce any speech. (Barnich, 1997, pp.283-293)

=== Evidence from Advanced Neuroscience Methods ===

Measuring the functions of both normal and damaged brains has been possible since the 1970s, when the first brain imaging techniques were developed. With them, we are able to “watch the brain working” while the subject is e.g. listening to a joke. These methods (further described in chapter 4) show whether the earlier findings are correct and precise.

Generally, imaging shows that certain functional brain regions are much smaller than estimated in brain lesion studies, and that their boundaries are more distinct (cf. Banich p.294). The exact location varies individually, therefore bringing the results of many brain lesion studies together caused too big estimated functional regions before. For example, stimulating brain tissue electrically (during epilepsy surgery) and observing the outcome (e.g. errors in naming tasks) led to a much better knowledge where language processing areas are located.

PET studies (Fiez &amp; Petersen, 1993, as cited in Banich, p.295) have shown that in fact both anterior and posterior regions were activated in language comprehension and processing, but with different strengths – in agreement with the lesion studies. The more active speech production is required in experiments, the more frontal is the main activation: For example, when the presented words must be repeated.

Another result (Raichle et al. 1994, as referred to in Banich, p.295) was that the familiarity of the stimuli plays a big role. When the subjects were presented well-known stimuli sets in well-known experimental tasks and had to repeat them, anterior regions were activated. Those regions were known to cause conduction aphasia when damaged. But when the words were new ones, and/or the subjects never had to do a task like this before, the activation was recorded more posterior. That means, when you repeat an unexpected word, the heaviest working brain tissue is about somewhere under your upper left earlap, but when you knew this word that would be the next to repeat before, it is a bit nearer to your left eye.

== Visual Language Processing ==

The processing of written language is performed when we are reading or writing and is thought to happen in a distinct neural processing unit than auditory language processing. Reading and writing respectively rely on vision whereas spoken language is first mediated by the auditory system. Language systems responsible for written language processing have to interact with a sensory system different from the one involved in spoken language processing.

Visual language processing in general begins when the visual forms of letters (“c” or “C” or “c”) are mapped onto abstract letter identities. These are then mapped onto a word form and the corresponding semantic representation (the “meaning” of the word, i.e. the concept behind it). Observations of patients that lost a language ability due to a brain damage led to different disease patterns that indicated a difference between perception (reading) and production (writing) of visual language just like it is found in non-visual language processing.

Alexic patients possess the ability to write while not being able to read whereas patients with agraphia are able to read but cannot write. Though alexia and agraphia often occur together as a result of damage to the angular gyrus, there were patients found having alexia without agraphia (e.g. Greenblatt 1973, as cited in M. T. Banich, “Neuropsychology“, p. 296) or having agraphia without alexia (e.g. Hécaen &amp; Kremin, 1976, as cited in M. T. Banich, “Neuropsychology“, p.296). This is a double dissociation that suggests separate neural control systems for reading and writing.

Since double dissociations are also found in phonological and surface dyslexia, experimental results support the theory that language production and perception respectively are subdivided into separate neural circuits. The two route model shows how these two neural circuits are believed to provide pathways from written words to thoughts and from thoughts to written words.                         

=== Two routes model ===

[[Image:1_1_twoRouteModelInReading.JPG|thumb|395px|1.1. Each route derives the meaning of a word or the word of a meaning in a different way]]In essence, the two routes model contains two routes. Each of them derives the meaning of a word or the word of a meaning in a different way, depending on how familiar we are with the word. 

Using the '''phonological route''' means having an intermediate step between perceiving and comprehending of written language. This intermediate step takes places when we are making use of grapheme-to-phoneme rules. Grapheme-to-phoneme rules are a way of determining the phonological representation for a given grapheme. A grapheme is the smallest written unit of a word (e.g. “sh” in “shore”) that represents a phoneme. A phoneme on the other hand is the smallest phonological unit of a word distinguishing it from another word that otherwise sounds the same (e.g. “bat” and “cat”). People learning to read or are encountering new words often use the phonological route to arrive at a meaning representation. They construct phonemes for each grapheme and then combine the individual phonemes to a sound pattern that is associated with a certain meaning (see 1.1).

The '''direct route''' is supposed to work without an intermediate phonological representation, so that print is directly associated with word-meaning. A situation in which the direct route has to be taken is when reading an irregular word like “colonel”. Application of grapheme-to-phoneme rules would lead to an incorrect phonological representation.

According to Taft (1982, as referred to in M. T. Banich,“Neuropsychology“, p.297) and others the direct route is supposed to be faster than the phonological route since it does not make use of a “phonological detour” and is therefore said to be used for known words ( see 1.1).
However, this is just one point of view and others, like Chastain (1987, as referred to in M. T. Banich, “Neuropsychology“, p.297), postulate a reliance on the phonological route even in skilled readers.

=== The processing of written language in reading ===

[[Image:1_2_TwoRouteModelIrregularWords.JPG|left|thumb|353px|1.2. Regularity effects are common in cases of surface alexia]]Several kinds of alexia could be differentiated, often depending on whether the phonological or the direct route was impaired. Patients with brain lesions participated in experiments where they had to read out words and non-words as well as irregular words. Reading of non-words for example requires access to the phonological route since there cannot be a “stored” meaning or a sound representation for this combination of letters.
Patients with a lesion in temporal structures of the left hemisphere (the exact location varies) suffer from so called '''surface alexia'''. They show the following characteristic symptoms that suggest a strong reliance on the phonological route: 
Very common are regularity effects, that is a mispronunciation of words in which the spelling is irregular like &quot;colonel&quot; or &quot;yacht&quot; (see 1.2).                                                                                                                               
These words are pronounced according to grapheme-to-phoneme rules, although high-frequency irregularly spelled words may be preserved in some cases, the pronunciation according to the phonological route is just wrong.

Furthermore, the would-be pronunciation of a word is reflected in reading-comprehension errors. When asked to describe the meaning of the word “bear”, people suffering from surface alexia would answer something like “a beverage” because the resulting sound pattern of “bear” was the same for these people as that for “beer”. This characteristic goes along with a tendency to confuse homophones (words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings associated). However, these people are still able to read non-words with a regular spelling since they can apply grapheme-to-phoneme rules to them.

[[Image:1_3_TwoRouteModelNonWords.JPG|right|thumb|353px|1.3. Patients with phonological alexia have to rely on the direct route]]In contrast, '''phonological alexia''' is characterised by a disruption in the phonological route due to lesions in more posterior temporal structures of the left hemisphere. Patients can read familiar regular and irregular words by making use of stored information about the meaning associated with that particular visual form (so there is no regularity effect like in surface alexia). However, they are unable to process unknown words or non-words, since they have to rely on the direct route (see 1.3).

Word class effects and morphological errors are common, too. Nouns, for example, are read better than function words and sometimes even better than verbs. Affixes which do not change the grammatical class or meaning of a word (inflectional affixes) are often substituted (e.g. “farmer” instead of “farming”). Furthermore, concrete words are read with a lower error rate than abstract ones like “freedom” (concreteness effect).

'''Deep Alexia''' shares many symptomatic features with phonological alexia such as an inability to read out non-words. Just as in phonological alexia, patients make mistakes on word inflections as well as function words and show visually based errors on abstract words (“desire” → “desert”). In addition to that, people with deep alexia misread words as different words with a strongly related meaning (“woods” instead of “forest”), a phenomenon referred to as semantic paralexia. Coltheart (as referred to in the “Handbook of Neurolinguistics”, ch.41-3, p.563) postulates that reading in deep dyslexia is mediated by the right hemisphere. He suggests that when large lesions affecting language abilities other than reading prevent access to the left hemisphere, the right-hemispheric language store is used. Lexical entries stored there are accessed and used as input to left-hemisphere output systems.

=== The processing of written language in spelling ===

[[Image:1_4_TwoRoutesModelWritig.JPG|thumb|365px|The phonological route is supposed to make use of phoneme-to-grapheme rules while the direct route links thought to writing without an intermediary phonetic representation]]Just like in reading, two separate routes –a phonological and a direct route- are thought to exist. The phonological route is supposed to make use of phoneme-to-grapheme rules while the direct route links thought to writing without an intermediary phonetic representation (see 1.4). 
                                                                    
It should be noted here that there is a difference between phoneme-to-grapheme rules (used for spelling) and grapheme-to-phoneme rules in that one is not simply the reverse of the other. In case of the grapheme “k” the most common phoneme for it is /k/. The most common grapheme for the phoneme /k/, however, is “c”.
Phonological agraphia is caused by a lesion in the left supramarginal gyrus, which is located in the parietal lobe above the posterior section of the Sylvian fissure (M. T. Banich, “Neuropsychology“, p.299). The ability to write regular and irregular words is preserved while the ability to write non-words is not. This, together with a poor retrieval of affixes (which are not stored lexically), indicates an inability to associate spoken words with their orthographic form via phoneme-to-grapheme rules. Patients rely on the direct route, which means that they use orthographic word-form representations that are stored in lexical memory.
Lesions at the conjunction of the posterior parietal lobe and the parieto-occipital junction cause so called lexical agraphia that is sometimes also referred to as surface agraphia. As the name already indicates, it parallels surface alexia in that patients have difficulty to access lexical-orthographic representations of words. Lexical agraphia is characterised by a poor spelling of irregular words but good spelling for regular and non-words. When asked to spell irregular words, patients often commit regularization errors, so that the word is spelled phonologically correct (for example, “whisk” would be written as “wisque”). The BEST to CONNECT is to CAPITALISE the WORDS you WANT TO COMMUNICATE for readers to COMPREHEND.

=== Evidence from Advanced Neuroscience Methods ===

How can we find evidence for the theory of the two routes. Until now neuroscientific research is not able to ascertain that there are neural circuits representing a system like the one described above. The problem of finding evidence for visual language processing on two routes in contrast to one route ( as stated by  e.g. from Seidenberg &amp; McClelland  as referred to in M. T. Banich,“Neuropsychology“, p.308)  is that it is not clear what characteristic brain activation would indicate that it is either happening on two or one routes.
To investigate whether there are one or two systems, neuroimaging studies examine correlations between the activations of the angular gyrus, which is thought to be a crucial brain area in written language processing and other brain regions. It was found out that during reading of non- words ( which would strongly engage the phonological route) the activation is mostly correlated with brain regions which are involved in phonological processing e.g. superior temporal regions (BA 22) and Boca’s  area. During reading of normal words (which would strongly engage the direct route) the highest activation was found in occipital and ventral cortex. That at least can imply that there are two distinct routes. However, these are conclusions drawn from highest correlations which do not ensure this suggestion. What neuroimaging studies do ascertain is that the usage of a phonological and a direct route strongly overlap, which is rather unspectacular since it is quiet reasonable that fluent speaker mix both of the routes.
Other studies additionally provide data in which the activated brain regions during reading of non-words and reading of normal words differ.
ERP studies suggest that the left hemisphere possesses some sort mechanism which response to combinations of letters in a string, or to its orthography and / or to the phonological representation of the string.
ERP waves differ, during early analysis of the visual form of the string, if the string represents a correct word or just pronounceable nonsense (Posner &amp; McCandliss, 1993 as referred in M.T. Banich, „Neuropsychology“p.307-308).
That indicates that this mechanism is sensitive to correct or incorrect words.
 
The opposite hemisphere, the right hemisphere, is in contrast to the left hemisphere, not involved in abstract mapping of word meaning but is rather responsible for encoding word specific visual forms.
ERP and PET studies provides evidence that the right hemisphere responds in a stronger manner than the left hemisphere to letter like strings.  Moreover divided visual field studies reveal that the right hemisphere can better distinguish between different shapes of the same letter (e.g. in different handwritings) than the left hemisphere.
The contribution of visual language processing on both hemispheres is that the right hemisphere first recognizes a written word as letter sequences, no matter how exactly they look like, then the language network in the left hemisphere builds up an abstract representation of the word, which is the comprehension of the word.

== Other symbolic systems ==

Most neurolinguistic research is concerned with production and comprehension of English language, either written or spoken. However, looking at different language systems from a neuroscientific perspective can substantiate as well as differentiate acknowledged theories of language processing. The following section shows how neurological research of three symbolic systems, each different from English in some aspect, has made it possible to distinguish  - at least to some extent - between brain regions that deal with the modality of the language (and therefore may vary from language to language, depending on whether the language in question is e.g. spoken or signed) from brain regions that seem to be necessary to language processing in general  - regardless whether we are dealing with signed, spoken, or even musical language.

=== Kana and Kanji ===

Kana and Kanji are the two writing systems used parallel in the Japanese language. Since different approaches are used in them to represent words, studying Japanese patients with alexia is a great possibility to test the hypothesis about the existence of two different routes to meaning, explicated in the previous section. 

The English writing system is phonological – each grapheme in written English roughly represents one 
speech sound – a consonant or a vowel. There are, however, other possible approaches to writing down a spoken language. In syllabic systems like the Japanese kana, one grapheme stands for one syllable. If written English were syllabic, it could e.g. include a symbol for the syllable “nut”, appearing both in the words “donut” and “peanut”. Syllabic systems are sound-based – since the graphemes represent units of spoken words rather than meaning directly, an auditory representation of the word has to be created in order to arrive at the meaning. Therefore, reading of syllabic systems should require an intact phonological route. In addition to kana, Japanese also use a logographic writing system called kanji, in which one grapheme represents a whole word or a concept. Different from phonological and syllabic systems, logographic systems don’t comprise systematical relationships between visual forms and the way they’re pronounced – instead, visual form is directly associated with the pronunciation and meaning of the corresponding word.  Reading kanji should therefore require the direct route to meaning to be intact. 

The hypothesis about the existence of two different routes to meaning has been confirmed by the fact that after brain damage, there can be a double dissociation between kana and kanji. Some Japanese patients can thus read kana but not kanji (surface alexia), whereas other can read kanji but not kana (phonological alexia). In addition, there is evidence that different brain regions of Japanese native speakers are active while reading kana and kanji, although like in the case of English native speakers, these regions also overlap.

Since the distinction between direct and phonological route also makes sense in case of Japanese, it may be a general principle common to all written languages that reading them relies on two independent (at least partially) systems, both using different strategies to catch the meaning of a written word – either associating the visual form directly with the meaning (the direct route), or using the auditory representation as an intermediary between the visual form and the meaning of the word (the phonological route).

=== Sign Language ===

From a linguistic perspective, sign languages share many features of spoken languages – there are many regionally bounded sign languages, each with a distinct grammar and lexicon. Since at the same time, sign languages differ from spoken languages in the way the words are “uttered”, i.e. in the modality, neuroscientific research in them can yield valuable insights into the question whether there are general neural mechanisms dealing with language, regardless of its modality. 

'''Structure of SL'''

Sign languages are phonological languages - every meaningful sign consists of several phonemes (phonemes used to be called cheremes (Greek χερι: hand) until their cognitive equivalence to phonemes in spoken languages was realized) that carry no meaning as such, but are nevertheless important to distinguish the meaning of the sign. One distinctive feature of SL phonemes is the place of articulation – one hand shape can have different meanings depending on whether it’s produced at the eye-, nose-, or chin-level.  Other features determining the meaning of a sign are hand shape, palm orientation, movement, and non-manual markers (e.g. facial expressions). 

To express syntactic relationships, Sign Languages exploit the advantages of the visuo-spatial medium in which the signs are produced – the syntactic structure of sign languages therefore often differs from that of spoken languages. Two important features of most sign language's grammars (including American Sign Language (ASL), Deutsche Gebärdensprache (DGS) and several other major sign languages) are directionality and simultaneous encoding of elements of information: 

*Directionality

The direction in which the sign is made often determines the subject and the object of a sentence. Nouns in SL can be 'linked' to a particular point in space, and later in the discourse they can be referred to by pointing to that same spot again (this is functionally related to pronouns in English). The object and the subject can then be switched by changing the direction in which the sign for a transitive verb is made.

*Simultaneous encoding of elements of information

The visual medium also makes it possible to encode several pieces of information simultaneously. Consider e.g. the sentence &quot;The flight was long and I didn't enjoy it&quot;. In English, the information about the duration and unpleasantness of the flight have to be encoded sequentially by adding more words to the sentence. To enrich the utterance &quot;The flight was long” with the information about the unpleasantness of the flight, another sentence (“I did not enjoy it&quot;) has to be added to the original one. So, in order to convey more information, the length of the original sentence must grow.
In sign language, however, the increase of information in an utterance doesn’t necessarily increase the length of the utterance. To convey information about the unpleasantness of a long flight experienced in the past, one can just use the single sign for &quot;flight&quot; with the past tense marker, moved in a way that represents the attribute &quot;long&quot;, combined with the facial expression of disaffection. Since all these features are signed simultaneously, no additional time is needed to utter &quot;The flight was long&quot; as compared to &quot;The flight was long and I didn't enjoy it&quot;.

'''Neurology of SL'''

Since sentences in SL are encoded visually, and since its grammar is often based on visual rather than sequential relationships among different signs, it could be suggested that the processing of SL mainly depends on the right hemisphere, which is mainly concerned with the performance on visual and spatial tasks. However, there is evidence suggesting that processing of SL and spoken language might be equally dependant on the left hemisphere, i.e. that the same basic neural mechanism may be responsible for all language functioning, regardless of its modality (i.e. whether the language is spoken or signed). 

The importance of the left hemisphere in SL processing indicated e.g. by the fact that signers with a damaged right hemisphere may not be aphasiacs, whereas as in case of hearing subjects, lesions in the left hemisphere of signers can result in subtle linguistic difficulties (Gordon, 2003). Furthermore, studies of aphasic native signers have shown that damage to anterior portions of the left hemisphere (Broca’s area) result in a syndrome similar to Broca’s aphasia – the patients lose fluency of communication, they aren’t able to correctly use syntactic markers and inflect verbs, although the words they sign are semantically appropriate. In contrast, patients with damages to posterior portions of the superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke’s area) can still properly inflect verbs, set up and retrieve nouns from a discourse locus, but the sequences they sign have no meaning (Poizner, Klima &amp; Bellugi, 1987). So, like in the case of spoken languages, anterior and posterior portions of the left hemisphere seem to be responsible for the syntax and semantics of the language respectively. Hence, it’s not essential for the &quot;syntax processing mechanisms&quot; of the brain whether the syntax is conveyed simultaneously through spatial markers or successively through word order and morphemes added to words - the same underlying mechanisms might be responsible for syntax in both cases.

Further evidence for the same underlying mechanisms for spoken and signed languages comes from studies in which fMRI has been used to compare the language processing of: 

*1. congenitally deaf native signers of British Sign Language,
*2. hearing native signers of BSL (usually hearing children of deaf parents)
*3. hearing signers who have learned BSL after puberty 
*4. non-signing subjects

Investigating language processing in these different groups allows making some distinctions between different factors influencing language organization in the brain -  e.g. to what amount does deafness influences the organization of language in the brain as compared to just having SL as a first language(1 vs. 2), or to what amount does learning of SL as a first language differ from learning SL as native language(1,2 vs.3), or to what amount is language organized in speakers as compared to signers(1,2,3 vs.4).

These studies have shown that typical areas in the left hemisphere are activated in both native English speakers given written stimuli and native signers given signs as stimuli. Moreover, there are also areas that are equally activated both in case of deaf subjects processing sign language and  hearing subjects processing spoken language – a finding which suggests that these areas constitute the core language system regardless of the language modality(Gordon, 2003). 

Different from speakers, however, signers also show a strong activation of the right hemisphere. This is partly due to the necessity to process visuo-spatial information. Some of those areas, however (e.g. the angular gyrus) are only activated in native signers and not in hearing subjects that learned SL after puberty. This suggests that the way of learning sign languages (and languages in general) changes with time: Late learner's brains are unable to recruit certain brain regions specialized for processing this language (Newman et al., 1998).] 

We have seen that evidence from aphasias as well as from neuroimaging suggest the same underlying neural mechanisms to be responsible for sign and spoken languages. It ‘s natural to ask whether these neural mechanisms are even more general, i.e. whether they are able to process any type of symbolic system underlying some syntax and semantics. One example of this kind of more general symbolic system is music.

===Music===

Like language, music is a human universal involving some combinatorial principles that govern the organizing of discrete elements (tones) into structures (phrases) that convey some meaning – music is a symbolic system with a special kind of syntax and semantics. It’s therefore interesting to ask whether music and natural language share some neural mechanisms: whether processing of music is dependent on processing of language or the other way round, or whether the underlying mechanisms underlying them are completely separate. By investigating the neural mechanisms underlying music we might find out whether the neural processes behind language are unique to the domain of natural language, i.e. whether language is modular. Up to now, research in the neurobiology of music has yielded contradicting evidence regarding these questions. 

On the one hand, there is evidence that there is a double dissociation of language and music abilities. People suffering from amusia are unable to perceive harmony, to remember and to recognize even very simple melodies; at the same time they have no problems in comprehending or producing speech. There is even a case of a patient who developed amusia without aprosodia, i.e. although she couldn't recognize tone in musical sequences, she nevertheless could still make use of pitch, loudness, rate, or rhythm to convey meanings in spoken language (Pearce, 2005). This highly selective problem in processing music (amusia) can occur as a result of brain damage, or be inborn; in some cases it runs on families, suggesting a genetic component. The complement syndrome of amusia also exists – after suffering a brain damage in the left hemisphere, the Russian composer Shebalin lost his speech functions, but his musical abilities remained intact (Zatorre, McGill, 2005). 

On the other hand, neuroimaging data suggest that language and music have a common mechanism for processing syntactical structures. The P600 ERP`s in the Broca area, measured as a response to ungrammatical sentences, is also elicited in subjects listening to musical chord sequences lacking harmony (Patel, 2003) – the expectation of typical sequences in music could therefore be mediated by the same neural mechanisms as the expectation of grammatical sequences in language. 

A possible solution to this apparent contradiction is the dual system approach (Patel, 2003) according to which music and language share some procedural mechanisms (frontal brain areas) responsible for processing the general aspects of syntax, but in both cases these mechanisms operate on different representations (posterior brain areas) – notes in case of music and words in case of language.

==Outlook==

Many questions are to be answered, for it is e.g. still unclear whether there is a distinct language module (that you could cut out without causing anything in other brain functions) or not. As Evely C. Ferstl points out in her review, the next step after exploring distinct small regions responsible for subtasks of language processing will be to find out how they work together and build up the language network.

This chapter should be called: Neuroscience of TEXT Comprehension, but unfortunatly no one from our group found out how to rename a chapter without harming the structure of this wikibook.

er...mmh..  ok, i did it! chapter is now renamed, links from previous and next chapter and in the main page are updated. ok...

==discussion points from outer space==
Still a bit to go, but looks cool. Try to insert some pics. Talked with Hibba about it, so ask her :)--[[User:Aschoeke|Aschoeke]] 11:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)


==Japanese kana ==
japanese kana are not syllabic as claimed in the section about kana and kanji. rather the kana represent mora, which is a timing unit smaller than a syllable. would someone like to clean that up?</text>

your text is already very nice, but don't forget that you need almost the double amount of text. (Schmalhofer said 500 words you just have 277)!

Ebenso beim 2ten Review. Der Text ist noch zu kurz. Ich weiss, euer Thema ist net einfach. Mein Tipp: Es gib t in den texten ungelöste Frage, z.b. bei situation models.
Die Probleme könnt ihr aufnehmen und ein bisschen was dazu schreiben. Was sind aktuelle Versuche (auch am Institut) und wohin führen sie?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==OverallStructure==

Our workgroup OverallStructure tries to work out this project of Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience by '''helping''' people how to do things right and remind them on the '''laws''' that we are all restricted to when we publish. We try to give, the groups that work on this book, useful help, inspiration and to remind them on certain '''dead-lines'''. 
Especially at the end we are going to put the chapters together as '''one piece''', to make this a book worth being published and being read.

Working voltage is necessary for a '''workflow''' of our project to succeed. A workflow needs to be split up in sub-units. These '''subunits''' fill up the work schedule which is necessary to keep track of the workload and to stay in the timeframe. 
Here it is important to delegate work to different groups and to have us that has an overlook about what needs to be done and when it is due.

OverallStructure works with the group '''CrossReferences''' closely together. This is required, because otherwise there is the possibility, that we work counterproductive or that we work parallelly on the same thing. Therefor our groups need to find out together what our priorities are and how to put this into practice.

'''Social skills''' is a highly recommended to work in this group. Remembering and criticizing people is risky field. Our comments need to be productive and not to be offensive. We need close interaction with everybody working on this project, just by that it is possible for us to do the required work. We depend on the different groups and they depend on us. Therefor we need some empathy for the nature of humans. 

Hence we expect of people working on this project and especially of ourselves:
*We estimate people to have critical faculties, are able of some kind of self-reflection, self-discipline and tolerance.
*In terms of working in groups, we anticipate everyone to be team-oriented, to cooperate with us and insight of the group, to be discountable, open to use communication skills and we hope to have at least one person in each group with some kind of leader-qualities. 

OverallStructure emphasizes very much '''group-work'''. Working in groups has a lot of advantages: 
It makes a project being more productive and more flexible. Groups always optimize themselves, because each member of the group enhances the work of the others resulting in improved work-results. Each member harvest their own individuality and their own creativity. A group contains a special selfcheck, each member not cooperating get in some ways punished by the rest of the group.  

Paraphrasing this we hope to find people being committed to this project. Our group is a very challenging and implies responsibility from both sides for this project to work and to succeed.

Introduction, as in?? Like to the book, or me, you seem to speak German well, and that is all that is needed, and I need you to work on missing things in the book, and correct my mistakes, because I make A LOT of them. --[[User:German Men92|Je suis]] 21:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

Alright. I will browse through the book, I am also willing to record more audio files, and as I do so, I can also go hunt for errors and goofs in the book.

And thanx for the 'you seem to speak German well' - I am german ;) Anyway, I think we should continue to talk to each other in English, since this is the english Wikibooks, and other users will want to understand us, too.

''But a lot of businesses out there don't see the return on''
''investment, they look at it as a liability, and until they can''
''understand that proactive security actually returns, gives''
''them a return on investment, it's still a hard sell for people.''

The concept of Defence in Depth is going to cost your
organisation money. It is not cheap to implement, and it is
something you have to feed money into every day to maintain.
So why do you do it? The simple answer is to protect the
business. Business of today is no longer just bricks and mortar.
It is no longer just buildings and street addresses. The heart of
business today is information. Take away the information and
the bricks and mortar will be sold off eventually at bankruptcy
auction.

Defence in Depth is all about protecting the information by
building up a number of layers around it. It isn’t simply putting up
and firewall and walking away. Defence in Depth is building a
number of layers around the information that work together to
provide a strong and (hopefully) impenetrable.

This book will most likely not cover a lot of new ground for you.
A lot of the concepts here are standard areas you will cover
working in any IT department. What is new is the aspect of
integrating them into one consolidated defensive strategy.

Nine main areas will be covered. These will include:

# [[/Preparation/]]
# [[/The Technology/]]
# [[/The Business/]]
# [[/The People/]]
# [[/The Physical/]]
# [[/The Policy/]]
# [[/Incident Handling/]]
# [[/Information Warfare and Operations Security/]]
# [[/Putting it together/]]

== Baselining ==

Before you can look at defending anything from attack you need
to know two things:


1. Where does your boundary lie

2. What exactly are you defending


The first requirement is simple. Where is the boundary of your
defences? Where does your domain end and the rest of the
world (i.e. internet) begin? You can’t defend the castle if you are
unsure where the castle wall is located.


The second requirement is just as simple. What is in your
network? What are you defending? What types of defences do
you need to mount? There is a quote from the Art of War (Sun
Zhu), that describe this type of situation well:


If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not
fear the results of a hundred battles


Basically the simple answer is to know what’s out there before
the attacker does (and knowing the enemy will come a little later
in this paper).


Undertaking baselining activity consists of two steps:

* [[../Configuration Control and Documentation/]]
* [[../Performance Measurement/]]

== Configuration Control and Documentation ==



Now every good system administrator will have some
knowledge of the systems they are responsible for in their head,
or on spreadsheets, word files, homegrown database system
etc. However, can you truthfully answer the following questions?


1. Is it 100% up to date?


2. Is it 100% correct?


3. Do your colleagues/boss know where it is and how to
read it?


4. Is this the only copy that exists or do other system
administrators keep similar systems?


These questions highlight the need for configuration control and
a central and unique repository of documentation.


The best way to commence the creation of the central repository
of information is to first determine what currently exists. If a
system administrator is responsible for looking after a large


number of servers and switches, generally they will keep the
information they need to do their job handy. Depending upon
their skill with the tools available to them, this could be anything
from a sophisticated spreadsheet with macros and formulas to a
simple text file with a list of IP addresses. Don’t discount what
you currently have, but try to look at all of the various system
and attempt to develop a best of breed approach. Take the
various systems that already exist, adopt it organisation wide
and make it mandatory for all system administrators to use that
system.
Once you have a standard system that is used by all system
administrators, then you need to ensure that it is maintained and
kept up-to-date. This is task now becomes mostly a policy and
procedure function. There are two areas you need to address:
1. Changes to existing configuration
2. Additions to the network
An approach that can be used here is to adopt a Configuration
Control Board to handle and approve any changes and
additions. This provides a solid and robust framework to ensure
that all changes are documented and (possibly more
importantly) that all changes are approved and reviewed before
they are made.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''' The A-level Wise Children Study Guide'''

You are viewing the ''Wise Children'' Study Guide Wikibook. It is an attempt to provide a study guide for those reading Wise Children as their 'Modern Novel' for the AQA examination board (AS English Literature, Specification A - paper LTA1). I would be grateful for any additions to this Wikibook as it only takes a few dedicated contributors to make a really useful resource that students can use to study this text. 

[[/Narrative Techniques/]]

[[/Plot Summary/]]

[[/Past Paper Questions/]] - There are currently 15 past paper questions listed

[[/Model Answers/]] - Model Answers and exam tips

[[/Allusions to Shakespeare/]] - There are 26 known references to different Shakespearean plays in ''Wise Children''.  

[[/References to People and Books in Wise Children/]]

[[/Post-Modernism/]]

[[/Feminism/]] - Feminism in ''Wise Children''.

[[/Angela Carter and Influences on Wise Children/]]

==Assessment Objectives==

The ‘modern novel’ forms 30% of the A.S. grade and therefore 15% of the A-level grade.  It is a closed book examination, which lasts '''one''' hour where you will be able to answer one question of the '''two''' that are available to you. Often one will be on a character or a theme and the other will involve analysing an extract. 

You will be examined on different assessment objectives. Although the paper is marked out of twenty below are the weighting of each assessment objective as if the paper was out of thirty so that the numbers round to whole numbers. This should communicate that more emphasis is placed on some objectives than others.

'''AO1''' Terminology  (7 marks)

'''AO2''' Knowledge (10 marks)

'''AO3''' Structure/meaning  (8 marks)

'''AO4''' Your Opinion (5 marks)

== Vectors==

A vector is a quantity that has both a magnitude (or a size) and a direction. The opposite of vectors are scalars. Scalars only have a magnitude. There is no direction. For example, speed is a scalar as speed is the same regardless of direction. This is best illustrated as a triangle:

[[Image:ForceTriangle.jpg]]


Our point, P, is a plane travelling along the hypotenuse of this triangle at a speed of &lt;math&gt; 5ms ^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. Its velocity, however, is not 5. As velocity is a vector and has both magnitude and direction, the speed of P is equal to moving at a velocity of &lt;math&gt; 4ms^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; along the horizontal and &lt;math&gt; 3ms ^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; along the vertical.

There are several different ways of writing this as a vector. One of the most common is the '''i''' and '''j''' notation. Where '''i''' is the horizontal component of the velocity and '''j''' is the vertical component of the velocity. Using this notation, our plane would have a velocity of (4i + 3j)


Another common way of writing vectors is in the form of &lt;math&gt; {x \choose y} &lt;/math&gt; where x is the horizontal component and y is the vertical component. Using our plane as the example, is this vector form it's velocity would be &lt;math&gt; {4 \choose 3}ms^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;.

To change a Vector into its horizontal and vertical components we:

1. Draw a triagle represnting the vector.

2. Label all known values on traingle.

3. Use trigonometry to solve.

E.g. A force, P, with magnitude 25N has a direction of &lt;math&gt;arcsin&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{25}&lt;/math&gt; (arcsin is the opposite of &lt;math&gt;sin&lt;/math&gt;.), find the horizontal and vertical components of P

Triangle

Label triangle:

Use trigonometry: is &lt;math&gt;\arcsin \theta&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{25} &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;sin &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{25} &lt;/math&gt;. Sin is O/H. Therefore the vertical component of P is 7. The Horizontal component can be found by using Pythagoras' theorem or recognising 7, 24, 25 as a Pythagorean triple. Pythagoras' theorem says that &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;+&lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the adjacent and opposite (order does not matter). Therefore &lt;math&gt;\ 25^2-\ 7^2\ &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;horizontal component^2&lt;/math&gt; = 576. &lt;math&gt;576^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; = 24. In '''i''' and '''j'''s this is (24i+7j).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the important '''concepts''' discussed in [[Atlas Shrugged]] include  the ''Sanction of the Victim'' and the ''Theory of Sex''.

===Sanction of the Victim===

The Sanction of the Victim is defined as &quot;the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil, to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the 'sin' of creating values.&quot;

The entire story of Atlas Shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question, what would happen if this sanction was revoked?  When Atlas shrugs, relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world, he is revoking his sanction.

The concept is supposedly original in the thinking of Ayn Rand and is foundational to her moral theory.  She holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it.  To quote from Galt's Speech: &quot;Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us&quot;, and, &quot;I saw that evil was impotent...and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it.&quot;  Morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood, Rand claims.  In adhering to this concept, Rand assigns virtue to the trait of selfishness.

Throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world but they cannot put their finger on what it is.  The concept they cannot grasp is the sanction of the victim.  The first person to grasp the concept is [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]], who vows to stop the motor of the world by getting the creators of the world to withhold their sanction.

We first glimpse the concept in [[Atlas Shrugged/Structure|Section]] 121 when [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] feels he is duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility towards him.

In section 146 the principle is stated explicitly by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dan Conway]]: &quot;I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain.&quot;

===Theory of Sex===

In rejecting the traditional Christian altruist moral code, Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is a logical implication of altruism.

Rand introduces a theory of sex in ''Atlas Shrugged'' which is purportedly implied by her broader ethical and psychological theories.  Far from being a debasing animal instinct, sex is the highest celebration of our greatest values.  Sex is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values&amp;mdash;a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract.

One is sexually attracted to those who embody one's values.  Those who have base values will be attracted to baseness, to those who also have ignoble values.  Those who lack any clear purpose will find sex devoid of meaning.  People of high values will respond sexually to those who embody high values.

That our sexual desire is a response to the embodiment of our values in others is a radical and original theory.  However, even those who are sympathetic to this theory have criticized it as being incomplete.  For instance, since according to Rand the economy is also such an expression of values, and since it is always possible to encounter someone who embodies one's values more completely, this would seem to make family undesirable. (Indeed, Rand treats &quot;family&quot; as a sort of trap.) Furthermore, promiscuity, prostitution, and an endless round-robin of &quot;values-driven&quot; sexual relationships would become inevitable.  From this viewpoint, one could say that Aldous Huxley portrayed the ideal sexual state: ''Brave New World'' features humans who are incapable of deviating from their caste-oriented &quot;values&quot;, which naturally include a code of sexual desirability.

Her sexual theory is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of Hank Rearden with Lillian Rearden and Dagny Taggart, and later with Dagny Taggart and John Galt.  

Other important illustrations of this theory are found in:
* Section 152 - recounts Dagny's relationship with Francisco d'Anconia.
* Section 162 - recounts Hank and Lillian Rearden's courtship, and Lillian's attitude towards sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technology in Atlas Shrugged''', [[w:Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand]]'s novel includes a variety of technological products and devices.  In addition to real world technology ([[w:aircraft|aircraft]], [[w:automobile|automobile]]s, [[w:diesel engine|diesel engine]]s, [[w:phonograph record|phonograph record]]s, [[w:radio|radio]]s, [[w:telephone|telephone]]s, [[w:television|television]], and [[w:traffic signals|traffic signals]]) [[Atlas Shrugged]] also includes various fictional technologies or fictional variants on real inventions.

{{spoilers}}

==Fictional technology==
Fictional inventions mentioned in the book include refractor rays (Gulch mirage), Rearden Metal, a sonic [[w:death ray|death ray]] (&quot;Project X&quot;), voice activated door locks (Gulch power station), motors powered by [[w:static electricity|static electricity]], palm-activated door locks (Galt's NY lab), shale-oil drilling, and a [[w:nerve|nerve]]-induction [[w:torture|torture]] machine.
 
===Traffic Signals===
Early on, the book mentions the &quot;screech&quot; of a traffic signal as it changes. This implies the older technology of mechanical traffic signals, the kind which displayed a pennant or flag indicating stop or go, and the inverse indicator in the opposite direction. Traffic signals using lights have been around for over 40 years, so anything of this type is very old compared to today.

===Project X===
Project X is an invention of the scientists at the state science institute, requiring tons of Rearden Metal. Basically, it is a &quot;death ray&quot;, and is capable of destroying anything with a [[w:Sonic weaponry|sonic pulse]]. The scientists claim that the project will be used to preserve peace and squash rebellion. It is destroyed towards the end of the book, and emits a pulse of sound that destroys everything in the surrounding area, including Cuffy Meigs and Dr. Stadler, as well as the Taggart Bridge.  The invention is publicly introduced as the &quot;Thompson Harmonizer&quot;.

===Rearden Metal===
Rearden metal is a [[w:Fictional_chemical_substance#Fictional_compounds_and_alloys|fictitious metal]] alloy invented by [[w:Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]].  It is lighter than traditional [[w:steel|steel]] but stronger, and is to steel what steel was to [[w:iron|iron]].  It is described as greenish-blue.  Among its ingredients are iron and [[w:copper|copper]].

Initially no one is willing to use Rearden metal because no one wants to stick his neck out and be the first to try it.  Finally, [[w:Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] places an order for Rearden Metal when she needs rails to rebuild the dying [[w:Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].

The first thing made from Rearden metal is a [[w:Things in Atlas_Shrugged|bracelet]].

Rearden metal is mentioned in [[Atlas Shrugged/Structure|sections]] 114, 121, 131, 148 and 161.

===Galt's Motor===
John Galt invented a new type of electrical apparatus described in the book as a [[w:Electric motor|motor]].  However, it does not operate like a motor in the common use of the word today:  it is capable of harnessing [[w:static electricity|static electricity]] and transforming it into useful [[w:mechanical work|mechanical work]]. Its operation is reminiscent of modern speculation about [[w:zero-point energy|zero-point energy]].

Dagny discovers a discarded prototype of the motor and it is superficially described in section Part 1, Chapter 9.  Galt shows Dagny the motor and describes it in section Part 3, Chapter 1.

::In the movie &lt;i&gt;[[w:Atlas Shrugged: Part I|Atlas Shrugged: Part I]]&lt;/i&gt;, the motor is said to use the [[w:Casimir Effect|Casimir effect]].  [[User:Dr.Zev|Dr.Zev]] ([[User talk:Dr.Zev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dr.Zev|contribs]]) 15:38, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

===Ferris Persuader ===
After all methods of &quot;liberal&quot; persuasion had been performed to try to force John Galt to fix the world (become &quot;Economic Dictator&quot; etc.), Dr. Floyd Ferris was finally permitted to have his way due to the desperate and scattered attitude of Mr. Thompson. Ferris proceeded to take John Galt to his hidden, guarded, laboratory close to the State Science Institute, and wired him to the &quot;Ferris Persuader&quot; - a device filled with dials, knobs and buttons, that presumably shocks its victims as a form of torture. It is said to deliver the maximum amount of pain, but to deliver the least amount of physical damage (so the captive cannot die).

The device fails during its operation on Galt, and neither the trained guard, nor Ferris understand how to fix it. Galt inherently understands, but when Ferris tries to fix it in the manner Galt says, James Taggart's mental breakdown makes Mouch postpone the torture session. Much later, when Dagny Taggart, Francisco D'Anconia, Ragnar Danneskjold and Hank Rearden rescue Galt, Danneskjold dismantles the machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Formatting==
I think we should place footnotes or cite the language from a legal reference.  This would enhance the degree of acceptance of the wikibooks.  Essentially, it may be better to make the wikibooks transparent to the viewer to the source of the law.

==Copyright issues==
Is anyone familiar with any copyright issues involved with citation?

==Case citation==
In a common law system like the U.S., is anyone aware of a reliable online repository of cases?  I realize that the court systems publish their decisions, but they may not have a http reference.

== Performance Measurement ==

Now that you know what is out there, you need to know what is
normal. Knowledge of how your network should run is essential
for you to be able to determine any anomalous actions that may
indicate some form of attack or intrusion.


What needs to be undertaken is a measurement of each item of
infrastructure over a period of time to determine how it runs
normally. This should include aspects such as:


 CPU utilisation


 Hard drive usage (and rate of increase)


 Bandwidth utilisation


 Log file examination


These are fairly common attributes which should be considered.
Specific items that need to be included in this list will of course
depend upon the type of infrastructure within your network.



== How do I do this? ==

There are a number of ways of going about both these activities.
For performance measurement, a simple approach can be to
use tools included with the operating system or the network
device. These will provide a very quick, easy and low cost
indication of how your network is running.


For more complex and in-depth analysis and reporting, there are
a number of commercially available tools available. These
include:


'''MRTG'''

Multi Router Traffic Grapher is a tool available under the GNU
public licence. It is available on both Windows and Linux
platforms and undertakes in-depth analysis of traffic on network
links.

http://www.people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/


'''SolarWinds'''

SolarWinds is a commercial product that contains a suite of
tools which will do pretty much everything you could need for
performance measurement. The unfortunate thing with this
software is that while it will do it all, it does come at a price. That
said, it does do what it claims very well and has the capability of
producing a variety of reports. 

http://www.solarwinds.net


For configuration management, there are also a number of
software packages available. The problem that may be faced
here however, is that configuration of a network is a very unique
thing. What works for one organisation may not work for
another. The best advice with this is to examine any choices of
software here very carefully and ensure that it fits you network
requirements before any purchase is made.

In the UK anyone can keep chickens in their backgarden or smallholding. Noise restrictions mean that cockerels may not be kept in urban areas, and there have been complaints about cockerels in the countryside. Flocks greater than 50 birds must be registered with DEFRA because of the possibility of bird flu. Smaller flocks can be registered, but this is not compulsary. It is generally a good idea to share surplus eggs with the neighbours, so they do not mind if a chicken escapes onto their land. In the US check your town's zoning laws. in Petaluma you can keep up to 6 chickens, no cockerels.

== Introduction ==

Happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust and fear. All these words describe some kind of abstract inner states in humans, in some cases difficult to control. We usually call them feelings or emotions. But what is the reason that we are able to &quot;feel&quot;? Where do emotions come from and how are they caused? And are emotions and feelings the same thing? Or are we supposed to differentiate?

These are all questions that cognitive psychology deals with in emotion research. Emotion research in the cognitive science is not much older than twenty years. The reason for this lies perhaps in the fact that much of the cognitive psychology tradition was based on computer-inspired information-processing models of cognition.

This chapter gives an overview about the topic for a better understanding of motivation and emotions. It provides information about theories concerning the cause of motivation and emotions in the human brain, their processes, their role in the human body and the connection between the two topics. We will try to show the actual state of research, some examples of psychologist experiments, and different points of view in the issue of emotions. In the end we will briefly outline some disorders to emphasize the importance of emotions for the social interaction.

== Motivation ==

=== About Drives and Motives ===

[[wikipedia:Motivation|Motivation]] is an extended notion, which refers to the starting, controlling and upholding of corporal and psychic activities. It is declared by inner processes and variables which are used to explain behavioral changes. Motivations are commonly separated into two types:

1.Drives: describe acts of motivation like thirst or hunger that have primarily biological purposes.

2.Motives: are driven by primarily social and psychological mechanisms.

Motivation is an interceding variable, which means that it is a variable that is not directly observable. Therefore, in order to study motivation, one must approach it through variables which are measurable and observable:


- Observable terms of variation (independent variables &lt;ref&gt; Independent variables are the circumstance of major interest in an experiment. The Participant does only react on them, but cannot actively change them. They are independent of his behaviour. &lt;/ref&gt;)

- Indicators of behavior (dependent variables&lt;ref&gt;The measured behaviour is called the dependent variable. &lt;/ref&gt;) e.g.: rate of learning, level of activity, ...


There are two major methodologies used to manipulate drives and motives in experiments:


''Stimulation'': Initiating motives by aversive attractions like shocks, loud noise, heat or coldness. On the other side attractions can activate drives which lead to positive affective states, e.g. sexual drives.

''Deprivation'': means that you prohibit the access to elementary aspects of biological or psychological health, like nutrition or social contacts. As a result it leads it to motives or drives which are not common for this species under normal conditions.


A theory of motivations was conceived by Abraham Maslow in 1970 ([[wikipedia:Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]). He considered two kinds of motivation:

1. ''Defected motivation'': brings humans to reconsider their psychical and physical balance.

2. ''Adolescence motivation'': gets people to pass old events and states of their personal development.

Maslow argues that everyone has a hierarchy of needs(see picture).

Regarding to this, our innate needs could be ordered in a hierarchy, starting at the “basic” ones and heading towards higher developed aspects of humanity. The hypothesis is that the human is ruled by lower needs as long as they are not satisfied. If they are satisfied in an adequate manner, the human then deals with higher needs. (compare to chapter attention)

[[Image:Maslow's hierarchy of needs.svg|right|thumb|Hierarchy of needs, Maslow (1970)]]

Nevertheless, all throughout history you can find examples of people who willingly practiced deprivation through isolation, celibacy, or by hunger strike. These people may be the exceptions to this hypothesis, but they may also have some other, more pressing motives or drives which induce them to behave in this way. 

It seems that individuals are able to resist certain motives via personal cognitive states. The ability of cognitive reasoning and willing is a typical feature of being human and can be the reason for many psychological diseases which indicates that humans are not always capable to handle all rising mental states. Humans are able to manipulate their motives without knowing the real emotional and psychological causes. This introduces the problem that the entity of [[wikipedia:consciousness|consciousness]], unconsciousness and what ever else could be taken into account is essentially unknown. Neuroscience cannot yet provide a concrete explanation for the neurological substructures of motives, but there has been considerable progress in understanding the neurological procedures of drives.

=== The Neurological Regulation of Drives ===

==== The Role of the Hypothalamus  ====

The purpose of drives is to correct disturbances of homeostasis which is controlled by the hypothalamus. Deviations from the optimal range of a regulated parameter like temperature are detected by neurons concentrated in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus. These neurons then produce an integrated response to bring the parameter back to its optimal value. This response generally consists of 

1. ''Humoral response''

2. ''Visceromotor response''

3. ''Somatic motor response''

When you are dehydrated, freezing, or exhausted, the appropriate humoral and visceromotor responses are activated automatically&lt;ref&gt;At the humoral response hypothalamic neurons stimulate or inhibit the release of pituitary hormones into the bloodstream and at the visceromotor response neurons in the hypothalamus adjust the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).&lt;/ref&gt;, e.g.: body fat reserves are mobilized, urine production is inhibited, you shiver, blood is shunted away from the body surface, … But it is much faster and more effective to correct these disturbances by eating, drinking water or actively seeking or generating warmth by moving. These are examples of drives generated by the somatic motor system, and they are incited to emerge by the activity of the lateral hypothalamus. 

For illustration we will make a brief overview on the neural basis of the regulation of feeding behavior, which is divided into the long-term and the short-term regulation of feeding behavior.

The long-term regulation of feeding behavior prevents energy shortfalls and concerns the regulation of body fat and feeding. 
In the 1940s the “dual center” model was popular, which divided the hypothalamus in a “hunger center” (lateral hypothalamus) and a “satiety center” (ventromedial hypothalamus). This theory developed from the facts that bilateral lesions of the lateral hypothalamus causes anorexia, a severely diminished appetite for food (lateral hypothalamic syndrome) and on the other side bilateral lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus causes overeating and obesity (ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome). Anyway, it has been proved that this “dual model” is overly simplistic. The reason why hypothalamic lesions affect body fat and feeding behavior has in fact much to do with leptin signaling. 
Adipocytes (fat cells) release the hormone leptin, which regulates body mass by acting directly on neurons of the arcuate nucleus&lt;ref&gt;αMSH neurons and CART neurons of the arcuate nucleus. αMSH(alpha-malanocyte-stimulating hormone) and CART(cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) are anoretic peptides, which activate the pituitary hormones TSH(thyroid-stimulating hormone) and ACTH(adrenocorticotropic hormone), that have the effect of raising the metabolic rate of cells throughout the body.&lt;/ref&gt; of the hypothalamus that decreases appetite and increase energy expenditure. 
A fall in leptin levels stimulates another type of arcuate nuleus neurons&lt;ref&gt;NPY neurons and AgRP neurons. NPY(neuropeptide Y) and AgRP(agouti-related peptide) are orexigenic peptides, which inhibit the secretion of TSH and ACTH.&lt;/ref&gt; and neurons in the lateral hypothalamus&lt;ref&gt;MCH(melanin-concentrating hormone) neurons, which have extremely widespread connections in the brain, including direct monosynaptic innervation of most of the cerebral cortex, that is involved in organizing and initiating goal-directed behaviors, such as raiding the refrigerator. &lt;/ref&gt;, which activate the parasympathetic division of the ANS, and stimulate feeding behavior. 
The short-term regulation of feeding behavior deals with appetite and satiety. 
Until 1999 scientists believed that hunger was merely the absence of satiety. This changed with the discovery of a peptide called ghrelin, which is highly concentrated in the stomach and is released into the bloodstream when the stomach is empty. In the arcuate nucleus it activates neurons&lt;ref&gt;The NPY- and AgRP neurons.&lt;/ref&gt;, that strongly stimulate appetite and food consumption. The meal finally ends by the concerted actions of several satiety signals, like gastric distension and the release of insulin&lt;ref&gt;The pancreatic hormone insulin, released by β cells of the pancreas, acts directly on the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. It appears that it operates in much the same way as leptin to regulate feeding behavior, with the difference that its primary stimulus for realisng is increased blood glucose level.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
But it seems that animals not only eat because they want food to satisfy their hunger. They also eat because they like food in a merely hedonistic sense. Research on humans and animals suggests that “liking” and “wanting” are mediated by separate circuits in the brain.

==== The Role of Dopamine in Motivation ====

In the early 1950s, Peter Milner and James Olds conducted an experiment in which a rat had an electrode implanted in its brain, so the brain could be locally stimulated at any time. The rat was seated in a box, which contained a lever for food and water and a lever that would deliver a brief stimulus to the brain when stepped on. At the beginning the rat wandered about the box and stepped on the levers by accident, but before long it was pressing the lever for the brief stimulus repeatedly. This behavior is called electrical self-stimulation. Sometimes the rats would become so involved in pressing the lever that they would forget about food and water, stopping only after collapsing from exhaustion.
Electrical self-stimulation apparently provided a reward that reinforced the habit to press the lever. Researches were able to identify the most effective sites for self-stimulation in the different regions of the brain: the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. 
Drugs that block dopamine receptors reduced the self-stimulation behavior of the rat. In the same way this drugs greatly reduced the pressing of a lever for receiving of food even if the rat was hungry. These experiments suggested a mechanism by which natural rewards (food, water, sex) reinforce particular behavior.
Dopamine plays an important role in addiction of drugs like heroin, nicotine and cocaine. Thus these drugs either stimulate dopamine release (heroin, nicotine) or enhance dopamine actions (cocaine) in the nucleus accumbens. Chronic stimulation of this pathway causes a down-regulated of the dopamine “reward” system. This adaption leads to the phenomenon of drug tolerance. Indeed, drug discontinuation in addicted animals is accompanied by a marked decrease in dopamine release and function in the nucleus accumbens, leading to the symptom of craving for the discontinued drug.
The exact role of dopamine in motivating behavior continues to be debated. However, much evidence suggests that animals are motivated to perform behaviors that stimulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and related structures

== Emotions ==

===Basics===
In contrast to previous research, modern brain based neuroscience has taken a more serviceable approach to the field of [[wikipedia:Emotion|Emotions]], because emotions definitely are brain related processes which deserve scientific study, whatever their purpose may be.

One interpretation regards emotions as „action schemes“, which especially lead to a certain behaviour which is essential for survival. It is important to distinguish between conscious aspects of emotion like subjective - often bodily - feelings, as well as unconscious aspects like the detection of a threat. This will be discussed later on in conjunction with awareness of emotion. It is also important to differentiate between a mood and an emotion. A mood refers to a situation where an emotion occurs frequently or continuously. As an example: Fear is an emotion, anxiety is a mood.

The first question which arises is how to categorise emotions. They could be treated as a single entity, but perhaps it could even make more sense to distinguish between them, which leads to the 
question if some emotions like happiness or anger are more basic than other types like jealousy or love and if emotions are dependent on culture and/or language.

One of the most influential ethnographic studies by Enkamn and Friesen, which is based on the comparison of facial expressions of emotions in different cultures, concluded that there are six basic types of emotions expressed in faces - namely sadness, happiness, disgust, surprise, anger and fear, independent from culture and language. An alternative approach is to differentiate between emotions not by categorising but rather by measuring the intensity of an emotion by imposing different dimensions, e.g. their valence and their arousal. If this theory would be true then one might expect to find different brain regions which selectivey process positive or negative emotions.
[[Image:Emotions.jpg|500px|thumb|Six basic types of emotions expressed in faces]]


Complex emotions like jealousy, love and pride are different from basic emotions as they comprehend awareness of oneself in relation to other people and one's attitude towards other people. Hence they come along with a more complex attributional process which is required to appreciate thoughts and beliefs of other people. Complex emotions are more likely be dependent on cultural influences than basic types of emotions. If you think of Knut who is feeling embarrassment, you have to consider what kind of action he committed in which situation and how this action raised the disapproval of other people.

===Awareness and Emotion===

Awareness is closely connected with changes in the environment or in the psycho-physiological state. Why recognise changes rather than stable states? An answer could be that changes are an important indicator of our situation. They show that our situation is unstable. Paying attention or focusing on that might increase the chance to survive. A change bears more information than repetitive events. This appears more exciting. Repetition reduces excitement. If we think that we got the most important information from a situation or an event,we become unaware of such an event or certain facts.

Current research in this field suggest that changes are needed to emerge emotions,so we can say that it is strong attention dependent. The event has to draw our attention. No recognition, no emotions. But do we have always an emotional evaluation, when we are aware of certain events? How has the change to be relevant for our recognition? Emotional changes are highly personal significant, saying that it needs a relation to our personal self. 

Significance presupposes order and relations. Relations are to meaning as colours are to vision: a necessary condition, but not its whole content. One determines the significance and the scope of a change by f.e. event´s impact (event´s strength), reality, relevance and factors related to the background circumstances of the subject. We feel no emotion in response to change which we perceive as unimportant or unrelated. Roughly one can say that emotions express our attitude toward unstable significant objects which are somehow related to us. 

This is also always connected with the fact that we have greater response to novel experience. Something that is unexpected or unseen yet. When children get new toys, they are very excited at first, but after a while one can perceive, or simply remember their own childhood, that they show less interest in that toy. That shows, that emotional response declines during time. This aspect is called the process of adaptation. The threshold of awareness keeps rising if stimulus level is constant. Hence, awareness decreases. The organism withdraws its consciousness from more and more events. The person has the pip, it has enough. The opposite effect is also possible. It is known as the process of facilitation. In this case the threshold of awareness diminishes. 

Consciousness is focusing on increasing number of events. This happens if new stimuli are encountered. The process of adaptation might prevent us from endlessly repetitive actions. A human would not be able to learn something new or be caught in an infinite loop. The emotional environment contains not only what is, and what will be, experienced but also all that could be, or that one desires to be, experienced; for the emotional system, all such possibilities are posited as simultaneously there and are compared with each other. 

Whereas intellectual thinking expresses a detached and objective manner of comparison, the emotional comparison is done from a personal and interested perspective; intellectual thinking may be characterised as an attempt to overcome the personal emotional perspective. It is quite difficult to give an external description of something that is related to an intrinsic, personal perspective. But it is possible. In the following the most popular theories will be shown, and an rough overview about the neural substrates of emotions.

=== The Neural Correlate of Emotion ===



====Papez Circuit====

James W. Papez was the investigator of the Papez Circuit theory (1937). He
was the first who tried to explain emotions in a neurofuncional way. Papez
discovered the circuit after injecting the rabing-virus into a cat's hippocampus andobserved its effects on the brain. The Papez circuit is chiefly involved in the cortical control of emotion. The
corpus mamillare (part of the hypothalamus) plays a central role. The Papez Circuit involves several regions in the brain with the following course:

● The hippocampus projects to fornix and via this to corpus mamillare

● from here neurons project via the fasciculus mamillothalamicus to nucleus anterior of the thalamus and then to the gyrus cinguli

● due to the connection of gyrus cinguli and hippocampus the circuit is closed.

1949 Paul MacLean extended this theory by hypothezing that regions like the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex work together with the circuit and form an emotional brain. However, the theory of the Papez circuit could no longer be held because, for one, some regions of the circuit can no longer be related to functions to which they were ascribed primarily. And secondly, current state of research concludes that each basic emotion has its own circuit. Furthermore, the assumption that the limbic system is solely responsible for these functions is out-dated. Other cortical and non-cortical structures of the brain have an enormous bearing on the limbic system. So the emergence of emotion is always an interaction of many parts of the brain.

====Amygdala and Fear====

The Amygdala (lat. Almond), latinic-anatomic Corpus amygdaloideum, is located in the left and right temporal lobe. It belongs to the limbic system and is essentially involved in the emergence of fear. In addition, the amygdala plays a decisive role in the emotional evaluation and recognition of situations as well as in the analysis of potential threat. It handles external stimuli and induces vegetative reactions. These may help prepare the body for fight and flight by increasing heart and breathing-rate. The small mass of grey matter is also responsible for learning on the basis of reward or punishment. If the two parts of the amygdala are destroyed the person loses their sensation of fear and anger. Experiments with patients whose amygdala is damaged show the following: The participants were impaired to a lesser degree with recognizing facial anger and disgust. They could not match pictures of the same person when the expressions were different.
Beyond Winston, O´Doherty and Dolan report that the amygdala activation was independent of whether or not subjects engaged in incidental viewing or explicit emotion judgements. However, other regions (including the ventromedial frontal lobes) were activated only when making explicit judgements about the emotion. This was interpreted as reinstatement of the „feeling“ of the emotion. Further studies show that there is a slow route to the amygdala via the primary visual cortex and a fast subcortical route from the thalamus to the amygdala. The amygdala is activated by unconscious fearful expressions in healthy participants and also „blindsight“ patients with damage to primary visual cortex. The fast route is imprecise and induces fast unconscious reactions towards a threat before you consciously notice and may properly react via the slow route.
This was shown by experiments with persons who have a snake phobia (ophidiophobics) or a spider
phobia (arachnophobics). When they get to see a snake, the former showed a bodily reaction, before they reported seeing the snake. A similar reaction was not observable in the case of a spiderphobia. By experiments with spiders the results were the other way round.

====Recognition of Other Emotional Categories====

Another basic emotional category which is largely independent of other emotions is disgust. It literally means „bad taste“ and is evolutionary related to contamination through ingestion. Patients with the Huntington´s disease have problems with recognizing disgust. The insula, a small region of cortex buried beneath the temporal lobes, plays an important role for facial expressions of disgust. Furthermore, the half of the patients with a damaged amygdala have problems with facial expressions of sadness. The damage of the ventral regions of the basal ganglia causes the deficit in the selective perception of anger and this brain area could be responsible for the perception of aggression. Happiness cannot be selectively impaired because it consist of a more distributed network.

===Functional Theories===

In order to explain human emotions, that means to discover how they arise and investigate how they are represented in the brain, researchers worked out several theories. In the following the most important views will be discussed


====James – Lange Theory====

The James – Lange theory of emotion states that the self – perception of bodily changes produces emotional experience. For example you are happy because you are laughing or you feel sad because you are crying. Alternatively, when a person sees a spider he or she might experience fear. One problem according this theory is that it is not clear what kind of processing leads to the changes in the bodily state and wether this process can be seen as a part of the emotion itself. However, people paralyzed from the neck down, who have little awareness of sensory input are still able to experience emotions. Also, research by Schacter and Singer has shown, that changes in bodily state are not enough to produce emotions. Because of that, an extension of this theory was necessary. 


====Two Factor Theory====

The two factor theory views emotion as an compound of the two factors: physiological arousal and cognition. Schacter and Singer (1962) did well-known studies in this field of research. They injected participants with adrenaline (called epinephrine in the USA). This is a drug that causes a number of effects like increased blood flow to the muscles and increased heart rate. The result was that the existence of the drug in the body did not lead to experiences of emotion. Just with the presence of an cognitive setting, like an angry man in the room, participants did self – report an emotion. Contrary to the James – Lange theory this study suggests that bodily changes can only support conscious emotional experiences but do not create emotions. Therefore, the interpretation of a certain emotion depends on the physiological state in correlation to the subjects circumstances.

====Somatic Marker Hypothesis==== 

This current theory of emotions (from A. Damasio) emphasizes the role of bodily states and implies that “somatic marker” signals have influence on behaviour, like particularly reasoning and decision–making. Somatic markers are the connections between previous situations, which are stored in the cortex, and the bodily feeling of such situations (e.g. stored in the amygdala). From this it follows, that the somatic markers are very useful during the decision process, because they can give you immediate response on the grounds of previous acquired knowledge, whether the one or the other option “feels” better. People who are cheating and murdering without feeling anything miss somatic markers which would prevent them from doing this.

In order to investigate this hypothesis a gambling task was necessary. There have been four decks of cards (A, B, C, D) on the table and the participants had to take always one in turn. On the other side of the card was either a monetary penalty or gain. The players have been told that they must play so that they win the most. Playing from decks A and B leads to a loss of money whereas choosing decks C and D leads to gain. Persons without a brain lesion learned to avoid deck A and B but players with such damage did not.

===Reading Minds===

Empathy is the ability to appreciate others’ emotions and their point of view. Simulation theory states that the same neural and cognitive resources are used by perceiving the emotional expressions of others and by producing actions and this expressions in oneself. If you are watching a movie where one person touches another, the same neural mechanism (in the somatosensory cortex) is activated as if you were physically touched. Further studies investigated empathy for pain. That means, if you see someone experiencing pain, two regions in your brain are overlapping. The first region is  responsible for expecting another person’s pain, and the second region is responsible for experiencing this pain oneself.

=== Mood and Memory ===

While we store a memory, we not only record all sensory data, we also store our mood and emotional state. 
Our current mood thus will affect the memories that are most effortlessly available to us, such that when we are in a good mood we recollect good memories (and vice versa). While the nature of memory is associative this also means that we tend to store happy memories in a linked set. 
There are two different ways we remember past events:


==== Mood-congruence ====

Memory occurs where current mood helps recall of mood-congruent material, e.g. characters in stories that feel like the reader feels while reading, regardless of our mood at  the time the material was stored.
Thus when we are happy, we are more likely to remember happy events. Also remembering all of the negative events of our past when depressed is an example of mood congruence. That means that you can rather remember a funeral where you were happy in a happy mood while you remember a party where you were sad in a sad mood, although a funeral is sad and a party is happy.


==== Mood-dependency ====

Memory occurs where the congruence of current mood with the mood at the time of memory storage helps recall of that memory. When we are happy, we are more likely to remember other times when we were happy. So, if you want to remember something, get into the mood you were in when you experienced it.
You can easily try this yourself. You just have to bring into a certain mood by listening to the saddest/happiest music you know. Now you learn a list of words. Then you try to recall the list in the other/the same mood. You will see that you remember the list better when you are in the same mood as you were while learning it.

== Disorders ==

Without balanced emotions, one's ability to interact in a social network will be affected in some manner (e.g. reading minds). In this part of the chapter some grave disorders will be presented- these are: [[wikipedia:depression|depression]], [[wikipedia:autism|austism]] and antisocial behaviour disorders as [[wikipedia:psychopathy|psychopathy]] and [[wikipedia:sociopathy|sociopathy]]. It is important to mention that those disorders will mainly be considered in regard to their impact on social competence. To get a full account of the characteristics of each of the disorders, we recommend reading the particular articles provided by Wikipedia.


=== Depression ===

Depression is a disorder that leads to an emotional disfunction characterized by a state of intensive sadness, melancholia and despair. The disorder affects social and everyday live. There are many different forms of depression that differ in strength and duration. 
People affected by depression suffer from anxiety, distorted thinking, dramatic mood changes and many other symptoms. They feel sad, and everything seems to be bleak. This leads to an extremely negative view of themselves and their current and future situation. These factors can lead to a loss of a normal social life that might affect the depressed person even further. Suffering from depression and losing your social network can thereby lead to a vicious circle.

=== Autism ===

Autism is an innate disorder with individual forms distributed on a broad spectrum. This means that symptoms can range from minor behavioral problems to major mental deficits, but it there is always some impairment of social competence. The American Psychiatric Association characterizes autism as &quot;the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly  restricted repertoire of activities and interests&quot; (1994, diagnostic and statistical manual; DSM-IV). The deficits in social competence are sometimes divided into the so-called &quot;triad of impairments&quot;, including:


(1)Social interaction
This includes difficulties with social relationships, for example appearing distanced and indifferent to other people.

(2)Social communication 
Autists have problems with verbal and non-verbal communication, for example, they do not fully understand the meaning of common gestures, facial expressions or the voice tones. They often show reduced or even no eye-contact as well, avoid body contact like shaking hands and have difficulties to understand metaphores and &quot;to read between the lines&quot;.

(3)Social imagination 
Autists lack social imagination manifesting in difficulties in the development of interpersonal play and imagination, for example having a limited range of imaginative activities, possibly copied and pursued rigidly and repetitively. 

All forms of autism can already be recognized during childhood and therefore disturb the proper socialization of the afflicted child. Often autistic children are less interested in playing with other children but for example love to arrange their toys with utmost care.
Unable to interpret emotional expressions and social rules autists are prone to show inappropriate behaviour towards the people surrounding them. Autists may not obviously be impaired therefore other people misunderstand their actions as provocation. 

Still there are other features of autism- autists often show stereotyped behaviour and feel quite uncomfortable when things change in the routines and environment they are used to. Very rarely, a person with autism may have a remarkable talent, such as memorizing a whole city panorama including, for example, the exact number of windows in each of the buildings.

There are several theories trying to explain autism or features of autism.
In an experiment conducted by Baron-Cohen and colleagues (1995) cartoons were presented to normal and autistic children showing a smiley in the centre of each picture and four different sweets in each corner (see  picture below). The smiley, named Charlie, was gazing at one of the sweets. The children were asked question as: &quot;Which chocolate does Charlie want?&quot; 


[[Image:Charlie2.gif|thumbnail|Autistic children where able to detect where the smiley was looking but unable to infer its 'desires'. (adapted graphic from &quot;Ward, J. (2006). The Students Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. Hove: Psychology Press.&quot; page 316)]]

Normal children could easily infer Charlie's desires from Charlie's gaze direction whereas autistic children would not guess the answer.

Additional evidence from other experiments suggest that autist are unable to use eye gaze information to interpret people's desires and predict their behaviour which would be crucial for social interaction.
Another proposal to explain autistic characteristics suggests that autists lack representations of other people's mental states (mindblindness- proposed by Baron-Cohen, 1995b).

=== Psychopathy and Sociopathy ===

Psychopathy and sociopathy are nowadays subsumed under the notion of antisocial behaviour disorders but experts are still quite discordant whether both are really separated disturbances or rather forms of other personal disorders e.g. autism.
Psychopaths and sociopaths often get into conflict with their social environment because they repeatedly violate social and moral rules. 
Acquired sociopathy manifests in the inability to form lasting relationships, irresponsible behaviour as well as getting angry quite fast and  exceptional strong egocentric thinking.  While acquired sociopathy might is characterised by impulsive antisocial behaviour often having no personal advantage, developmental psychopathy manifests in goal directed and self-initiated aggression.
Acquired sociopathy is caused by brain injury especially found in the orbitofrontal lobe (frontal lobe) and is thought to be a failure to use emotional cues and the loss of social knowledge. Therefore sociopaths are unable to control and plan their behaviour in a socially adequate manner. 
In contrast to sociopaths psychopaths are not getting angry because of minor reasons but they act aggressively without understandable reasons at all which might be due to their inability to understand and distinguish between moral rules (concerning the welfare of others) and conventions (consensus rules of society). Furthermore it even happens that they feel no guilt or empathy for their victims. Psychopathy is probably caused be a failure to process distress cues of others, meaning that they are unable to understand sad and fearful expressions and consequently suppress their aggression (Blair 1995). It is important to mention that they are nevertheless able to detect stimuli being threatening for themselves.

== Summary ==

We hope that this chapter gave you an overview and answered the question we posed at the beginning. As one can see this young field of cognitive is wide and not yet completely researched.
Many different theories were proposed to explain emotions and motivation like the James-Lange Theory which claims that bodily changes lead to emotional experiences. This theory led to the Two-Factor-Theory which in contrast says that bodily changes only support emotional experiences. Whereas the newest theory (Somatic marker) states that somatic markers support decision making.
While analyzing emotions, one has to distinguish between conscious emotions, like a feeling, and unconscious aspects, like the detection of threat.
Presently, researchers distinguish six basic emotions that are independent from cultural aspects. In comparison to this basic emotions other emotions also comprehend social awareness.
So, emotions are not only important for our survival but for our social live, too. Reading faces helps us to communicate and interpret behaviour of other people. Many disorders impair this ability leaving the afflicted person with an inability to integrate himself into the social community. 
Another important part in understanding emotions is awareness; we only pay attention on new things in order to avoid getting unimportant information. Moods also affect our memory - we can remember things better if we are in the same mood as in the situation before and if the things we want to remember are connoted in the same way as our current mood.
We also outlined the topic of motivation which is crucial to initiate and uphold our mental and corporal activities. Motivation consists of two parts: drives (biological needs) and motives (primarily social and psychological mechanisms).
One important theory is the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs; it states that higher motivations are only aspired if lower needs are satisfied.
As this chapter only dealt with mood and memory, the next chapter deals with memory and language.

== Introduction ==

No matter which public topic you discuss or which personal aspect you worry about – you need reasons for your opinion and argumentation. Moreover, the ability of reasoning is responsible for your cognitive features of decision making and choosing among alternatives.

Everyone of us uses these two abilities in everyday life to the utmost. Let us, therefore, consider the following scene of Knut's life:

''“It is again a rainy afternoon in Osnabrück (Germany) and as Knut and his wife are tired of observing the black crows in their garden they decide to escape from the shabby weather and spend their holidays in Spain. Knut has never been to Spain before and is pretty excited. They will leave the next day, thus he is packing his bag. The crucial things first: some underwear, some socks, a pair of pyjamas and his wash bag with a toothbrush, shampoo, soap, sun milk and insect spray. But, Knut cannot find the insect spray until his wife tells him that she lost it and will buy some new. He advises her to take an umbrella for the way to the chemist as it is raining outside, before he turns back to his packing task. But what did he already pack into his bag? Immediately, he remembers and continues, packing his clothing into the bag, considering that each piece fits another one and finally his Ipod as he exclusively listens to music with this device. Since the two of them are going on summer holidays, Knut packs especially shorts and T-Shirts into his bag. After approximately half an hour, he is finally convinced that he has done everything necessary for having some fine holidays.”''

With regard to this sketch of Knut's holiday preparation, we will explain the basic principles of '''reasoning''' and '''decision making'''. In the following, it will be shown how much cognitive work is necessary for this fragment of everyday life.
After presenting an insight into the topic, we will illustrate what kind of brain lesions lead to what kind of impairments of these two cognitive features.

== Reasoning ==
In a process of reasoning available information is taken into account in form of [[Wikipedia:premises|premises]]. Through a process of inferencing a [[Wikipedia:conclusion|conclusion]] is reached on the base of these premises. The conclusion’s content of information goes beyond the one of the premises. To make this clear consider the following consideration Knut makes before planning his holiday:

'''1. Premise: In all countries in southern Europe it is pretty warm during summer.'''

'''2. Premise: Spain is in southern Europe.'''

'''Conclusion: Therefore, in Spain it is pretty warm during summer.'''

The conclusion in this example follows directly from the premises but it entails information which is not explicitly stated in the premises. This is a rather typical feature of a process of reasoning. In the following it is decided between the two major kinds of reasoning, namely '''inductive''' and '''deductive''' which are often seen as the complement of one another. 

=== Deductive reasoning ===
...

==== Categorical syllogisms ====

In categorical syllogisms the statements of the premises begin typically with “all”, “none” or “some” and the conclusion starts with “therefore” or “hence”. These kinds of syllogisms fulfill the task of describing a relationship between two categories. In the example given above in the introduction of deductive reasoning these categories are Spain and the need for shorts and T-Shirts. Two different approaches serve the study of categorical syllogisms which are the '''normative approach''' and the '''descriptive approach'''.

===== The normative approach =====
The normative approach is based on logic and deals with the problem of categorizing conclusions as either valid or invalid. Two basic principles and a method called '''Euler circles''' have been developed to help judging about the [[Wikipedia: validity|validity]]. 
The first principle was created by Aristotle and says “If the two premises are true, the conclusion of a valid syllogism must be true” (Goldstein, 2005,page 431).
The second principle explains why the following syllogism is (surprisingly) valid:

'''All flowers are animals.'''
'''All animals can jump.'''
'''Therefore all flowers can jump.'''
[[File:Flowers Deductive Reasoning.jpg|thumb|350px|''Figure 1'']]

Even though it is quite obvious that the first [[Wikipedia: premise|premise]] is not true and further that the conclusion is not true, the whole syllogism is still valid. The second principle inhales that “The validity of a syllogism is determined only by its form, not its content.”

Due to this precondition it is possible to display a [[Wikipedia: syllogism|syllogism]] formally with symbols or letters and explain its relationship graphically with the help of diagrams.  As shown in the picture, there are various ways to demonstrate a premise graphically. Starting with a circle to represent the first premise and adding one or more circles for the second one, the crucial move is to compare the constructed diagram with the conclusion. It should be clearly laid out whether the diagrams are contradictory or not. Agreeing with one another, the syllogism is valid.

===== The descriptive approach =====
The descriptive approach is concerned with estimating people´s ability of judging validity and explaining judging errors. 
This psychological approach uses two methods in order to determine people`s performance. For the method of '''evaluation''' (which is the preferred one) people are given two premises, a conclusion and the task to judge whether the syllogism is true or not. The method of '''production''' supplies the participants with two premises and asks them to develop a logically valid conclusion (if possible).

With the '''method of evaluation''' researchers found typical reasons misjudgements about syllogisms. 
Premises starting with “All”, “Some” or “No” imply a special atmosphere and influence a person in his decision. One mistake often occurring is judging a syllogism incorrectly as valid, in which the two premises as well as the conclusion starts with “All”. The influence of the provided atmosphere leads to the right decision at most times, but is definitely not reliable and guides the person to a rash decision. This phenomenon is summarized by the '''atmosphere effect'''. 
In addition to the form of a syllogism, the content is likely to influence a person’s decision as well and cause the person to neglect his logical thinking.  Given a conclusion as “ Some bananas are pink”, hardly any participants would judge the syllogism as valid, even though it might be valid according to its premises (e.g. Some bananas are fruits. All fruits are pink.)
The '''[[Wikipedia: belief bias|belief bias]]''' states that people tend to judge syllogisms with believable conclusions as valid, while they tend to judge syllogisms with not believable conclusions as invalid.

===== Mental models of deductive reasoning =====

From the data already given it is still not possible to consider what mental processes might be occurring as people are trying to determine if a syllogism is valid.
After finding out that Euler circles can be used to determine the validity of a syllogism Phillip Johnson – Laird (1999) wondered whether people would use such circles naturally when not haven been taught to them.
At the same time he found out that they do not work for some more complex syllogisms and that a problem can be solved by applying logical rules, but most people solve them by imagining the situation.
This is the base idea of people using mental models – a specific situation that is represented in a person’s mind that can be used to help determine the validity of syllogisms – to solve deductive reasoning problems. The basic principle behind such a mental model theory is: A conclusion is valid only if it cannot be refuted by any mode of the premises.
This theory is attractive because it makes predictions that can be tested and because it can be applied without training in the rules of logic.
But there are still problems that face researchers when trying to determine how people reason about syllogisms.
These problems include the fact that a variety of different strategies are used by people in reasoning and that some people are better in solving syllogisms than others.

===== Effects of culture on deductive reasoning =====

Now it is known that people can be influenced by the content of syllogisms rather than by focusing on logic when judging their validity.
Psychologists have wondered whether people are influenced by their cultures when judging. Therefore they have done cross – cultural experiments in which reasoning problems were presented to people in different cultures. They found out that people from different cultures judge differently to these questions. 
For example, a man from a traditional tribe in Liberia would give a wrong answer to such a reasoning problem when the question is considered purely in terms of formal logic, but for justifying his answer he would use logic. This shows that the man uses evidence from his own experience (empirical evidence) but is ignoring evidence presented in the syllogism (theoretical evidence).
When asking people to explain their answers it becomes clear that they often base their response on empirical evidence.
Another fact that becomes by these experiments is the difference between educated and uneducated participants. Uneducated people are often affected by the believability of the conclusion, while educated people base their judgments on logic.
These results might occur because of the difference in raising up their children. It also shows that European Americans for example are less susceptible to the belief bias then Eastern Asians. Such experiments strengthen the idea that people in different cultures may use different strategies for reasoning.

==== Conditional syllogisms ====

Another type of syllogisms is called “conditional syllogism”. Just like the categorical one, it also has two premises and a conclusion. In difference the first premise has the form “If … then”. Syllogisms like this one are common in everyday life. Consider the following example from the story about Knut:
 
'''1. Premise: If it is raining, Knut`s wife gets wet.'''

'''2. Premise: It is raining.'''

'''Conclusion: Therefore, Knut`s wife gets wet.'''

Conditional syllogisms are typically given in the abstract form: “If p then q”, where “p” is called the '''antecedent''' and “q” the '''consequent'''. 

===== Forms of conditional syllogisms =====

There are four major forms of conditional syllogisms, namely '''Modus Ponens''', '''Modus Tollens''', '''Denying The Antecedent''' and '''Affirming The Consequent'''. These are illustrated in the table below (Figure 2) by means of the conditional syllogism above (i.e. If it is raining, Knut`s wife gets wet). The table indicates the premises, the resulting conclusions and it shows whether these are valid or not. The lowermost row displays the relative number of correct judgements people make about the validity of the conclusions.

Obviously, the validity of the syllogisms with valid conclusions is easier to judge in a correct manner than the validity of the ones with invalid conclusions. The conclusion in the instance of the modus ponens is apparently valid. In the example it is very clear that Knut`s wife gets wet, if it is raning.
 
The validity of the modus tollens is more difficult to recognize. Referring to the example, in the case that Knut`s wife does not get wet it can`t be raining. Because the first premise says that if it is raining, she gets wet. So the reason for Knut`s wife not getting wet is that it is not raining. Consequently, the conclusion is valid.

The validity of the remaining two kinds of conditional syllogisms is judged correctly only by 40% of people. If the method of denying the antecedent is applied, the second premise says that it is not raining. But from this fact it follows not logically that Knut`s wife does not get wet – obviously rain is not the only reason for her to get wet. It could also be the case that the sun is shining and Knut tests his new water pistol and makes her wet. So, this kind of conditional syllogism does not lead to a valid conclusion.

Affirming the consequent in the case of the given example means that the second premise says that Knut`s wife gets wet. But again the reason for this can be circumstances apart from rain. So, it follows not logically that it is raining. In consequence, the conclusion of this syllogism is invalid.

The four kinds of syllogisms have shown that it is not always easy to make correct judgments concerning the validity of the conclusions. The following passages will deal with other errors people make during the process of conditional reasoning.

===== The Wason Selection Task =====

The [[Wikipedia:Wason Selection Task|Wason Selection Task]] is a famous experiment which shows that people make more errors in the process of reasoning, if it is concerned with abstract items than if it involves real-world items (Wason, 1966).
In the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task four cards are shown to the participants with each a letter on one side and a number on the other (Figure 3, yellow cards). The task is to indicate the minimum number of cards that have to be turned over to test whether the following rule is observed: “If there is a vowel on one side then there is an even number on the other side”. 53% of participants selected the ‘E’ card which is correct, because turning this card over is necessary for testing the truth of the rule. However still another card needs to be turned over. 64 % indicated that the ‘4’ card has to be turned over which is not right. Only 4% of participants answered correctly that the ‘7’ card needs to be turned over in addition to the ‘E’. The correctness of turning over these two cards becomes more obvious if the same task is stated in terms of real-world items instead of vowels and numbers. One of the experiments for determining this was the beer/drinking-age problem used by Richard Griggs and James Cox (1982). This experiment is identical to the Wason Selection Task except that instead of numbers and letters on the cards everyday terms (beer, soda and ages) were used (Figure 3, blue cards). Griggs and Cox gave the following rule to the participants: “If a person is drinking beer then he or she must be older than 19 years.” In this case 73% of participants answered in a correct way, namely that the cards with “Beer” and “14 years” on it have to be turned over to test whether the rule is kept.

[[Image:wason.jpg|thumb|300px|''Figure 3'']]

'''Why is the performance better in the case of real–world items?'''

There are two different approaches which explain why participants’ performance is significantly better in the case of  the beer/drinking-age problem than in the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task, namely one approach concerning permission schemas and an evolutionary approach. 
The regulation: “If one is 19 years or older then he/she is allowed to drink alcohol”, is known by everyone as an experience from everyday life (also called permission schema). As this permission schema is already learned by the participants it can be applied to the Wason Selection Task for real–world items to improve participants` performance. On the contrary such a permission schema from everyday life does not exist for the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task. 
The evolutionary approach concerns the important human ability of cheater-detection . This approach states that an important aspect of human behaviour especially in the past was/is the ability for two persons to cooperate in a way that is beneficial for both of them. As long as each person receives a benefit for whatever he/she does in favour of the other one, everything works well in their social exchange. But if someone cheats and receives benefit from others without giving it back, some problem arises (see also chapter 3. Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions). It is assumed that the property to detect cheaters has become a part of human`s cognitive makeup during evolution. This cognitive ability improves the performance in the beer/drinking-age version of the Wason Selection Task as it allows people to detect a cheating person who does not behave according to the rule. Cheater-detection does not work in the case of the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task as vowels and numbers do not behave or even cheat at all as opposed to human beings.

=== Inductive Reasoning ===
In the previous sections deductive reasoning was discussed, reaching conclusions based on logical rules applied to a set of premises.
However, many problems cannot be represented in a way that would make it possible to use these rules to get a conclusion. This subchapter is about a way to be able to decide in terms of these problems as well: [[Wikipedia:inductive reasoning|inductive reasoning]].

Inductive reasoning is the process of making simple observations of a certain kind and applying these observations via generalization to a different problem to make a decision. Hence one infers from a special case to the general principle which is just the opposite of the procedure of deductive reasoning (Figure 4). 

[[Image:reasoning.jpg|thumb|300px|''Figure 4'']]

A good example for this kind of reasoning is the following:

'''Premise: All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are black.'''

'''Conclusion: Therefore, they reason that all crows on earth are black.'''

In this example it is obvious that Knut and his wife infer from the simple observation about the crows they have seen to the general principle about all crows. Considering figure 5 this means that they infer from the subset (yellow circle) to the whole (blue circle). As in this example it is typical in a process of inductive reasoning that the premises are believed to support the conclusion, but do not ensure it.

[[Image:crows.jpg|300px|''Figure 5'']]

''Figure 5''

==== Forms Of Inductive Reasoning ====

The two different forms of inductive reasoning are &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; induction.
The former describes that the truth of the conclusion is very likely, if the assumed premises are true. An example for this form of reasoning is the one given in the previous section. In this case it is obvious that the premise (&quot;All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are black&quot;) gives good evidence for the conclusion (&quot;All crows on earth are black&quot;) to be true. But nevertheless it is still possible, although very unlikely, that not all crows are black.

On the contrary, conclusions reached by &quot;weak induction&quot; are supported by the premises in a rather weak manner. In this approach the truth of the premises makes the truth of the conclusion possible, but not likely. An example for this kind of reasoning is the following:

'''Premise: Knut always hears music with his IPod.'''

'''Conclusion: Therefore, he reasons that all music is only heard with IPods.'''

In this instance the conclusion is obviously false. The information the premise contains is not very representative and although it is true, it does not give decisive evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  

To sum it up, strong inductive reasoning gets to conclusions which are very probable whereas the conclusions reached through weak inductive reasoning on the base of the premises are unlikely to be true. 
        
==== Reliability Of Conclusions ====

If the strength of the conclusion of an inductive argument has to be determined, three factors concerning the premises play a decisive role. The following example which refers to Knut and his wife and the observations they made about the crows (see previous sections) displays these factors:

When Knut and his wife observe in addition to the black crows in Germany also the crows in Spain, the '''number of observations''' they make concerning the crows obviously increases. Furthermore, the '''representativeness of these observations''' is supported, if Knut and his wife observe the crows at all different day- and nighttimes and see that they are black every time. Theoretically it may be that the crows change their colour at night what would make the conclusion that all crows are black wrong. The '''quality of the evidence''' for all crows to be black increases, if Knut and his wife add scientific measurements which support the conclusion. For example they could find out that the crows` genes determine that the only colour they can have is black.
Conclusions reached through a process of inductive reasoning are never definitely true as no one has seen all crows on earth and as it is possible, although very unlikely, that there is a green or brown exemplar. The three mentioned factors contribute decisively to the strength of an inductive argument. So, the stronger these factors are, the more reliable are the conclusions reached through induction.  
   

==== Processes And Constraints ====

In a process of reasoning people often make use of certain heuristics which lead in many cases quickly to adequate conclusions but sometimes may cause errors. In the following, two of these heuristics ('''availability heuristic''' and '''representativeness heuristic''') are explained. Subsequently the '''confirmation bias''' is introduced which sometimes influences peoples’ reasons according to their own opinion without them realising it.

'''The availability heuristic'''
Things that are more easily remembered are judged to be more prevalent. An example for this is an experiment done by Lichtenstein et al. (1978). The participants were asked to choose from two different lists the causes of death which occur more often. Because of the availability heuristic people judged more “spectacular” causes like homicide or tornado to cause more deaths than others, like asthma.
The reason for the subjects answering in such a way is that for example films and news in television are very often about spectacular and interesting causes of death. This is why these information are much more available to the subjects in the experiment.  
Another effect of the usage of the availability heuristic is called '''illusory correlations'''. People tend to judge according to stereotypes. It seems to them that there are correlations between certain events which in reality do not exist. This is what is known by the term “prejudice”. It means that a much oversimplified generalization about a group of people is made. Usually a correlation seems to exist between negative features and a certain class of people (often fringe groups). 
If, for example, one's neighbour is jobless and very lazy one tends to correlate these two attributes and to create the prejudice that all jobless people are lazy. This illusory correlation occurs because one takes into account information which is available and judges this to be prevalent in many cases.
'''The representativeness heuristic'''
If people have to judge the probability of an event they try to find a comparable event and assume that the two events have a similar probability.
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974) presented the following task to their participants in an experiment: “We randomly chose a man from the population of the U.S., Robert, who wears glasses, speaks quietly and reads a lot. Is it more likely that he is a librarian or a farmer?” 
More of the participants answered that Robert is a librarian which is an effect of the representativeness heuristic. The comparable event which the participants chose was the one of a typical librarian as Robert with his attributes of speaking quietly and wearing glasses resembles this event more than the event of a typical farmer. So, the event of a typical librarian is better comparable with Robert than the event of a typical farmer.
Of course this effect may lead to errors as Robert is randomly chosen from the population and as it is perfectly possible that he is a farmer although he speaks quietly and wears glasses. 
The representativeness heuristic also leads to errors in reasoning in cases where the '''conjunction rule''' is violated. This rule states that the conjunction of two events is never more likely to be the case than the single events alone. An example for this is the case of the feminist bank teller (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1983). If we are introduced to a woman of whom we know that she is very interested in women’s rights and has participated in many political activities in college and we are to decide whether it is more likely that she is a bank teller or a feminist bank teller, we are drawn to conclude the latter as the facts we have learnt about her resemble the event of a feminist bank teller more than the event of only being a bank teller.

[[Image:bankteller.jpg|thumb|300px|''Figure 6, cp. E. Bruce Goldstein - Cognitive Psychology'']]

But it is in fact much more likely that somebody is just a bank teller than it is that someone is a feminist in addition to being a bank teller. This effect is illustrated in figure 6 where the blue circle which stands for just being a bank teller is much larger and thus more probable than the smaller green circle which displays the conjunction of bank tellers and feminists which is a subset of bank tellers. 
Confirmation bias
This phenomenon describes the fact that people tend to decide in terms of what they themselves believe to be true or good. If, for example, someone believes that one has bad luck on Friday the thirteenth, he will especially look for every negative happening at this particular date but will be inattentive to negative happenings on other days. This behaviour strengthens the belief that there exists a relationship between Friday the thirteenth and having bad luck. This example shows that the actual information is not taken into account to come to a conclusion but only the information which supports one's own belief.
This effect leads to errors as people tend to reason in a subjective manner, if personal interests and beliefs are involved.  

All the mentioned factors influence the subjective probability of an event so that it differs from the actual probability ('''probability heuristic'''). Of course all of these factors do not always appear alone, but they influence one another and can occur in combination during the process of reasoning.

==== Why Inductive Reasoning At All? ====

All the described constraints show how prone to errors inductive reasoning is and so the question arises, why we use it at all? 
But inductive reasons are important nevertheless because they act as shortcuts for our reasoning. It is much easier and faster to apply the availability heuristic or the representativeness heuristic to a problem than to take into account all information concerning the current topic and draw a conclusion by using logical rules. 
In the following excerpt of very usual actions there is a lot of inductive reasoning involved although one does not realize it on the first view. It points out the importance of this cognitive ability:

''The sunrise every morning and the sunset in the evening, the change of seasons, the TV program, the fact that a chair does not collapse when we sit on it or the light bulb that flashes after we have pushed a button.''
 
All of these cases are conclusions derived from processes of inductive reasoning. Accordingly, one assumes that the chair one is sitting on does not collapse as the chairs on which one sat before did not collapse. This does not ensure that the chair does not break into pieces but nevertheless it is a rather helpful conclusion to assume that the chair remains stable as this is very probable. To sum it up, inductive reasoning is rather advantageous in situations where deductive reasoning is just not applicable because only evidence but no proved facts are available. As these situations occur rather often in everyday life, living without the use of inductive reasoning is inconceivable.

'''Induction vs. deduction'''

The table below (Figure 7) summarises the most prevalent properties and differences between deductive and inductive reasoning which are important to keep in mind.

[[Image:invsde.jpg|650px]]

''Figure 7''

== Decision Making ==

According to the different levels of consequences, each process of making a decision requires appropriate effort and various aspects to be considered.  The following excerpt from the story about Knut makes this obvious:
“After considering facts like the warm weather in Spain and shirts and shorts being much more comfortable in this case (information gathering and likelihood estimation) Knut reasons that he needs them for his vacation. In consequence, he finally makes the decision to pack mainly shirts and shorts in his bag (final act of choosing).”
Now it seems like there cannot be any decision making without previous reasoning, but that is not true. Of course there are situations in which someone decides to do something spontaneously, with no time to reason about it. We will not go into detail here but you might think about questions like ''&quot;Why do we choose one or another option in that case?&quot;''

=== Choosing Among Alternatives ===

The psychological process of [[Wikipedia: Decision making|decision making]] constantly goes along with situations in daily life. Thinking about Knut again we can imagine him to decide between packing more blue or more green shirts for his vacation (which would only have minor consequences) but also about applying a specific job or having children with his wife (which would have relevant influence on important circumstances of his future life). The mentioned examples are both characterized by personal decisions, whereas professional decisions, dealing for example with economic or political issues, are just as important.

==== The Utility Approach ====
[[Image:value.png|frame|100px|''Utility: outcomes that are desirable because they are in the person‘s best interest'']]

There are three different ways to analyse decision making. The normative approach assumes a rational decision-maker with well-defined preferences. While the rational choice theory is based on a priori considerations, the descriptive approach is based on empirical observation and on experimental studies of choice behavior. The prescriptive enterprise develops methods in order to improve decision making.
According to Manktelow and Reber´s definition, “utility refers to outcomes that are desirable because they are in the person’s best interest” (Reber, A. S., 1995; Manktelow, K., 1999). This normative/descriptive approach characterizes optimal decision making by the maximum expected utility in terms of monetary value. This approach can be helpful in gambling theories, but simultaneously includes several disadvantages. People do not necessarily focus on the monetary payoff, since they find value in things other than money, such as fun, free time, family, health and others. But that is not a big problem, because it rather is necessarily possible to apply the following graph, which shows the relation between (monetary) gains/losses and their subjective value (which is equal to utility), to all the valuable things mentioned above. Therefore not choosing the maximal monetary value does not automatically describe an irrational decision process.

==== Misleading Effects ====

But even respecting the considerations above there might still be problems to make the “right” decision because of different misleading effects, which mainly arise because of the constraints of inductive reasoning. In general this means that our model of a situation/problem might not be ideal to solve it in an optimal way. The following three points are typical examples for such effects.

'''Situation Models'''

This effect is rather equal to the illusory correlations mentioned before in the part about the constraints of inductive reasoning. It is about the problem that models which people create might be misleading, since they rely on subjective speculations. An example could be deciding where to move by considering typical prejudices of the countries (e.g. always good pizza, nice weather and a relaxed life-style in Italy in contrast to some kind of boring food and steady rain in Great Britain). The predicted events are not equal to the events occurring indeed.
(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1982; Dunning &amp; Parpal, 1989)

'''Focusing Illusion'''

Another misleading effect is the so-called '''focusing illusion'''.  By considering only the most obvious aspects in order to make a  certain decision (e.g. the weather) people often neglect various really important outcomes (e.g. circumstances at work). This effect occurs more often, if people judge about others compared with judgments about their own living.

'''Framing Effect'''

A problem can be described in different ways and therefore evoke different decision strategies. If a problem is specified in terms of gains, people tend to use a risk-aversion strategy, while a problem description in terms of losses leads to apply a risk-taking strategy.
An example of the same problem and predictably different choices is the following experiment:
A group of people asked to imagine themselves $300 richer than they are, is confronted with the choice of a sure gain of $100 or an equal chance to gain $200 or nothing. Most people avoid the risk and take the sure gain, which means they take the risk-aversion strategy. 
Alternatively if people are asked to assume themselves to be $500 richer than in reality, given the options of a sure loss of $100 or an equal chance to lose $200 or nothing, the majority opts for the risk of losing $200 by taking the risk seeking or risk-taking strategy. This phenomenon is known as '''framing effect''' and can also be illustrated by the graph ''&quot;Utility: outcomes that are desirable because they are in the person‘s best interest&quot;'' above, which is a concave function for gains and a convex one for losses.
(''Foundations of Cognitve Psychology'', Levitin, D. J., 2002)

==== Justification in Decision Making ====

Decision making often includes the need to assign a reason for the decision and therefore justify it. This factor is illustrated by an experiment by A. Tversky and E. Shafir (1992):
A very attractive vacation package has been offered to a group of students who have just passed an exam and to another group of students who have just failed the exam and have the chance to rewrite it after the holidays coming up. All students have the options to buy the ticket straight away, to stay at home, or to pay $5 for keeping the option open to buy it later.
At this point, there is no difference between the two groups, since the number of students who passed the exam and decided to book the flight (with the justification of a deserving a reward), is the same as the number of students who failed and booked the flight (justified as consolation and having time for reoccupation).
A third group of students who were informed to receive their results in two more days was confronted with the same problem. The majority decided to pay $5 and keep the option open until they would get their results.
The conclusion now is that even though the actual exam result does not influence the decision, it is required in order to provide a rationale.

== Executive Functions ==

[[File:Frontallobe.jpg|thumb|350px|''Figure 9: The Frontal Lobes'']]

Subsequently, the question arises how this cognitive ability of making decisions is realized in the human brain. As we already know that there are a couple of different tasks being are involved  in the whole process, there has to be something that coordinates and controls those brain activities – namely the executive functions. They are the brain's conductor, instructing other brain regions to perform, or be silenced, and generally coordinating their synchronized activity (Goldberg, 2001). Thus, they are responsible for optimizing the performance of all “multi-threaded” cognitive tasks.

Locating those executive functions is rather difficult, as they cannot be appointed to a single brain region. Traditionally, they have been equated with the frontal lobes, or rather the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes; but it is still an open question whether all of their aspects can be associated with these regions.

Nevertheless, we will concentrate on the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes, to get an impression of the important role of the executive functions within cognition. Moreover, it is possible to subdivide these regions into functional parts. But it is to be noted that not all researchers regard the prefrontal cortex as containing functionally different regions.

=== Deficits in initiation, cessation and control of action ===

We start by describing the effects of the loss of the ability to start something, to initiate an action. A person with executive dysfunction is likely to have trouble beginning to work on a task without strong help from the outside, while people with left frontal lobe damage often show impaired spontaneous speech and people with right frontal lobe damage rather show poor nonverbal fluency. Of course, one reason is the fact that this person will not have any intention, desire or concern on his or her own of solving the task since this is yet another characteristic of executive dysfunction. But it is also due to a psychological effect often connected with the loss of properly executive functioning: psychological inertia.

Like in physics, inertia in this case means that an action is very hard to initiate, but once started, it is again very hard to shift or stop. This phenomenon is characterized by engagement in repetitive behavior, is called perseveration and can best be observed in a famous experiment, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test or short, WCST.

[[Image:WCST.jpg|thumb|480px|''Example for the WCST: Cards sorted according to shape (a), number (b) or color (c) of the objects'']]

A participant is presented with cards that show certain objects. These cards are defined by shape, color and number of the objects on the cards. These cards now have to be sorted according to a rule based on one of these three criteria. The participant does not know which rule is the right one but has to reach the conclusion after positive or negative feedback of the experimenter. Then at some point, after the participant has found the correct rule to sort the cards, the experimenter changes the rule and the correct sorting will lead to negative feedback. The participant has to realize the change and adapt to it by sorting the cards according to the new rule.

Patients with executive dysfunction have problems identifying the rule in the first place. It takes them noticeably longer because they have trouble using already given information to make a conclusion (will be explained later). But once they got to sorting correctly and the rule changes, they keep sorting the cards according to the old rule although many of them notice the negative feedback. They are just not able to switch to another sorting-principle, or at least they need many tries to learn the new one. They perseverate.

Another problem caused by executive dysfunction can be observed in patients suffering from the so called environmental dependency syndrome. Their actions are impelled or obligated by their physical or social environment. This manifests itself in many different ways and depends to a large extent on the individual’s personal history. Examples are patients who begin to type when they see a computer key board, who start washing the dishes upon seeing a dirty kitchen or who hang up pictures on the walls when finding hammer, nails and pictures on the floor. This makes these people appear as if they were acting impulsively or as if they have lost their ‘free will’. It shows a lack of control for their actions. This is due to the fact that an impairment in their executive functions causes a disconnection between thought an action, these patients know that their actions are wrong but like in the WCST, they cannot control what they are doing. Even if they are told by which attribute to sort the cards, they will still keep sorting them sticking to the old rule due to major difficulties in the translation of these directions into action.

What is needed to avoid problems like these are the abilities to start, stop or change an action but very likely also the ability to use information to direct behavior.

=== Impairments in abstract and conceptual thinking ===

To solve many tasks it is important that one is able to use given information. Often this means that material has to be processed in an abstract rather than in a concrete manner. Patients with executive dysfunction have abstraction difficulties. This is proven by another card sorting experiment (Delis et al., 1992).

This time, the cards show names of animals and black or white triangles placed above or below the word. Again, the cards can be sorted with attention to different attributes of the animals (living on land or in water, domestic or dangerous, large or small) or the triangles (black or white, above or below word). Unlike in the WCST, people with frontal lobe damage fail to solve the task because they cannot even conceptualize the properties of the animals or the triangles, thus are not able to deduce a sorting-rule for the cards (in contrast, there are some individuals with only perseverative tendencies, they find a sorting-criterion but then are unable to switch it).

As we have seen in other examples before, these problems in abstract conceptualization remain after the participants have been given abstract or even concrete cues. Therefore, it is sometimes believed that their problem might be caused by, once again, the difficulty in translating thought to action.
Furthermore, once they found a rule to sort, they are unable to describe their sorting-criterion. 

In general, all these problems are not connected to perseverative tendencies but rather to major difficulties for patients with frontal lobe damage to conceptualize information in an abstract manner. Plus, that information cannot be used to guide behavior.
A reason for these problems might be a general difficulty in strategy formation (will be discussed later). 

=== Deficits in cognitive estimation ===

Cognitive estimation is the ability to use known information to make reasonable judgements or deductions about the world. Now the inability for cognitive estimation is the third type of deficits often observed in individuals with executive dysfunction.
It is already known that people with executive dysfunction have a relatively unaffected knowledge base. This means they cannot retain knowledge about information or at least they are unable to make inferences based on it. There are various effects which are shown on such individuals. Now for example patients with frontal lobe damage have difficulty estimating the length of the spine of an average woman. Making such realistic estimation requires inference based on other knowledge which is in this case, knowing that the height of the average woman is about 5&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in (168&amp;nbsp;cm) and considering that the spine runs about one third to one half the length of the body and so on.
Patients with such a dysfunction do not only have difficulties in their estimates of cognitive information but also in their estimates of their own capacities (such as their ability to direct activity in goal – oriented manner or in controlling their emotions).
Prigatuno, Altman and O’Brien (1990) reported that when patients with anterior lesions associated with diffuse axonal injury to other brain areas are asked how capable they are of performing tasks such as scheduling their daily activities or preventing their emotions from affecting daily activities, they grossly overestimate their abilities.
From several experiments Smith and Miler (1988) found out that individuals with frontal lobe damages have no difficulties in determining whether an item was in a specific inspection series they find it difficult to estimate how frequently an item did occur. This may not only reflect difficulties in cognitive estimation but also in memory task that place a premium on remembering temporal information.
Later the fact that individuals with such dysfunction and frontal lobe damage are impaired on a variety of sequencing tasks will be explained more in detail.
Thus both difficulties (in cognitive estimation and in temporal sequencing) may contribute to a reduced ability to estimate frequency of occurrence.
Despite these impairments in some domains the abilities of estimation are preserved in patients with frontal lobe damage. Such patients also do have problems in estimating how well they can prevent their emotions for affecting their daily activities. They are also as component as patients with temporal lobe damage or neurologically intact patients at judging how many dues they will need to solve a puzzle. For solving a puzzle patients with frontal lobe damage try to guess the answer.
Therefore the ability for estimating is not entirely lost but is compromised in a number of areas. 

=== Lack of Cognitive Flexibility and Deficits in the Response to Novelty ===

People with executive dysfunction are unable to look at situations from more than one point and to produce a variety of behavior and therefore unable to be cognitively flexible.
Now this cognitive inflexibility can be called distinct from and related to cognitive estimation.
But when dealing with new situations this flexibility is very important. It is also required when a person has to react newly to an old stimulus. Because damage to the prefrontal areas in the brain leads to difficulties in dealing with novel situations some theorists suggest that this area plays an important role.

=== Deficits in goal directed behavior ===

The last part that is affected by the breakdown of executive functions we want to discuss are the problems in goal-directed behavior. This topic is closely related to the area of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective problem solving] since this is nothing else than organizing behavior towards a goal.

To make this more plastic, for the course of this topic we want to introduce an example that requires an individual to behave goal-directed.
Let us imagine that a person, call him John, has just got up in the morning and wants to get dressed, in this case John’s goal is being dressed. 
For neurologically intact people this task is not at all hard to master, they might not even realize that it is any task because it is so trivial.
But if you look closely, there are a lot of things that have to be taken into account while working towards being fully dressed and any other task – trivial or not – in general.

==== What characterizes goal directed behavior? ====

Now, in the case of John, which are these?

'''Goal must be kept in mind'''

During the whole process it is improtant to always remember what it actually was that John wanted to do. If he starts getting dressed and forgets that he wanted to get dressed quickly because he might have oversplept and is late in time, and starts making his breakfast, he definitely will not reach his goal of getting fully dressed.

'''Dividing into subtasks and sequencing'''

Most tasks have to de divided into subtasks, in John’s case: getting clothes, such as underwear, a shirt, trousers, socks and a tie, and putting them on one after the other in a sensible order. This means that John has to sequence the subtasks. He has to think about the fact that he cannot put on any clothes that are still inside of the wardrobe and that he cannot put on the underwear after he has put on his trousers.

'''Completed portions must be kept in mind'''

John has to remember which of the subtasks he has performed already, meaning that he need not do them again. He only needs to get one piece (or pair) of clothes of each kind out of the wardrobe and after he has put on his tie he must know that he does not have to look for another one and put this on as well.

'''Flexibility and adaptability'''

Imagine that John has a shirt that is his favourite one and he plans on wearing it today. He looks into the wardrobe and does not find it. Now he has to realize that the shirt is not inside the wardrobe and has to develop alternative ways to complete the task of getting dressed. Maybe his wife has put the shirt into the laundry because it was dirty? In this case, John has to adapt to this situation and has to pick another shirt that was not in his plan originally.

'''Evaluation of actions'''

Along the way of reaching his ultimate goal John constantly has to evaluate his performance in terms of ‘How am I doing considering that I have the goal of being dressed?’. If he is looking for socks or is working on the knot of his tie (after he has put on all the other clothes), he should know that he is doing perfectly fine in completing the subtasks required to reach his goal. But if he is distracted by his new tuxedo inside the wardrobe and starts getting dressed in it just to see how it looks on him, he has to realize that he is not working towards his goal of being properly dressed for a day at the office. He also will not reach his goal if he has the opinion that he is done getting dressed when he is only wearing his underpants and socks.

As we have seen, goal directed bahaviour is by far not as easy as it looks on first sight. Most people still will not have any trouble though, but think about what we have said about executive functions already.

==== Executive dysfunction and goal directed behavior ====

The breakdown of executive functions impairs goal directed behavior to a large extend. In which way cannot be stated in general, it depends on the specific brain regions that are damaged.
So it is quite possible that an individual with a particular lesion has problems with two or three of the five points described above and performs within average regions when the other abilities are tested, however, if only one link is missing from the chain, the whole plan might get very hard or even impossible to master. Furthermore, the particular hemisphere affected plays a role as well. Patients with lesions in the left hemisphere have difficulties with one aspect of a task and patients with lesions ind the right hemisphere have difficulties with other aspects of the same tasks.

'''Problems in sequencing'''

For example, in an experiment (Milner, 1982) people were shown a sequence of cards with pictures. The experiment included two different tasks: recognition trials and recency trials. In the former the patients were shown two different pictures, one of them has appeared in the sequence before, and the participants had to decide which one it was. In the latter they were shown two different pictures, both of them have appeared before, they had to name the picture that was shown more recently than the other one.
The results of this experiment showed that people with lesions in temporal regions have more trouble with the recognition trial and patients with frontal lesions have difficulties with the recency trial since anterior regions are important for sequencing. This is due to the fact that the recognition trial demanded a properly functioning [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory recognition memory], the recency trial a properly functioning [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory memory for item order]. These two are dissociable and located in different areas of the brain.

Another interesting result was the fact that lesions in the frontal lobes of left and right hemisphere impaired different abilities. While a lesion in the right hemisphere caused trouble in making recency judgements, a lesion in the left hemisphere impaired the patient’s performance only when the presented material was verbal or in a variation of the experiment that required self-ordered sequencing.
Because of that we know that the ability to sequence behavior is not only located in the frontal lobe but in the left hemisphere particularly when it comes to motor action.

The frontal lobe is not only important for sequencing but also for [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory working memory] because the patient has to keep track of the items presented to them to make recency judgements. This idea is supported by the fact that lesions in the lateral regions of the frontal lobe are much more likely to impair this ability than damage to other areas of the frontal cortex.

But this is not the only thing there is to sequencing. For reaching a goal in the best possible way it is important that a person is able to figure out which sequence of actions, which strategy, best suits the purpose, in addition to just being able to develop a correct sequence.
This is proven by an experiment called 'Tower of London' (Shallice, 1982) which is similar to the famous 'Tower of Hanoi' task with the difference that this task required three balls to be put onto three poles of different length so that one pole could hold three balls, the second one two and the third one only one ball, in a way that a changeable goal position is attained out of a fixed initial position in as few moves as possible. Especially patients with damage to the left frontal lobe proved to work inefficiently and ineffectively on this task, they needed many moves and engaged in actions that did not lead toward the goal.
But in the end, although there are differences in how executive functions are affected depending on the particular hemisphere where the frontal lobe lesion is located, abilities connected with sequencing are mostly provided by overlapping structures in both frontal lobes.

'''Problems in shifting and modifying strategies'''

The intact neuronal tissue in the frontal lobe is also crucial for another exectuvie function connected with goal directed behavior that we described above: flexibility and adaptability.
This means that a person with frontal lobe damage will have difficulties in shifting in set - meaning creating a new plan after it has been found out that the original one cannot be carried out for some reason - and in modifying the initial strategy according to this new set.
In what particular way this can be observed in patients can again not be stated in general but depends on the nature of the shift that has to be made.

An experiment (Owen, 1991) that presented patients with pictures that required different kinds of conceptual shifts, discrimination between two black shapes, between two black shapes while ignoring intermingled white shapes ('intradimensional') and between the two white shapes ('extradimensional'), showed that patients with lesions in the frontal lobe have difficulties only with the extradimensional shift. This shows that these people cannot apply general rules to situations that are different from the origninal situations when these rules were learned. Besides, they are unable to create alternatives to their original plans because they stay fixed on their original way of dealing with a situation and cannot disengage from it. This is also part of the usual perseveration problems found in patients with executive dysfunction.

Another problem of patients with frontal lobe damage is that they do not use as many appropriate hypotheses for creating a strategy as people with damage to other brain regions do or they suddenly abandon it when they have found an appropriate hypothesis. Also, it seems not very surprising that they have big trouble switching between hypotheses indicated by Owen's experiment. Even when it is clear that one hypothesis cannot be the right one, patients will stick to it nevertheless and are unable to abandon it (called 'tunnel vision').

These earlier described problems of 'redirecting' of one's strategies stand in contrast to the atcual 'act of switching' between tasks.
This is yet another problem for patients with frontal lobe damage. Since the control system that leads task switching as such is independent from the parts that actually perform these tasks, the task switching is particularly impaired in patients with lesions to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while at the same time they have no trouble with performing the single tasks alone. This of course, causes a lot of problems in goal directed behavior because as it was said before, most tasks consist of smaller subtasks that have to be completed.

'''Problems with the interpretation of available information'''

Quite often, if we want to reach a goal, we get hints on how to do it best. This means we have to be able to interpret the available information in terms of what the appropriate strategy would be. For many patients of executive dysfunction this is not an easy thing to do either. They have trouble to use this information and thus, engage in inefficient actions and it takes them much longer to solve a task than it would if they took into account the extra information and developed an effective strategy.

'''Problems with self-criticism and -monitoring'''

The last problem for people with frontal lobe damage we want to present here is the last point in the above list of properties important for proper goal directed behavior. It is the ability to evaluate one's actions, an ability that is missing in most patients. These people are therefore very likely to 'wander off task' and engage in behavior that does not help them to attain their goal. In addition to that, they are also not able to determine whether their task is already completed at all. Reasons for this are thought to be a lack of motivation or lack of concern about one's performance (frontal lobe damage is usually accompanied by changes in emotional processing) but these are probably not the only explanations there are for these problems.

Another important brain region in this context – the medial portion of the frontal lobe – is responsible for detecting behavioral errors made while working towards a goal. This has been shown by [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Behavioural_and_Neuroscience_Methods ERP experiments] where there was an error-related negativity 100ms after an error has been made.
If this area is damaged, this mechanism cannot work properly anymore and the patient loses the ability to detect errors and thus monitor his own behavior.

However, in the end we must add that although executive dysfunction causes an enormous number of problems in behaving correctly towards a goal, most patients when assigned with a task are indeed anxious to solve it but are just unable to do so which can manifest in all the various ways discussed in the passages above.

=== Theories of Frontal Lobe Function in Executive Control ===

In order to explain that patients with [[Wikipedia: Frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] damage have difficulties in performing executive functions, four major approaches have developed. Each of them leads to an improved understanding of the role of frontal regions in executive functions, but none of these theories covers all the deficits occurred.
	
==== Role of Working Memory ====

The most anatomically specific approach assumes the dorsolateral prefrontal area of the frontal lobe to be critical for working memory. The working memory which has to be clearly distinguished from the long term memory keeps information on-line for use in performing a task. 

Not being generated for accounting for the broad array of dysfunctions it focuses on the three following deficits. Sequencing information and directing behavior toward a goal, understanding of temporal relations between items and events, and some aspects of environmental dependency and perseveration.

Research on monkeys has been helpful to develop this approach (the delayed-respone paradigm, Goldman-Rakic, 1987, serves as a classical example.

In 2000 the working memory was defined by Baddeley as “a limited capacity system for temporary storage and manipulation of information for complex tasks such as comprehension, learning, and reasoning” (Goldstein) consisting of three components. 
The central executive coordinating the activity of the phonological loop (which holds verbal and auditory information) and the visuospatioal sketch pad (which holds visual and spatial information) and pulling information from long-term memory is the most important part. 

==== Role of Controlled Versus Automatic Processes ====

There are two theories based on the underlying assumption that “the frontal lobes are especially important for controlling behavior in nonroutine situations and for overriding typical stimulusresponse associations, but contribute little to automatic and effortless behavior.” (Banich, p.&amp;nbsp;397).

Stuss and Benson (1986) consider control over behavior to occur in a hierarchical manner. They distinguish between three different levels, of which each is associated with a particular brain region. In the first level sensory information is processed automatically by posterior regions, in the next level (associated with the executive functions of the frontal lobe) conscious control is needed to direct behavior toward a goal and at the highest level controlled self-reflection takes place in the prefrontal cortex.

This model is appropriate for explaining deficits in goal-oriented behavior, in dealing with novelty, the lack of cognitive flexibility and the environmental dependency syndrome. Furthermore it can explain the inability to consciously control action and to self-criticize.

The second model developed by Shalice (1982) proposes a system consisting of two parts to influence the choice of behavior. The first part, a cognitive system called contention scheduling, is in charge of more automatic processing. Various links and processing schemes cause a single stimulus to result in an automatic string of actions. Once an action is initiated, it remains active until inhibited.

The second cognitive system is the supervisory attentional system which directs attention and guids action through decision processes and is only active “when no processing schemes are available, when the task is technically difficult, when problem solving is required and when certain response tendencies must be overcome” (Banich).

This theory supports the observations of few deficits in routine situations, but relevant problems in dealing with novel tasks (e.g. the Tower of London task, Shallice), since no schemes in contention scheduling exist for dealing with it.
Impulsive action is another characteristic of patients with frontal lobe damages which can be explained by this theory. Even if asked not to do certain things, such patients stick to their routines and cannot control their automatic behavior.

==== Use of Scripts ====

The approach based on scripts, which are sets of events, actions and ideas that are linked to form a unit of knowledge was developed  by Schank (1982) amongst others.

Containing information about the setting in which an event occurs, the set of events needed to achieve the goal and the end event terminating the action, such managerial knowledge units (MKUs) are stored in the prefrontal cortex. They are organized in a hierarchical manner being abstract at the top and getting more specific at the bottom.

Damage of the scripts leads to not being able to behave goal-directed, finding it easier to cope with usual situations (due to the difficulty of retrieving a MKU of a novel event) and deficits in the initiation and cessation of action (because of MKUs specifying the beginning and ending of an action.)

==== Role of a goal list ====

The perspective of artificial intelligence and machine learning introduced an approach which assumes that each person has a goal list, which contains the tasks requirements or goals. This list is fundamental to guiding behavior and since a frontal lobe damage disrupts the ability to form a goal list, the theory helps to explain difficulties in abstract thinking, perceptual analysis, verbal output and staying on task.  It can also account for the strong environmental influence on patients with frontal lobe damages, due to the lack  of internal goals and the difficulty of organizing actions toward a goal.

== Introduction ==

Introduction 

&quot;You need memory to keep track of the flow of conversation&quot; &lt;ref&gt;E. G. Goldstein, &quot;Cognitive Psychology - Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience&quot;, page 137, THOMSON WADSWORTH TM 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Maybe the interaction between memory and language does not seem very obvious at first, but this interaction is necessary when trying to lead a conversation properly. 
Memory is the component for storing and retrieving information. So to remember both things just said and information heard before which might be important for the conversation.
Whereas language serves for following the conversational partner, to understand what he says and to reply to him in an understandable way. &lt;br&gt;
This is not a simple process which can be learned within days. In childhood everybody learns to communicate, a process lasting for years. &lt;br&gt;
So how does this work? Possible responses to the question of language acquisition are presented in this chapter.The section also provides an insight into the topic of malfunctions in the brain. Concerning dysfunctions the following questions  arise: How can the system of language and memory be destroyed? What causes language impairments? How do the impairments become obvious? These are some of the topics dealt with in this chapter.

Up to now, the whole profoundness of memory and language cannot be explored because the present financial resources are insufficient. And the connection between memory and language mostly becomes obvious when an impairment arises. So certain brain areas are explored when having a comparison between healthy brain and impaired brain. Then it is possible to find out what function this brain area has and how a dysfunction becomes obvious.

== Basics ==
 
=== Memory ===

Memory is the ability of the nervous system to receive and keep information.
It is divided into three parts: Sensory memory, Short-term memory and Long-term memory. Sensory memory holds information for milliseconds and is separated into two components. The iconic memory is responsible for visual information, whereas auditory information is processed in the echoic memory. Short-term memory keeps information for at most half a minute. Long-term memory, which can store information over decades, consists of the conscious explicit and the unconscious implicit memory. Explicit memory, also known as declarative, can be subdivided into semantic and episodic memory. Procedural memory and priming effects are components of the implicit memory.

=== Language ===

Language is an essential system for communication which highly influences our life. This system uses sounds, symbols and gestures for the purpose of communication.
Visual and auditory systems of a human body are the entrance-pathway for language to enter the brain. The motor system is responsible for speech and writing production, it serves as exit-pathway for language. The nature of language exists in the brain processes between the sensory and motor systems, especially between visual or auditory income and written or spoken outcome.
The biggest part of the knowledge about brain mechanism for language is deduced from studies of language deficits resulting from brain damage. Even if there are about 10 000 different languages and dialects in the world, all of them express the subtleties of human experience and emotion.

For detailed information see chapters [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Comprehension|'''Comprehension''']] and [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Neuroscience of Comprehension|'''Neuroscience of Comprehension''']]

== Acquisition of language ==

A phenomenon which occurs daily and in everybody’s life is the acquisition of language. Anyhow scientists are not yet able to explain the underlying processes in detail or to define the point when language acquisition commences, even if they agree that it happens long before the first word is spoken.&lt;br&gt;
Theorists like Catherine Snow and Michael Tomasello think that the acquisition of language skills begins at birth. Others claim, it already commences in the womb. Newborns are not able to speak, even if babbling activates the brain regions later involved in speech production.&lt;br&gt;
The ability to understand the meaning of words already begins before the first birthday, even if they cannot be pronounced till then. The phonological representation of words in the memory changes between the stage of repetitive syllable-babbling and the one-word stage. At first children associate words with concrete objects, followed by an extension to the class of objects. After a period of overgeneralisation the children’s system of concept approaches to the adults’ one. To prove the assumption of understanding the meaning of words that early, researches at MIT let children watch two video clips of “Sesame Street”. Simultaneously the children heard the sentences “Cookie Monster is tickling Big Bird” or “Big Bird is tickling Cookie Monster”. The babies consistently looked more at the video corresponding to the sentence, what is an evidence for comprehension of more complex sentences, than they are able to produce during the one-word period.&lt;br&gt;
The different stages of speech production are listed in the table below.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
!Age

!Example
|-
|6th month	
|Stage of babbling: &lt;br&gt;

|12th month	
|Usage of first words - John Locke(1995): &lt;br&gt;
- prephonological
&amp;rarr; consonant-vowel(-consonant)	
|car, hat 
|}


Locke’s theory about the usage of the first word is only a general tendency. Other researchers like Charlotte Bühler (1928), a German psychologist, think that the age of speaking the first word is around the tenth month, whereas Elizabeth Bates et al. (1992) proposed a period between eleven and 13 months. The one-word stage described above can last from two till ten months. Until the second year of life a vocabulary of about 50 words evolves, four times more than the child utilises. Two thirds of the language processed is still babbling. After this stage of learning the vocabulary increases rapidly. The so called vocabulary spurt causes an increment of about one word every two hours. From now on children learn to have fluent conversations with a simple grammar containing errors. 

As you can see in the following example, the length of the sentences and the grammatical output changes a lot. While raising his son, Knut keeps a tally of his son’s speech production, to see how fast the language develops:

Speech diary of Knut’s son Andy:&lt;br&gt;
''(Year; Month)&lt;br&gt;
''2;3: Play checkers. Big drum. I got horn. A bunny rabbit walk.&lt;br&gt;
''2;4: See marching bear go? Screw part machine. That busy bulldozer truck.&lt;br&gt;
''2;5: Now put boots on. Where wrench go? Mommy talking bout lady. What that paper clip doing?&lt;br&gt;
''2;6: Write a piece a paper. What that egg doing? I lost a shoe. No, I don't want to sit seat. &lt;br&gt;
''2;7: Where piece a paper go? Ursula has a boot on. Going to see kitten. Put the cigarette down. Dropped a rubber band. Shadow has hat just like that. Rintintin don't fly, Mommy. &lt;br&gt;
''2;8: Let me get down with the boots on. Don't be afraid a horses. How tiger be so healthy and 
fly like kite? Joshua throw like a penguin. &lt;br&gt;
''2;9: Where Mommy keep her pocket book? Show you something funny. Just like turtle make mud pie.&lt;br&gt;
''2;10: Look at that train Ursula brought. I simply don't want put in chair. You don't have paper. Do you want little bit, Cromer? I can't wear it tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;
''2;11: That birdie hopping by Missouri in bag? Do want some pie on your face? Why you mixing baby chocolate? I finish drinking all up down my throat. I said why not you coming in? Look at that piece a paper and tell it. We going turn light on so you can't see.&lt;br&gt;
''3;0: I going come in fourteen minutes. I going wear that to wedding. I see what happens. I have to save them now. Those are not strong mens. They are going sleep in wintertime. You dress me up like a baby elephant.&lt;br&gt;
''3;1: I like to play with something else. You know how to put it back together. I gon' make it like a rocket to blast off with. I put another one on the floor. You went to Boston University? You want to give me some carrots and some beans? Press the button and catch it, sir. I want some other peanuts. Why you put the pacifier in his mouth? Doggies like to climb up.&lt;br&gt;
''3;2: So it can't be cleaned? I broke my racing car. Do you know the light wents off? What happened to the bridge? When it's got a flat tire it's need a go to the station. I dream sometimes. I'm going to mail this so the letter can't come off. I want to have some espresso. The sun is not too bright. Can I have some sugar? Can I put my head in the mailbox so the mailman can know where I are and put me in the mailbox? Can I keep the screwdriver just like a carpenter keep the screwdriver?'' &lt;ref&gt;S. Pinker, The Language Instinct, p.269f&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously children are able to conjugate verbs and to decline nouns using regular rules. To produce irregular forms is more difficult, because they have to be learnt and stored in Long-term memory one by one. Rather than the repetition of words, the observation of speech is important to acquire grammatical skills. Around the third birthday the complexity of language increases exponentially and reaches a rate of about 1000 syntactic types.&lt;br&gt;
Another interesting field concerning the correlation between Memory and Language is Multilingualism. Thinking about children educated bilingual, the question arises how the two languages are separated or combined in the brain. Scientists assume that especially lexical information is stored independently for each language; the semantic and syntactic levels rather could be unified. Experiments have shown that bilinguals have a more capacious span of memory when they listen to words not only in one but in both languages.

== Disorders and Malfunctions ==

Reading about the disorders concerning memory and language one might possibly think about amnesia or aphasia, both common diseases in the concerned brain regions. But when dealing with the correlation of memory and language we want to introduce only diseases which affect loss of memory as well as loss of language.


=== Alzheimer's Desease ===

Alzheimer’s disease

Discovered in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer this disease is the most common type of dementia. 
Alzheimer’s is characterised by symptoms like loss of memory, loss of language skills and  impairments in skilled movements. Additionally other cognitive functions such as planning or 
decision-making which are connected to the frontal and temporal lobe can be reduced. 
The correlation between memory and language in this context is very important because they work together in order to establish conversations. When both are impaired, communication becomes a difficult task. People with alzheimer’s have reduced working memory capability, so they cannot keep in mind all of the information they heard during a conversation. They also forget words which they need to denote items, their desires and to understand what they are told.
Affected persons also change their behaviour, they become anxious, suspicious or restless and they may have delusions or hallucinations. 
In the early stages of the disorder sick persons become less energetic or suffer little loss of memory. But they are still able to dress themselves, to eat and to communicate.
Middle stages of the disease are characterised by problems of navigation and orientation. They do not find their way home or even forget where they live.
In the late stages of the disease the patients’ ability to speak, read and write decreases enormously. They are no longer able to denote objects and to talk about their feelings and desires. So their family and the nursing staff have great problems to find out what the patients want to tell them. 
In the end-state the sick persons do not show any response or reaction. They lie in bed, have to be fed and are totally helpless. 
Most of them die after four to six years after diagnosis, although the disease can endure from three to twenty years. A cause for this is the difficulty to distinguish Alzheimer’s from other related disorders. Only after death when seeing the shrinkage of the brain one can definitely say that the person was affected by Alzheimer’s disease.

''&quot;Genetic Science Learning Center, University of Utah, http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/
''A comparison of the two brains:&lt;br&gt;
''In the Alzheimer brain:&lt;br&gt;
''·	The cortex shrivels up, damaging areas involved in thinking, planning and remembering. &lt;br&gt;
''·	Shrinkage is especially severe in the hippocampus, an area of the cortex that plays a key role in formation of new memories. &lt;br&gt;
''·	Ventricles (fluid-filled spaces within the brain) grow larger. 

Scientists say that long before the first symptoms appear nerve cells that store and retrieve information have already begun to degenerate.
There are two theories giving an explanation for the causes of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first describes plaques as protein fragmens which defect the connection between nerve cells. They arise when little fragments release from nerve cell walls and associate with other fragments from outside the cell. These combinded fragments, called plaques, append to the outside of nerve cells and destroy the connections. Then the nerve cells start to die because they are no longer provided with nutrients. As a conclusion the stimuli are no longer transferred. 
The second theory explains that tangles limit the functions of nerve cells. They are twisted fibers of another protein that form inside brain cells and destroy the vital cell transport made of proteins.
But scientists have not yet found out the exact role of plaques and tangles.

''&quot;Genetic Science Learning Center, University of Utah, http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/&lt;br&gt;
''-	 Alzheimer tissue has many fewer nerve cells and synapses than a healthy brain. &lt;br&gt;
''-	Plaques, abnormal clusters of protein fragments, build up between nerve cells. &lt;br&gt;
''Dead and dying nerve cells contain tangles, which are made up of twisted fibers of another protein.

Alzheimer’s progress is separated into three stages: 
In the early stages (1) tangles and plaques begin to evolve in brain areas where learning, memory, thinking and planning takes place. This may begin 20 years before diagnosis.
In the middle stages(2), plaques and tangles start to spread to areas of speaking and understanding speech. Also the sense of where your body is in relation to objects around you is reduced. This may last from 2-10 years.
In advanced Alzheimer’s disease(3) most of the cortex is damaged, so that the brain starts to shrink seriously and cells begin to die. The people lose their ability to speak and communicate and they do not recognise their family or people they know. This stage may generally last from one to five years.

Today more than 18 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, in Germany there are nearly 800,000 people. The number of affected persons increases enormously.
Alzheimer’s is often only related to old people. Five percent of the people older than 65 years and fifteen to twenty percent of the people older than 80 years suffer from Alzheimer’s. But also people in the late thirties and forties can be affected by this heritable disease. The probability to suffer from Alzheimer’s when parents have the typicall old-generation-Alzheimer’s is not very high.

=== Autism ===

Autism is a neurodevelopment condition  which causes neurodevelopmental disorders in several fields. Autistic people for example have restricted perception and problems in information processing.
The often associated intellectual giftedness only holds for a minority of people with autism, whereas the majority possesses a normal amount of intelligence or is below the average. &lt;br&gt;
There are different types of autism, i.a.:&lt;br&gt;
*	Asperger’s syndrome – usually arising at the age of three
*	infantile autism – arising between nine and eleven months after birth
The latter is important because it shows the correlation between memory and language in the children's behaviour very clearly.
Two different types of infantile autism are the low functioning autism (LFA) and the high functioning autism (HFA). The LFA describes children with an IQ lower than 80, the HFA those with an IQ higher than 80. The disorders in both types are similar, but they are more strongly developed in children with LFA.&lt;br&gt;
The disorders are mainly defined by the following aspects:&lt;br&gt;
#	the inability of normal social interaction, e.g. amicable relations to other children&lt;br&gt;
#	the inability of ordinary communication, e.g. disorder of spoken language/idiosyncratic language&lt;br&gt;
#	stereotypical behaviour, e.g. stereotypical and restricted interests with an atypical content&lt;br&gt;

To demonstrate the inability to manage normal communication and language, the University of Pittsburgh and the ESRC performed experiments to provide possible explanations. Sentences, stories or numbers were presented to children with autism and to normal children. The researchers concluded that the disorders in people with HFA and LFA are caused by an impairment in declarative memory.
This impairment leads to difficulties in learning and remembering sentences, stories or personal events, whereas the ability to learn numbers is available. 
It has been shown that these children are not able to link words they heard to their general knowledge, thus the words are only partially learnt, with an idiosyncratic meaning. This explains why LFA and HFA affected children differ in their way of thinking from sane children. It is often difficult for them to understand others and vice versa.
Furthermore scientists believe that the process of language learning depends on an initial vocabulary of fully meaningful words. It is assumed that these children do not possess such a vocabulary, thus their language development is impaired. In a few cases the acquisition of language fails completely, therefore in some cases the children are not able to use language in general. The inability of learning and using language can be a consequence of an impairment of declarative memory. It might also cause a low IQ because the process of learning is language-mediated. In HFA the IQ is not significantly lower than the IQ of sane children. This correlates well with their better understanding of word meanings. They have a milder form of autism.
The experiments have also shown that adults do not have problems with the handling of language. A reason for that might be that they have been taught to use it during development or maybe they acquired this ability through reading and writing.
The causes of autism are not yet explored appropriately to get some idea how to help and support those people having autism in everyday-life. It is still not clear whether the diseases are really caused by genetic disorders. It is also possible that other neurological malfunctions like brain damages or biochemical specialties are responsible for autism. The research just started to get answers to those questions.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Attendance can be an issue when going to college. There comes a time in the career of most college students where they may feel the need to miss class. However, missing class is unadvised as it is an integral part of the learning experience.

== Reasons ==
There are several reasons one should go to class.

One reason is that many courses, especially lecture courses, are designed in such a way that information is not repeated between different class meetings, and missing a certain day means that you miss a day to learn new material. This can be hazardous and hurt one's grade.

== Lack of Sleep ==
If a student hasn't been sleeping well or hasn't slept within the past 24 hours, he or she could use a voice recorder as a secondary &quot;remembering device&quot;. When a person is fatigued, he or she typically can not remember as much as he or she would when awake. However, the voice recorder can retain 100% of what the brain can not. All a student has to do is pull out a voice recorder, set it up on a desk or table, and start recording. Afterwards, the student can nod off and the device records the lecture. Then, the student can listen to it later when he or she is more awake.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Anarchism?==

Anarchism is defined as the abolition of the state, and the end of the state. Anarchist society is a way to organize relations among people. It refers to a relationship among humans based on the ideal liberalism: often formulated as &quot;my freedom ends when your freedom begins&quot;. Anarchism incorporates the doctrine of liberalism and left-idealism into one ideology, where everyone is equal.   

==Anarchist Schools of Thought==

===Anarcho-syndicalism===
Anarcho-syndicalism is based around the concept of the trade union as a catalyst for revolution. Anarchist Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War was split between syndicalism and anarcho-communism. Key principles of syndicalism include worker's solidarity, direct action, and worker's self-management, and famous syndicalist thinkers include Rudolf Rocker and Noam Chomsky.

===Mutualism===
Mutualism was formulated by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in his 1840 treatise, &quot;What is Property?&quot;. Often described as &quot;free market anti-capitalism&quot;, mutualism is based on ideas of a society where workers freely exchange their means of production. Famous mutualist thinkers include Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Kevin Carson.

===Post-left anarchy===
Post-left anarchy is based on the concept that anarchism transcends left-right politics, and is closely associated with post-structuralist, primitivist and insurrectionary ideas. Famous post-left thinkers include Hakim Bey and Wolfi Landstreicher.

===Anarcho-capitalism===
Not considered a part of the anarchist tradition, anarcho-capitalists believe that the State can be overthrown and replaced with a free market capitalist system where all functions of the State including policing, security, social welfare and so on can be provided through free market exchange.

      <comment>/* Wrong arrow direction? */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Quantifiers ===

I am curious as to why quantifiers aren't in this section, as apposed to in the notation
section.

MikeRumex: I agree quantifiers should be explained here.

=== And ===

I don't like the example &quot;I like cheesecake and broccoli&quot; in the explanation for 'and'. The word 'I' makes it personal and therefore ambiguous.

=== Mistake in the implications part ===

The implication arrows in the first line after the implications section has the arrows reversed for the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;only if&quot; directions.  That might confuse people.
:I agree it is confusing - but I don't think it is actually wrong. The word-based explanations are inconsistent though. If you are writing P =&gt; Q as &quot;if P then Q&quot;, then it would be more consistent to write P &lt;= Q as &quot;only if P then Q&quot;. Alternatively you could write P =&gt; Q as &quot;Q if P&quot; and write P &lt;= Q as &quot;Q only if P&quot;. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:52, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

== Wrong arrow direction? ==

Is the arrow direction in the &quot;Necessary&quot; topic correct? Since it states the exact same thing as in the &quot;Sufficient&quot; topic...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The group Cross References  responsibility is to make sure, that the chapter are related to each other and that the mentioning of source is not redundant. It will also help to connect groups which have similar topics and may work together on certain issues.

The group works together with OverallStructure, to ensure that the book in its final state is consistent, but the CRG will concentrate more on sources and team work.

Our tools will be mostly non visible in the book, as our work will happen on discussion pages, email and other not wiki related methods of communication. However, we see our work as most important, as we have to ensure the scientific mentioning of the sources and have an overview over every page written in this project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cookbook question==
Hiya, I saw your question on the staff lounge. You should ask normal cookbook questions on [[Talk:Cookbook]], and you can read about policies at [[Cookbook:Policy]]. I have done a lot of the categorization, and it's been pretty ad-hoc, so if you have improvements, I'd be happy to hear them. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:32, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

== Category links ==

Hi, I just fixed the links to some categories on your user page. If you want to generate a link to a category, you need to put a colon &quot;:&quot; in front of the category name, like so: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Recipes with images]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, otherwise you'll just include the page into the category. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]==

This policy needs a few more people to take a look at it and vote. Any help would be most useful. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== Commons ticker ==

Sorry, I didn't mean to give the appearance of rejecting it - I was just trying to reduce the size of the staff lounge by removing items with no comments in the last few days. I also doubt there were going to be any actual replies on there.

In response to your question, it sounds good, but how would we get it to operate on Wikibooks? What do we actually need to do? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you for your comment on my talk page. One thing that isn't covered is, how easy is it to turn off if we don't like it? Am I right in saying that it works as a bot from a registered account, so we just block the account if there are any problems? (I don't wish to be negative, it's just that it's easier to say &quot;let's give it a try&quot; if we can switch it off quickly if we decide it's not suitable), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

== Cake and Dessert categories ==

Hiya. We list recipes in categories both for the 'type' of recipe (cake) and the meal at which it is eaten (dessert). With cake this might seem redundant, but consider that for other types of recipes (pies, for example) it is not clear at which meal you might eat the result. Since we intend to use multiple categories to filter the recipes, it is important that both meal and type categories are present on each. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

: ''Thanks for the tip, although I'm not sure what prompted it.''
: Ah, I had noticed that you removed some of the categories on some recpies, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Fairy_Cakes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=438353 like here]. I'm aware of the UK English vs. American English as I'm an American living in the UK for the moment. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:49, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
:: The terms &quot;pudding&quot; and &quot;cake&quot; are definitely different in the UK versus in America. I prefer the American terms since they are more precise. Both pudding and cake are generic in the UK. In America, &quot;cake&quot; is specifically the soft leavened type that you've (very well) illustrated in [[:Image:Cake_slice_-_original.JPG]] (except for cheesecake, which is a misnomer). &quot;Pudding&quot; is thickened, sweetened milk, somewhat like english custard but a bit thicker. And on that note, &quot;custard&quot; would be thickened milk and eggs, like flan. As for Dessert being a course; you're right, in the US, though, it's also the all-encompassing term for sweet treats (including candy, cookies/biscuits, cake, pie, etc). We might put some notes on the categories, to help our english readers. Or if you have suggestions for better category names, I'm all ears =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I saw your comments about the [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] policy, and I wanted to alert you that there is a proposed rewrite of this policy undergoing discussion now. The new proposal can be found at [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]]. This proposal takes into account many of your criticisms from the previous version. Your comments and opinions about this new proposal would be much appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[Cookbook:Creaming]] ==

That seems a nice article, but it aroused some questions for me. Are there really only 3 steps that should have pictures in the creaming process? Or did you just not get a chance to do (photos of) more steps? Also do you think you could explain more about the interrelation between creaming and rising? You've just got this throwaway comment in there about how it's necesary for rising. Is that always true? Thanks! Lar 13:55, 2 October 2006 (UTC)


== TiddlyWiki documentation project ==
Hi cure fan(?) and fellow aussie, I found the TiddlyWiki wikibook just now and I wondered if you might be interested in the new TiddlyWiki documentation project. It's in early stages and hasn't been officially announced yet but there is a small group of interested folk on this list: http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDocs. The site (at least for now) is at http://wiki.tiddlywiki.org/. Even if you'd just like to lurk on that list and occasionally point out where we are going wrong that would be great. :) simon.baird@gmail.com

== Re:Revert ==

That same message was posted to a number of other users, and I took it to be spam. I didn't realize at the time that you were actually interested in TiddlyWiki, my appologies. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:52, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

== New category ==

I created a new category for the pages you've photo-ized: Category:Pages with illustrated tutorials.  Cheers, [[User:Unforgettableid|Unforgettableid]] ([[User talk:Unforgettableid|talk]]) 20:47, 22 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

Born Narcissa Black to Cygnus Black and his wife Druella Rosier-Black in 1955, Narcissa was the youngest child of three sisters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] being her older siblings. She was the cousin of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], and later became an aunt to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], although it is unlikely that she acknowledges the connection due to Andromeda's marriage to Muggleborn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. The Blacks are a very old wizarding family with firm prejudices against half-bloods, Muggleborns and Muggles, and Narcissa was no doubt taught these prejudices from an early age. She is a natural stunning beauty, though less so than her elder sister Bellatrix, and, unusually, blonde while most of the Black family appear to be dark-haired.

Narcissa attended [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], where she completed her education along with most of the young wizarding population of Britain and Ireland. She later married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], the heir of a wealthy pure-blood family, and they had one son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]. Narcissa and her sister Bellatrix have a strong bond, the only two to call each other by their nicknames, Cissy and Bella respectively.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] (before we know his name) mentions his mother to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] in Madam Malkin's robe shop on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Narcissa accompanies [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. This is the first time we have seen her.

Harry later asks Malfoy if the perpetual dissatisfied look on her face has to do with him (Draco). This inspires Draco to try to Curse Harry, which in turn results in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguring]] him into a white ferret.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While Narcissa Malfoy does not directly take any part in this book, it is mentioned that she is the only member of the Black family that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] still trusts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] tells Harry that at Christmas, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] had so forcefully ordered Kreacher out, Kreacher had gone to Narcissa, and presumably there had mentioned how much affection there was between Harry and Sirius. It was this bond between Harry and Sirius that Voldemort, with Lucius Malfoy's help, played upon to lure Harry into the Department of Mysteries.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Out of fear for the welfare of her son, Narcissa, accompanied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], her sister, visits [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]. She tries to get him to promise that he will protect her son Draco, who has apparently been tasked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] with a mission that seems to be hopeless. Eventually, Snape is coerced into making an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to help her son in the mission.

We next see her shopping for school supplies with Draco at Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, where she appears after a confrontation between Draco, Harry and Ron, started by Draco commenting about Hermione, has already become heated. Responding to a threat from Narcissa. Harry alludes to Lucius's imprisonment, and she responded by coldly mentioning the recent death of Harry's godfather before haughtily departing with her son to Twilfitt and Tatting's. 

Throughout the school year, Draco made several unsuccessful attempts to kill Dumbledore, which eventually resulted in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and Snape's fulfillment of his vow to Narcissa.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When we first see Narcissa in this volume, she is at a council of Death Eaters. She, with her husband and son, are seated far down the table, distant from Voldemort, as a sign of their decreased status within the organization. It would appear that the Malfoy family is in disgrace, and much to her dismay, Bellatrix is seated near them.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] are brought to Malfoy Manor, their captors call on the Malfoys to identify them before summoning the Dark Lord. Narcissa is unable to identify Harry, despite recognizing Hermione, and orders Draco to look; Draco is also uncertain, though Harry believes that he is only feigning that uncertainty. Narcissa is halted from summoning the Dark Lord by Bellatrix, who has seen the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], and believes that her vault at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] has been compromised; knowing that the vault was the hiding place of something highly valued by Voldemort, Bellatrix is aware that Voldemort will be furious if that vault has been infiltrated. Bellatrix by and large takes charge of proceedings at this point and Narcissa retreats into the background.

When Harry has fallen in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] after confronting Voldemort, Narcissa, presumably because she is closest, is asked by Lord Voldemort to check if Harry Potter is alive. Narcissa sees that he is, and asks if her son is all right, then lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead. Harry guesses that she has done this because only if Harry is believed dead will she be able to get into Hogwarts castle to re-unite with Draco.

Her last appearance is in the Great Hall, after the battle. She is with Lucius and Draco, standing somewhat apart from the celebrations around them.

== Strengths ==

While neither she nor Voldemort thinks of it as such, Narcissa's capacity for love, and her love for Draco are a strength. The fact that her love for her son outweighs her loyalty to Voldemort demonstrates how even within Voldemort's inner circles, love is still the force that causes his ultimate downfall. Narcissa's love for her son, possibly equivalent to Lily's love for Harry, gives her the ability to lie to Voldemort that Harry is dead, despite what Harry feels is a quite visible pulse. Narcissa here exhibits the exact type of love Voldemort never understood.  This type of love caused his downfall 17 years ago, and it is the cause of his downfall in the final book.

== Weaknesses ==

During the scene at Spinner's End in the beginning of ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince]]'', Narcissa practically begs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] to make an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] to protect her son, even though her sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] strongly opposes this action. Narcissa does this even though she is under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s orders to not speak of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s mission. Her love of her son outweighs her obedience to the Dark Lord, which could spell disaster for her in the future.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Narcissa Malfoy is the wife of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and the mother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]. She is close friends with her sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]].

Narcissa is extremely judgmental, obviously holding those whose blood is less than pure, and those who would accept any such, as being greatly beneath her. It is possibly this need to feel superior that placed her in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s camp initially; his emphasis on purity of blood matches hers. One must wonder how she rationalizes the fact that Voldemort is a half-blood.

Starting in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', we see that Narcissa's love of her family outweighs her loyalty to Voldemort and his principles.

== Analysis ==

While Narcissa is a lesser player in the arc followed by the Malfoy family, we can see the transitions she goes through alongside those of her husband and son. When we first see her, she is haughty, proud, sure of her position at the top of the Wizarding world alongside her husband, Lucius. In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', she is far less sure of herself; still believing in her family's innate superiority over the half-blood and Muggle-born, she is aware of her family's having fallen out of Voldemort's good books following Lucius' loss of the diary Horcrux, and later his arrest and imprisonment. At the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', she, along with all her family, are aware that they are in disgrace; Draco had only completed half of his mission, and Narcissa had broken the rules of secrecy in talking to Snape about Draco's mission. At the end of that book, she quite clearly sees that she has lost everything except Draco, and is willing to lie to Voldemort in order to re-unite her family. (While Lucius is still alive, he is quite clearly merely a shell of what he had been, and Narcissa does not seem to be overly concerned with his whereabouts; though this may simply be because when we see her, it is in the clearing in the forest, and Lucius is immediately to hand.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{German/Appendices/Header}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The history of the German language begins with the High German consonant shift during the Migration period, separating South Germanic dialects from common West Germanic. The earliest testimonies of Old High German are from scattered Elder Futhark inscriptions, especially in Alemannic, from the 6th century, the earliest glosses (Abrogans) date to the 8th and the oldest coherent texts (the Hildebrandslied, the Muspilli and the Merseburg Incantations) to the 9th century. Old Saxon at this time belongs to the North Sea Germanic cultural sphere, and Low German should fall under German rather than Anglo-Frisian influence during the Holy Roman Empire.

As Germany was divided into many different states, the only force working for a unification or standardisation of German during a period of several hundred years was the general preference of writers trying to write in a way that could be understood in the largest possible area.

When Martin Luther translated the Bible (the New Testament in 1522 and the Old Testament, published in parts and completed in 1534) he based his translation mainly on this already developed language, which was the most widely understood language at this time. This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German (unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper Germany that already at that time began to lose the genitive case and the preterit tense). In the beginning, copies of the Bible had a long list for each region, which translated words unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Roman Catholics rejected Luther's translation in the beginning and tried to create their own Catholic standard (gemeines Deutsch) — which, however, only differed from 'Protestant German' in some minor details. It took until the middle of the 18th century to create a standard that was widely accepted, thus ending the period of Early New High German.

German used to be the language of commerce and government in the Habsburg Empire, which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-19th century it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. It indicated that the speaker was a merchant, an urbanite, not their nationality. Some cities, such as Prague (German: Prag) and Budapest (Buda, German: Ofen), were gradually Germanized in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain. Others, such as Bratislava (German: Pressburg), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time. A few cities such as Milan (German: Mailand) remained primarily non-German. However, most cities were primarily German during this time, such as Prague, Budapest, Bratislava, Zagreb (German: Agram), and Ljubljana (German: Laibach), though they were surrounded by territory that spoke other languages.

Until about 1800, standard German was almost only a written language. At this time, people in urban northern Germany, who spoke dialects very different from Standard German, learnt it almost like a foreign language and tried to pronounce it as close to the spelling as possible. Prescriptive pronunciation guides used to consider northern German pronunciation to be the standard. However, the actual pronunciation of standard German varies from region to region.

Media and written works are almost all produced in standard German (often called Hochdeutsch in German) which is understood in all areas where German is spoken, except by pre-school children in areas which speak only dialect, for example Switzerland. However, in this age of television, even they now usually learn to understand Standard German before school age.

The first dictionary of the Brothers Grimm, the 16 parts of which were issued between 1852 and 1860, remains the most comprehensive guide to the words of the German language. In 1860, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the Duden Handbook. In 1901, this was declared the standard definition of the German language. Official revisions of some of these rules were not issued until 1998, when the German spelling reform of 1996 was officially promulgated by governmental representatives of all German-speaking countries. Since the reform, German spelling has been in an eight-year transitional period where the reformed spelling is taught in most schools, while traditional and reformed spelling co-exist in the media. See German spelling reform of 1996 for an overview of the heated public debate concerning the reform with some major newspapers and magazines and several known writers refusing to adopt it.

After the spelling reform of 1996 let to so much public controversy and some of its changed rules introduced new ambiguities or were simply perceived as &quot;ugly&quot;, the transitional period (initially scheduled to end on Dec, 31. 2005) was extended until at least end 2006 and some parts of the reform were changed again in March 2006. This new &quot;reform of the reform&quot; tries to remove the ambiguities introduced in 1996. To date (April 2006), it is yet to be accepted by all German speaking countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!

About me:

I am a 15 year old swedish teenager, living in Gothenburg. My real name is Filip.
I love the &quot;wiki concept&quot;, with everyone being able to write articles and I have used wikipedia alot. So I wanted to be an part of it, and do some good myself. I registerd this account and I hope that I can help out with some tasks. I am very interessted in the Wikijunior project and I hope I will be able to contribute to that.

I am not a native english speaker, my first language is Swedish. But I am still quite good at English (I've got very good grades in the subject anyway :-) ) I don't think I'll do to many grammar errors around here. 

I'll be glad to help with translations to Swedish (Or to a certain amount anyway I am not planning sitting up day and night translating stuff...)

'''Have a nice day'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi All!

I'm new to Wiki, and am trying to get a hang of the ropes around here.  I will be a contributing editor of the Wikiversity School of Psychology.  I have a BA in psychology, and am currently a graduate student in a MS program for psyc.  My areas of specialization are evolutionary psychology and human motivation.  While not my favorite fields (but certainly not least favorite), are the areas of cognition, abnormal, social, and biological.  However, I am rather knowledgeable in all aspects, with 98 quarter-based psychology credits so far (and thats just for the undergrad work).

If you have any questions regarding psychological topics, feel free to contact me.  In the email subject line, put Wikiversity as the first word.  I have my Hotmail account on file here, and get so much Spam I just take a quick look at the sender and subject line, then hit delete.

== Mistake / Lendemain ==

&quot;Lendemain&quot; does not mean &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot;. It means tomorrow but in the past or in the future.

Ex : Il y a deux an, Jean alla voir Martine. Le lendemain (and not &quot;demain&quot;), il alla chez moi.

French dictionnary ''Larousse'' said : Jour qui suit celui où l'on est, ou celui dont on parle.

In french, &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot; is &quot;après-demain&quot;

:This is corrected in the article long ago, but the audio clip is off.  (I'm able to record, but I'm not sure my recording is suitable - my recorded voice isn't that good, and I'm not a native french speaker.  I can still upload it if you want...) --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:00, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

== Dimanche ==

The etymological origin of the word &quot;dimanche&quot; is NOT the sun, like in English &quot;Sunday&quot; or German &quot;Sonntag&quot;, but comes from Latin &quot;dies domini&quot; (&quot;day of the Lord&quot;), like in Spanish and Portuguese &quot;Domingo&quot; or Italian &quot;Domenica&quot;. See http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimanche. Took the liberty of changing it.

Anyone know how to delete LOL WUT? I think it's in a template, but I can't find it

Does anyone else find ages completely out of place here?

:Yes, you have a good point there. I think the idea behind these introductory lessons was to teach some basic material while avoiding any formal discussion of grammar as such. It's quite a common feature of this book that phases are used before the underlying grammar is fully explained. I think many books for beginners that aim to avoid a strict formal approach are a bit like this. I have been reviewing the overall book plan recently (see [[French/Project/Book_overview]]) but being just a student myself, I don't have really firm views as to the best way forward for this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Alkanes==

Alkanes are ''saturated hydrocarbons''. This means that they contain '''only carbon and hydrogen atoms''' and they contain '''no carbon-carbon double bonds'''.

The alkane homologous series has the general formula of &lt;math&gt; C_{n} H_{2n+2} &lt;/math&gt; except for the cycloalkanes in which 2 hydrogens are lost so that the carbon can form another C-C bond; they have the general formula of &lt;math&gt; C_{n} H_{2n} &lt;/math&gt;

==Physical Properties==

The alkanes are the most complex of the organic molecules. There are a few things you will need to know about their physical properties in an exam:

===Boiling/Melting Point===

As the relative molecular mass, or number of carbon atoms in an alkane increases, so does its boiling or melting point:


&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| ''Alkane''
| ''Molecular Mass''
| ''Molecular Formula''
| ''Boiling Point (K)''
|- 
| Methane
| 16
| CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
| 109
|-
| Ethane
| 30
| C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
| 185
|-
| Propane
| 44
| C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
| 231
|-
| Butane
| 58
| C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
| 273
|-
| Pentane
| 72
| C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
| 309
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


As you should be aware, alkanes are held together by ''Van der Waal's forces''. The larger a molecule is, the more electrons it has. This means it can form ''larger dipoles'' and its Van der Waal's forces will be larger. It will therefore take ''more energy to break the bonds'' and so the boiling and melting point will be higher.

As you should know, however, some alkanes can be branched instead of straight chained. Boiling point ''decreases as a molecule becomes more branched''. This is because ''branched molecules cannot pack so tightly together'', so their ''Van der Waal's forces must act over larger distances'' (intensity of the Van der Waal's forces decreases) and thus ''require less energy to break''. For example, hexane has five isomers:


&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| ''Isomer''
| ''Structural Formula''
| ''Boiling Point (K)''
|- 
| Hexane
| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
| 342
|-
| 3-Methylpentane
| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
| 337
|-
| 2-Methylpentane
| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
| 333
|-
| 2,3-Dimethylbutane
| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
| 331
|-
| 2,2-Dimethylbutane
| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
| 323
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Reactions==

The alkanes are fairly unreactive, as the C-H bond is non-polar. However they undergo three reactions.

===Reactions of alkanes===

Take the alkane &lt;math&gt;C_2 H_6 &lt;/math&gt;. 

It will under go combustion to form &lt;math&gt;CO_2 + H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

It will under go substitution reactions (Say with &lt;math&gt;Cl_2&lt;/math&gt;) to create &lt;math&gt;C_2 H_5 Cl + HCl&lt;/math&gt;

It will also undergo cracking reactions to create an alkene, in this case, &lt;math&gt; C_2 H_4 + H_2 &lt;/math&gt;

The most important of these being combustion, alkanes are very volatile &amp; burn easily when in the presence of plentiful amounts of oxygen &amp; thus are major fuels.

===Cracking===

As said earlier, long chain molecules have higher boiling points and are more difficult to ignite. These long chain molecules can be broken into shorter chain (more useful) molecules through catalytic cracking. Any alkane from &lt;math&gt; C_4 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; C_{50} &lt;/math&gt; can be cracked. As it is catalytic cracking it requires a catalyst, previously this catalyst was either &lt;math&gt; SiO_2 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; Al_2 O_3 &lt;/math&gt;, but now zeolite is preferred. These reactions also need high temperatures (773K or 450ºC is usually used).

The products from cracking can vary.  For example you can create several moles of one alkene and hydrogen from cracking an alkane if done right.  However you can also create a mixture of alkenes &amp; alkanes or just a mixture of alkenes.

Example:
&lt;math&gt; C_8 H_{18} \rightarrow \; 4 C_2 H_4 + H_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Under conditions of 773k and with an &lt;math&gt; Al_2 O_3 &lt;/math&gt; catalyst present.

===Reforming===

Reforming reactions are reactions where a straight chain alkane is converted into a branched alkane or cycloalkane to increase the octane number in petrol. (Octane numbers represent how much pressure a fuel can be put under before it combusts &amp; causes knocking which damages engines).

Again, reforming uses an platinum or rhodium catalyst &amp; a high temperature, but this time it also uses a higher pressure (40 atm or so). The by-product of reforming is hydrogen molecules.

===Free radical substitution===

Alkanes are very unreactive due to the non-polar C-H bond, so nucleophilic &amp; electrophilic attack reactions are not possible. However, free radical substitutions are possible due to their reactivity. Free radical substitution involves a halogen &amp; some UV light to initiate homolytic fission.

An example with methane.

Initiation reaction:

&lt;math&gt; Cl_2 \rightarrow\; Cl^\bullet + Cl^\bullet &lt;/math&gt;


Propagation:

&lt;math&gt; Cl^\bullet + CH_4 \rightarrow HCl + CH_3^\bullet &lt;/math&gt;

This sets into motion the chain reaction, where one free radical reacts with a stable species to form another stable species &amp; a free radical.

The next propagation steps:

&lt;math&gt; CH_3^\bullet + Cl_2 \rightarrow CH_3Cl + Cl^\bullet &lt;/math&gt;

Or

&lt;math&gt;CH_3^\bullet + CH_3Cl \rightarrow C_2H_6 + Cl^\bullet &lt;/math&gt;

This goes on until 2 radicals meet &amp; combine to form a stable species &amp; thus once all the radicals have done this, the reaction terminates, hence why it is the termination step.

In this reaction we have 3 possible termination steps:

&lt;math&gt;CH_3^\bullet + Cl^\bullet \rightarrow CH_3Cl &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Cl^\bullet + Cl^\bullet \rightarrow Cl_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;CH_3^\bullet + CH_3^\bullet \rightarrow C_2H_6 &lt;/math&gt;

Henceforth, the reaction ends.

Note that a free-radical hydrogen is never produced.

==Problems==

As we know from above, alkanes burn readily in oxygen &amp; give off carbon dioxide, which is a weak greenhouse gas and thus a contributor to global warming.

Alkanes must burn in excess oxygen for complete combustion and the production of carbon dioxide:

CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Incomplete combustion comes from a reduced supply of oxygen and produces water and carbon monoxide:

CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 1½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; CO + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Carbon monoxide is poisonous when inhaled.  It binds irreversibly to haemoglobin in red blood cells and makes carboxyhaemoglobin. The red blood cells can no longer carry oxygen and this can cause suffocation if enough cells are carrying carboxyhaemoglobin.

UK regulations ensure that all gas equipment must be annually serviced and that all gas installations require adequate ventilation.

==History==

The German-English language textbook was started in October 2003. It was one of the first language textbooks at the English version of Wikibooks, following close on the heels of (and borrowing some layout ideas from) the Spanish language textbook then under development by Thomas Strohmann. Eric Guinther designed the cover and contents pages, expanding on a cover layout used for the Spanish textbook, and these ideas as introductions to language books have since been widely copied at Wikibooks (see [[Dutch]], [[Norwegian]], or [[Romanian]] for examples). However since then [[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] and [[User:German Men92|German Men92]] have established a highly templated style. Unfortunately, some of the plans of the latter have never been implemented, leaving the original Level II lessons inaccessible for several years while the Level I lessons contained too much vocabulary and grammar details to be very useful. 

The current tasks are:
* The Level I lessons should be revised, integrating problems and answers in the modules and establishing consistent table layouts. Moreover, several (if not all) of the Level I lessons have to be split into smaller lessons since they are far too large for an introductory course. (Maybe until middle of 2011.)
* In parallel, the original Level II and Level III lessons should be restored. (Maybe until end of August 2010.) 
* Then the Level II and Level III lessons should be revised. (Maybe until end of 2011.)
* Then the grammar and appendices should be revised. (Maybe until end of 2012.)
* Once all this is done, new print versions and PDF versions should be produced. (Sometimes in 2013.)

== Lesson To-Do ==

===General===

===Level I===

* Establish consistent table layout.
* Integrate problems and answers in the lessons.
* Split large lessons into smaller parts.
--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:50, 2 August 2010 (UTC)

===Level II===
As like Level 3, this level will get totally redone, I currently have a plan for it, please tell me if you do not agree.

*'''Vocabulary''': Culture, Animals, Computers, Internet, Mail, The World, Sickness, Science, and Art 
:''Review of Level One'' &lt;small&gt;(same topics, but with more info, detail, and/or depth)&lt;/small&gt;: Food, Leisure, School, Clothes, Directions and Locations, Weather

*'''Grammar''': Introduction to Genitive, More Der-Words, Compound Articles, Relative Pronouns, Declension of Adjectives, Adverbs, Subordinating Conjunction, Translations of &quot;When&quot;, Past Participle, Future Tense, Reflexive Verbs, Negation, Every and Every- 
:''Review of Level One'': Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Modals, Es gibt, Was Für...?, Verbs

Level two will be very heavy in grammar, but that will give the learner very much freedom in speak German casually with a native speaker, since they will already know so much vocabulary, I'm going to design the lessons now. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 23:53, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

'''Lessons'''

They are rough, but somewhat detailed.

Lesson 1: Ernährung ~ Food, Verbs, Nominative Case, Models

Lesson 2: Tiere ~ Animals, Compound Articles, Accusative &amp; Dative

Lesson 3: Kommunikation ~ Computers, Internet, Mail, Translations of &quot;when&quot;, Introduction to the Genitive Case, Es gibt, Was für...?

Lesson 4: Kulture ~ Cultures around the world, Nationality, Languages, Relative Pronouns, every and every-, Strong &amp; Weak Declinion of Adjectives

Lesson 5: Nein ~ Leisure Time, Negation, Genitive Case

Lesson 6: Gesundheit ~ Illness, the Body, Health Warnings, Introduction to Reflexive Verbs, Mixed Declension of Adjectives

Lesson 7: die Welt ~ Countries, Continents, Climates, Living Things, Reciprocal Pronouns, Indefinite Pronouns, Prepositions with the Infinitive and Zu

Lesson 8: eine Reise ~ North, East, etc. , More Places to Go, Vacationing, More der-words

Lesson 9: Kunst ~ Paintings, Theater, Music, Accusative Reflexive Pronouns, Subordinating Conjunction

==Audio==

===Help Playing Audio Files===
[[w:Wikipedia:Media help (Ogg)|Wikipedia page]]

===Contribute!===
====Native Speakers====
Do you want to improve this Wikibook and help people all around the world to learn German? If so, please upload audio to accompany each lesson whenever you see a red &quot;audio&quot; link on a table by clicking on that link and uploading your audio to the file given.

====Maintenance Tasks====
If an &quot;upload&quot; link brought you here for a file that already exists, please edit the table and change the &quot;0&quot; at the top of the table to the size of the audio file in kilobytes. You can find the filesize by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:image:[filename].ogg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the sandbox and clicking on the link.

===Creating Audio Files===
The best and most efficient format to use for recorded speech that is acceptable at Wikibooks is .ogg with the [http://www.speex.org/ Speex] codec. 

First create a .wav file using the software that came with your microphone. Next you must convert the file to .ogg. To do this, first download the binary file [http://www.republika.pl/roed/speexw/ here]. Install it, open command prompt (start=&gt;run=&gt;cmd.exe), and type:
  x:\...\speexenc.exe x:\...\file.wav x:\...\file.ogg
where &quot;x:\...\&quot; is the directory of speexenc.exe, the location of the .wav file to be converted, and the soon-to-be location of the .ogg file. Replace &quot;file&quot; with the name of the .wav file. 

===Uploading the File to Wikibooks===
# Click on the red audio link at the top of the table that you created audio for.
# Click browse and find the .ogg file, choose a license for your file, and click &quot;upload file.&quot;
# Click &quot;edit this page&quot; at the top and add &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Category:German Audio]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; to the edit box.
# Click &quot;Save page&quot; then reload the page of the table you created audio for and make sure the &quot;audio&quot; link turns blue.
# Edit the table and change the &quot;0&quot; at the top to the file size amount in kilobytes of the file (listed on the file's description page).

===Custom File Names or Multiple Files Per Table===
To use a custom file name for a table, edit the table and add |[file location] between the column number (often 4) and }}.

Example: 

&lt;nowiki&gt; {| {{German table|Dialogue|What's your name?|Wie heißt du?|131|2|Dialogue franz greta 1.ogg}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; 

produces:
{| {{German table|Dialogue|What's your name?|Wie heißt du?|131|2|Dialogue franz greta 1.ogg}}
|}

== Pronounce ==

'''Q''':How do you say German ß

'''A''': The symbol is equivalent to &quot;ss&quot;.  See [[w:ß|Eszett]].

'''A''' &lt;small&gt;(revised)&lt;/small&gt;: To make it more clear on the pronouncion part, it is  pronounced like the ending of &quot;ni'''ce'''.&quot;

== Pronouncing 'ch' ==

How do you know when to pronounce 'ch' as '''shh''' or as '''hhhhhc'''?
-- 17:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

A lot of the time, when you have '''sch''', it makes a '''shh''' sound. Otherwise, it is mostly '''hhhhhc'''. There are exceptions though.
-- 16:28 EST, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

'''A''' &lt;small&gt;(revised)&lt;/small&gt;: The '''hhhhhc''' is after a, o, u, au. The '''shh''' is after e, i, ä, ö, ü, äu, ei and i.e. However the real &quot;sh&quot; sound is made by ''sch''. -- [[User:German Men92|Je suis]] 05:19, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

:I (as a native speaker) never pronounce &quot;ch&quot; like '''shh''' and I always pronounce &quot;sch&quot; like '''sh'''. In some local accents &quot;ch&quot; is pronounced like &quot;sch&quot; but those are local accents. There are differences in the pronunciation of &quot;ch&quot; depending on the vowel before it but my advice would be not to worry about it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:28, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

== How do you write &lt;ß&gt;? ==

Could someone point me in the direction of an article explaining how to handwrite &lt;ß&gt;? I don't know how to make &lt;ß&gt; look different from &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Thanks!

'''A''' &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;: On Windows/PC use Alt+225 using numeric keyboard. -- [[User:German AwenStormFool|AwenStormFool]] 11:19, 06 October 2006 (UTC)

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F This might help] - [[User:Rappo|Rappo]] 16:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

'''A''' when writing &quot;B&quot; I beginn with a vertical stroke at the top and stop at exactly at the line. Then the right part is added, beginning again at the top. The result is a bit edged.  &quot;ß&quot; starts at the bottom (some mms below the line, that's probably most important), and is then drawn without any stop, what makes it look curvy at the top. You can see this very cleary in these pictures:

hope that helps...

'''A''' There is a second way to write this. Here you have a picture of this one:

[[File:handwrote_german_ss.png]]

== Do you have any good links to help with improving reading/listening skills? ==
:In http://ilovelanguages.com/index.php?category=Languages%7CBy+Language%7CGerman you have directory of resources for the German language. If you don't find them useful, try asking in a language forum like unilang.org or performing a google search with terms you expect to appear in the results (eg, add &quot;grammar&quot; or &quot;excercises&quot; or whatever)--[[User:Pfc432|Pfc432]] 04:06, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

== could you give some indication of time phrases? ==

'''Q''': I know there is a note about where time is placed in a sentence, but what case are time phrases usually given in? And what about 'seit' ?
:'''A''': In a sentence, time can be placed wherever you want. However, it's customary to use the order Temporal, Kausal, Modal, Lokal, when you have more than one complement in a predicate. In that case, the first complement should be the on indicating time (eg. Ich bin '''gestern''' nach München gefahren. instead of 'nach München gefahren gestern').

:Time phrases are usually given in Akusativ. Eg, '''Jeden Tag''' gehe ich arbeiten.

:The preposition Seit always requires Dativ. So, we say: Seit '''einem Jahr''' besuche ich die Wikipedia.
&lt;!-- Corrected: There is no comma after Seit einem Jahr. Jayk (Comma is only used to divide a sub clause and a main clause.) --&gt;

:Hope this helps. --[[User:Pfc432|Pfc432]] 04:03, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

==Translations==
'''Q''': Is there anyone who can maybe tell me a few tiny German phrases?
As in writing, how do you say &quot;Shh!&quot; or &quot;Hahaha!&quot; ???
I know they differ in languages.
Danke!
&lt;3 -t

:'''A''': In German you also use &quot;Hahaha&quot; to signify laughter. Alternatively, it could also be &quot;hehehe&quot;, or a more giggly &quot;hihihi&quot;, or a Santa Claus-y &quot;hohoho&quot;, depending on the specific sound of the laughter you want to emulate. &quot;Shh!&quot; (as in telling someone to be silent) can be &quot;Sch!&quot; (sounds the same) or &quot;Psst!&quot;. &quot;Shh&quot; to soothe someone is also &quot;Sch&quot; in German.

== Standard pronunciation ==

'''Q''': In what city (area) of Germany do they speak the most &quot;prestigious&quot; form of German in terms of pronunciation? I'm thinking about moving to German for a short while to master the language but I don't want to get stuck with some local accent? I mean something similar to English RP. --[[Special:Contributions/81.15.33.134|81.15.33.134]] ([[User talk:81.15.33.134|talk]]) 04:35, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
:'''A''': I think the city of Hannover might be a good place to avoid strong local accents. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:03, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

==Article of ''Dienstagnacht''==
'''Q''': What is article of &quot;Dienstagnacht&quot;? --[[Special:Contributions/41.232.176.138|41.232.176.138]] ([[User talk:41.232.176.138|talk]]) 13:17, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

:'''A''': Your answer can be found here: [[German/Level_I/Essen#Connection_with_Time|Connection with Time]]. ''Nacht'' is feminine, so it is ''die Dienstagnacht'' in the [[German/Level_I/Wie_heißt_du?#Nominative_Case|nominative case]].-- [[User:Neet|Neet]] ([[User talk:Neet|talk]]) 13:09, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

'''Q''': Give a brief explanation about akkusativ and dativ. (unsigned comment by [[Special:Contributions/122.183.232.130|122.183.232.130]]) 14:30, 03 March 2010 (UTC)

== Practice writting skills ==

'''Q''': Hello, do you know where can I practice my written German. I can speak pretty well by now, but when I write I make tons of grammatical mistakes. I believe that it is a matter of practice. What would you recommend I do?

Thanks for your time and the great reference source.

Nina.

== Why Not Accusative? ==

In sentences like this:
Dann steht Mutti '''im''' Zimmer.
I see that Zimmer stands in dative (in dem Zimmer), and I am really confused. Shouldn't it stand in accusative, because it is the direct object of the sentence?

:Accusative and dative don't always correspond to direct and indirect objects. For example, &quot;lehren&quot; (to teach) takes two accusative objects: jemanden etwas lehren (to teach someone something). In principle, you have to learn for every verb whether it is used with accusative or dative object(s). In the case of locations, the general rule is that dative is used for positions (in the room: in dem Zimmer) and accusative is used for directions (into the room: in das Zimmer). Hope that helps. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 20:50, 20 November 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ozonolysis is the process in which you treat an alkene or alkyne with ozone (O3). Ozone will attack a C=C (or a triple bond between carbons) and cleave it, leaving 2 areas that are slightly electropositive, oxygens will quickly bond to these carbons, and the end structure now has 2 Oxygens doubly bonded to 2 carbons.

== General Overview ==

'''''Little Hangleton''''' is a small village which is the ancestral home of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Little Hangleton is a village where the Riddle family used to live, and where both [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Riddle Manor|Riddle Manor]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|the House of Gaunt]] are located. Riddle Manor is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] as a base for their activities at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Harry's fourth year]].

At the end of that year, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] are transported to the cemetery in Little Hangleton by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]]. The climax of the story occurs there, in the cemetery, as Voldemort returns, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] are called to report to Voldemort, and Voldemort duels with Harry.

=== Location ===

[[Image:HP possible locations of Little Hangleton.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Possible locations of Little Hangleton]]

Its location is uncertain, however we [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|are given one hint]] during the summer vacation before the fourth year: ''Two hundred miles away, the boy called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] woke with a start.''

== Analysis ==

Little Hangleton is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle's]] &quot;ancestral home;&quot; while he was born in London, his mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]] and father, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|muggle]] Tom Riddle, both lived in this area, and his father is buried here. This is part of the reason that Voldemort, as Tom Riddle was later known, set up his base of operations here; one of the necessary ingredients for the potion that restored Voldemort was &quot;''Bone of the father, unknowingly given''&quot;, for which access to the graveyard in Little Hangleton was necessary. Magic being what it is, it is in fact possible that the spell would only work if it was in the immediate environs of Tom Riddle Sr.'s grave, meaning that Voldemort, his servant, his foe, and his father's grave would all have to be brought together in the same place.

Tom Marvolo Riddle feels no attachment for the place, however. Despite being the closest thing to an heir left by his father, Tom Riddle, and thus presumably the actual owner of the manor house, Riddle Jr. had previously only visited the house for long enough to murder his father and grandparents. For Voldemort, the house is a convenient place for headquarters, where he is unlikely to be disturbed (once he has murdered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|the Muggle gardener]]), with no claims on its ownership apart from his own.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

While it is convenient in that he is unlikely to be disturbed there, the house at Little Hangleton is a bit too far away from the center of action for Voldemort once he starts taking an active role in events. Additionally, it is somewhat lacking in comforts, having been largely abandoned for some forty years since Tom Riddle was murdered. It is almost certainly for these reasons that Voldemort moves his headquarters to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch's]] London house while controlling Mr. Crouch, and why he relocates to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==input() vs. raw_input()==
The example code on this page was broken for floats. I see that the use of int(raw_input()) drives the user away from input(), which can be dangerous. In my view it is needless complication. The focus of this manual should be on basic concepts. Allowing the use of input() keeps the user from having to worry too much about data types and lets them move on to other things. The text currently says, &quot;raw_input() returns a string while input() returns a number.&quot; I think it makes good sense to keep things at this level and to drop int(raw_input()) from the example code. Thoughts? [[User:Zastard|Zastard]] ([[User talk:Zastard|talk]]) 17:41, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
:Well, I guess this becomes a mute point when we switch the tutorial over to python 3000, in which input always returns a string.  Since that will be happening later this year (or maybe the tutorial will be forked) I think we will have to just explain int(raw_input()).

== = vs &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;==

The use of == won't be understood by non-programmers.  It hasn't been introduced yet I don't think, so using it casually won't work. [[User:Dooglus|Dooglus]] 19:46, 30 April 2006 (UTC) dooglus

: I agree and think we should change/remove the following section (including the example):
:: If you want to use an actual value, you must use quotation marks. &lt;tt&gt;value1 == Pim; value2 == &quot;Pim&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

:: Both look the same, but in the first one Python checks if the value stored in the variable value1 is the same as the value stored in the variable Pim. In the second one, Python checks if the string (the actual letters P,i, and m) are the same as in value2 (continue this tutorial for more explanation about strings and about the ==).

: Especially the &quot;actual value&quot; is kind of confusing. [[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] ([[User talk:Siebengang|talk]]) 07:57, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

: I agree. It is confusing. I see what it's trying to accomplish though. The question it's trying to answer is &quot;What's the difference between the variable pim and the string &quot;pim&quot;&quot;. This is a fairly abstract idea, and in as much as we should be trying to avoid those, for now, I think it's save to remove this. If the user is very curious they will be better served learning this by experimentation anyway. [[User:Zastard|Zastard]] ([[User talk:Zastard|talk]]) 18:09, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

==Example Rates_times.py Error==
When running this program I received an error because I input a decimal number but the input is actually an integer. I am new to python. Contact User:Camilo Sanchez at wikipedia.

:&lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; tries to convert anything into an integer. &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt; returns keyboard input as a string. If the argument of &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; is a string, the conversion will only work with strings containing an integer (as &lt;code&gt;&quot;1234&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), not any other number (e.g. &lt;code&gt;&quot;1234.56&quot;&lt;/code&gt;).

:Replace the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function with &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt;, and it will work with floats, too. Example:

:&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;rate = float(raw_input(&quot;Rate: &quot;))&lt;/source&gt;

:[[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] ([[User talk:Siebengang|talk]]) 08:59, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

== program  ==

i get an error with this:

&lt;pre&gt;
num = input(&quot;Type in a Number: &quot;)
str = raw_input(&quot;Type in a String: &quot;)

print &quot;num is a &quot;,type(num)
print &quot;num * 2 =&quot;,num*2
print &quot;str =&quot;, str
print &quot;str is a &quot;,type(str)
print &quot;str * 2 =&quot;,str*2

Type in a number: 12.34
Type in a string: hello
num = 12.34
num is a  &lt;type 'float'&gt;

NameError: name 'srt' is not defined

i'm using python 2.4.4
          tk 8.4
          idle 1.1.4


It's a typo, it should be str instead of srt. [[User:89.172.27.156|89.172.27.156]] 13:41, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

This doesn't work for Python 3.0. How about a revision for the new version?

== Data types ==

I think this is a good place to add a section outlining the different kinds of data types and what they are for. In the Assignment section of the article, it talks about integers and string values but the article doesn't address these or other data types formerly.

==Molecular Docking==
&lt;!--Poulami--&gt;

Molecular docking is the technique that is used to study  molecular binding and   how   molecules  bind. The term “docking” is mostly related to protein molecule interactions. There are several types of molecular docking for protein interactions:
*If a protein interacts with a ligand : protein-ligand interaction 
*If a protein interacts with another protein: protein-protein interaction 
*If a protein binds to DNA: protein-DNA interactions 
Of all these Protein ligand interaction techniques are the most widely used techniques.

'''Advantages:'''
One of the major advantages conferred by docking is that it allows researchers to quickly screen large databases of potential drugs which would otherwise require tedious and prolonged work in the lab using traditional drug discovery procedures.

==The Principle Behind Docking==
&lt;!--Poulami--&gt;

The foremost thing that we need to start with a docking search is the sequence of our protein of interest. We then search for ligand sequences from suitable databases. These two components are the input for the docking method.  There are two basic components of molecular docking:
*The [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Proteomics/Protein_-_Protein_Interactions/Types_of_Interactions#The_Search_Algorithm search algorithm]
*The [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Proteomics/Protein_-_Protein_Interactions/Types_of_Interactions#The_Scoring_Function scoring function]

===The Search Algorithm===
&lt;!--Poulami--&gt;

A search algorithm finds the best docking pose measured by the scoring function. Since it is impossible to do an exhaustive search most of the docking tools resort to the most flexible ligands available. There are several ways for sampling the search space.

Some examples are{{ref|1}}: 
*Use a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation to propose energetically reasonable poses
*Use a &quot;linear combination&quot; of multiple structures determined for the same protein to emulate receptor flexibility
*Use a genetic algorithm to &quot;evolve&quot; new poses that are successively more and more likely to represent favorable binding interactions.

===The Scoring Function===
[[Image:scoringfunction.jpg|frame|Illustration of the scoring function]]

A scoring function discriminates correct (experimentally verified) docking poses from incorrect ones. It estimates the binding affinity between ligand and receptor. To check whether the resultant pose is stable or not, we use several physics theories, such as Gibb's free energy. A low Gibb’s free energy confirms a stable conformation rather than a high energy which denotes an unstable complex. Another approach of the scoring function is to establish a conformational relationship (based on statistical analysis) from large protein databases and then evaluate the stability and fitness of the pose. One of the main problems with utilizing a database technique for the docking function is the increased rate of false positives.

==Types of interactions==
&lt;!-- Lorelle --&gt;



===Protein-Protein Docking Interactions=== 
[[image:Protein_Protein_Docking.JPG |frame|protein docking with another protein]]
Protein-protein interactions occur between two proteins that are similar in size.  The interface between the two molecules tend to be flatter and smoother than those in protein-ligand interactions. 
Protein-protein interactions are usually more rigid; the interfaces of these interactions do not have the ability to alter their conformation in order to improve binding and ease movement.  Conformational changes are limited by steric constraints and thus are said to be rigid. 


===Protein Receptor-Ligand Docking===
&lt;!--Poulami--&gt;
Also known as the molecular docking technique, protein receptor -ligand docking is used to check the structure, position and orientation of a protein when it interacts with small molecules like ligands.
Protein receptor-ligand motifs fit together tightly, and are often referred to as a lock and key mechanism.  There is both high specificity and induced fit within these interfaces with specificity increasing with rigidity.   
Protein receptor-ligand can either have a rigid ligand and a flexible receptor, or a flexible ligand with a rigid receptor. 
                          


====Rigid Ligand with a Flexible Receptor==== 

The native structure of the rigid ligand flexible receptor often maximizes the interface area between the molecules.  They move within respect to one another in a perpendicular direction in respect to the interface.  This allows for binding of a receptor with a larger than usual ligand.  Normally when there is ligand overlap in the docking interface, energy penalties incur. If the van der Waals  forces can be decreased,  energy loss in the system will be minimized. This can be accomplished by allowing flexibility in the receptor.  Flexible receptors allow for docking of a larger ligand than would be allowed for with a rigid receptor.  


====Flexible Ligand with a Rigid Receptor====

When the fit between the ligand and receptor does not need to be induced, the receptor can retain its rigidity while maintaining the free energy of the system.  For successful docking, the parameters of the ligand need to be constant and the ligand must be slightly smaller in size than that of the receptor interface. No docking is completely rigid though; there is intrinsic movement which allows for small conformational adaptation for ligand binding.  When the six degrees of freedom for protein movement are taken into consideration (three rotational, three translational), the amount of inherent flexibility allowed by the receptor is even greater.  This further offsets any energy penalty between the receptor and ligand,  allowing for easier, more energetically favorable binding between the two.

==Docking Problems==

The search space consists of all possible [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformation conformations] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_configuration configurations]. With present computing resources, it would be impossible to exhaustively explore the search space for all possible poses (a pose is the name given to the configuration of the conformation of a molecule in a coordinate system). Needless to say, every docking simulation is a trade-off between accuracy and speed and a good docking tool is expected to maintain a reasonably good balance between the two.

==Domain-domain interfaces==
Domain-domain interfaces exist between separate domains contained in the same chain.
A domain is defined as a region of a protein containing a globular structure with a distinct self-stabilizing motif that has the ability to fold independently of the protein.  Domain sequences are not unique to individual proteins; thus the structural and sequential alignment of a binding domain is often used to determine the biological function and significance of the protein.  
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_data_bank Protein Data Bank] can be used in tangent with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_Classification_of_Proteins SCOP] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cn3d NIH’s Cn3D] to visualize the domain binding in proteins.{{ref|1}}{{ref|2}}{{ref|3}}

==Intra-domain interfaces==

Intra-domain interfaces have a single structural domain and the surface interfacing occurs most often through disulfide bonding between the N-terminus of the protein to DNA binding C-domain.

==Hetero-oligomers==
[[Image:Heterooligomers.jpg| thumb |Hetero Oligomers]]
Hetero-oligomers create an interface between permanently interacting protein chains of in different chain sequences in oligomeric enzymes.  
When hetero-oligomer binding occurs, the ligand on one subunit interacts both positively and cooperatively with the same type of ligand bound on adjacent subunits.

==Hetero-complexes==
Hetero-complexes contain interfaces between different transiently interacting protein chains.  Examples of hetero-complexes include signal transduction proteins, protease complexes, enzymes, antibody-antigen, and G- coupled proteins. 

A common theme contained in domain-domain, intra-domain, and hetero interfaces are   the presence of hydrophobic, hydrophilic interactions, and cysteine and salt bridges, which are not found in the homo structures discussed below.  

==Homo-oligomer surfaces==
Homo-oligomer surfaces are permanent interfaces between intermingling  identical chains.
Oligomeric enzymes bind in this way;  the binding of a ligand on one subunit interacts in such a way that the same ligand interacts positively and cooperatively on the same type of ligand bound on adjacent subunits. 
 
==Homo-complexes==
Homo-complexes exist between transitorily interacting interfaces that contain indistinguishable protein chains.  Homo-dimer interfaces mimic the appearance of the protein interior. They incorporate non-covalent interactions and These interactions at the quaternary structural level that allow for the numerous regulatory roles including ligand binding or modification. Enzymes, transport proteins and transcriptional factors all contain homo-dimeric interactions.  
These types of interactions are unique in that the presence of hydrophobic or hydrophilic interfaces are rare, nor are salt bridges, which will be discussed later in the chapter.  Homo-complexes prefer to form bonds between amino acids which are identical.

==Characterization of Binding Sites==
&lt;!-- Lorelle --&gt;
Protein stability and flexibility are dependent on electrostatic interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.  The energy of the interaction is not evenly distributed between the two proteins at the interface.  Rigidity in the interface ensures that the entropy loss is offset and the binding free energy is contributed to in a favorable way by the amino acid residues contained in the interface.  Contributions of hot spots to the stability of the protein-protein complex within a hot region is cooperative, however the contributions of independent hot regions are additive.

===Hydrogen Bonding and Hydrophobic Packing===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Betas.png |thumb| Depiction of hydrogen bonds in anti-parallel beta sheets.]] --&gt;
Hydration is very important for the three dimensional structure and activity of proteins. Surface water molecules are held most strongly by the positively charged basic amino acids.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bonding Hydrogen bonding] adds conformational flexibility, while the level of hydration determines the degree of flexibility in the internal molecular motions. Water molecules in close proximity to peptide hydrogen bonds cause separation in the bonds and a release of tension in the structure.  The presence of water molecules also prevents swift conformational fluctuations from occurring. Water interacts with protein surfaces; the breaking of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the amino acids has an unfavorable enthalpic result on the system,  effecting the overall energy of the protein.  Water molecules act as an adhesive, sealing holes in complementary surfaces that would normally lack shape. 
Hydrogen bonding drastically reinforces other bonding present in the interface between proteins.  This type of bonding occurs when  an hydrogen atom proximal to a docking facade interacts across the interface with atoms of another molecule.  Hydrogen bonding  can occur between side chains, backbone groups, and between the two.{{ref|1}}  

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic Hydrophobic] surfaces located at ligand receptor interfaces have greater ambiguity with bonding.  Hydrogen bonding  between the peptide atoms decreases the hydrophobicity of the backbone. Coincidentally, hydrophobic surfaces can  be sealed with an ordered shell of water molecules, creating an entropically favorable state when water molecules are ejected.  Water removal increases the thermodynamic benefit in hydrophobic patches.  These patches are uncommon though;  the patches found in proteins are more often hydrophilic.  The secondary structure of the protein  is a result of hydrogen bonding since the residues arrange themselves in such a way so that hydrophobicity of the backbone is reduced.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix α-helices] and  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet β-sheet] conformations are the way in which is accomplished.{{ref|1}} 

====Amino acids in order of hydrophobicity====

Least hydrophobic to most hydrophobic:

*Lysine 
*Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid 
*Arginine,  Glutamine, Serine, Aspargine 
*Proline, Glycine, Threonine 
*Histidine, Alanine 
*Tyrosine 
*Cystine, Valine, Tryptophan, Methionine 
*Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine

===Dehydron Bonding===

The hydrogen bonds in the backbone of a protein usually exist in the form of dehydron bonds, which form between two hydrogen atoms bonded that differ in polarity bonds.   The proton acceptor in this case is a metal hydride with the donor being OH or NH.    Dehydrons attract hydrophobes, their bonding increases the electrostaticity of hydrogen bonds by increases the surrounding dielectric coeffiecient.   The dehydron bonds thus create a  hydrophobic shell around the backbone increasing the electorstatic interaction; this desolvated environment is condusive for salt bridge formation increasing structural stability.{{ref|2}}  

===Salt Bridges===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_bridge_%28protein%29 Salt bridges], also referred to as ionic bonds,  are a form of chemical bonding that occur between amino acids of opposite charge.  They contribute greatly to the stability of the protein and are usually found in the interior of the protein structure. This stability is dependant on the location of the side chains, and the electrostatic contribution.  Hydrophobic environment is conducive to salt bridges. 
Charged residues within four angstroms to each other have the ability to form salt bridges.{{ref|1}}

===Van der Waals Interactions===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force Van der Waal forces] occur between dipoles.  
Covalently bonded atoms differ in electronegativity that causes a minute dipole. Since the distribution of electrons is asymmetrical, a dipole effect is created by the van der Waals attraction.  These dipoles oscillate, creating a dipole field.  This field allows two atoms with identical oscillation frequencies to synchronize, one negative while the other positive.  Thus the charge between the two cancel each other out and the net charge is zero.  van der Waals  bonds are one of the weakest intermolecule forces studied.  But van der Waal bonds are important, since it is with these forces that noble gases can achieve bond saturation with the dominant form of interaction between electrically neutral species.  Induced dipole interactions cause van der Waal bonding to occur, and the large close surface contact allows van der Waal binding to contribute significantly.{{ref|3}}       
The following formula is used to determine van der Waal bonding: 
 A/(r6) - B/(r12) where r is the distance between A and B.

===Pockets===
A protein pocket is a concave surface region containing the active sites of the protein. These areas are solvent accessible, and are characterized as either unfilled or complemented, the partner conformation not being taken under consideration. Compositional difference between complemented pockets and other surface pockets may be useful for predicting complemented pockets from the unbound states.  The floor of complemented pockets are often filled with residues that are ionizable  and/or polar.   In a hydrophobic environment, these residues provide molecules for salt bridge formation and hydrogen bonding which are essential for binding stability.  Pockets are crucial for binding site flexibility for large interfaces reduce binding stability, and allow for ligand movement. 

===Cation-π Interactions===
Cation-π pairs are frequently present in the interface of proteins, probably due to their low energy conformation.  They play an important role in specificity, causing a need for conformational changes to provide the correct orientation for binding.   Cation-π interactions are found most frequently in homodimers. The abundance of this form of bonding is tied to the occurrence of specific amino acids.  In homodimers, arginine bound to phenylalanine forms the most frequent cation-π bonds, while in the other protein complexes arginine-tyrosine and arginine-tryptophan  cation-π bonding is a more likely occurrence.

===Hot Spots===
A hot spot is an area of high energy and binding around an amino acid residue.  Surrounded by hydrophobic pockets, hot spots are found in clusters, rather than scattered throughout the interface. This clustering assists with the elimination of water molecules, and increases the bond strength and available bond energy through increases charge-charge relations.  Hot spots usually do not include hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, although there is a slight preference of  non-polar residues.
Packing around hot spots is significantly tighter that the other residues found in the  interface.  Since hot spots contribute significantly to binding, the association of neighboring residue size, charge, and interaction must be taken under consideration when considering binding affinity and docking.    
It has been established that a  linear relationship between the number of hot spots and the interface size exists; the larger the interface the higher the number of hot spots present.
&lt;!--Sarah--&gt;

===Protein Chips===
Much like DNA microarrays, and gene chips, protein chips have revolutionized the method and speed with which scientists can discover differences in gene expression levels, protein chips are a relatively new addition to proteomics that brings high-throughput efficiency to discovering protein-protein interactions.  Earlier protein chips emulated existing proteomic techniques by requiring labeling of proteins, a requirement that resulted in only revealing certain proteins or classes of proteins.  Recent developments have put forth label-free techniques that couple the original protein chip idea with [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry/Types Mass Spectrometry#MALDI-TOF| MALDI-TOF]] [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry| mass spectrometry]], and other forms of mass spectrometry, to produce a protein chip technology that does not require proteins to be labeled, consequently widening the range of protein-protein interactions detected with each chip.{{ref|3}}{{ref|4}}  While [[Proteomics/Protein_Chips| protein chip]] technology does not directly contribute to binding site characterization, it is a useful method for gaining insight into how proteins and classes of proteins function through their interactions with many other proteins.  See chapter on [[Proteomics/Protein_Chips| protein chips]] more more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Le Parkour''' (also called '''Parkour''', and abbreviated '''PK''') is a physical discipline of French origin in which participants attempt to pass obstacles in the most efficient way possible as if moving in an emergency situation, using skills such as jumping and climbing, or the more specific parkour moves. The obstacles can be anything in one's environment, but parkour is often seen practiced in urban areas because of many suitable public structures that are accessible to most people, such as buildings and rails. Parkour also has a deep mental and spiritual side; based around the overcoming of fears and mental obstacles in an altruistic way which may one day prove beneficial to the community.

[[File:Parkour fl2006.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Welcome to the '''Parkour''' Wikibook]]

Another discipline which is related on the surface is Freerunning, which is a break-away discipline formed by Sebastien Foucan, where the freerunner moves through their environment in anyway they wish, which often includes acrobatic manouveres such as flips and kicks. These movements are generally accepted as not parkour because they are not the most efficient way of moving through an environment.

==Allosteric Effects and Binding Affinities==

&lt;!-- Lorelle --&gt;

Allosteric binding occurs at an interface that is not within the active site of the protein, while allosteric regulation occurs through binding of an activator molecule in the interface of the allosteric site.  Allosteric binding is cooperative, that is the affinity for the ligand of the molecule rises as the levels of ligand increase. Binding is said to be noncooperative if the concentrations of ligand have no effect on binding.{{ref|1}}  

There are two models for allosteric binding: 
*Concerted modeling 
*Sequential modeling. 

==Concerted Modeling:==

In concerted modeling, the conformational changes of one protein subunit extend to all of the other subunits, such that all the subunits share the identical conformation. Without a ligand bound, the equilibrium of the conformation favors either a tensed or relaxed state, T or R. The conformation is shifted between these states depending on the binding of the ligand to an allosteric site.{{ref|2}}

==Sequential Modeling:==
In sequential modeling the conformational changes of one protein subunit may induce similar changes in the others, but none of the subunits share identical conformations.    
Induced fit is an element of the sequential model.  Collision with the interface elicits ligand  conformational changes in such a way that there is relaxation in the subunit allowing the receptor to form fit around the ligand. But these conformational changes do not propagate to the surrounding subunits.{{ref|3}}


Allosteric Inhibition occurs when the binding of a ligand in the manner decribed above decreases the binding affinity of substrates in the active site.

===Binding Affinity===
		
Receptor-Ligand binding can be characterized by the affinity, or attraction,  the two have for each other.  Binding sites with high affinity, have strong intermolecular forces between receptor-ligand and remain bound for longer periods of time than those of low affinity.  High affinity sites have high molecule energies, and can transmit some of their energy to provide for conformational changes in the receptor.   
The concentration at which half amount of ligand is bound to the receptor is used to quantify binding affinities.  High affinity sites have more ligand bound, whereas low affinity sites have less than half bound. 
Binding affinities are used  to determine the number and location of binding sites present in a protein, and this information is gathered through computation of data determined through isothermal titration calorimetry  and enzyme inhibition.{{ref|4}}

==Determining Binding Experimentally - In Vivo==
&lt;!-- Lorelle --&gt;
====FRET====

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer uses fluorescent energy transfer to visualize protein interactions.  The procedure is simple.  Fluorophores are fused to the proteins of interest and then bombarded with light at the excitation wavelength.  The first fluorophore transfers some of the energy it absorbed from the light source to the second fluorohore, which in turn emits some of its energy into the environment where, with the use of a fluorescent microscope, it is visible.    

[[image:Fret2.JPG |frame|FRET Example]]

====BRET====

Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer is a biodetection system that utilizes energy transfer between a donor and receptor to visualize binding.  When the two molecules are in close proximity, a green fluorescent protein on the receptor absorbs the energy from luciferase attached to the donor.  As a result, the GFP emits light that appears green to the naked eye.  

====Yeast Two-Hybrid====

The yeast two-hybrid system is an ''in vivo'' system that utilizes the binding domain (BD) and activation domain (AD) of genes (used in transcription) to determine protein interactions.  Proteins are fused to both the BD and the AD of a reporter gene, one to each.  When the protein attached to BD interacts with the protein fused to the AD, transcription is initiated, and the reporter gene is transcribed.   The effect is quantifiable by measuring the levels of reporter gene expressed.
&lt;br&gt;
==Determining Binding Experimentally - In Vitro==
&lt;!-- Amanda --&gt;

====Identifying interactions====

=====Protein arrays=====

Thanks to the success of DNA microarray technology, other areas of science are developing arrays or “chips” to test for multiple things at once.  One of these areas is protein interaction studies, where array technology is currently expensive and complicated, but looks like it will soon be a realistic option.  Protein interaction arrays have the advantage of allowing a scientist to test for numerous interactions quickly and conveniently.  Read more about arrays in Chapter 8: [[Proteomics/Protein Chips|Protein Chips]].

=====Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_affinity_purification]=====

To perform TAP, a “TAP tag” must be attached to the protein of interest.  This is done by genetic recombination of the protein with the tag, usually using plasmids.  The expressed fusion protein then contains the protein of interest covalently bound to the tag.  The tag consists of two IgG binding domains from Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and a calmodulin binding protein (CBP), with a TEV protease cleavage site between those two sections.  The CBP is closest to the protein, and the IgG binding domains are farthest away.  When the protein is extracted from the cells, any interacting proteins will come with it, giving you complexes of protein attached to the tag rather than just your one protein.  The sample is applied to a column of IgG beads, so that the complexes of interest bind to them due to protein A, and any other proteins pass through.  The bound proteins are released by cleavage with the TEV protease, and the resulting proteins passed through a column with calmodulin beads.  The CBP causes them to bind these beads, and the protease and any other contaminants pass through.  This results in a very pure sample of the protein of interest and its interaction partners.  The resulting proteins can be identified by SDS-PAGE or mass spectrometry.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
====Characterizing interactions ====

=====Solid-phase detection=====

Unlike many interaction detection methods, solid-phase detection does not involve labeling of proteins.  In these techniques, one protein is attached to the surface of a transducer.  The other protein is contained in a solution that can be applied to the surface.  This allows binding kinetics of a reaction to be studied in real time.  Some of the common approaches use surface plasmon resonance or reflectance interference to detect and image the interactions.  Just like the protein array trend, this area is moving more toward parallel analysis of several interactions.  This can be done with a microfludic system, where proteins in solution are passed through a tiny channel that runs over a series of surfaces that each have a different type of protein attached to them.

[[Image:solid_state.jpg|frame|A schematic of a microfluidic interaction detection system.  This surface would be attached to a detector (not shown) that could monitor the interactions. ]]

=====Single molecule detection{{ref|4}}=====
&lt;!--Poulami--&gt;

Some of the newest and most exciting developments in studying protein interactions involve single molecules.  These allow experiments to be carried out with low concentrations, and with well-defined samples so there won’t be other interactions confounding the results.

One method used is force spectroscopy.  One member of a pair of interacting proteins is attached to the tip of an atomic force microscope, which can measure very small forces.  The other protein is attached to a solid surface.  The tip is brought down to the surface so that the proteins interact, and then pulled away.  The amount of force needed to pull the tip away from the surface is the force of the interaction.  This method was used effectively by Nevo et al. to determine whether the binding of an effector protein to a receptor caused a conformational change&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15454457&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, fluorescence can be used to detect single interacting pairs of proteins.  Two proteins can be marked with different fluorescent labels, and confocal microscopy used to scan a very thin section of a small volume of sample and detect the fluorescence.  When it detects both colors, it knows that it must have found an interacting pair, because they have to be very close to be in the same thin section.

__TOC__



==Prediction Methods for Interactions and Docking==
&lt;!-- Amanda and Lorelle --&gt;
===Monte Carlo===
The Monte Carlo approach to protein/protein interaction is modeled after the well-known random sampling algorithm used in computer science.  The theory is summarized as follows: Given a sufficiently large number of initial configurations, one will either emerge as the best configuration, or eventually lead to it.  The process begins with the docking of one protein to another.  A score is then computed based on things like energy, amount of exposed hydrophobic surface, number of interacting amino acids, among other parameters.  Random changes are made to the interaction (on the level of whole proteins, side chains, and even individual atoms!), and the step is either approved or rejected based on whether it caused the score to improve. {{ref|1}}

===Accessible Surface Area (ASA)===
Each atom in a protein has a van der Waal’s radius, and this is used to create a van der Waal’s surface of the protein.  The ASA describes all the places that solvent could potentially make contact with this surface.  It is calculated by computationally “rolling” a sphere around on the van der Waal’s surface, and calculating what parts of the surface it makes contact with.  This surface is incorporated in many docking and surface patch programs. {{ref|2}}

===Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions (CAPRI)===
The CAPRI challenge the European Bioinformatics Institute’s (EBI) creative way of evaluating protein docking programs.  Groups receive protein data from EBI and attempt to dock the proteins.  Their results are then tested and compared, not only giving recognition to deserving researchers, but also providing scientists with a comparison of the advantages of each program or protocol. {{ref|3}}

===Geometric Hashing===
Geometric Hashing is a molecular modeling technique that matches a target molecule to a protein of interest.

*TESS
TESS is an algorithm that uses X-ray and NMR data to determine 3D templates of proteins from the structures deposited in PDB. New structures can be scanned against these 3D structures to identify functional sites. Thus TESS is used to identify function of new protein structures and design proteins with specific function with the development of a 3D template database. {{ref|4}}
[[Image:Delaunay_circumcircles_vectorial.svg|thumb|right|200px|Delaunay triangulation in the plane with circumcircles. {{ref|17}} ]]

===Weighted Delaunay Triangulation===
Delaunay triangulation is one way of turning the surface of a protein into triangles.  The method involves taking a set of points in three dimensions, and forming triangles so that if a circle were drawn that contains all three points (a circumcircle), no other points in the set would fall within that circle.  In the case of protein surfaces, the points would be locations of atoms.  This creates a surface without little “sliver” triangles that take up more time and memory in the computer without really being meaningful to the calculations.{{ref|5}}

===FADE and PADRE===
The Fast Atomic Density Evaluator (FADE) and Pair-wise Atomic Density Reverse Engineering (PADRE) programs are used to determine molecular modeling of proteins. FADE and PADRE identify most prominent features in a protein such as regions which are involved in interaction with the other molecules by elucidating features of interest like crevices, grooves and protrusions. FADE has a special feature of evaluating shape complementarity for docked protein protein complexes.{{ref|6}} FADE and PADRE can be downloaded at http://www.mitchell-lab.org/mitchell-lab/FADE.php 

===CAST===
Computed Atlas of Surface Topography measures the shape of protein pockets with  weighted Delauney triangulation. Proteins and certain aminoacids have specific structures known as cavities  which creates the physiochemical properties needed for the function of the protein. CASTp is an online tool which estimates the function of the protein by locating and measuring the pockets and voids on 3D protein structures. The new version of CASTp includes the annotated versions from PDB,Swiss-prot and SNPs. The annotated residues from these sources are mapped to surface pockets, interior voids or other regions of the PDB structures. CASTp is used to study surface features, functional regions and specific roles of key residues of proteins.{{ref|7}}{{ref|8}} CASTp can be downloaded at http://cast.engr.uic.edu

=Computational Methods for Predicting Protein and Domain Interaction Partners=
==Methods for Predicting Protein Interaction Partners==
=== Gene neighbor and gene cluster method===
The hypothesis of the gene neighbor method is genes with similar functions are transcribed together as a single unit known as operon. If the genes that encode two proteins are neighbors on the chromosomes of several genomes then those proteins will have similar function. These genes which transcribe together inspite of the genetic distance between them are known as co-regulated genes. Conservation in the co-regulated genes is observed even in the distantly related organisms. The operons reveal the functional linkage between the constituent genes. Gene neighbor method is the most widely used method compared to other genomic inference methods. This method is used to detect the previously unknown interactions. Examples of gene neighbor prediction are the prediction of archeal exosome by comparing with the eukaryotic genome.   {{ref|10}} {{ref|11}}

===Phylogenetic profile methods===
Phylogenetic profile describes the presence or absence of a protein in a particular organism whose genome has been sequenced. Phylogenetic  profiles consists of n entries where n indicates the number of genomes sequenced. Presence of a homolog to a given protein in the nth genome is denoted by one and absence of the protein is denoted by zero. The proteins are then clustered based on the similarity of their phylogenetic profiles. Functionally related proteins are found in the same cluster. Both proteins and protein domains can be detected by using this method. The main drawbacks of this method are high cost, dependence on high information profiles and false detection of homology between distant organisms. The most striking example of the false correlation is to detect correlation between ubiquitous unlinked proteins present in all genomes. {{ref|9}} {{ref|10}} {{ref|11}}

===Rosetta Stone method===
Rosetta Stone method is also known as gene fusion method. Some pairs of interacting proteins have homologs in other organisms which are fused to a single protein chain. This fused protein is called a Rosetta Stone protein. This method detects protein interactions in different genomes. For example Gyr A and Gyr B are separate protein subunits in Escherichia coli where as the homolog of these proteins  found in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae is a single protein Topoisomerase-2. Rosetta Stone method is used for predicting about 6.4% of all experimental interactions. In Escherichia coli this method has found about 6,809 pairs of interacting non homologous proteins. {{ref|9}} {{ref|10}} {{ref|11}}
[[Image:Rosetta1_protein.jpg‎ | thumb |  center | 290px | Imaginary view of rosetta protein in Saccharomyces which is fused from 2 proteins in E.coli]]

===Sequence-based co-evolution methods===
This method is based on measuring the evolutionary distance between two different organisms. Co-evolution is the similarity in phylogenic trees of non-homologous proteins. The extent of similarity is quantified by calculating the correlation coefficient between the distance matrices indicating co-evolution of two different protein families. To calculate the correlation coefficient correspondence between the two elements is required which is not always available. Hence several algorithms are developed to identify specific interaction patterns. In co-evolution the changes in one protein which leads to the loss of its function is compensated by the correlated changes in the other gene. There is always some similarity between trees of any proteins due to the speciation process. This is known as &quot;background similarity&quot;. It is constructed from the 16S rRNA sequences and the final distance matrix is calculated by subtracting the rRNA based distances from the evolutionary distance obtained from original phylogenetic trees. Widely studied example of co-evolution studies is to predict interaction partners in DNA colicin and their immunity proteins. Co-evolution method is also used for predicting domain interactions. {{ref|10}}

===Classification methods===
Classification methods are used for the prediction of both protein and domain interactions. These methods distinguish true interacting protein pairs from the false non-interacting protein pairs by training a classifier with various data sources. There are many classifiers used in the classification methods the most popular classifier is Random Forest Decision followed by Support Vector Machines. Most popular classification method used is Kernel method which provides vectorial representation of the data in the feature space with a set of pair wise comparisions. The feature vectors represent the particular information of a protein such as protein interactions, domain compositions of a particular protein.  {{ref|10}}

==Predicting Domain Interactions from Protein Interactions==
===Association methods===
Association methods are generally assigned to predict domain interactions. Association methods are used to distinguish interacting proteins from non-interacting. Different classifiers such as correlated sequence signatures are used to distinguish this. Correlated sequence signatures considers each pair of interacting domains separately, ignoring other domains present in the protein. These methods distinguish interacting from non-interacting proteins by calculating the log odds score. The log odds score (log2(Pij/PiPj)) is calculated by taking the ratio of observed frequency domains in one protein pair to the background frequencies in the data. The domain interactions are predicted based on the positive log odds score. Based on the occurrence of domains in protein interacting pairs protein prediction can also be done. {{ref|10}}

===Bayesian network models and maximum likelihood methods===
This method is used to predict the domain interactions. This is advantageous when compared to association methods as bayesian network models considers missing and incorrect interaction data. Bayesian parameters are estimated by using Maximum Likelihood Estimation method. Maximum Likelihood Estimation method calculates experimental errors in the scoring scheme by maximizing the probability of interactions of the putative domain pairs. The likelihood function(θ) is a function of many parameters such as λij (probability that domains i and j interact), fp (false postive rate), fn (false negative rate), hence it is very difficult to maximize the likelihood function directly. Therefore Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to find the maximum likelihood estimate of unknown parameters by calculating the complete data in two iterative sets
1) observed data: consisting of protein-protein interactions
2) unobserved data: consisting of non protein-protein interactions. {{ref|10}}

===Domain pair exclusion analysis===
This method is advanced to maximum likelihood estimation method which predicts non specific interactions. Domain pair exclusion analysis detects specific and rare interactions between the proteins which have a lower θ value. These interactions are estimated by calculating the Eij score which is the logarithmic ratio of the probability that two proteins interact given the domains i and j interact to the probability that the two proteins interact given i and j do not interact. The probability in the numerator is calculated by using Expectation Maximization procedure and the probability in the denominator is calculated by repeating the procedure where the probability of domain pair interactions is zero. Higher E-scores indicate the high possibility of domain interaction while the lower values indicate that the competing domains are responsible for interactions. Thus domain pair exclusion analysis detects the interactions with low θ and high Eij values. Though it does not detect the false positives and false negatives it detects true positives to a considerable extent. {{ref|10}}

===p-Value method===
The null hypothesis of this method tests whether the presence of a domain in a protein pair effects the protein interactions. The statistic in p-Value method is calculated by considering two factors. They are the fraction of false positives known as experimental error and the fraction of false negatives known as incompleteness of the dataset. An ideal reference distribution for this method is obtained by shuffling the domains in proteins such that the protein interactions remain stable. The p-statistics then obtained considering the reference distribution indicate the reliability of domain interactions given that the two proteins interact. There is a inverse relationship between the value of p-statistics and the interaction of the proteins. Given that two proteins interact the domain pair with the lowest p-value is most likely to interact. The p-value method works well if there are nine or more domains in a given protein pair.  {{ref|10}}

==Available Software Programs for Determining Protein-Protein Interactions==
===Protein Interactions Calculator===
Protein Interactions Calculator (PMID:17584791)is a server which recognizes various kinds of interactions; such as disulphide bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, aromatic- aromatic interactions, aromatic-sulphur interactions and cation - π interactions within a protein or between proteins in a complex. It also determines the accessible surface area as well as the distance of a residue from the surface of the protein. 
The input should be in the Protein data bank(.pdb) format. 
Interactions are calculated based on empirical or semi-empirical set of rules. 
All the interactions and bonds can be seen in a single site and also the identified interactions/bonds between residues can be visualized using a RasMol and Jmol interface. {{ref|11}}

===DOCK===
DOCK software is compatible with UNIX based platforms. DOCK generates many possible orientations of a putative ligand in a user selected region of a receptor structure. These orientations are scored using several scoring schemes which are designed to measure steric and chemical complementarity of the receptor-ligand complex. DOCK has many applications such as detecting the binding orientation of protein-protein complexes,  protein-DNA complexes, evaluating likely orientations of a single ligand, ranking molecules from a database. It also searches different databases for the compounds which acts as enzyme inhibitors, DNA binding compounds, compounds binding to receptor etc., DOCK uses a geometric matching algorithm to assess rigid receptor docking by superimposing the negative image of the ligand onto the binding pocket. {{ref|12}}{{ref|13}}
The official website of DOCK is http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/

===autoDOCK===
AUTODOCK is composed of many automatic docking tools. It predicts how substrates and drug candidates bind to a receptor or protein of known 3D structure. It has two main programs. The first program performs the docking of the ligand to a set of grids describing the target protein. Second program is the AutoGrid which precalculates these grids. AUTODOCK is also compatible with the UNIX based platform. AUTODOCK has applications in many fields such as X-ray crystallography, structure-based drug design, protein-protein docking, lead optimization, combinatorial library design etc., {{ref|12}} {{ref|13}} {{ref|18}}

===ICM (Internal Coordinates Mechanism)===
ICM uses bond length, torsion angles, bond angles to determine structural predictions. It does fast and accurate docking simulations. It has a unique set of tools for accurate ligand-protein docking, peptide-protein docking, and protein-protein docking including interactive graphic tools. {{ref|13}} Visit the Abagyan lab at:  http://abagyan.scripps.edu/lab/web/man/frames.htm or www.molsoft.com to learn more.

===FleXX===
FleXX is a high speed computer program used to determine binding mode. It detects the protein-ligand complex within seconds if the three dimensional structure of the protein is known. FLEXX  estimates  the binding affinity of protein-ligand complex by predicting the geometry of protein-ligand complex from the known 3D structure of the protein. FLEXX has 2 main applications in protein predictions. They are
1) Complex prediction: It is used when a protein and a small molecule is present without the knowledge of the structure of the protein ligand complex. It creates and ranks a series of possible protein-ligand complexes.
2) Virtual Screening: It is used for prioritizing the compounds for experimental testing from the set of compounds and a given protein.  
Placement algorithm in FLEXX is based on interactions between two molecules and Boehm function is applied for scoring. Two databases are widely used in FLEXX to predict protein-ligand interactions. They are 
1) MIMUMBA torsion angle database: It is used for the creation of the conformers
2) Interaction geometry database: It is used to describe exactly intermolecular interaction patterns. The advantages of this software are it is best enrichment tool in structure based drug design,generating poses of lead structures in a protein binding site and docking gigantic libraries by using high speed docking. {{ref|12}}{{ref|13}}

Note: The possessive is not a case of the personal pronoun, rather it's a pronoun itself. This table shows the possessive pronoun's stem, which is declined as an ein-word (like the indefinite article).  

The genitive case indicates possession or association, and is equivalent to, and replaces, the English word &quot;of&quot;.  &quot;Des&quot; and &quot;der&quot; (do not confuse with masculine singular nominative) mean &quot;of the&quot;; &quot;eines&quot; and &quot;einer&quot; mean &quot;of a/an&quot;; and, &quot;der Sohn guten Weins&quot; means &quot;the son of good wine&quot; (no article, M, Gen strong adj).  Strict replacement of the genitive case with the word &quot;of&quot; maintains the word-order of the German nominal phrase: possessed - possessor (in genitive).  The genitive case also replaces &quot;'s&quot; in English, though reversing the word-order (in English: possessor's possessed).  German itself also uses an &quot;s&quot; (though without the apostrophe) to indicate possession, in the same word order as English.  It is used mainly with proper nouns, such as &quot;Goethes Heimat&quot;, as well as for compounding words.

Standard genitive constructions are used with nouns and modifiers of nouns such as articles and adjectives, and the inflection they receive implies possession.  The first noun may be in any case and may occur in any part of the sentence; the second noun, which possesses the first noun, immediately follows the first noun, and is in the genitive case.  The noun in the genitive case need not have any modifiers - e.g., Heimat Goethes, Heimat Katerina, which mean the homeland of Goethe and Katerina, respectively - though such constructions can be cumbersome and ambiguous.

Proper treatment of the genitive case, including all of the declensions, is found in another part of this book.

German pronouns have genitive forms, but they are used only rarely nowadays, mostly in archaic or formal German. In many cases, a preposition can be added to allow a different case to be used.
 Ich erinnere mich ihrer. (I remember her)
 Also possible: Ich erinnere mich an sie.

 Wir gedachten seiner. (We thought of him)
 Also possible: Wir dachten an ihn.

 Herr, erbarme dich unser! (Lord, have mercy upon us)
 Also possible: Herr, erbarme dich über uns.

The possessive pronouns (mein-, dein-, unser-, etc.) are almost identical in form to the genitive pronouns and but they directly modify their attribute and could be conceived of as adjectives, though they decline differently.  Alternatively, one could think of possessive pronouns, e.g., &quot;mein-&quot;, as replacing the phrase, &quot;of me&quot;.  Directly translated, &quot;mein-&quot; means &quot;my&quot; in English.

Examples:

 I want the teacher's book. Let's rewrite this as: I want the book of the teacher.
 -Ich will das Buch '''des''' Lehrer'''s''' (der Lehrerin).
--The genitive case here is masculine (feminine) singular, inflecting the definite article (des/der) as well as the noun (Lehrer (+s), but not Lehrerin, which doesn't change because it is feminine).

 Without his friend's car, we cannot go home.
 -Ohne den Wagen seines Freundes können wir nicht nach Hause fahren.
--Here, two possessive relationships are mentioned.  The car belongs to the friend, and the friend belongs to &quot;him&quot;.  For illustrative purposes, one could conceivably re-write the prepositional phrase as &quot;without the car (accusitive case) of the friend of him&quot;.  German's rendering is far less awkward.

 The wall of the building is old and brown.
 -Die Wand des Gebäudes ist alt und braun.
--As in the first example, the genitive case here is in the masculine singular, and inflects the definite article and the noun (M,N add +s/+es in the genitive case).

= Comparison of Pronouns to other Parts of Speech = 

Despite the difficulty many people have in learning German declensions, case-endings in German correspond to each other to a considerable degree.  Specifically, the pronouns bear an obvious resemblance to their parent direct articles.  Learning the corresponding 3rd-person declensions side-by-side allows some people to comprehend the declension pattern more easily. 

As discussed above, possessive pronouns replace the genitive case for pronouns.  In this table, they will be placed where the genitive case is, so that their similiarities to other parts of speech that actually are in the genitive case can become clear.

German is very rigorous in its use of gender, and will use the pronoun corresponding to the gender of the referential noun, regardless of whether the noun being referenced is a person (unlike English, which uses &quot;it&quot; for everything not a person or other entities (animals, ships) in certain contexts).  ''Der Liberalismus'' will be referred to as &quot;er&quot;, or &quot;he&quot;, whereas &quot;das Mädchen&quot; would be &quot;es&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;.  Many English speakers have trouble with this, especially in spoken language.  Mastery is nonetheless possible with a proper understanding of German declension and a considerable amount of practice.

N.B.(1) The use of &quot;wessen&quot; is considered old-fashioned, though most Germans would find it endearing to hear a non-native speaker use the word.  One is encouraged to use the &quot;gehören + dativ (wem?)&quot; construction, which means &quot;to belong to s.o. (whom?)&quot;.

N.B.(2) The dative plural.  Except for words whose plural form adds an &quot;-s&quot; (mainly loan-words), and words whose plural form already ends in &quot;-n&quot;/&quot;-en&quot;, all nouns add an &quot;-n/-en&quot; in the dative plural.  Like the s's added to masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive, this is a remnant from when German inflected all of its nouns, which other languages based on declension, such as Russian and Latin, retain.  Sometimes one will notice an &quot;-e&quot; after masculine and neuter nouns in the dative case, such as the dedication on the Reichstag building - &quot;Dem deutschen Volke&quot;, &quot;for the German People&quot;.  

This nominal declension is reflected in the dative plural pronoun (to/for them), &quot;ihnen&quot;, instead of &quot;ihn&quot; (masculine, accusitive).  For example, 

 Helga: Können Sie bitte meinen Brüdern helfen?
 Olga: Natürlich, aber ich kann ihnen leider nur nach zwei Tagen helfen.
 Helga: Unsere Leben gehen trotzdem weiter.

Make a point of studying and getting used to the dative plural.

      <comment>/* Verbs with prepositions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">German has dative, accusative, genitive and two-way prepositions and postpositions.  Each preposition causes the adverbial expression on which it acts to take the case of the preposition.  Two-way prepositions cause the adverbial expression to take the accusative case if the verb is transitive, and the dative case if the verb is intransitive.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Several German prepositions'''
|-
! Accusative !! Dative !! Genitive !! two-way
|-
| bis || aus || während || an
|-
| durch || außer || trotz || auf
|-
| entlang || bei || anstatt || hinter
|-
| f&amp;uuml;r || mit || wegen  || in
|-
| gegen || nach ||innerhalb || neben
|-
| ohne || seit || außerhalb || &amp;uuml;ber
|-
| um || von || jenseits || unter
|-
| wider || zu || diesseits || vor
|-
| || gegen&amp;uuml;ber || || zwischen
|}

Notes:

Gegen&amp;uuml;ber is one of the rare postpositions which typically follows the object it modifies.

 Er stand mir gegenüber.
 Mir gegenüber steht Au&amp;szlig;enminister Fischer.

Aber auch:

 Gegenüber von Ihnen befindet sich das Stadtmuseum.

Nach is also sometimes used as a postposition, when its meaning is &quot;according to&quot;.  The two phrases are equivalent:

 Nach dem Pfarrer sei Gott gut.
 Dem Pfarrer nach sei Gott gut.

In spoken language, the genitive with prepositions is nowadays often replaced by the dative.
But it is important to notice that this replacement is still just colloquial language, e.g.:

 Written: W&amp;auml;hrend des Essens wollen wir nicht gest&amp;ouml;rt werden.
 Spoken:  W&amp;auml;hrend dem Essen  wollen wir nicht gest&amp;ouml;rt werden.

==Two way Prepositions (Wechselpr&amp;auml;positionen)==
The case with two way prepositions should be determined with questions like wo? (where?), wann? (when?), wohin? (where does it go to?) and wie? (how?).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Two-way prepositions'''
|-

|-
| an, hinter, in, neben, &amp;uuml;ber, unter, vor, zwischen || Dative || Accusative || Dative
|-
| auf || Dative || Accusative || Accusative
|}

==Short notation==
Some combinations of articles and prepositions are usually combined:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Short notation'''
|-
! Preposition + Article !! Short notation
|-
| an + das || ans
|-
| an + dem || am
|-
| auf + das || aufs
|-
| bei + dem || beim
|-

|-
| in + dem || im
|-
| von + dem || vom
|-
| vor + dem || vorm
|-
| zu + dem || zum
|-
| zu + der || zur
|}

In all other cases the preposition and articles have to be written separately.

==Verbs with prepositions==
Several verbs are used with a specific preposition and case:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Verbs ==

German verbs can be classified as ''weak'' or as ''strong''. Weak verbs are very regular in their forms, whereas strong verbs change the stem vowel.

Weak:
 kaufen, kaufte, gekauft

Strong:
 singen, sang, gesungen

With its Anglo-Saxon origin, this notion is also present in English.

 flip, flipped, flipped
 sing, sang, sung

Some German verbs have weak and strong forms. This may depend on meaning:

 Der Botschafter wurde nach Berlin gesandt.
 Der S&amp;uuml;ddeutsche Rundfunk sendete ein Konzert aus dem Gasteig.

Or on transitive vs. intransitive use:

 Das Hemd hing auf der W&amp;auml;scheleine.
 Sie h&amp;auml;ngte das Hemd auf die W&amp;auml;scheleine.

== Separable Verbs ==

Sometimes you will run into verbs such as anrufen, aufräumen, mitkommen. These verbs are examples of Separable Prefix Verbs. When you see these kinds of verbs, it will have a preposition prefix followed by a verb. These verbs separate when they are the main verb of a sentence.

EXAMPLES:

I am calling the butcher.
Ich rufe den Metzger an.

I am trying on the boots.
Ich probiere die Stiefel an.

== Reflexive Verbs ==

'''Reflexive Verbs''' are verbs involving the reflexive pronoun &quot;sich&quot; and its conjugations that reflect, or refer back, to the performer of the action. There are only accusative and dative reflexive pronouns.

Accusative reflexive pronouns are used when there is no direct object. Dative reflexive pronouns are used when a direct object is present. However, when using a direct object, the possessive is not used.

Examples:
:Accusative: ''Ich '''verletze mich'''.'' I injure myself.
:Dative: ''Ich '''verletze mir''' die Hand.'' I injure my hand.

:Accusative: ''Er hat '''sich verbrannt'''.'' He burned himself.
:Dative: ''Er hat '''sich''' den Daumen '''verbrannt'''.'' He burned his thumb.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+Reflexiv Pronommen
|-
!  !! Akkusativ (Wenfall) !! Dativ (Wemfall)
|-
| 1st sg.
| mich || mir 
|-
| 2nd sg. (informal)
| dich || dir
|-
| 1st pl.
| uns || &quot;
|-
| 2nd pl. (informal)
| euch || &quot;
|-
| 2nd sg. or pl. formal; 3rd.
| sich || &quot; 
|}

Notice that all reflexives are the same as the Akkusativ and Dativ Pronoun Declensions — ''except'' for 3rd Person and 2nd sg./pl. Person formal (''man/sie/Sie''), in which case all reflexives are ''sich''.

== Modals ==
===Dürfen===
''Dürfen'' means to be allowed/permitted, may.

|}

Examples:

===Mögen===
''mögen'' expresses a pleasure, or desire. In the present tense, it is used transitively with people or food. e.g. 'Ich mag dich' 'I like you' or 'Ich mag Erdbeeren' 'I like strawberries'. The subjunctive (of the past) expresses preference to perform the action of a subordinate clause 'Ich möchte nach Frankreich reisen' ''I would like to travel to France'. 'mögen' is cognate with the English verb 'may'/'might'.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-

! Past
! Conjunctive II
|-
| ich

| er/sie/es
| '''mag''' (He/She/It likes to)
| '''mochte'''
| '''möchte''' (He/She/It would like to)
|-

|}

Example:

(There is also a present subjunctive ''möge'', which is very formal:&lt;br&gt;
Der König sagte: &quot;Er möge eintreten.&quot; - The king said: &quot;He may enter.&quot;)

===Müssen===
''müssen'' expresses something forced on you. It is etymologically related to 'must'.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!
! Present
! Past
! Conjunctive II
|-
| ich
| '''muss''' gehen  (I must/have to go)
| '''musste''' (I had to)
| '''m&amp;uuml;sste'''
|-
| du
| '''musst'''
| '''musstest'''
| '''m&amp;uuml;sstest'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| '''muss'''
| '''musste'''
| '''m&amp;uuml;sste'''
|-
| wir
| '''müssen'''
| '''mussten'''
| '''m&amp;uuml;ssten'''
|-
| ihr

| '''musstet'''
| '''m&amp;uuml;sstet'''
|-
| sie/Sie

|}

Examples:
 Ich '''muss nicht''' arbeiten. ~ Ich '''brauche nicht zu''' arbeiten.  I '''don't have to''' work.
 Ich '''darf nicht''' arbeiten.  I '''must not''' work.

Note that the negative '''nicht müssen''' is not the English '''must not''', but rather '''need not''' or '''don't have/need to'''.
'''must not''' translates to '''nicht dürfen'''.

There are however some northern German uses like:
 Du '''musst''' das '''nicht''' tun meaning Du '''solltest''' das '''nicht''' tun.

===Sollen===

''sollen'' expresses an obligation or duty. It is etymologically related to 'shall'.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!
! Present
! Past
|-
| ich
| '''soll''' schwimmen  (I am to swim)
| '''sollte''' (I was to)
|-
| du
| '''sollst'''
| '''solltest'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| '''soll'''
| '''sollte'''
|-
| wir
| '''sollen'''
| '''sollten'''
|-
| ihr
| '''sollt'''
| '''solltet'''
|-
| sie/Sie
| '''sollen'''
| '''sollten'''
|}

===Wollen===

''wollen'' means to want.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

| '''wolltest'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| '''will'''
| '''wollte'''
|-
| wir
| '''wollen'''
| '''wollten'''
|-
| ihr
| '''wollt'''
| '''wolltet'''
|-
| sie/Sie
| '''wollen'''
| '''wollten'''
|}

===Use in Perfect (and Pluperfect) Tense===

Although all these modals have a normal perfect:
 '''gedurft gekonnt gemocht gemusst gesollt'''

in connection with other verbs, the infinitive form is used:
 Ich habe das tun '''dürfen - können - mögen - müssen - sollen'''.

Wrong:
 Ich habe das tun '''gedurft - gekonnt - gemocht - gemusst - gesollt'''.

It holds also for the verbs '''sehen''' and '''hören''':
 Ich habe ihn kommen '''sehen - hören'''.

===Use of modal verbs as full verbs===

Modal verbs can be used as full verbs indicating motion.
 '''Er muss nach Berlin''' He must go to Berlin.

==Present Tense==

===Use===

The Present Tense is used for..

* The Present Tense (=&quot;das Präsens&quot;) is used to describe situations that are happening and aren't the past.

* For Ongoing Action, like ''I'm swimming in the pool now''

* Everyday Truths, like ''The moon and stars will come at night.''

* Future meaning, if explicitly stated, like ''I will run tomorrow morning''

* Actions started in the past and still going on in the present ''I've been cleaning the house all day''

===Progressive Forms===

There is a present progressive tense in colloquial spoken German. Its use is optional.

Here is one example: 

Ich bin am Fahren.
(I am at the driving)
I'm driving.

The person to say this would be driving during the time they say this and they would continue to drive after stating this for some time.

You nominalize the verb (&quot;fahren&quot; (driving) becomes &quot;das Fahren&quot;) and add a &quot;am&quot;.
You can also do this with forms of the past.

Als er kam war ich gerade am Abwaschen.
(When he arrived i was at &quot;the dishwashing&quot;)
I was washing the dishes when he arrived.

So the verb &quot;sein&quot; (to be) includes the information what tense he was doing what he did in.

Here the progressive meaning is also emphasized with the word &quot;gerade&quot; meaning something like: I was JUST ABOUT to wash the dishes(not the same though because it means he is already doing it and not about to start).

==Perfect Tense==
The '''Perfect Tense''' or '''das Perfekt''' of verbs is used to talk about things in the past which have already happened. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Present Perfect Tense&quot;. This can cause confusion. While the formation is similar, the meaning and usage differs.

===Formation===

As in English, the perfect tense consists of two parts. An auxiliary (Hilfsverb) and a past participle (Partizip Perfekt). Compare the examples given below with their English translations.

{|
|Er
|hat
|gelacht.
|-
|''He''
|''has''
|''laughed.''
|}

{|
|Sie
|ist 
|gekommen
|-
|''She''
|''has''
|''come''.
|}
{|
|Die Kinder
|haben
|gegessen.
|-
|''The children''
|''have''
|''eaten''.
|}


===Past participle for regular verbs===

The '''general rule''' is simple:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! verb            !! prefix !! + 3rd-person sing.  !! participle(er/sie/es)
|-
| lachen (laugh) || ge     || + (er/sie/es) lacht || gelacht 
|-
| kaufen (buy)   || ge     || + (er/sie/es) kauft || gekauft
|-
| mähen  (mow)   || ge     || + (er/sie/es) mäht  || gemäht
|}

There are some groups of regular verbs that slightly differ from that pattern.

Some verbs '''drop the prefix ge-'''. Like the other regular verbs they end in -t. These are:

1. Verbs with ''unseparable prefixes'' (be-, ent-, er-, empf-, ge-, ver-, miss-, zer-)&lt;br&gt;
Examples:
 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! verb               !! past participle
|-
| besuchen (visit)   || besucht
|-
| entfernen (remove) || entfernt
|-
| erreichen (achieve) || erreicht
|-
| gehören (belong)   || gehört
|-
| verstecken (hide)  || versteckt
|-
| missverstehen (misunderstand) || missverstanden
|}

2. Verbs ''ending in -ieren''&lt;br&gt;
Examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! verb              !! past participle
|-
| kopieren (copy)   || kopiert 
|-
| polieren (polish) || poliert
|}

3. Another group is formed by '''verbs with separable prefixes'''&lt;br&gt;
With separable verbs, the prefix ge is placed between the prefix and the rest of the verb.&lt;br&gt;
Examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! verb                 !! sep. pref.+  ge + 3rd-person sg. !! =  past participle
|-
| aufmachen (open)     || auf       +  ge + macht          || =  aufgemacht
|-
| abstellen (put down) || ab        +  ge + stellt         || =  abgestellt
|}

'''Separable''' and '''inseparable''' verbs are distinguished by the '''stressed syllable''':
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! verb                 !! past participle
|-
|über'setzen (to translate) || über'setzt
|-
|'übersetzen (to ferry across) || 'übergesetzt
|}

 Er hat das Buch ins Chinesische übersetzt.
 Der F&amp;auml;hrmann hat den Passagier übergesetzt (über den Fluss gesetzt).

===Past Participle for Irregular Verbs===
Irregular verbs always end in '''-en'''. The '''vowel can be different''' from the one in present tense. Look at some examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! infinitive        !! 3rd-person sg. !! past participle
|-
| gehen (go)        || geht           || gegangen
|-
| essen (eat)       || isst           || gegessen
|-
| schreiben (write) || schreibt       || geschrieben
|-
| trinken (drink)   || trinkt         || getrunken
|-
| schlafen (sleep)  || schläft        || geschlafen
|-
| nehmen (take)     || nimmt          || genommen
|}

You have to learn these forms by heart. How you can obtain the necessary information and how you should learn them is described in ''section tips for learning'' below.

Note that irregular verbs can be combined with the same prefixes as described above. The same rules regarding the prefix ''ge-'' apply. Therefore the forms for ''schreiben'', ''verschreiben'' and ''aufschreiben'' are ''geschrieben'', ''verschrieben'' and ''aufgeschrieben'' respectively.

====Which verbs are irregular====
A lot of verbs that are irregular in English are irregular in German, too. Unfortunately, this is not always true. It is most likely when the German and the English verb are related (i.e. look similar).

Examples:
 see:    irregular   sehen:    irregular
 buy:    irregular   kaufen:   regular
 get:    irregular   bekommen: irregular ;-)

Regular verbs are much more frequent than irregular ones, but a lot of the irregular verbs are used very frequently, for instance haben, sein, gehen, kommen etc.

When in doubt whether a verb is irregular or not, it is best to look it up in a dictionary (See below).

===''Haben'' or ''sein'' as auxiliaries===
'''Whether a verb is irregular''' or not '''does not influence the choice of auxiliary.'''

'''Most verbs''' take ''haben'' as auxiliary. 

A) Verbs which take an '''accusative object''' (transitive verbs)&lt;br&gt;
B) '''Reflexive verbs''' always take '''haben''' as auxiliary.

Examples A:
 trinken: Er hat ein Bier getrunken.
 lesen:   Sie hat ein Buch gelesen
 kochen   Sie haben gestern Spaghetti gekocht.

Examples B:
 sich freuen   Ich habe mich gefreut
 sich kämmen   Er hat sich gekämmt
 sich ärgern   Wir haben uns schon lange nicht mehr so geärgert.

The '''auxiliary sein''' is taken by verbs that describe &lt;br&gt;
:C) the relocation from one place to another or 
:D) the change of a state
::and with
:E) '''sein''' (be) and '''bleiben''' (stay)
'''Note''': none of the verbs from groups C-E is combined with an accusative object.

Examples C: relocation verbs
 verb               aux.  irregular  sentence with perfect tense 
 kommen (come)      sein  yes        Ich bin gekommen.
 reisen (travel)    sein  no         Wir sind schon dreimal nach China gereist.
 fahren (drive)     sein  yes        Ich bin mit dem Auto nach Kalifornien gefahren.
 begegnen (meet)    sein  no         Er ist ihm gestern begegnet. 
 gehen (go)         sein  yes        Du bist gegangen.
 starten (take off) sein  yes        Das Flugzeug ist gestartet.

In southern German (mostly Bavarian) use, also stehen, sitzen und schwimmen are treated like a (non-)movement:
 Ich bin gestanden - gesessen - geschwommen. High German is: Ich habe gestanden - gesessen - geschwommen.
 Aber: Ich habe den See durchschwommen.

Examples D: change of state verbs
 verb                        aux.   irr.    sentence with perfect tense
 aufstehen (get up)          sein   yes     Ich bin heute früh aufgestanden.
 einschlafen (fall asleep)   sein   yes     Die Kinder sind endlich eingeschlafen.
 verblühen (whither)         sein   no      Die Blumen sind schon verblüht

Examples E: sein and bleiben
 Er ist nicht lange geblieben.  He didn't stay long.
 Er ist immer nett gewesen.     He has always been nice.

'''Exceptions to the rules'''
Some of the verbs from group A can be used with an object in accusative case. In this case, they take '''haben''' as auxiliary. 

Compare:
 Ich bin nach Kalifornien gefahren.                  I drove to California. 
 Ich bin mit dem Auto nach Kalifornien gefahren.     I drove to California by car (literally: with the car)
 Ich habe das Auto (Akk.) nach Kalifornien gefahren. I drove the car to California. 

The same applies to fliegen (fly), starten and reiten (ride a horse).

===Usage===
Unlike in English the difference in meaning between Perfekt and Präteritum is rather small. The main difference between those two forms lies in usage. Perfekt is mostly used in spoken language, while Präteritum is mostly reserved for written texts. However, the ''modals'', the verbs ''haben'' and ''sein'' and the expression ''es gibt'' are almost exclusively used in Präteritum - even when speaking. One reason might be the frequency of those verbs, the other reason is most likely the very complex perfect forms for modals. 

(This is in southern German use; in northern German, you'll hear the preterite also in spoken language.)

On the other hand, the perfect tense is used in writing too. The more oral the text is, the more perfect tense you will find (for example in personal letters etc.). If an action has happened very recently, it tends to be in perfect tense too.

Look at the following conversation and concentrate on the distribution of Präteritum and Perfekt.

&lt;i&gt;(1) Anna: Hallo Peter. Wo warst du denn? Ich habe dich schon lange nicht mehr gesehen.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Peter: Hallo Anna. Ich war die letzen zwei Wochen im Urlaub.&lt;br&gt;
(3) Anna: So? Wo warst du denn genau? &lt;br&gt;
(4) Peter: Auf der Insel Elba, in einem fantastischen Hotel. Es gab jeden Abend ein Büffet und man konnte essen, so viel man wollte! &lt;br&gt;
(5) Anna (lacht): Ich glaube dir sofort, dass dir das gefallen hat. Du hast aber nicht nur gegessen, oder? Was hast du denn den ganzen Tag gemacht? &lt;br&gt;
(6) Peter (lacht auch): Nein, natürlich nicht. Ich bin viel geschwommen, ich habe mir die Insel angeguckt und am Abend bin ich immer zum Tanzen in eine Disco gegangen. &lt;br&gt;
(7) Anna: Aha... Und? Hast du jemanden kennen gelernt?&lt;br&gt;
(8) Peter (grinst): Kein Kommentar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Vocablary to help you understand the text:
 der Urlaub, -e   vacation
 genau            exactly, precisely
 die Insel, -n    island
 das Büffet, -s   buffet
 gefallen         like
 angucken         to look at (colloquial)
 kennen lernen    get to know
 grinsen          grin

Used forms to talk about past events
 Präteritum         Perfekt
 du warst (1/3)     habe gesehen (1)
 ich war (2)        es hat gefallen (5)
 es gab (4)         du hast gegessen (5)
 konnte (4)         du hast gemacht (5)
 wollte (4)         ich bin geschwommen (6)
                    ich habe angeguckt (6)
                    ich bin gegangen (6)
                    du hast kennen gelernt

===How to find the forms in a dictionary===
Unless you have a special dictionary for learners, not all the forms will be spelled out. Regular forms are often omitted. The same goes for the auxiliary ''haben''. If no forms are indicated, you may assume that the verb is regular and has the verb haben as an auxiliary. However, if you find the abbreviation ''itr'' or ''i''. (for intransitive) behind the verb, the auxiliary is often '''sein'''. Intransitve verbs don't have an accusative object and these are often used with sein, while ''transitive'' verbs (tr. or t.) are '''always''' conjugated with haben. 

Sometimes not even the forms of irregular verbs are given in the lexicon entry. Irregular verbs are often indicated by ''irr''. for irregular or a similar abbreviation. In that case, look for a list of irregular verb forms in the index of your dictionary.

To find the past participle of separable verbs you often have to cut the prefix and look for the base form of the verb. If you look for ''aufstehen'' (get up), you probably find your answer in the entry of stehen. '''Remember''': The prefix ge goes in between the prefix of the separable verb and the verb itself: auf + ge + standen.

When working online, you might consider using [http://www.canoo.net Canoo]. Enter an arbitrary form of the word you are interested in into the mask. Hit enter. On the results page, choose the link ''Flexion'' behind the appropriate entry (or ''inflection'' in the English version). You will get a table of all possible verb forms.

===Tips for learning===
Irregular forms are just that - irregular. Therefore you have to learn them by heart. By learning four forms, you can construct every verb form for a given verb. 

The forms you should know are: 
 Infinitiv    Präsens          Präteritum    Hilfsverb  + Partizip Perfekt
 infinitiv    3rd person       preterite     auxiliary  + past participle
 gehen        geht             ging          ist        + gegangen
 nehmen       nimmt            nahm          hat        + genommen
 fahren       fährt            fuhr          ist        + gefahren
 lesen        liest            las           hat        + gelesen
 essen        isst             aß            hat        + gegessen
 kommen       kommt            kam           ist        + gekommen
 bleiben      bleibt           blieb         ist        + geblieben
 sein         ist              war           ist        + gewesen
 anfangen     fängt ... an     fing ... an   hat        + angefangen
 ...

All forms - besides the infinitive of course - should be in '''3rd-person singular'''. 

A good way to learn those forms is to put them on small cards. On one side you write the infinitive and probably a sentence to illustrate the usage of the verb. On the backside you put the rest of the forms and - if needed - a translation of the verb. When learning, you look at the infinitve and try to remember the forms and the meaning. You can easily verify your hypothesis by flipping the card.

If you encounter a verb you want to learn, look it up in a dictionary. If it is irregular, learn the verb together with its defining forms. Like that, you spare yourself a lot of trouble later on.

==Sentence Structure==
The perfect tense consists of two verb forms: an auxiliary and a past participle. Together they form the so called predicate. The predicate consists of all verb parts in one clause.

The sentence structure in perfect behaves as with every two parts predicate (modals plus infinitive, separable verbs etc.) 

===Main Clauses===
In a main clause (Hauptsatz), the conjugated verb (the auxiliary in this case) is in the second position and the past participle stands at the end of the clause.

    First Position (I)       (II)
 1) Sein Vater               hat  gestern    ein fantastisches Essen gekocht.
 2) Gestern                  hat  sein Vater ein fantastisches Essen gekocht.
    Both: ''Yesterday, his father cooked a fantastic meal.''
 3) Ein fantastisches Essen  hat  sein Vater gestern                 gekocht.*
    ''It was a fantastic meal that his father cooked yesterday.''
&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The third example is correct, although not very frequent. You might use it if you want to stress what exactly his father has prepared or if you have to repeat the sentence because your partner has not understood this particular part of it.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Second position&lt;/i&gt; does not equal &lt;i&gt;second word&lt;/i&gt;, as you can see above. However, there is only one group of words allowed before the conjugated verb (the auxiliary in this case). Such groups of words are called &quot;phrases&quot;. While you can put very long phrases in front of the conjugated verb, you must not use two. Therefore the sentence &quot;Gestern sein Vater hat ein fantastisches Essen gekocht&quot; is wrong.

===Subordinated Clauses===
Subordinated clauses begin with a ''subordinating conjunction''. Well known conjunctions of this kind are
 weil  dass  wenn. 

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;In spoken language &lt;i&gt;weil&lt;/i&gt; is often used like &lt;i&gt;und&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;aber&lt;/i&gt;, which means that it is followed by a main clause. However, after &lt;i&gt;weil&lt;/i&gt;, speakers often pause for a little while. There is no pause after either &lt;i&gt;und&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;aber&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Weil + main clause is not allowed in written language. Therefore you may say: &lt;i&gt;Ich gehe, weil - (little pause) - ich bin müde.&lt;/i&gt; But you wouldn't use it in a letter. At least not yet.&lt;br&gt;
The correct conjunction for a main clause is &lt;i&gt;denn&lt;/i&gt;, which is rarely used in spoken language.&lt;/small&gt;

In subordinated clauses the conjugated verb, i.e. the auxiliary, stands at the very end of the sentence. The past participle stands directly in front of it. For example:
                   conj.    aux.                 participle  aux.
 Ich weiß,         dass  du      das             gemacht     hast.
 Ich glaube dir,   weil  du      bisher noch nie gelogen     hast.
 Ich glaube dir,   denn  du hast bisher noch nie gelogen.
 Ich gehe,         wenn  du                      gegangen    bist.

==Past tense==
===Regular verbs===
Regular (or better, weak) verbs take the ending -te. The person endings are added afterwards. Note that the forms for 1st- and 3rd-person singular are the same.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!  !! lernen
|-
| ich
| lern'''te'''
|-
| du
| lern'''test'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| lern'''te'''
|-
| wir
| lern'''ten'''
|-
| ihr
| lern'''tet'''
|-
| sie/Sie
| lern'''ten'''
|}

If the stem of a verb (infinitive minus -en) ends in -t (arbeit-en), -d (end-en) or consonant plus m or n (öffn-en, rechn-en) you add an -e before the preterite endings.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!  !! arbeiten
|-
| ich
| arbeit'''ete'''
|-
| du
| arbeit'''etest'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| arbeit'''ete'''
|-
| wir
| arbeit'''eten'''
|-
| ihr
| arbeit'''etet'''
|-
| sie/Sie
| arbeit'''eten'''
|}

===Irregular verbs===
====Without -te====

The strong verbs belong to this group. The endings are easy to memorize. It is harder to know which vowel to use. The rule mentioned above for t/d, double-consonant + n/m applies also for irregular verbs.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!  !! fahren !! stehen
|-
| ich
| fuhr
| stand
|-
| du
| fuhr'''st'''
| stand'''(e)st'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| fuhr
| stand
|-
| wir
| fuhr'''en'''
| stand'''en'''
|-
| ihr
| fuhr'''t'''
| stand'''et'''
|-
| sie/Sie
| fuhr'''en'''
| stand'''en'''
|}

 gehen, ging, gegangen
 stehen, stand, gestanden

====With -te====
Few irregular verbs take the -te ending. Examples are: nennen, rennen, kennen, bringen, denken and the irregular modals (können, dürfen and müssen).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!  !! nennen
|-
| ich
| nann'''te'''
|-
| du
| nann'''test'''
|-
| er/sie/es
| nann'''te'''
|-
| wir
| nann'''ten'''
|-
| ihr
| nann'''tet'''
|-
| sie/Sie
| nann'''ten'''
|}

==Future Tense==
=== Talking about future with the present tense ===
German uses the Present Tense to talk about the future whenever it is clear to both speaker and listener that the future is meant. In the dialogue example:

 Wenn du zu Hause bleibst, kommen wir dich besuchen.
 ''If you stay at home, we shall come and visit you.''

The whole conversation is about the future, so there is no need to indicate it again in the tense of the verb.

Some more examples:

 Ich schreibe den Brief heute Abend.
 ''I will write the letter this evening.''
 
 Wir gehen nächstes Jahr nach Spanien.
 ''We will go to Spain next year.''

===Futur I===
Where the meaning would not otherwise be clear, and in more formal language, e.g. to express an intention, German talks about the future tense by using '''werden''' plus the infinitive at the end of the clause. The forms of '''werden''' are:
 ich '''werde'''
 du '''wirst'''
 er/sie/es/man '''wird'''
 
 wir '''werden'''
 ihr '''werdet'''
 sie/Sie '''werden'''

Examples:
 Ich '''werde''' ein Haus '''bauen'''.
 ''I shall build a house.'' (an intention)
 
 Wir '''werden sehen'''.
 ''We will see.''

The future can also express some inescapable fate:
 Sie '''werden''' alle '''umkommen'''.
 ''They will all perish.''

===Future II===
The Future II is formed with added &quot;sein&quot; oder &quot;haben&quot; and expresses that one action will happen before another one.
 Wenn sie das Abendessen gekocht '''haben''' wird, werden sie kommen. 
 When she will have cooked the dinner, they will come.
In the colloquial language, the perfect is often used for that.

In the colloquial language expresses the Future II often a speculation about the past. 

 Sie werden angekommen '''sein'''.
 literally &quot;they will have arrived&quot; - meaning &quot;(I gather) they have arrived (by now)&quot;

 Sie werden es gemacht '''haben'''.
 &quot;they will have done it&quot;

In the colloquial language, the ''Futur II'' is normally used when speaking about something that should have happened already, but you are not sure or you can't prove it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sentence Structure in Main clauses==

Here is the ultimate syntax guide for a main clause.  German allows a considerable amount of syntactical freedom as parts of speech are indicated through case, rather than syntax.  Nonetheless, there are conventions to follow, especially ones that reduce the ambiguity of pronouns.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Word-Order in the Main Clause'''
|-
| '''First Position''' || Anything || Used for emphasis.  Sometimes people will even put a past participle or some other verb in the first position.  You shouldn't do that until you know what you are doing.  The first position is often used for the subject (Nominative), however. 
|-
| '''Second Position''' || Conjugated Verb || &quot;habe&quot;, &quot;muss&quot;, &quot;arbeitete&quot;
|-
| '''Mittelfeld''' || Nominative Pronoun || &quot;ich&quot;
|- 
| || Reflexive Pronoun || &quot;mich&quot;, &quot;uns&quot;
|-
| || Accusative Pronoun || '''A''' &quot;dich&quot;
|-
| || Dative Pronoun || '''D''' &quot;dir&quot;, &quot;mir&quot;
|-
| || (Temporal Expressions) || Expressions of time, especially short temporal adverbs, are often placed here.
|-
| || Nominative Noun || &quot;die Katze&quot;
|-
| || Dative Noun || '''D''' &quot;meiner Mutter&quot;
|-
| || Accusative Noun || '''A = ADDA''' &quot;meinen Vater&quot;
|-
| || Prepositional Phrases || Time, Manner, Place
|-
| || Adverbs, Predicate Adjectives || Time, Manner Place
|-
| || Verbal negation using &quot;nicht&quot; || see section on negation for proper treatment of this topic
|-
| '''Final Position''' All Remaining Verbs || Separable Prefixes || &quot;Ich fange damit ''an''!&quot;
|-
| || Past Participles (conjugated verb should be either &quot;haben&quot; od. &quot;sein) || &quot;Ich habe heute nicht ''gearbeitet''.&quot;
|-
| || Infinitives || Used with modal verb as conjugated verb.  &quot;Du sollst das nicht ''tun''.&quot;
|-
| || || Used with modal-like verbs (sehen, hören, helfen, lassen) &quot;Ich höre dich ''atmen''.&quot;
|-
| || Extended verb phrases: three verbs in sentence || Build Inwards
|-
| || || Translating a hypothetical English sentence with three verbs into German, the first English verb - the conjugated verb - would be in the second position in the German sentence.  The second verb will be on the outside of the verb-phrase, at the end of the German sentence.  The third verb will be immediately before that.  Subj . 1 . [Mittelfeld] . 3 . 2.
|-
| || || &quot;Ich ''habe (1)'' seit dem Unfall nicht ''arbeiten (3) können (2)''.&quot;  &quot;I have (1) not been able (2) to work (3) since the accident.&quot;
|-
| '''Nachfeld''' || The stuff you forgot to say, or that you just thought of after saying your verb.  This happens to both native-speakers and those learning the language.  However, try to avoid it.  || This position is also used for comparisons.  See below.
|}

This is the officially-sanctioned syntax of a main clause.  However, German syntax is not written in stone.  One has considerable latitude in the way one constructs one's sentence.  Before fleshing out the topic, here are some rules, conventions, and words of advice:

1) In terms of being placed in proper syntax, the pronouns are the most important, for they are the ones most liable to ambiguity (&quot;sie&quot; = which person, what part of speech, which case?  Put it in its correct position).

2) It is not possible for a sentence to include all of the listed items, but it is still good to be able to reproduce that schema from memory.

3) You must be able to recognize an element of a sentence.  For example, you must not split something like, &quot;mit einem Buch&quot;, for that is a prepositional phrase, i.e., one and only one sentence element.  Many other sentence elements are, however, only one word.  You get a lot better at this as time goes on.

4) Two good mnemonics.  Number one: pronouns before nouns.  always.  even if it feels weird to put both your accusative and dative objects before your subject (a noun), you must get used to it.  It doesn't happen very often, though.

5) The second one is &quot;ADDA&quot; (i.e., NOT DAAD, the Deutsche Akademische Austausch Dienst).  ADDA describes, first, the pronouns (Accusative, then Dative), and then the nouns (Dative, then Accusative).  ADDA.  think ABBA, but with D's instead of B's.

6) The first position is usually your subject, but can also draw attention to something you want to discuss.

7) As will be explained below, prepositional phrases and adverbs follow the &quot;Time, Manner, Place&quot; format.

8) Beyond reducing/eliminating ambiguity, you actually do have a fair amount of freedom.  &quot;Time, Manner, Place&quot; is more a suggestion than a commandment, and most German textbooks tell you to learn the schema laid out above, but then to speak and write your sentences with items in ''ascending order of importance''.  Put the important stuff at the end.  Then you get to your verb, which gives all of the words in the sentence meaning, resulting in a crescendo of emotion and understanding.  Or not.  But you see how that might work.

9) If you speak enough, your verbs start going to the right places.  It will seem perfectly natural that the verb is in the second position, and that the other verbs are at the end.  Getting used to subordinate clauses takes more time, but eventually your words go to the right place.  Don't worry about making mistakes, but also try not to forget which verb you have waiting in your head until the sentence ends.

10) Banish the terms, &quot;subject&quot;, &quot;direct object&quot;, and &quot;indirect object&quot; from your head.  Get used to explaining things in terms of &quot;nominative&quot;, &quot;accusative&quot;, &quot;dative&quot;, and &quot;genitive&quot;.  Same goes for &quot;linking-&quot; and &quot;helping-verbs&quot;.  Start talking about modal verbs, and modal-like verbs.  

In general, you have to learn how to talk about grammar to be able to study German successfully.  

11) If you can do the declensions in your head, you can do the syntax in your head.  Syntax is easier.



==Position of the Verb==
===Clauses with one verb part - Sätze mit nur einem Verbteil===
In a main clause (Hauptsatz), the conjugated verb is in ''second position''.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellplanning=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Clauses with one verb part'''
! !! First Position (I) !! (II) !! Mittelfeld !! Punctuation
|-
| 1. || Er || geht || nach Hause || .
|-
| 2. || Heute Abend || fahre || ich mit dem Auto nach Köln || .
|-
| 3. || Im Park || machte || er einen langen Spaziergang || .
|}

''Second position'' does not equal ''second word'', as you can see above. However, there is only one group of words allowed before the conjugated verb. Such groups of words are called &quot;phrases&quot;. While you can put very long phrases in front of the conjugated verb you mustn't use two. Therefore the sentence &quot;Heute Abend ich fahre mit dem Auto nach Köln&quot; is wrong. This is a big difference between English and German syntax.

===Clauses with two verb parts - Sätze mit zwei Verbteilen===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellplanning=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Clauses with two verb parts'''
! !! First Position (I) !! (II) !! Mittelfeld !! Second Verb !! Punctuation
|-
| 4. || Der Junge || zieht || den Mantel || an || .
|-
| 5. || Der Junge || hat || den Mantel || angezogen || .
|-
| 6. || Schüler || müssen || Hausaufgaben || machen || . 
|-
| 7. || Gestern || hat || sein Vater ein fantastisches Essen || gekocht || .
|-
| 8. || Ein fantastisches Essen || hat || sein Vater gestern || gekocht || .
|}
Sometimes you have to use more than one verb part in a clause. This is true for Perfekt forms, separable verbs, modals etc. Only one of these verbs is conjugated. The conjugated verb stays in second position, the other part goes to the end.

===Clauses with three verb parts - Sätze mit drei Verbteilen===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellplanning=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Clauses with three verb parts'''
! !! First Position !! II !! Mittelfeld !! Third Verb !! Second Verb !! Punctuation 
|-
| 9. || Ich || werde || der morgen || nicht machen || können || .
|-
| 10. || Du || hast || mich || nicht besuchen || dürfen || .
|-
| 11. || Ich || kann || dir deinen Wagen übermorgen || umsetzen || helfen || .
|}

Sometimes there are even three verbs in a sentence.  These usually involve modals and perfect tenses.  The conjugated verb is in the second position.  The remaining two verbs are at the end of the clause, ''building inwards'' that is to mean, what would be the second verb in English is placed at the end, and what would be the third verb is placed before the second verb.

==Order of phrases - Reihenfolge der Satzglieder==
In English, you need the position of phrases to determine whether a noun phrase is a subject or an object. In German the cases tell you which role is assigned to a certain noun phrase. Therefore, the word order is less strict. 
===First Position - erste Position===
In neutral sentences the subject is most likely in the first position (Examples 1, 4, 5, 6).

However, you can put everything there you want to stress. This is very common with phrases about time or place (Examples 2, 3, 7). English speakers need to remember that the first position is restricted to exactly one phrase.

You can even put objects in first position (Example 8). You do it mostly, if you want to emphasize the object or if you have to repeat the sentence because your partner has not understood this particular part of it.

If the subject is not in first position, it goes directly after the conjugated verb (Examples 2, 3, 7, 8), unless preceded by a reflexive pronoun or an accusative or dative pronoun.

===Order of Phrases in the Middle of the clause - Reihenfolge der Satzglieder im Mittelfeld===

====Introduction====
In the middle of the sentence - the part between the two parts of the verb - word order is quite flexible. 

Often the word order for a neutral sentence can be described like this: 
# Time
# Objects
# Manner
# Place

The mnemonic is &quot;STOMP&quot; where S is for subject. However, when looking at wild German sentences you will find structures that do not follow these principles but are nonetheless correct. This is very frequent in spoken language. Mostly the deviation from the neutral structure is caused by a special focus. While they are not wrong, it would be inappropriate to use them all the time.  Therefore it is best to learn the principles described here. If you have mastered them and can use them without thinking about it, you can try some of the deviations.

====Time====
Time seems to be a very important concept for German speaking people. It is mostly mentioned very early in the sentence, either at the very beginning in the first position which means that the subject goes directly after the conjugated verb (i.e.: Gestern war ich im Kino) or early in the middle field (i.e.: Ich war gestern im Kino). The sentence &quot;Ich war im Kino gestern&quot; is not exactly wrong, but it would sound weird in most situations. It could be used though in a casual conversation when putting special emphasis on &quot;im Kino&quot;, but it's not the regular sentence pattern.

====Order of Objects ====

The order of objects is different for nouns and pronouns.  Pronouns always come before nouns, and reflexive pronouns come before everything except nominative pronouns.  '''ADDA''', mentioned above, is a good way to remember the prescribed order of cases for pronouns and then nouns.  As sentences can contain only two objects, here are the three possible combinations deriving from ADDA:

Two pronouns: accusative before dative (''AD'')
 I   II    Acc. Dat.       
 Ich habe  sie  ihm  gegeben.
 Ich gab   sie  ihm         .

One noun, one pronoun: The pronoun goes first, regardless of the case 
 I   II    Pronoun  Noun      
 Ich habe  ihm      die Kleider gegeben.
 Ich gab   sie      dem Jungen         .

Two nouns: dative before accusative (''DA'')
 I   II    Dat.           Acc.      
 Ich habe  dem Jungen     die Kleider gegeben.
 Ich gab   dem Jungen     die Kleider        .

====Manner====

This includes adverbs and prepositional phrases describing how, why, and by what methods the event of the sentence has taken place.

====Place====

This includes adverbs and prepositional phrases describing ''location'' and ''direction''

=== Satzglieder im Nachfeld===

In German grammar the term ''Nachfeld'' is used to describe parts of the sentence that come '''after''' the second part of the verb. The ''Nachfeld'' is neglected in most learner's grammars.  It is mostly used in spoken language, when people add something to a sentence as an afterthought or with special emphasis. In '''written language''' it is important for comparisons. You put them almost exclusively in the nachfeld.
 
Consider the example ''Peter verdient mehr Geld als Paul''' (Peter earns more money than Paul). Now try to convert the sentence to the perfect. If you follow the normal sentence structure rules you would have to write: ''Peter hat mehr Geld als Paul verdient'', but this is almost never done. The sentence best accepted by a majority of German speakers is: ''Peter hat mehr Geld verdient als Paul''. The comparison is put '''after''' the past participle.

Note that the two items being compared must be in the same case.  ''Du verdienst mehr Geld als ich''.  This is also correct grammar in English, though it is now almost obsolete among native English speakers.

== '''Syntax of Interrogatives and Imperatives''' ==

I am putting this up here for the sake of completion.

===Interrogatives===


'''Interrogatives''' (questions) change word order in the first two fields or so.  There are two kinds.  In a question based on a verb, the conjugated verb comes first.  Following that is the same string of pronouns first and nouns thereafter (and other sentence elements and finally the remaining verbs) that was detailed above.  The main difference between questions and statements is that the freedom of the first position is eliminated; the item you wanted to emphasize must now find a different position in the sentence.  The ascending-order-of-importance convention still holds.

Example:

 Q: Hast du schon &quot;Fargo&quot; gesehen?
 A: &quot;Fargo&quot; habe ich noch nicht gesehen.

The second kind of question involves a question word or wo-compound, which always comes at the beginning, and is immediately followed by the conjugated verb.  They are then followed by the remaining parts of the sentence in the order outlined above.  Be mindful of the case of the question word, and make sure never to use a wo-compound when referring to a person.

 Q: Warum hast du &quot;Fargo&quot; nie gesehen? (Why have you never seen &quot;Fargo&quot;?)
 A: Ich hatte keine Lust. (I had no interest.)

 Q: Wem hast du geholfen? (Wem = &quot;whom?&quot; in the dative case.) (Whom have you helped?)
 A: Ich habe meiner Mutter geholfen. (I have helped my mother.)

 Q: Bei wem hast du dich beworben?  (From whom have you applied [for a job]?)
 A: Beim Geschäft meines Onkels habe ich mich beworben. (I applied at my uncle's business.)

 Q: Worum hast du dich beworben? (For what did you apply?)
 A: Um eine Stelle habe ich mich beworben!  Bist du verrückt? (I applied for a job!  
 Are you insane?)

And so on.

===Imperatives===

'''Imperatives''' (commands) also slightly alter the aforementioned main-clause sentence structure.  Imperatives are formed in several ways:

 Geh', bitte!  (Please go, informal)
 Gehen Sie, bitte! (Please go, formal)
 Gehen wir, bitte! (Let's go! Within a group)

This sequence - verb in imperative form, perhaps followed by the person to whom it is directed in the nominative case (depending on the kind of imperative used, however) - is then followed by all of the other elements of the sentence, in the aforementioned order.  

German-speakers, like English-speakers and the speakers of many other languages, consider the use of the imperative mood to be rude, and, as in English, use a conditional or subjunctive construction to convey requests.  This will be dealt with in a different section of this book.

Both of these syntaxes are very easy to master once you understand main-clause syntax.

==Coordinating Conjunctions==

Before moving on to subordinate and relative clauses, we must address '''coordinating conjunctions''' and parallel clauses.  A coordinating conjunction is a conjunction that connects two clauses that are able to stand alone, i.e., two main clauses.

Here are some examples in English:

 I am here and I am glad to see you.
 You are grateful for this job, or you are a spoiled brat.

Commas are generally optional in English, whereas they used more often in German.

Here are the common coordinating conjunctions one would find in German:

 '''German'''   '''English'''

 aber     but, nevertheless, however 
 denn     for, because (rarely used in spoken German; not to be confused with ''weil'')
 oder     or 
 sondern  but rather 
 und      and

As coordinating conjunctions connect two independent clauses, they do not affect word-order in the two clauses.  The first clause is often separated from the second with a comma - especially if it is a long or complicated clause - after which follows the coordinating conjunction and the second clause.  

Here are some examples in German:

 Ich hasse und ich liebe, und ich weiß nicht warum.  (Odi et amo - Catullus)
 Ich bin nicht jung, aber ich bin froh.

There are two more constructions to be aware of: ''entweder/oder'' and ''weder/noch'', which correspond to &quot;either/or&quot; and &quot;neither/nor&quot;, respectively.

 Entweder bist du mit uns gemeinsam, oder du bist unser Feind.

''Entweder/oder'' and ''weder/noch'' can also be employed to contrast two items as well as clauses.  Note how &quot;entweder&quot; functions as an adverb.

English speakers should take note of the difference between ''aber'' and ''sondern'', both of which can be translated directly as &quot;but&quot;.  ''Aber'' means &quot;however&quot;.  ''Sondern'' means &quot;rather&quot;.  Many other languages make this distinction.

Coordinating conjunctions are rather straightforward, and the number of coordinating conjunctions is few.

==Dependent Clauses: Subordinate and Relative Clauses==

===Introduction===

'''Subordinate and relative clauses''' introduce information regarding the main clause that needs to be expressed as a separate clause.  They are collectively called &quot;dependent clauses&quot; because they are unable to stand by themselves as independent clauses.  Usually, subordinate and relative clauses occupy a part of the main clause that was not fully explained; subordinate clauses tend to fulfill more abstract missing sentence elements than relative clauses do.  Here are a few examples in English:

Subordinate Clauses:

 I know ''that you are unhappy''.
 We came ''because it was your birthday.''
 We came ''because we knew'' that you were having a rough time.

This last example has two subordinate clauses: ''because we knew'' and ''that you were having a rough time''.

Subordinate clauses are usually set off by a ''subordinating conjunction'', such as ''that'', ''because'', ''when'', ''if'', and so on.  In English, it is sometimes possible to omit the subordinating conjunction, specifically ''that'', resulting in sentences such as, &quot;I know you are unhappy,&quot; which is perfectly acceptable in English.  Such an option does not exist in German.

Relative Clauses:

 I know the person ''to whom you were talking'' (''who you were talking to'').
 God helps those ''who help themselves''.
 You are the person ''that got hit by the fly-ball at the game on Saturday.''

Relative clauses relate one element of a clause to another clause by way of a ''relative pronoun''.  The system of relative pronouns in German is considerably more extensive than that of English.

In German, both subordinate clauses and relative clauses affect syntax, in most cases by moving the conjugated verb to the end of the clause.  ''Both subordinate clauses and relative clauses are set off by a comma in German,'' which can frequently be omitted in English.  We should now examine the two types of clauses in greater detail, and then return to their syntax.

===Subordinate Clauses===

Subordinate clauses are always set off by a comma, and begin with a subordinating conjunction.    Here is a list of all subordinating conjunctions in German.  Note how all of them answer a question presumably introduced in the main clause:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Subordinating Conjunctions'''
|-
! German
! English
|-
| als
| as, when
|-
| bevor
| before
|-
| bis
| until
|-
| da
| as, since (because)
|-
|damit
|so that, with it
|-
|dass
|that
|-
|ehe
|before
|-
|falls
|in case
|-
|indem
|while; &quot;by [do]ing...&quot; See below. 
|-
|nachdem
|after
|-
|ob
|whether
|-
|obgleich
|although
|-
|obschon
|although
|-
|obwohl
|although
|-
|seit/seitdem
|since (time)
|-
|sobald
|as soon as
|-
|sodass / so dass
|so that
|-
|solang(e)
|as long as 
|-
|trotzdem
|despite the fact that
|-
|während
|while, whereas
|-
|weil
|because
|-
|wenn
|if, when, whenever
|}

Furthermore, all interrogative (question) words, such as ''wie'', ''wann'', ''wer'', and ''wo'', and wo-compounds, may be used as subordinating conjunctions.  For example:

 Ich weiß nicht, wohin er gegangen ist.  (I don't know where he went.)
 Ich weiß nicht, wie das Fest sich entwickelt hat.  (I don't know how the party turned out)
 Ich weiß nicht, warum er dir so böse ist.  (I don't know why he is so mad at you.)

Subordinate clauses provide information missing in the main clause.  Consider the previous two examples.  In both cases, the subordinate clause answered the question, &quot;what?&quot;, or what would have been the accusitive object.  Other subordinate clauses provide information that would otherwise have been provided by one of the several parts of speech.

 Er hat mich geschlagen, als meine Frau im Klo war.  (He hit me when my wife was in the bathroom.)

In this example, the subordinate clause, set off by the conjunction, &quot;als&quot;, answers the question, &quot;when?&quot;, which would otherwise be answered adverbially.

The syntax regarding subordinate clauses will be discussed later.  At this point, a property of subordinate clauses that is not altogether shared with relative clauses should be pointed out.  Subordinate clauses are themselves ''parts of speech'' for the main clause, and to a limited extent can be treated as such.  Consider the following two sentences, which are equivalent:

 Ich darf in Kanada bleiben, solange wir noch verheiratet sind.
 Solange wir noch verheiratet sind, darf ich in Kanada bleiben.

Note how, in the second sentence, the subordinate clause occupied the ''first position'', immediately followed by the conjugated verb.  In reality, the use of subordinate clauses as parts of speech integrated into the main clause is limited; they are, for aesthetic reasons, restricted to the first position and to following the main clause.  At both times they are set off from the main clause by a comma.

''Indem..., ist x passiert.''  This subordinating conjunction accomplishes the same functions as the English construction, &quot;by [do]ing something..., x happened.&quot;

 Indem er die Tür offen gelassen hat, hat er auch die Räuber ins Haus eingelassen.
 By leaving the door open, he let the robbers into the house.

By requiring a subject in the clause, the German construction is less susceptible to ambiguity than English is; consider the sentence, &quot;by leaving the door open, the robbers were able to enter the house,&quot; which is lacking an agent for the door being left open, even though such a construction is common in spoken English.

This section must make note of the differences between the words, ''als'', ''wenn'', and ''wann'', all of which can mean &quot;when&quot; in English.

''Als'' refers to a single event or condition in the past, usually expressed using the preterite tense.  

 Als du mich anriefst, war ich noch nicht zu Hause.  (When you called me, I was not yet home.)

''Wann'' is the interrogative word for &quot;when&quot;.  It's use as a subordinating conjunction is limited to indirect questions and immediate temporal events.

 Ich weiß nicht, wann er nach Hause kommen wird.

''Wenn'' is the most versatile of the three, and has several other meanings beyond its temporal meaning.  In the temporal space ''wenn'' describes, events are less recognized, or focuses on a condition, rather than an event.

Finally, &quot;wenn&quot; has one other principal function.  It also means, &quot;if&quot;, and is used in conditional and subjunctive statements.

 Wenn ich einmal reich wär', ... (If i were ever rich...)

We will return to syntax later.

===Relative Clauses===

In many ways, a relative clause is a lengthy description of an item in the main clause.  Minimally, a relative clause takes a part of speech from the main clause, known as the ''antecedent'' and uses it in the dependent clause.  What connects the two is a ''relative pronoun''.  As should already be published in this book, the following declension table is provided:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Relative Pronoun - Declension Summary'''
|-
!'''Case'''
!'''Masculine'''
!'''Neuter'''
!'''Feminine'''
!'''Plural'''
|-
|'''Nominative'''  
|der
|das
|die
|die
|-
|'''Accusative'''
|den
|das 
|die
|die
|-
|'''Dative'''
|dem   
|dem   
|der
|'''denen'''
|-
|'''Genitive'''
|'''dessen'''
|'''deren'''
|'''dessen'''
|'''deren'''
|}

Relative pronouns are similar to the definite article, with the exceptions of the dative plural and the genitive case being marked in bold.

Note that the distinctions between &quot;that&quot; and &quot;which&quot;; and &quot;that&quot; and &quot;who&quot; in English do not exist in German, where everything is described with a standard set of relative pronouns with no regard to how integral the qualities described in the relative clause are to the antecedent.

As relative clauses take one item from the main clause and use it in some way in a dependent clause, it is important to consider how relative pronouns work to avoid confusion.  All words in German possess gender, number (singular or plural), and case.  The ''main clause'', as it relates to the ''antecedent'', determines the ''gender and number'' of the relative pronoun; the ''relative clause'' determines its ''case''.

In order to use relative clauses successfully, it is critical that this point be understood.  Gender and number are &quot;inherent&quot; to the antecedent; no grammatical agent could conceivably change those properties.  The relative pronoun's case is determined by its role in the relative clause, i.e., how it relates to the other parts of speech in the clause.  Consider the following examples, all based on &quot;the man&quot;, who is masculine and singular, and apparently not well-liked.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
!'''Case of Relative Pronoun'''
!'''Example'''
|- 
|'''Nominative'''
|Der Mann, ''der'' nach Hause allein ging, ...
|-
|
|The man, ''who'' went home alone, ...
|- 
|'''Accusitive'''
|Der Mann, ''den'' mein Freund während der Hochzeit schlug, ...
|-
|
|The man, ''whom'' my friend punched at the wedding, ...
|-
|'''Dative'''
|Der Mann, ''dem'' meine Mutter kein Weihnachtsgeschenk gegeben hat, ...
|-  
|
|The man, ''to whom'' my mother didn't give a Christmas present, ...
|-
|'''Genitive'''
|Der Mann, ''dessen'' Tochter arbeitslos ist, ...
|-
|
|The man, ''whose'' daughter is unemployed, ...
|}

In each of these examples, the gender and number of the relative pronoun were determined by the antecedent, while the case of the relative pronoun was determined by its role in the relative clause.  Note particularly the genitive example, wherein the relative pronoun, meaning ''whose'', modified a feminine noun, without his gender being affected.  

Whenever you construct a relative clause, be mindful of this rule.  Don't confuse yourself with its complexity, especially regarding the genitive case.  As discussed in the chapter on personal pronouns, the word &quot;whose&quot;, as well as other possessive pronouns such as &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, and so forth, is a ''pronoun'' and not an adjective.  The pronoun always expresses the characteristics of its antecedent, viz., gender and number.

Relative pronouns offered within prepositional phrases are perfectly acceptable:

 Der Mann, mit dem meine Mutter wieder gestritten hat, ...
 The man, with whom my mother argued again, ...

However, if the antecedent is not a person, and the relative pronoun falls within a prepositional phrase, a wo-compound is frequently substituted:

 Das Flugzeug, worin ich nach Seattle geflogen bin, war fast kaputt.
 The airplane, in which I flew to Seattle, was almost broken.

Relative clauses almost invariably ''follow'' the item that they are modifying or the main clause as a whole (with the gender and number of the relative pronoun indicating - to some extent - which potential antecedent it is referring to).  Very rarely do they precede the main clause.  Exceptions to this come in the form of aphorisms and proverbs:

 Der (oder Wer) heute abend ruhig einschläft, bekommt morgen Eiskrem und Keks.  
 (He who goes to bed quietly tonight will get ice-cream and cookies tomorrow 
 - something a mother might say to her children.)

This usage is relatively unimportant.

One final property of relative clauses should be discussed.  Relative clauses in some way describe their antecedent.  The rules governing attributes in German are considerably more flexible than in English, because the German case system reduces ambiguity.  This allows the German speaker to turn a relative clause into an extended attribute, which is essentially a long adjective.  Compare the following two sentences, which are equivalent:

 Der Mann, der jede Woche auf Dienstreise nach Seattle fährt, ist krank.
 The man, who drives to Seattle every week on business, is sick.

 Der jede Woche nach Seattle auf Dienstreise fahrende Mann ist krank.
 The to-Seattle-every-week-on-business driving man is sick.

Such a construction is ludicrious in English, but not-uncommon in German.  The experienced reader of German will, with practice, be able to read through such an item without difficulty.

It would be best to review what we have learned about subordinate and relative pronouns before discussing their syntax.  Dependent clauses - both subordinating and relative clauses - modify or in some other way describe the antecedent clause upon which they are based.  Subordinating clauses provide a variety of ways in which new information can relate to the main clause, many of which are adverbial in nature (e.g., &quot;weil/because&quot;, but not &quot;dass/that&quot;, which, in the examples above, replaced the accusitive object).  Relative clauses modify and describe entities already mentioned in the main clause.  Generally speaking, only subordinate clauses have the ability to occupy the first position in a main clause.

Format:

 Main clause, subordinating conjunction + subordinate clause.
 Subordinating conjunction + subordinate clause, conjugated verb + main clause.

 Main clause including antecedent, relative pronoun based on antecedent + relative clause.

===Syntax of Dependent Clauses===

Subordinate and relative clauses have similar syntax.  Indeed, neglecting the verbs, they have a syntax similar to main clauses.  Recall the syntax described at the beginning of this chapter.  That syntax will form the basis of the Mittelfeld in dependent clauses.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

| &quot;dass&quot;, &quot;weil&quot;, &quot;obwohl&quot;, &quot;denen&quot;
|-
|'''Mittelfeld'''
|The Mittelfeld of a dependent clause follows the same syntax as the Mittelfeld of the main clause.

|-
| || Nominative Pronoun || &quot;ich&quot;, &quot;wir&quot; 
|-
| || Reflexive Pronoun || &quot;mich&quot;, &quot;uns&quot;
|-
| || Accusative Pronoun || '''A''' &quot;dich&quot;
|-

|-
| || Prepositional Phrases || Time, Manner, Place
|-
| || Adverbs, Predicate Adjectives || Time, Manner, Place

|-
| || '''Three'''
|
|-
|
|Modal/-like is ''conjugated''
|3.2.1.  Build inwards.
|-
|
|Modal/-like is ''not conjugated'' (likely the second verb)
|Conjugated verb (1); infinitive verb (3); modal verb (2)
|}


Once again, no dependent clause will contain each of these elements.  But understanding the position of pronouns is critical.  The same conventions listed under the main clause schema apply.


====Verbs in Dependent Clauses====

The way the verbs are arranged depends on the number of verbs in the verb-phrase, and the presence of a modal verb.


'''Dependent Clauses with One Verb'''

This is the simplest case.  Such a clause has one verb, conjugated based on the person and number of the subject of the sentence.  This conjugated verb is placed at the end of the clause.

{|
|'''Subordinate Clause'''
|Du weißt, dass ich dich ''liebe''.  (You know that I love you.)
|-
|'''Relative Clause'''
|Er ist ein Mann, der oft Berlin ''besucht''.  (He is a man who often visits Berlin.)
|}


'''Dependent Clauses with Two Verbs'''

A clause with two verbs has one conjugated verb and one verb in the infinitive.  Such examples are clauses in a perfect tense (wherein the conjugated verb is the auxiliary verb, either &quot;haben&quot; or &quot;sein&quot;), the future tense (&quot;werden&quot;), ones with modal verbs, and ones with modal-like verbs (sehen, hören, helfen, lassen).

In a main clause, the conjugated verb will be in the second position, and the infinitive verb will be at the end of the clause.

In a dependent clause, both verbs will be at the end of the clause, with the conjugated verb ''last''.  This supports the principle of &quot;building inwards&quot;.

{|
|'''Subordinate Clause'''
|Du weißt, dass ich dich nicht ''lieben kann''.  (You know that I cannot love you.)
|-
|'''Relative Clause'''
|Er ist ein Mann, der nach seiner absolvierten Prüfung Berlin besuchen wird.  (He is a man who will visit Berlin after his graduation exam.)
|}


'''Dependent Clauses with Three Verbs'''

Sentences with three verbs typically involve a modal verb, whose presence complicates matters terribly.  Let us think of some examples in English.

1) I am not able to help you move your car. - können - helfen - bewegen

2) I will be able to go to the store with you. - werden - können - gehen

3) I have not been able to afford that. (haben + &quot;sich (dat) etw. leisten können&quot; = to be able to afford sth.)

4) I have not been able to reach you over the phone. - haben - können - erreichen

And so on.  The problem is, after you've learned how to put your verb at the end of the sentence in a main clause, and after you've learned how to &quot;build inwards&quot; in dependent clauses, and after you've pulled your hair out, night after night, sitting in a cafe in Seattle declining relative pronouns, German grammar throws ''yet another'' rule at you, this one so pointless and downright counter-productive, and it seems like German grammar is simply making fun of you at this point, that you leap out of your seat, scream &quot;woo hoo!&quot;, and then get back to work.

The modal verb (or the modal-like verb) has to be at the end of the verb phrase, regardless of whether it has been conjugated.  In cases where it has not, the conjugated verb moves to the beginning of the verb phrase.  Let's look at our examples above.

''Du weißt, dass...''

1) ...ich dir dein Auto nicht ''bewegen helfen kann''.  This one is straightforward, because the modal verb is the conjugated verb, allowing the clause to follow the &quot;build inwards&quot; principle.

2) ...ich zum Markt mit dir nicht ''werde gehen können''.  The modal verb must come last.  No semantic or logical reason for this.

3) ...ich mir das nicht ''habe leisten können''.  The modal verb must come last.  Note here that the modal verb does not form a past participle when it has main verb to modify.

4) ...ich dich am Telefon nicht ''habe erreichen können''.  Note the somewhat sensible placement of &quot;nicht&quot;.

And so...

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Verb-order in Dependent Clauses'''
! Number of Verbs !! Placement of Verbs (always at end of clause}
|-
|'''One''' (conjugated)
|At end of Clause
|-
|'''Two''' (conjugated - modal/-like or auxiliary; infinitive)
|Build inwards. Infinitive, then conjugated verb
|-
|'''Three'''
|
|-
|Modal/-like is ''conjugated''
|3.2.1.  Build inwards.
|-
|Modal/-like is ''not conjugated'' (likely the second verb)
|Conjugated verb (1); infinitive verb (3); modal verb (2)
|}

==Infinitive Clauses==

The reader is already familiar with several types of German verbs that require other verbs; these verbs are ''modal'' verbs (''können, dürfen, wollen,'' etc.); ''modal-like'' verbs (''sehen, hören, helfen, lassen''); ''auxilliary'' verbs (''sein'', ''haben''), used for the perfect tenses; and ''werden'', used for future and passive constructions.  Another verb that can take another verb without forming an infinitive clause is ''bleiben'' (e.g., ''stehenbleiben'', to remain standing).  These verbs never form infinitive clauses, and the verbs that are used with them go at the end of the sentence.

'''Infinitive clauses''' are another kind of clause found in German, and are equivalent to infinitive clauses in English.  Consider the following examples in English:

 I am here (in order) to help you clean your house.
 The car is ready to be driven.
 I work to be able to afford my car.

Infinitive clauses are formed after verbs that do not regularly take other verbs.  They indicate purpose, intent, and meaning of the action in the main clause.  As such, infinitive clauses have ''no subject'', or no nouns in the nominative case.  Here are the above examples in German:

 Ich bin hier, um dir dein Haus putzen zu helfen.
 Das Auto ist bereit, gefahren zu werden.
 Ich arbeite, um mir ein Auto leisten zu können.

Infinitive clauses are usually found after a main clause, though it is possible for them to occupy the first position of a main clause.  They are always set off by a comma.  

Of particular interest is the construction, &quot;''um...zu...''&quot;&quot;, which corresponds to the English construction, &quot;in order to...&quot;.  ''Um'' is placed at the beginning of the clause, after which follows a standard infinitive clause.  Whereas &quot;in order&quot; is frequently omitted from English infinitive clauses of this sort, &quot;''um''&quot; is always included such clauses in German.

The Mittelfeld follows the standard syntax of main clauses, though without nominative nouns and pronouns.  At any rate, infinitive tend to be rather short.

Verbs (in the infinitive form) always come at the end, immediately preceded by the word ''zu''.  In the case of separable-prefix verbs, such a verb is written as one word, with the word ''zu'' between the prefix and the main verb; e.g. ''anzuschlagen'', ''auszugehen'', ''abzunehmen'', and so forth.  

The syntax of infinitive clauses can thus be summarized as follows:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+'''Syntax of Infinitive Clauses'''
|-
! '''Position''' !! '''Contents''' !! '''Examples'''
|-
| '''Introduction''' || Comma or Capital Letter (beginning of sentence) || &quot;,&quot;  &quot;Um&quot;

|-
| '''End''' || Either a period to end the sentence, or a comma to introduce the main clause || &quot;,&quot;; &quot;.&quot;

==Please doublecheck spelling/grammar before submitting next time! ==

I am also unsure of/confused as to the use of &quot;metrosexual&quot; in the following sentence: &quot;This guide aims to change you from the useless waste of unpoetic space there is into a '''metrosexual''' lover of Byron and Keats!&quot;
(While I understand the somewhat humourous intent, does the sentence make any sense?)
 [[User:64.229.224.182|64.229.224.182]] 03:18, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

I am further curious as to the author's original intent- is there supposed to be a Step 4? And if so, why has it been left out?
[[User:64.229.224.182|64.229.224.182]] 03:22, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

To answer both, metrosexual has been removed, and the missing Step 4 appears to be a minor error, which has been fixed. If the original author and/or someone else feels something is missing, feel free to add it in. [[User:Akademix|Akademix]] 21:23, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

==Meter needs clarification==

The author says the poem has &quot;hectameter&quot;, which means 7 feet. However, each line of the poem has 8 syllables. For the poem to have hectameter it would have to have more syllables per line, wouldn't it? Can someone please clarify this?

As you may/may not have noticed, the use of &quot;dactylic hectameter&quot; was a mere example for scansion, and precedes the poem by a section or two. Additionally, dactylic infers epic poetry, which Wordsmith did not write. You are correct, the poem is 8 syllables (iambic octameter), but the use of &quot;dactylic hectameter&quot; is not in reference to the poem. [[User:Akademix|Akademix]] 21:09 08 May 2007 (UTC)


==Please Discuss Changes Before Making Them==

An unknown recently made a plethora of edits, not necessarily bad, but some of them were arguable. I reverted the ones I am certain of, such as the use of narrator versus speaker, the latter being the preferred one in IB papers, mainly because a narrator refers to a storyteller, and quite often the texts are not stories. The unknown also changed Step 4 to Step 5, without creating a new Step 4, so I reverted it. Also made several grammar edits. A change was also made to the title of Wordsworth's 1804 poem, as it is chiefly in anthologies that it appears as &quot;I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud&quot;, with the original title being &quot;The Daffodils&quot;.

== Prose ==

Great! so we have something on poetry, what about prose now???

== Structure ==

Ok, I edited the structuring of the essay bit. I put down a better structure layout as an alternative to the less useful original. - Frenziedst00ge

== Thanks! ==

Just wanted to give my sincere thanks to those who kindly took the time to write this. It was a really useful read to me, since I have just begun learning Poetry Commentary (and to be honest, was struggling, despite being rather good in other areas of English) and I am extremely grateful indeed! Thank you!

== Step 1: Reading the Poem, issue surrounding usage of the word &quot;context&quot;. ==

In &quot;step 1: reading the poem&quot; we are instructed to &quot;...take notes about the literal and figurative context of the poem...&quot;. What exactly is meant by this sentence? When i subsequently googled &quot;Literal and figurative context&quot; i found a wikipedia article named Literal and Figurative Language (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_and_figurative_language)
outlining a method of analysis for language. This article explains how to distinguish between the usage of literal and figurative language. So my question is ultimately: By &quot;...literal and figurative context...&quot; do you actually mean &quot;Literal and figurative language&quot;?

Thank you

      <text xml:space="preserve">: Please help [[Wikibooks:Categories|categorize]] and [[WB:CCR|catalog]] books. [[Special:Prefixindex/Subject:|Subject pages]] and the &lt;tt&gt;Subject:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace are part of an ongoing effort to improve Wikibooks.

Bookshelves and departments are expected to disappear once most books can be found on subject pages. Bookshelves were historically used to list books. Bookshelves used to be in the main namespace before being moved to the Wikibooks namespace. New book suggestions once included on bookshelves were moved to [[Wikibooks:Requested books]], and {{tlx|requested books}} used in every section of every bookshelf in order to help encourage people to add their requests there instead. Departments would be created to better keep bookshelves organized. Questions were asked, such as &quot;What is the difference between departments and bookshelves?&quot;, &quot;What are the differences between bookshelves and categories?&quot;, and &quot;Is this really the best way to list books?&quot;. These sort of questions led to the creation of the &lt;tt&gt;Subject:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace and to the proposal that bookshelves and departments be done away with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players on each side. It is a bat-and-ball game.  Cricket is played between two teams of 11 players each on a field around 120 yards by 180 yards oval. One team bats while the other fields or bowls at any given time during a match. The batting team gets to place two players in the middle to score runs for the team while the fielding or bowling team tries to get the &quot;wickets&quot; by getting the batsmen out. The main implements of the game are a wooden bat for the batting player(s) and a leather ball for the fielding players.Both sides get to bat at least once during a game. There are a lot of exceptions but the major rule of thumb is the team batting second has to overhaul the first team's score.

I am just a French Londoner that enjoys reading the wikipedia and sometimes writing in it.

I have started a new book about learning the Kapampangan language, and guess how it is called? [[Kapampangan]]!

If you are a speaker of the Kapampagan language, do not hesitate to help out.

A few boxes? Well they don't work well from wikibook so I recommend that you have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lgriot if you want to know me.</text>

I used my bot to categorize all the pages in your book today. I did this on request from [[User:SBJohnny]], who asked that I categorize them to keep the book organized. Let me know if it turned out alright, and definately tell me if I made some kind of mistake. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:48, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

It's definitely nicer to have things there than here, but next time please use either &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NowCommons|PAGENAME ON COMMONS}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NowCommonsThis}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; if it has the same pagename on commons.

==Motor paced track cycling==
i'm not super sure how it works myself because i'm more familiar with keirin than six day racing.  first, in the kierin it is basically just a few laps where i think 6 riders are paced (fairly slowly) by one motorbike for the first couple, then the motorbike pulls off and everybody sprints like crazy for the last 2 or 3.

for six day, each person has their own pacer.  and i imagine that the pacer and rider have to be fairly well in tune so they can go as fast as possible without the rider getting dropped by the pacer.  what makes it really exciting is the speeds that they can go at because of the slipstream effect.  i think they can average 30-40 miles an hour for quite a distance, i read upto 50 mph somewhere! [[User:Will.law|Will.law]] 15:55, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

== Cookbookwiki ==

I looked over the site. It seems pretty, I kinda like the layout. They've given themselves a larger scope than we have with the Cookbook, including bios of famous chefs, food festivals, food columns, and interviews with contributors. It actually seems like a fairly well done idea.

They're using some Wikibooks and Wikipedia content without proper attribution. I've left a comment at one of their talk pages, and should probibly look back for a reply. It looks like everything they're posting right now is in the public domain, which again causes problems, as Wikimedia content is not public domain, and others may reuse the content from their site and not know they're infringing on our contributors' copyright rites.

I'll look around a few times, just to see what's going on, and how they're progressing. Thanks for letting me know about the site. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

== 3RR ==

Hi

Listen, the 3RR states &quot; The policy states that an editor must not perform more than three reversions, in whole or in part, on a single Wikipedia article within a 24 hour period.&quot; So don't misquote it. So what if 2 contributors disagree, that leaves just over 6 Billion people that dont, and those two will give up and move on to something else sometime soon.

A link to a breakfast talk radio show hardly meets Wiki standards ! You have to be joking...

Whilsts neither you nor I are likely to agree with the website owner, he is a qualified medical professional and the vegan child abuse trial is referenced in far better detail than elsewhere. And being &quot; horrible &quot; in the opinion of one contributor - no one or everyone is an editor here - hardly constitutes academic reason. I would say that immediately undercuts their [[credibility]].

And for the record, I have been a vegan for over 20 years known to executive members of the Vegan Society. I am just not a wussy vegan afraid to face the ugly truths and often stupidities of our peers. The best PR is honesty and bravery to face what is not attractive.

== Season Categories==
Hi, I saw you added a supercategory for the season categories and a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag to the category pages. Great work, but shouldn't that template be &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cooknav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or something for ingredients? Now they're showing up in the recipe listing, and they're not really recipes.

Ok, I thought maybe I was misremembering.  Do you know how to move the category?  [[User:Ants Go Marching|Ants Go Marching]] 02:59, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

yep, that's for sure.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/cycling/1998/tourdefrance/news/1998/08/02/drug_chronology/&quot;&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; all over again. [[User:Will.law|Will.law]] 03:07, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

== namespace formating ==

If you look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Monobook.css Wikipedia's monobook.css file], near the top, you'll see a section called /* BEGIN LIGHT BLUE SECTION */, where the default background color is set to light blue, then changed to white for the main namespace using css commands with &quot;.ns-0&quot; in the command line. The same technique could be used for the Cookbook's namespace, by using css commands that include the &quot;.ns-102&quot; (I think) for the main cookbook, and &quot;.ns-103&quot; for the cookbook talk namespace. It could also be used for more than just background colors. [[User:71.132.3.124|71.132.3.124]] 22:00, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

:oops, that was me. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:01, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, it will be cool. I've already modified [[User:Gentgeen/monobook.css|my style sheet]] to make Cookbook pages have a white background again. I'll have to look at the other things we can do with styles. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

== Gardening/cookbook linking ==

Hadn't notice that (though I had actually read a bunch of those pages). The &quot;gardening&quot; book is being replaced... it's actually just a transcription of an old (and out-of date) book. I'll make a new template for the new book, maybe something similar for linking back to the cookbook as well. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 14:51, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

:Just to give you an update: I've created a template ( ((Veggiegrowing|ARTICLE)) ) that I'm adding to ingredient pages as WmG chapters are added. I'll probably add a few pages too... Mustard Greens and Tatsoi coming soon (BTW, I'm going to add &quot;Pac Choi&quot; as a redirect to &quot;Bok Choy&quot; on the ingredients list as a way of disambigging. [[User:SBJohnny|SB_Johnny]] 17:20, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

::I left the old one because the new book doesn't yet have chapters to replace all of the ones linked in. It's also because the new book is multivolume, so it needs a different template for fruits, herbs, and vegetables in any case. [[User:SBJohnny|SB_Johnny]] 09:36, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

== Re: Cake and Dessert categories ==
Thanks for the tip, although I'm not sure what prompted it... FWIW, I also consider cake a 'morning/afternoon tea' food (like &lt;s&gt;biscuits&lt;/s&gt;cookies) as well as a dessert (which is rather a course than a meal, but I get what you're saying)... unfortunately there is quite a lot of variance in the English-speaking world regarding meals. cheers --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 13:59, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:Ah I see. Sorry, then. Feel free to revert!  I have to say I have trouble considering a cake as a dessert though. Pudding, which is surely just warm cake maybe with sauce, yes. But cold cake you eat with coffee, my brain just says no. :) --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 16:47, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

== RE COTM ==

Thanks for the head's up about the COTM. I'll look for a more appropriate image (there should be one on commons, I would hope) or else I will try to make one and upload it myself. The wording seems good so far, so i dont think it needs to get changed too too much. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:30, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I don't know if you have heard about this yet or not. We have created a new proposed policy to replace the old proposed [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] policy. This new version doesn't require hard percentages, and puts a strong focus on the idea of concensus. Your comments/questions/suggestions on this new policy would be well appreciated. I would like to put this new policy to a vote sometime next week (assuming we all stop changing it around). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:17, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for your comments. I created multiple subpages for the various versions and revisions of this policy, so that we can view them side-by-side, and pick the ones that are best. I took the liberty of copying your proposed version to [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4]]. I left you some comments about it on the [[Wikibooks talk:General voting rules/Proposal|discussion page]]. The gist of my comments are that I like your proposal, but i think it needs more prose, and It needs more emphasis on the key ideas of consensus, compromise, etc. Take a look at some of the previous versions, and see if you find any that you like. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

::I wrote out a prose-version of your policy: [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5]]. I tried to be as faithful as possible to your points, but I wanted to make it easier to read. You can feel free to edit things that you don't think are faithful to your original text. I think that wording like this, along with some small additions ([[User:Robert Horning]] proposed additional text that would allow a future increase in the minimum contribution number, and [[User:RobinH]] mentioned a few small changes) would be acceptable to everybody. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Cocktail recipes, etc. ==

Is there a spot in the cookbook for these, or should I redirect them to [[Bartending]]? (See [[Transwiki:Cookbook:Tiki_Bar_TV_recipes]] for an example... I think I've seen others as well). [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:40, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== 2 quick thoughts ==

During my roamings, I've run across other food and drink related topics, including information on drying and canning, slaughtering, commercial food service, etc. I'm wondering if these should be a mainpage category, or should they just be a how-to category. Any opinions? 

Also, does the cookbook have a cover page? I was thinking of making nicer templates for use on wikipedia using bookcovers for the gardening book, and thought it would be nice for the cookbook too (the current template (to me) seems a bit dull).

:# If they are applicable, they should be merged into the cookbook. Some of them might be better as standalone howtos, but the cookbook currently serves as an umbrella book for all food-related items.

::They're definitely stand-alones... I'll leave you some links tomorrow morning (just popping in now... have company over). 
::For the cover, I was more thinking of an image (hopefully colorful) that would replace the &quot;wikibooks&quot; icon on the WP template. I had invisioned something like an iron pan with colorful veggies or something along those lines. I've &quot;spoken&quot; with quite a few people on WP who see the &quot;wikibooks has more about...&quot; template as being along the lines of  &quot;the soviet union also has swimming pools, though of course they're not as nice as wikipedian swimming pools&quot;. Blue and grey, blah. 
::BTW: I keep thinking of adding some of my recipes to the cookbook, but they're really not very good reading. &quot;Put a bit of olive oil in a very hot iron pan, add freshly picked baby squash, aslt and pepper, cook 45 seconds, serve.&quot; Should that be a separate recipe, or should I just put that sort of thing on the &quot;ingredients&quot; page? 
::I kind of wonder in general if there should be this sort of thing somehow tied into ingredient pages: a simple way to cook up an ingredient you might not be familiar with as a way of &quot;acquiring the taste&quot;. I think it would be a good way of helping people know how to incorporate things like asian greens and such if they had a simple recipe for just &quot;taste-testing&quot;, so that they'd know how an ingredient tastes just by itself, and can then extrapolate how it will affect a &quot;whatever's in the fridge&quot; meal.

::: Basically you're suggesting that we need a custom logo for the cookbook, and you're right. I mocked one up a while back with a chef's hat and a crossed knife and fork on the wikibooks logo, but it wasn't really what I wanted. If you have any artistic inclinations, I say you should go for it and try to knock one out. Most of the other cookbook contributors (Albert, Gentgeen, etc) are inactive at the moment (and I'm not using the internets as much as usual) so we could use some new energy. 
::: We sometimes have &quot;basic preparation&quot; on ingredients pages.

See {{tl|Growit}}. I actually just chose a random image from commons (which I'll change from time to time on the template), can you think of anything that would work for the cookbook (and look good at 50px)? I'd at least like to get one going for linking to the cookbook from the garden book (also to and from the bartending book for both books).

== [[Cookbook]] Write lessons ==

I am sorry to disturb, but I have a problem. I went to the [[Cookbook]] page and then clicked to discussion. But then there opens a page, which is not like the normal discussion sides. Instead of the discussion, there is a box. I was wondering, where the normal discussion takes place? Because there was no normal discussion, I clicked to &quot;edit&quot; and wrote into the box, because of cooking lessons. Then you edited this and wrote: &quot;elaborate the lessons thing on the actual talk page, thx&quot;. I would do that, if there were one. Where is it?

Thanks for the message, and for noticing me in the sea of recent changes! I have photos ''somewhere'', but I just can't seem to find the disc copies.

Anyway, pointing those pages out to me is much appreciated, but I'm not sure how much I can contribute, since my time is already squeezed due to Wikipedia, Wiktionary and WiktionaryZ :). I principally add recipes here since I get bored of repeating them over and over to people: this way I can just give links them ;). Anyway, I've [[wikt:rabbit#verb|rabbitted]] enough.

Hi and thanks for the welcome.  I hope that I'll have the time to make some contributions here, particlarly to cookery.

:Point taken and I will vote but as the vote started 2 years ago maybe I'll do some clean up too.  Finding &quot;Paella&quot; under &quot;C&quot; is just too strange for me and I guess unhelpful for the casual reader.

Hi Ellen,

Please check your DOG RECIPE.  I find it quite objectionable that you sensationalize the &quot;killing of the dog part.&quot;

People from these third world countries have very little choice but to either kill a dog, cat, rat to survive.  Unlike you, they come from very poor countries and do not have the time or the resources to be as choosy as you are.   I find it offensive that you who campaign against pain does not even understand the violence that is brought about by poverty.  Gandhi once said that the most severe form of violence is poverty.  If you are so enlightened, then you would surely at least sympathize or commiserate w/ these people's plight.  You are a grass-consuming people-hating insensitive spoiled  ignoramus!  

== VfDs! ==

Good to have you back - have you moved or is the stress getting to you?!  I no expert on acceptability here but I think I agree.  You may fancy taking a look at Miracles while you are in the mood (&amp; of course you may want to read up on [[Future]] it kind of survived on a technicality.

If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Another DynamicPageList questions ==

Hi Kellen... long time no chat!

I have 2 questions about using DPL to make lists of plants from 2 or more categories in the garden book (and eventually on Wikiversity as well for creating a visual interface for the [[v:Bloom Clock|Bloom Clock]]).

First, I'd like to make lists that show links only as subpagenames. So for example the list that is currently generated at [[User:SBJohnny/sandbox3]] wouldn't have the &quot;A Wikimanual of Gardening/&quot; part, just the subpagenames. 

Second, I'd like it to generate pages created from other pages (for the Bloom Clock). That's more complicated though... I'll &quot;hand-make&quot; a few pages to show you examples first (I'm realizing as I write this that it's just amazingly complex). 

Any chance you can help me with this? What I'm trying to do is make the garden book searchable, so for example there can be pages that list &quot;all pink-flowered  perennial plants that bloom in spring and are hardy in zone 6&quot;. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:07, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

:: Unfortunately (1) we are using a very old version of DPL [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DynamicPageList/old this one] (2) you can't show just subpage names (3) even if you got the [http://semeb.com/dpldemo/index.php/Manual latest version] installed, you still can't show just subpage names (4) if you mean you want to create DPL-filtered list of pages from an already DPL-filtered list of pages, I think you'll just have to copy the DPL rules from the first rule into the new list rules. Hope that's clear. I can give you more of a hand if you can explain precisely what you want and what you can do/have already done yourself.

'''Momentum''' is the product of the mass and velocity of an object.  In general the momentum  of an object can be conceptually thought of as the tendency for an object to continue in its current state of motion, speed and direction.

As such, it is a natural consequence of Newtons first law. 

Momentum is a conserved quantity, meaning that the total momentum of any closed system cannot be changed. 

==Momentum in classical mechanics==
If an object is moving in any reference frame, then it has momentum ''in that frame''. It is important to note that momentum is frame dependent. That is, the same object may have a certain momentum in one frame of reference, but a different amount in another frame.

The amount of momentum that an object has depends on two physical quantities: the mass and the velocity of the moving object in the frame of reference. In physics, the symbol for momentum is usually denoted by a small '''p''' (bolded because it is a vector), so this can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}= m \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
:::where
::::'''p''' is the momentum,
::::''m'' is the mass, and 
::::'''v''' the velocity. 

The velocity of an object is given by its speed and its direction. Because momentum depends on velocity, it too has a magnitude and a direction and is a vector quantity. For example the momentum of a 5-kg bowling ball would have to be described by the statement that it was moving westward at 2 m/s. It is insufficient to say that the ball has 10 kg m/s of momentum because momentum is not fully described unless its direction is given.

==Conservation of momentum==
As far as we know, momentum is a conserved quantity. '''Conservation of momentum''' (sometimes also '''conservation of impulse''') states that the total amount of momentum of all the things in the universe will never change. One of the consequences of this is that the center of mass of any system of objects will always continue with the same velocity unless acted on by a force outside the system. 

Conservation of momentum is a consequence of the homogeneity of space.

In an isolated system (one where external forces are absent) the total momentum will be constant: this is implied by Newton's first law of motion. Newton's third law of motion, the law of reciprocal actions, which dictates that the forces acting between systems are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, is due to the conservation of momentum.

Since momentum is a vector quantity it has direction. Thus when a gun is fired, although overall movement has increased compared to before the shot was fired, the momentum of the bullet in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to the momentum of the gun in the other direction. These then sum to zero which is equal to the zero momentum that was present before either the gun or the bullet was moving.</text>

== Z Transform Mappings ==

There are a number of different mappings that can be used to convert a system from the complex Laplace domain into the Z-Domain. None of these mappings are perfect, and every mapping requires a specific starting condition, and focuses on a specific aspect to reproduce faithfully. One such mapping that has already been discussed is the '''bilinear transform''', which, along with prewarping, can faithfully map the various regions in the s-plane into the corresponding regions in the z-plane. We will discuss some other potential mappings in this chapter, and we will discuss the pros and cons of each.

== Bilinear Transform ==

The Bilinear transform converts from the Z-domain to the complex W domain. The W domain is not the same as the Laplace domain, although there are some similarities. Here are some of the similiarities between the Laplace domain and the W domain:

#Stable poles are in the Left-Half Plane
#Unstable poles are in the right-half plane
#Marginally stable poles are on the vertical, imaginary axis

With that said, the bilinear transform can be defined as follows:

{{eqn|Bilinear Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

{{eqn|Inverse Bilinear Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{(T/2) + w}{(T/2) - w}&lt;/math&gt;

Graphically, we can show that the bilinear transform operates as follows:

[[Image:Bilinear Transform Unwarped.svg|center|400px]]

=== Prewarping ===

The W domain is not the same as the Laplace domain, but if we employ the process of '''prewarping''' before we take the bilinear transform, we can make our results match more closely to the desired Laplace Domain representation.

Using prewarping, we can show the effect of the bilinear transform graphically:

[[Image:Bilinear Transform Mapping.svg|center|400px]]

The shape of the graph before and after prewarping is the same as it is without prewarping. However, the destination domain is the S-domain, not the W-domain.

== Matched Z-Transform ==

If we have a function in the laplace domain that has been decomposed using partial fraction expansion, we generally have an equation in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \frac{A}{s + \alpha_1} + \frac{B}{s + \alpha_2} + \frac{C}{s + \alpha_3} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

And once we are in this form, we can make a direct conversion between the s and z planes using the following mapping:

{{eqn|Matched Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;s + \alpha = 1 - z^{-1}e^{-\alpha T}&lt;/math&gt;

;Pro:A good direct mapping in terms of s and a single coefficient
;Con:requires the Laplace-domain function be decomposed using partial fraction expansion.

== Simpson's Rule ==

{{eqn|Simpson's Rule}}
:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{3}{T} \frac{z^2-1}{z^2+4z^1+1}&lt;/math&gt;

;CON:Essentially multiplies the order of the transfer function by a factor of 2. This makes things difficult when you are trying to physically implement the system.

== (w, v) Transform ==

Given the following system:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = G(s, z, z^\alpha)X(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Then:

:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(\alpha) = 1 - \alpha(1 - z^{-1}) + \frac{\alpha(\alpha - 1)}{z}(1-z^{-1})^2&lt;/math&gt;

And:

{{eqn|(w, v) Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;Y(z) = G(w, z, v(\alpha))\left[X(z) - \frac{x(0)}{1 + z^{-1}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

;Pro:Directly maps a function in terms of z and s, into a function in terms of only z.
;Con:Requires a function that is already in terms of s, z and &amp;alpha;.

== Z-Forms ==

*This book has recently made a great deal of progress, becoming nearly complete and an incredible source of information and background for European History.  Art has just been added, and some less important events are in the process of being added.  Over the past few days, I've also added a lot of maps, pictures, and more.  The book has been made uniform, showing the chapter title on each page, and starting with a brief albeit important introduction.  This book is certainly in every way a comprehensive text, an incredible change, since just a few weeks ago the book was a maturing text. - [[User:Ultimadesigns|Ultimadesigns]] 02:34, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

:This book is a a great study aid and has been helpful to a lot of people that I know personally.  Also, other language books have been Book of the Month.  Since Spanish is one of the languages with the highest population of Spanish-speaking people and since it is a common elective for American kids.  I believe this should be made a book of the month.  It is a wondrful source of information and should be rewarded. -[[User:Jack-o-jason|Jack-o-jason]] 7:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

The help namespace should contain useful information for beginners (and probably something for oldtimers too). This should be the Welcome, Newcomers section. At present, though, it is turned off from the sidebar and is inadequate, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:29, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

Full of red links, the page [[Help:Contents/Starting a Wikibook|How to start a Wikibook]] just says good question, really neads some work, but could be very useful.  The low qaulity at the moment probaly puts lots of new contributors off.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 14:06, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

All those players cannot be wrong!!  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 18:23, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

:This book is about a game, and as such will need to be removed shortly as it doesn't comply with the Jimbo-amended WB:WIW. Therefore it's not appropriate to have this as a collaboration here on WB. DSYoungEsq, please see if you can find another wiki to take it over - StrategyWiki has been suggested for some of these game books, though I'm sure there are others about, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:27, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

::The proposal that Wikibooks not include game manuals is not yet an accepted consequence of the general idea that this is for &quot;textbooks.&quot;  I see that the WB:WIW talk page has discussion on this; the assertion that this policy was removed from the page. Unless and until it is accepted official policy, let's leave this open to see what people think. [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:49, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

:::I know there is some small resistance to the move, but come the end of the day, what Jimbo says goes. I'm certainly sympathetic to those who wish Jimbo had spoken much earlier, when there were just a few of these books, but I do agree with the general premise that Wikibooks should be focused on textbooks and that removing the non-textbooks will improve that focus and encourage further positive development. I'm heartened that there is at least one location (StrategyWiki) and possibly another (www.gmcfoley.com) that will provide a future for these books. I wish them every success. In the meantime, until they are relocated, I think it would be wrong (and even though you do not intend it, almost like sticking two fingers up at our benevolent dictator) to nominate one of these books as a Wikibooks Collaboration of the Month, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:27, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

::::If and when the policy is implemented, then the suggestion will be removed.  In the absence of agreement to and adoption of a policy, my suggestion will remain.  I don't think this is the place to carry out a debate which seems to be being engaged between only a very few individuals, and which has other, more appropriate homes.

* First [[French]], then [[German]] now this one will be one day be the Book Of The Month. Although, for now it's under development which is definitely great. I hope one day it'll be so developed that it'll reach a standard of higher respect.
** It's awesome to see the project grow, though I think there ought to be more variance in the themes of the focus points. I'd prefer to see lots of different projects of the month than have Wikibooks only focus on languages. [[User:Dilaudid|Dilaudid]] 19:50, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Light|Light]] is the thing we define as the visible part of the spectrum of [[w:Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic waves]].

With the help of the [[w:Impulse|impulse]] of a particle and the [[w:Impulse|impulse]] of a(n) [[w:Electromagnetic wave|(electromagnetic) wave]], evidence for [[w:Light|light]] being a stream of [[w:Elementary particle|particles]] and vice versa can be found.

If we take this down to a rather low level, we can say the following. [[w:Impulse|Impulse]] = [[w:Impulse|Impulse]].
The [[w:Impulse|impulse]] of a [[w:Elementary particle|&quot;normal particle&quot;]] is defined as: ''p = m * v''.

A scientist named [[w:Louis, 7th duc de Broglie|Louis de Broglie]] found that the [[w:Wavelength|wavelength]] of an [[w:Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic wave]] can be approached with [[w:Planck's constant|planck's constant]] and the [[w:Impulse|impulse]] of the waves. The formula looks like this:

''λ = h / p

p = m*v 

λ = h / (m*v)

p([[w:Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic wave]]) = h / λ''

Coming back to the first statement, [[w:Impulse|Impulse]] = [[w:Impulse|Impulse]], we can conclude that ''h / λ = m * v'' or ''p([[w:Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic wave]]) = p([[w:Elementary particle|particle]])'' or '''[[w:Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic wave]] = [[w:Elementary particle|particle]]'''.

==What is Algebraic Geometry?==

'''Algebraic Geometry''' is a branch of [[w:Mathematics|mathematics]] that combines [[abstract algebra]] with [[geometry]] - more precisely; it is the study of algebraic objects using geometrical tools. It can be seen as a combination of [[w:linear algebra|linear algebra]] (&quot;''systems of linear equations in several variables''&quot;), and [[w:algebra|algebra]] (&quot;''study of polynomial equations in one variable''&quot; (though not exclusively)). Perhaps another description is that algebraic geometry is the study of polynomial functions and the spaces on which those polynomial functions are defined (known as algebraic varieties).

Therefore, the starting point for algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions of systems of polynomial equations:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f_i(X_1,X_2,...,X_n) = 0, i = 1,2,...,m, f_i \in k[X_1,X_2,...,X_n]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The theorems for polynomial equations depend on whether or not the field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:Algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] and whether &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; has [[w:Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.

For example, let &lt;math&gt;k = \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f (X_1,X_2,X_3) = X_1^n+X_2^n-X_3^n &lt;/math&gt;. This is [[w:Fermat's Last Theorem|Fermat's Last Theorem]] - and if &lt;math&gt;n \ge 3&lt;/math&gt; then only trivial solutions to the problem exist.

What questions can be asked of this system of polynomial equations? It is not possible in many circumstances to note all the solutions explicitly (remember that a single polynomial equation cannot be solved in general exactly if it's degree is greater than 4 - see [[w:Abel–Ruffini theorem|Abel–Ruffini theorem]]) - so most study is dedicated towards the geometrical structure of the set of solutions to these equations.

===Notation===

Throughout the book, a ring will generally be taken as a [[w:commutative ring|commutative ring]] with identity, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; will represent an algebraically closed field.

==Preliminaries==

In order to progress in the subject, we must review some results from [[w:commutative algebra|commutative algebra]] (i.e. the study of commutative rings).

==History==

The field of algebraic geometry was first developed by Islamic mathematicians, such as the Persian mathematician [[w:Omar Khayyám|Omar Khayyám]].

== System Specification ==

There are a number of different specifications that might need to be met by a new system design. In this chapter we will talk about some of the specifications that systems use, and some of the ways that engineers analyze and quantify systems.

== Steady-State Accuracy ==

== Sensitivity ==

The '''sensitivity''' of a system is a parameter that is specified in terms of a given output and a given input. The sensitivity measures how much change is caused in the output by small changes to the reference input. Sensitive systems have very large changes in output in response to small changes in the input. The sensitivity of system H to input X is denoted as:

:&lt;math&gt;S_H^X(s)&lt;/math&gt;

== Disturbance Rejection ==

All physically-realized systems have to deal with a certain amount of noise and disturbance. The ability of a system to ignore the noise is known as the '''disturbance rejection''' of the system.

== Control Effort ==

The control effort is the amount of energy or power necessary for the controller to perform its duty.

The Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864) was perhaps the bloodiest civil war in human history, a clash between the forces of the Qing Empire in China and those inspired by a Hakka self-proclaimed mystic named Hong Xiuquan, a Christian convert who had claimed that he was the new Messiah and younger brother of Jesus Christ. He and his followers established the Kingdom of Heavenly Peace (Traditional Chinese: 太平天國; Hanyu Pinyin: Tàipíng Tiānguó; Wade-Giles: T'ai-p'ing t'ien-kuo) and attained control of significant parts of southern China. Most accurate sources put the total deaths at about 20 million civilians and army personnel, although some claim the death toll was much higher (as many as 50 million according to at least one source.)

The Spanish Civil War (July 18, 1936–April 1, 1939) was a conflict in which the incumbent Second Spanish Republic and political left-wing groups fought against a right-wing nationalist insurrection led by General Francisco Franco, who eventually succeeded in ousting the Republican government and establishing a personal dictatorship. It was the result of the complex political, economic and even cultural divisions between what Spanish writer Antonio Machado characterized as the two Spains.

==Ion Exchange Chromatography==
[[Image:anion+cation exchanger2.GIF|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1. An anion and cation exchanger]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ion exchange is probably the most frequently used chromatographic technique for the separation and purification of proteins, polypeptides, nucleic acids, polynucleotides and other charged biomolecules (Ref1). The reasons for the success of ion exchange are its widespread applicability, its high resolving power, its high capacity and the simplicity and controllability of the method [http://sbio.uct.ac.za/Sbio/documentation/Ion_exchange_chromatography.pdf (Ref2)]


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just as with other forms of chromatography, ion exchange chromatography utilizes both a stationary and mobile phase. The stationary phase in this method carries either a positive or negative charge. The charged stationary phases are named according to the types of charged particles that bind to them. 


The stationary phase for anion exchange consists of a synthetic polymer (resin) which contains many positively charged functional groups, typically quaternary ammonium ions. Negatively charged species are attracted to the resin and travel more slowly down the column.  Similarly, positively charged species are attracted to a cation exchange resin's negatively charged functional groups. Sulfonate groups are commonly found as side-chains in cation-exchange resins.  The stationary phases are available as granular material or beads, but prepacked column are now readily available : [http://www.gelifesciences.com/aptrix/upp01077.nsf/Content/Products?OpenDocument&amp;ParentId=702507&amp;moduleid=166664 GE HealthCare], [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Brands/Aldrich/Tech_Bulletins/AL_142/Sephadex_Products.html Sigma-Aldrich], [http://www.rohmhaas.com/ionexchange/  Rohm and Haas], [http://www.ion-exchange.com/ Sybron Chemicals], [http://www.edvotek.com/pdfs/243.pdf Edvotek Ion Exchange Chromatography Kit], [http://www.bio-rad.com/B2B/BioRad/product/br_category.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0521625230.1147406709@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccccaddhkghhhihcfngcfkmdhkkdfll.0&amp;divName=Process+Separations&amp;loggedIn=null&amp;serviceLevel=null&amp;lang=English&amp;csel=null&amp;catLevel=4&amp;catOID=-13554&amp;isPA=false&amp;categoryPath=Catalogs%2fProcess+Separations%2fIon+Exchange%2fIon+Exchange+Chromatography Bio-Rad]. The particles that bind to the stationary phase can be released by changing the buffer conditions.

==Charge On Protein==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The charge on the protein affects its behavior in ion exchange chromatography. Proteins contain many ionizable groups on the side chains of their amino acids including their amino - and carboxyl - termini. These include basic groups on the side chains of lysine, arginine and histidine and acidic groups on the side chains or glutamate, aspartate, cysteine and tyrosine. The pH of the solution, the pK of the side chain and the side chain’s environment influence the charge on each side chain. The relationship between pH, pK and charge for individual amino acids can be described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is described in detail elsewhere:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In general terms, as the pH of a solution increases, deprotonation of the acidic and basic groups on proteins occur, so that carboxyl groups are converted to carboxylate anions (R-COOH to R-COO-) and ammonium groups are converted to amino groups (R-NH3+ to R-NH2). In proteins the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH &gt; pI, a protein has a net negative charge and when the pH &lt; pI, a protein has a net positive charge. The pI varies from protein to protein.  This is the reason ion exchange is useful for separating proteins.  If a buffer containing more than one protein is used with an anion exchange resin, the the most negatively-charged protein will be most attracted to the stationary phase and will therefore elute last and the protein with the highest positive charge will elute first.

==Stages in Ion Exchange Chromatography==

The Ion Exchange process can be separated into four basic stages (Res1):

# Equilibration
# Application of sample
# Elution
# Regeneration

[[Image:iex.png]]

===Equilibration===
This stage involves setting up the desired starting conditions so that the system is ready for the ion exchange process. In this step the a buffer with the desired conditions is applied, and all of the charged group in the stationary phase are associated with ions of the opposite charge. When this process in complete, equilibrium has been reached.

===Application of Sample===
In this step, the sample is applied to the stationary phase. Only proteins carrying a charge opposite to the stationary phase will bind to it while those with the same charge or no charge will not bind. These unbound particles will wash out during this stage. In the chromatogram above, protein A never binds to the stationary phase and washes out forming the first peak.

===Elution===
This step involves changing the buffer conditions to particles that have bound to the stationary phase. There are several different ways to do this. One option is to change the pH of the buffer solution. As mentioned before, when the pI of a protein  is the same as the pH of a solution, the net charge of the protein will be zero. Therefore, when the buffer solution's pH reaches the pI of the protein, the protein's net charge will be zero. The protein will no longer bind to the stationary phase and will be released and washed out. Another method to elute the bound protein is to increase the salt concentration. As the salt concentration of the buffer increases, salt ions replace the bound protein. Proteins with weaker ion interactions will be released at lower salt concentrations. Proteins with stronger charges will have a higher affinity for the stationary phase and will remain bound to the column longer. In the chromatogram depicted above, protein B is released due a change in the conditions. The red line indicates some gradient applied to the system. When protein B is released, a second peak is created.

===Regeneration===
This step simply involves removing all bound protein from the stationary phase so that it is ready for another process.

==Anion and Cation Exchangers==

===Anion Exchangers===
[[Image:Anions.gif|thumb|right|600px|Figure 2. Anion Exchanger - [http://www.proteinchemist.com Proteinchemist.com]]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While the resin involved with an anion exchanger is positively charged, anion exchangers are named so because of their affinity to anions.  To effectively bind proteins, the pH of the buffer in the system must be greater than the isoelectric point of the protein of interest, as proteins are negatively charged above their isoelectric point.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anion exchangers can be classified as either weak or strong.  The charged group on a weak exchanger is a weak base that easily loses its charge at a high pH due to deprotonation.   On the other hand, strong anion exchangers are comprised of a charged group that is a strong base.  Strong anion exchangers are able to maintain their positive charges across a variable pH range while weak anion exchangers tend to lose their charge as the pH increases.  Examples of anion exchangers include the strong anion exchanger Q (quaternary resin), and the weak anion exchanger DEAE (diethylaminoethane).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Typically, the chromatography is performed using buffers at pH's between 7 and 10 and running a gradient from a solution containing just this buffer to a solution containing this buffer with 1M NaCl [http://www.proteinchemist.com/tutorial/iec.html (Res1)]. The salt (in solution) competes for binding to the stationary phase, thus releasing the protein from its bound state. Proteins separate because the amount of salt needed to compete varies with the external charge of the protein. Anion exchange chromatography have been successfully used to clean up of a crude slurry, separation of proteins from each other, concentrating a protein, and the removal of negatively charged endotoxin from protein preparations [http://www.proteinchemist.com/tutorial/iec.html  (Res1)].




	'''Ion exchange in practice.''' 
In order to elute an unknown protein via ion exchange, a gradient of different concentrations of salt with appropriate buffer is required to test at which salt concentration our desired protein is eluted. In the case of anion exchange, DEAE is used to pack our column. A buffer, such as Bis-tris, used to equilibrate, wash and elute. A syringe pump is commonly used to pump various buffer solution via the column. 
Before an ion exchange, target protein is first equilibrated in Bis-tris buffer. Some protein might precipitate in Bis-tris hence solubility could be a potential problem during ion exchange. The column is first equilibrated with buffer with no salt. One salt commonly used is sodium chloride. Buffers that contain gradually salt concentration is prepared, such as 50mM NaCl, 100mM NaCl, 150mM NaCl, etc. At last, a 1M NaCl buffer is used to completely clean up the column. All buffer needs to have their pH adjusted because protein are pH sensitive. 
As the diagram as suggested, fractions of increasing salt gradient are collected. After all fractions are collected, samples are taken to run an SDS page. With the gel, we can tell at which salt concentration our protein was eluted, and how well the separation is. 
The testing scale does not require a lot of protein mixture. In large scale protein purification, salt containing buffer can start rather high as an effective wash. Samples will be taken from all fractions to track our purification.

===Cation Exchangers===
[[Image:Cations.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 3. Cation Exchanger - [http://www.proteinchemist.com Proteinchemist.com]]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cation exchangers are named for their ability to attract cations or positively charged particles.  In this case, the resin of the chromatography system is negatively charged and proteins will bind if the buffer pH is less than the protein’s unique isoelcetric point.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just as with anion exchangers, cation exchangers can be classified as either weak or strong.  A weak cation exchanger is comprised of a weak acid that gradually loses its charge as the pH decreases, while a strong cation exchanger is comprised of a strong acid that is able to sustain its charge over a wide pH range.  Carboxymethal groups are used commonly as weak cation exchangers, while sulfopropyl groups are widely used as strong cation exchangers [http://www.rit.edu/~pac8612/webionex/website/html/ione0ni1.html (Res1)]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Designing a Cation Exchange Separation===
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Selecting the correct resin and buffer is critical as it determines the binding properties of proteins to the resin. In cation exchange, the protein of interests needs to be positively charge to bind to the negatively charged stationary phase. Suppose we have a mixture of the 
following protein :

{| width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| &lt;strong&gt;Protein&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;pI&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;pH 4.8 cm&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;pH 7.2 cm&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;pH 8 cm&lt;/strong&gt;
|-
| Carbonic Anhydrase
| 7.0
| +16.5
| -0.4
| -2.7
|-
| Carboxypeptidase B
| 6.2
| +12.0
| -3.3
| -6.3
|-
| Chymotrypsin
| 8.0
| +9.0
| +2.7
| 0.0
|-
| Lysozyme
| 9.8
| +14.1
| +7.9
| +6.9
|-
|}


*At pH 4.8 cm all protein will bind to the cation exchanger, with carbonic anhydrase binding the strongest to the stationary. If elution is performed at this pH, the protein will elute in the order of chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase B, lysozyme, and carbonic anhydrase. 

*At pH 7.2 cm, cm, carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase B will elute in the wash (before the gradient is initiated), followed by chymotrypsin, then lysozyme during the salt gradient.

*AtpH 8 cm, only the lysozyme will bind to the stationary phase, the other three proteins will elute in the wash.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is also possible to refine the salt concentration in solvents A and B so that the more weakly bound proteins will wash off the column in the wash, even if they are positively charged. For example, if you modify pH 4.8 cm to have 0.1 M NaCl in solvent A and 0.2 M NaCl in solvent B, you find that the most weakly bound protein (chymotrypsin) elutes in the wash, while the other three elute in the gradient.

===Molecular Exclusion===
[[Image:molecular_exclusion_chromatography.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Figure 1. Molecular exclusion column - Larger molecule move faster as they are excluded from the beads. Smaller molecules have to travel through the beads causing them to move slower.]]


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Molecular Exclusion / Gel Filtration / Gel Permeation / Size Exclusion is one of the simplest mechanism for separating molecules. This method separates proteins based on their size. The stationary phase is packed with porous bead with a range of pore sizes. When a mixture of protein is introduced into the column, a range of protein from small, intermediate and large will be filtered through the column 
*Small proteins can fit inside any pores and enter many pores before reaching the end of the column. Thus the movement of small proteins are greatly impeded which cause them to elute last in SEC.
*Intermediate size protein may fit in some pores but not in all. These protein will generally elute somewhere between the small size and large size protein.
*Large size proteins cannot enter the beads. Their movements in the column are not impeded by beads which make them the first protein to be eluded from the column.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In practice, gel filtration can be used to separate proteins by molecular weight at any point in a purification of a protein. It can also be used for buffer exchange - a protein dissolved in a sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, can be applied to a gel filtration column that has been equilibrated with tris buffer, pH 8.0. Using the tris buffer, pH 8.0, as the mobile phase, the protein moves into the tris mobile phase as it travels down the column, while the much smaller sodium acetate buffer molecules are totally included in the porous beads and travels much more slowly than the protein.

==Resolution in Molecular Exclusion Chromatography==

Achieving high resolution protein separation depends mainly on two factors:

#Sufficient selectivity: creating conditions that create enough space between sample zones
#Sufficient efficiency: counteracting &quot;zone broadening effects&quot;

The resolution can be expressed in the following formula:
&lt;math&gt; R = \frac{Vr1 - Vr2}{(W1 + W2)/2}&lt;/math&gt;

Vr1 and Vr2: the elution volumes of two adjacent peaks. Vr2-Vr1 therefore represents the distance between two peaks.

W1 and W2: the widths of the peaks

[[Image:resolution.png]]

===Achieving Sufficient Selectivity===

The numerator of the Resolution formula represents the selectivity or the distance between two different curves in a chromatogram. When the distance is too short, two adjacent curves may start to merge resulting in an adequate separation of the two proteins. The selectivity is controlled by two factors: the selectivity of the actual medium, and the length of the column.

Different mobile phase medium have different selectivity curves. Some mediums provide high selectivity while others provide lower selectivity. The medium chosen usually reflects the type and size of the proteins being separated. 

The length of the column also has an effect on the selectivity. Molecular Exclusion does not involve any gradients; therefore, the molecules will move down the column at a fairly constant rate. If two molecules are traveling at different rates, increasing the travel distance will subsequently increase the distance between the two molecules. Increasing the column length is one method that can improve resolution. One caveat to this, however, is that as the column lengthens, the sample zones broaden. This zone broadening effect will counteract some of the gained resolution.

===Achieving Sufficient Efficiency===

Increasing the efficiency involves counteracting zone broadening effects. Ideally all of the sample of a specific protein should reach the end of a column at the same time; however, several factors have an effect on the level of zone broadening that occurs. The two most significant ones are: uniformity in beads, and bead size and flow rate.

It is essential to have uniformity in the beads in a column. Irregularities will can different parts of a sample to travel down the column at different speed. The range of time over which the sample reaches the eng of the column becomes large which is not ideal.

==Affinity Chromatography==
[[Image:affinity2.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 1. Affinity Chromatography Column ]]
Affinity chromatography is a biochemical method designed to separate proteins from a mixed sample. It is one of the most commonly used techniques as it is very selective and effective at isolating proteins. The technique relies on unique interaction between a molecules with a ligand bounded to the matrix. Affinity chromatography have been used in a variety of applications, several types of matrix are readily available and can be purchased at various vendors. These matrices include interaction between:

{| width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| &lt;strong&gt;Molecule&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;Ligand&lt;/strong&gt;
|-
| Antigen
| Antibody
|-
| Enzyme
| Substrate
|-
| Receptor
| Ligand
|-
| Nucleic Acid Binding Protein
| Nucleic Acid
|-
| Polysaccharide, glycoprotein
| Lectin
|}

Affinity chromatography has been successfully performed with a number of protein tags, one of the most common application is the use of poly-histidine tag. Extracting a protein from a gene product can be difficult task; one strategy that is commonly employed is to engineer a poly-histidine tag near the end of the gene. Typically, the histidine tag is relatively short and does not interfere with protein conformation. In affinity chromatography, the poly-histidine tag will bind to the nickel resin in the column.

Developing an effective affinity chromatography method involves:

#Finding a ligand that is specific enough
#Finding suitable conditions for binding between the target protein and the ligand as well as release the protein.

==Stages in affinity chromatography==

The affinity chromatography process can be separated into 3 main stages:

#Equilibration
#Application of Sample
#Elution

===Equilibration===
The first step in affinity chromatography is to prepare a stationary phase by immobilizing one of the two recognized components on an insoluble hydrophobic polymer such as agarose.

===Application of Sample===
A crude mixture containing the other recognized component is then applied to this stationary phase. Only those that are attracted to the stationary phase will bind to the column, the rest will simply be washed through the column. The success of this portion of the experiment is highly dependent on the target molecule's ability to sufficiently bind to the ligand. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) is a value that quantifies the strength of the bond between the target protein and its ligand. The lower the K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value, the stronger the bond. K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; values between 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; are ideal for binding of the target molecule to the stationary phase.

If the K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value is too high, there will be leakage of the target protein. If the K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value is too low, the target protein will bind too strongly. This may result in &quot;irreversible&quot; adsorption to the stationary phase. Although in this case, the adsorption is not truly irreversible, the necessary elution conditions may be very harsh and may destroy the protein's ability to function. 

During a wash step, which often includes a high concentration of salt to overcome weaker recognition interactions, all proteins except those that bind tightly to the stationary phase are eluted.

===Elution===
[[Image:freeligand.png|thumb|500px|Figure 2. One way to elute the bound protein is to introduce free ligand that will bind to the target molecule]]
[[Image:competingProt.png|thumb|500px|Figure 3. The bound protein can be eluted by introducing another protein that will outcompete the target protein and bind to the ligand]]

The wash is followed by an elution step in which a soluble form of the immobilized ligand is used to displace the bound protein from the stationary phase.

Since only the specific target sample can bind to the stationary phase, no fine-tuned elution gradient is necessary. In affinity chromatography it is possible to simply switch from binding conditions to release conditions immediately.

There are two possible ways to elute the target molecule from the stationary phase:

#Change the K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value from low to high. Ideal K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; values for elution are usually between 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. The K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value can be altered by changing conditions such as the salt concentration, pH, temperature etc.
#Add a competitor that will displace the target protein from the ligand. This can involve adding free ligand that will bind to the target protein and wash out with the protein, or can be a competitor that binds to the ligand  and in place of the target protein (Figures 2 and 3).

==Target Molecules==

There are three groups of target molecules that can be used in affinity chromatography:

#Specific binding based on Biological Activity: These include receptor binding sites, antibody binding sites,and enzyme active sites. These are used with their naturally occurring ligands or analogues of these ligands. It is possible to use these to separate groups of molecules if and analogue to a ligand has broad specificity.
#Prosthetic groups that occur in nature: An example of this is polysaccharides. This is usually only useful in performing group separations.
#Molecules engineered to contain an affinity tag: Examples of common tags are GST (Glutathione-S-Transferase) or proteins with accessible histidine residues. These affinity tags are almost always engineered into recombinant proteins for the purpose of separation.

==Ligands==

[[Image:spacerarm.png|thumb|right|500px|Figure 4. When preparing the stationary phase ligand, it is often necessary to include a spacer arm to avoid possible interference with binding ]]

When using ligands that are mono-specific, it is difficult to find a commercially produced matrix specific for each case. Companies often sell &quot;activated gels&quot; that have active residues ready to be coupled to ligands. Ligands that are used in group-specific chromatography experiments are usually available commercially because they are more widely applicable.

Smaller ligands may result in some problems. One problem that may arise is steric interference. Another problem that may occur is blocked access to the ligand as illustrated in Figure 4. A spacer arm can solve this problem.

==Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Immobilized metal ion/Metal Chelate affinity chromatography is separation technique that is based on coordinate covalent binding between proteins and metal ions. Proteins have a wide variety of amino acids composition which, in effect, generates a range of different affinities towards metal ions.  However, not many naturally occurring proteins have affinity for metal ions, so the technique is mainly used to purify recombinant proteins. For example proteins can be engineered to contain a poly-histidine tail (histidine can generally act as a ligand towards divalent metal cations). If the stationary phase is immobilized with divalent metal cations, a mixture of proteins can be separated based on their ability to interact with the metal ions. Those proteins containing a higher number of histidine residues would be able to bind to the column more tightly than those with fewer histidine residues.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Several different types of immobilized metal ion column have been developed to separate various proteins (e.g. Fe, Co, Cd, Ni, or Zn). Protein separation in IMAC generally depends on the strength of the metal ion-protein bond. Thus, choosing the type of immobilized ion is crucial to the success protein separation. By far the most widely-used technique is to use an immobilized nickel column, and to engineer poly-histidine tags of six or more residues onto the recombinant proteins of interest.
One thing to keep in mind is that the binding between metal ion and protein must be reversible, allowing elution of bounded protein at later steps. Three different elution strategies can be applied to IMAC competitive elution, stripping elution and pH Adjustment [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16223503&amp;dopt=Abstract (Ref1)].

==Reversed Phase==
[[Image:reversedphase.PNG|thumb|right|500px| Reversed Phase Chromatography - Proteins with exposed hydrophobic region (red) will be able to bind to the immobilized hydrocarbon stationary phase; the rest simply wash off]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Reverse Phase chromatography is a separation based on the solubility of the protein. The term ‘reverse’ was derived from its predecessor named ‘normal’ phase chromatography, which utilized a polar stationary phase such as silica.  In reverse phase, the stationary phase is packed with silica modified with silyl ethers containing non-polar alkyl groups typically C8 or C18. This creates a hydrophobic stationary phase. The mobile phase on the other hand, contains relatively polar organic solvents such as methanol, butanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16503625&amp;query_hl=16&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum (Ref1)]. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Utilization of these polar solvents introduces very harsh conditions for the protein, thus the method will generally work well for smaller and more stable proteins. All peptides and proteins carry a mix of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids, but those with high net hydrophobicity will be able to participate in hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase. As mixtures of proteins are applied to the column, polar proteins will elute first while non-polar proteins will bind to the column. Elution of the bound hydrophobic protein can be accomplished by increasing the concentration of organic solvent, which increases the retention time of a particular component.  Reverse phase chromatography is commonly coupled with mass spectrometry in an effort to quantify the protein that is eluted from the column [http://www.chemistry.adelaide.edu.au/external/soc-rel/content/expts/hplcexpt.htm (Res1)].

==Stages in Reversed Phase Chromatography== 

The stages in Reversed Phase Chromatography are very similar to the stages found in Ion exchange Chromatography. Once again, the process can be summarized in four steps[http://www4.amershambiosciences.com/aptrix/upp00919.nsf/Content/281C4717F50A3605C1256E92003E865D?OpenDocument (Res2)]:

#Equilibration
#Sample Application
#Elution
#Regeneration

===Equilibration===
In this step the hydrophobic column is primed by applying the specific sample buffer. Because the column is hydrophobic, water molecules tend to be ordered at the junction between the column and the buffer.

===Application of the Sample===
In this step, the sample protein is injected into the system. Proteins in the mixture that have a high percentage of exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues will be adsorbed to the hydrophobic stationary phase. Other proteins in the mixture will be washed out.

===Elution===
This stage in the process involves changing the buffer conditions to elute the bound hydrophobic protein. The most common way to do this is to use a gradient that slowly increases the hydrophobicity using an organic buffer. The order in which proteins are desorbed is usually relative to the number of external hydrophobic residues each protein has (Res 3).

===Regeneration===
This stage involves washing off any remaining protein from the stationary phase and returning the conditions back to the way they were at the start of the process. This involves creating a less hydrophobic environment.

==Example==

Here is a sample diagram of a reversed phase separation run for 80 minutes, reaching a 70% organic solvent level with three elution peaks. [[Image:ReversePhase1.jpg]]

Note the gradient delay in this diagram. The delay is common to all liquid chromatography gradients, and is caused by a delay in the software telling the gradient to start pumping, and the solvent reaching the column. Also note the organic solvent concentration doesn't start at 0%. This is because the bonded hydrocarbons are much less efficient at binding to other hydrophobic molecules without a small amount of organic solvent present.

'''Optimization'''

In order to see greater peak separation, you can run the same proteins again for a shorter period of time, or lower the maximum amount of organic solvent. Using the above diagram, it appears that the last protein elutes at about 50% organic solvent concentration. After taking into account the delay, the last peak elutes and an adjusted 40% organic solvent concentration. A new separation can then be done, using a 40% maximum organic solvent concentration, which would generate much more widely separated peaks.

==Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC)==
[[Image:Hic.gif|thumb|right|500px|Figure 1. Common HIC Stationary Phase Molecules [http://www.rit.edu/~pac8612/webionex/website/html/ione8ho9.html RIT Ion Exchange Site] ]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography is a separation technique that uses the properties of hydrophobicity to separate proteins from one another.  In this type of chromatography, hydrophobic groups such as phenyl, octyl, or butyl, are attached to the stationary column.  Proteins that pass through the column that have hydrophobic amino acid side chains on their surfaces are able to interact with and bind to the hydrophobic groups on the column. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;HIC separations are often designed using the opposite conditions of those used in [[Proteomics/Protein_Separations_-_Chromatography/Ion_exchange|ion exchange chromatography]].  In this separation, a buffer with a high ionic strength, usually ammonium sulfate, is initially applied to the column. The salt in the buffer reduces the solvation of sample solutes thus as solvation decreases, hydrophobic regions that become exposed are adsorbed by the medium.
[[Image:hicsalt.png|thumb|right|500px|Figure 2. The diagram illustrates how an increase in salt concentration can result in enforced hydrophobic interactions]]

The more hydrophobic the molecule, the less salt needed to promote binding [http://www.bio-rad.com/B2B/BioRad/product/br_category.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0655054085.1146799058@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cccfaddhjklfdfkcfngcfkmdhkkdfll.0&amp;categoryPath=%2fCatalogs%2fLife+Science+Research%2fChromatography+%7c+Protein+Purification%2fChromatography+Media%2fHydrophobic+Interaction&amp;divName=Life+Science+Research&amp;loggedIn=null&amp;lang=English&amp;country=null&amp;catOID=-31139&amp;isPA=false&amp;catLevel=5&amp;serviceLevel=null (Res1)]. To elute the proteins, the salt concentration is gradually decreased in order of increasing hydrophobicity. Additionally, elution can also be achieved through the use of mild organic modifiers or detergent [http://www.bio-rad.com/B2B/BioRad/product/br_category.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0655054085.1146799058@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cccfaddhjklfdfkcfngcfkmdhkkdfll.0&amp;categoryPath=%2fCatalogs%2fLife+Science+Research%2fChromatography+%7c+Protein+Purification%2fChromatography+Media%2fHydrophobic+Interaction&amp;divName=Life+Science+Research&amp;loggedIn=null&amp;lang=English&amp;country=null&amp;catOID=-31139&amp;isPA=false&amp;catLevel=5&amp;serviceLevel=null (Res1)].

The stationary phase is designed to form hydrophobic interactions with other molecules. These interactions are too weak in water. However, addition of salts to the buffer result in hydrophobic interactions. The following is a list of salts that increase  hydrophobic interactions in the order of their ability to enhance interactions:

#Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
#K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
#(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
#NaCl
#NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl
#NaBr
#NaSCN

Although reversed phase chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography are very similar, the ligands in reversed phase chromatography are much more hydrophobic than the ligands in hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This enables hydrophobic interaction chromatography to make use of more moderate elution conditions, which do not disrupt the sample nearly as much.

==Two Dimensional (2D) Chromatography==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Separation of highly complex mixture can be a very difficult task. The mixture can be distributed according to their molecular mass, chemical composition, fuctionality and architecture (Res 5). A single chromatography experiment may be inefficient in separating our proteins of interst. In 2D chromatography, different techniques are essentially combined to achieve a higher degree of separation. This can be done by an offline technique, where the result of one chromatography is injected manually into a second column chromatography or an online method, where the two colums are directly coupled through switches. [http://chemeducator.org/sbibs/s0002006/spapers/26sve897.pdf (Ref 6)]. 

2-D chromatography is considered a complement to 2-D electrophoresis. While 2-D electrophoresis separates proteins based on Isoelectric point and size, 2-D chromatography can use many different combinations of properties for separation. There are many different types of 2D chromatography, these include:

*Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (Mud-PIT)
Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) is a separation technique which utilized two chromatography techniques back to back and can be coupled to silica capillary [http://www.chemsoc.org/ExemplarChem/entries/2002/proteomics/mudpit.htm (Res1)]. Typically the [http://www.chemsoc.org/exemplarchem/entries/2002/proteomics/images/mudpit_ms.gif column] consist of strong cation exchanger (SCX) followed by reversed phase (RP) material. One of the advantages of MudPIT is that band broadening are minimized and the capillary can easily be coupled directly with a mass spectrometer. The [http://www.chemsoc.org/exemplarchem/entries/2002/proteomics/images/mudpit.gif strategy] initially involves denaturing the protein complex into small peptides. The samples are then loaded to strong cation exchanger (SCX) column subsequently followed by reversed phase column. A capillary can be set up to stream line the process with a mass spectrometer. [http://www.chemsoc.org/exemplarchem/entries/2002/proteomics/images/mudpit_2dplot.jpg 2D plot image from MudPIT]
*Affinity-Reverse Phase
*Size Exclusion Chromatography-Reverse Phase
*Size Exclusion Chromatography-Ion Exchange Chromatography
*Ion Exchange Chromatography-Reverse Phase

2-D chromatography is growing in popularity (Res 2) as an alternative to 2-D electrophoresis. It is good for separating proteins that have a more extreme range of pIs or a large range of molecular weights. A nice advantage of 2-D chromatography is that it can be coupled to a mass spectrometry device directly. In electrophoresis, the samples must be cut from the gel for retrieval.

An example of a setup utilizing 2D Chromatography can be seen below: &lt;br&gt;

'''Introduction to Electrophoresis'''

__TOC__
==Definitions==
e•lec•tro•pho•re•sis (ĭ-lĕk'trō-fə-rē'sĭs) n. {{ref|AM1}}&lt;br/&gt;
1) The migration of charged colloidal particles or molecules through a solution under the influence of an applied electric field usually provided by immersed electrodes. Also called cataphoresis.&lt;br/&gt;
2) A method of separating substances, especially proteins, and analyzing molecular structure based on the rate of movement of each component in a colloidal suspension while under the influence of an electric field.  

&lt;br/&gt;
an•a•lyte (a-nə-līt) n. {{ref|MW1}}&lt;br/&gt;
A chemical substance that is the subject of chemical analysis.

==Electrophoresis Theory==
Separation by electrophoresis depends on differences in the migration velocity of ions or solutes through a given medium in an electric field. The electrophoretic migration velocity of an analyte is:

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v_p = \mu_p E&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

where E is the electric field strength and &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is the electrophoretic mobility.

&lt;br/&gt;
The electrophoretic mobility is inversely proportional to frictional forces in the buffer, and directly proportional to the ionic charge of the analyte. The forces of friction against an analyte are dependent on the analyte's size and the viscosity (η) of the medium. Analytes with different frictional forces or different charges will separate from one another when they move through a buffer. At a given pH, the electrophoretic mobility of an analyte is:

&lt;math&gt;\mu_p = \frac{z}{6\pi \eta r}&lt;/math&gt; 
 
where r is the radius of the analyte and z is the net charge of the analyte. 

&lt;br/&gt;
Differences in the charge to size ratio of analytes causes differences in electrophoretic mobility. Small, highly charged analytes have greater mobility, whereas large, less charged analytes have lower mobility. Electrophoretic mobility is an indication of an analyte's migration velocity in a given medium. The net force acting on an analyte is the balance of two forces: the electrical force acting in favor of motion, and the frictional force acting against motion. These two forces remain steady during electrophoresis. Therefore, electrophoretic mobility is a constant for a given analyte under a given set of conditions.{{ref|BIO}}

==Applications of Electrophoresis==
Electrophoresis has a wide variety of applications in proteomics, forensics, molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology.

One of the most common uses of electrophoresis is to analyze differential expression of genes. Healthy and diseased cells can be identified by differences in the electrophoretic patterns of their proteins. Proteins themselves can also be characterized in this way, and some sense of their structure can be derived from the masses of fragments inside the gel. {{ref|Twyman}}

There are many different types of electrophoresis, and each can be used for something different. Two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis, for example, has the ability to discern many more proteins than most of its contemporaries. Many of these methods will be discussed in detail throughout this chapter.

===What Will Proteomics Gain from Microfluidic?===

Proteomics contributes significantly to the discovery of proteins and their functions that influence the behaviors of an organism.  Recent studies have focused on its roles to explore the proteins in a single cell and tissue level as they represent a fingerprint for each individual especially in terms of how a disease exhibits.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2008&gt;Herr AE, Hatch AV, Giannobile WV, Throckmorton DJ, Tran HM, Brennan JS, Singh AK. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2572166 &quot;Integrated microfluidic platform for oral diagnostics&quot;] ''Ann NY Acad Sci. Author manuscript'' available in PMC (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to a limited amount of sample from a single cell or tissue, the study of proteome in these levels becomes a big challenge for a regular benchtop instrument.  To facilitate this level of study, a microfluidic technology is introduced and developed into an essential tool for proteomics.

In addition to the capability to handle small sample, the microfluidic technology plays an important role in miniaturizing the entire system.  As a result, a better performance in terms of less material consumption, faster processing time, more automated, and lower cost can be achieved.  Another advantage in such microscale is that the mixing between the sample and reagents becomes more effective.&lt;ref name=Xu_X_2008&gt;Xu X, Li L, Weber SG. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1832263 &quot;Electrochemical and optical detectors for capillary and chip separations&quot;] ''Trends Analyt Chem. Author manuscript'' available in PMC (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  A certain chemical process that usually takes hours can be completed in minutes.  This benefit allows the microfluidic-based immunoassay to be used to monitor the progress of disease.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2008/&gt;  And, with a reduction in cost, the microfluidic device becomes a perfect candidate for many point-of-care applications.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007&gt;Herr AE, Hatch AV, Throckmorton DJ, Tran HM, Brennan JS, Giannobile WV, Singh AK.

===Electrophoresis in Microfluidic Microsystems===

Incorporating biotechnology with microfluidic makes a manipulation of very small volume of biological fluid not only feasible, but also effective especially by means of electrophoresis.  Recent research and development efforts have been focused on inventing an electrophoretic microsystem that is fully automated, easy to customize for a specific need, and provides the results consistent with the gold standard.  This microfluidic microsystem is usually referred to as a lab-on-a-chip.  Among the microfluidic microsystems used in the analytical (bio)chemistry, the most widely used methods to control the transport of biomolecules or analytes are either gel or capillary electrophoresis.

Even though both techniques utilize the fact that biomolecules such as proteins, peptides, and DNA become charged in a buffer, the microfluidic gel electrophoresis operates differently from its capillary counterpart in terms of fluid dynamic.  In microfluidic gel electrophoresis, the presence of porous gel medium prevents a bulk flow in a microfluidic channel.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;  On the other hand, the bulk flow becomes an engineering factor that influences the electrokinetics of the analytes as the presence of electroosmotic flow needs to be considered as well in microfluidic capillary electrophoresis.&lt;ref name=Gong_M_2008_1&gt;Gong M, Wehmeyer KR, Limbach PA, Arias F, Heineman WR. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2442013 &quot;On-line sample preconcentration using field-amplified stacking injection in microchip capillary electrophoresis&quot;] ''Anal Chem. Author manuscript'' available in PMC (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Gong_M_2008_2&gt;Gong M, Wehmeyer KR, Stalcup AM, Limbach PA, Heineman WR. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2442562 &quot;Study of injection bias in a simple hydrodynamic injection in microchip capillary electrophoresis&quot;] ''Electrophoresis. Author manuscript'' available in PMC (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the analytical viewpoint, their electrophoretic separation methods are also different.  The gel-based electrophoretic separation of biomolecules is based on the difference in size or molecular weight, while the capillary-based electrophoresis separation operates by taking the advantage of the difference in charge-to-mass ratio among biomolecules. 

In comparison to the gold-standard methods, the analytical results obtained from the microfluidic gel and capillary electrophoresis are consistent with those from the traditional slab gel &lt;ref name=Hsieh_JF_2007&gt;Hsieh J-F, Chen S-T. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2399892 &quot;Comparative studies on the analysis of glycoproteins and lipopolysaccharides by the gel-based microchip and SDS-PAGE&quot;] ''Biomicrofluidics'' '''1''' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and capillary electrophoresis &lt;ref name=Guzman_NA_2009/&gt;, respectively.  In the design and application viewpoints, however, there are some advantages and disadvantages of these two methods needed to be considered.  In terms of engineering design, the microfluidic gel electrophoretic system is much easier to customize for specific applications and multiplexing since no influence from the bulk flow needs to be considered.  This makes it more straightforward to integrate extra features like sample preprocessing into the microfluidic gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;  Nevertheless, since the gel-sieving medium is not required in the capillary-based microsystem, the reusability of the microfluidic capillary electrophoretic device is much higher than the gel-based counterpart.  In terms of bio(analytical) applications, the microfluidic capillary electrophoresis has a drawback such that it operates poorly to analyze the charged particles of similar charge-to-mass ratios.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;  It is worth noting that some microfluidic capillary electrophoretic system is capable of direct interface with mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name=Guzman_NA_2009/&gt;

In this chapter, the device fabrication process, basic principle of operation, and some clinical applications of both microfluidic gel and capillary electrophoresis are described in detail.   Even though this chapter is dedicated mainly to the microfluidic electrophoresis, the integration of additional features like sample preprocessing, detection, and quantification processes are also included.  Unquestionably, this integration is made possible by the microfluidic technology.

===Microfluidic Gel Electrophoresis===

Utilizing microfluidic technology in gel electrophoresis provides several advantages to the study of proteome in many ways that cannot be achieved by the conventional methods. Faster processing time, more sensitive detection, more automated operation, and highly integrated system are the major benefits of using microfluidic. In addition, the microfluidic technology allows gel electrophoretic system to be easily customized for a specific application. For example, a microfluidic gel electrophoretic system can be designed such that off-chip processing can be eliminated. In fact, it can be integrated into the microfluidic-based system. The integration of sample preparation is one of the practical examples that not only simplify the experiment protocol, but also improve the detection sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2008/&gt; 

This section is dedicated to a customized microfluidic gel electrophoresis for immunoassay applications.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; The important aspects such as the fabrication process, principle of operation, and clinical applications will be discussed in detail.


====I. Fabrication Process====

Gel electrophoresis can be customized for a specific analytical study such as an immunoassay by using microfluidic technology.  The customized fabrication process of microfluidic gel electrophoretic immunoassay to be described below is based on the device used by Herr et al.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2008/&gt; &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;  In their study, an antibody was used as a reporter to detect the presence of a particular protein as an antigen, potentially a disease biomarker. A step-by-step fabrication process is described as follows.


[[Image:uCEI_Step_1.png|right|thumb|200px|Step 1: Fabrication of size-exclusion membrane &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Step 1: Fabrication of Size-Exclusion Membrane'''

&lt;u&gt;Materials&lt;/u&gt;:

#Degassed 22% (15.7:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (6% bis-acrylamide cross-linker)
#0.2% (w/v) VA-086 &lt;ref name=VA_086&gt;Wako Chemicals ( http://www.wakousa.com/specialty/specialty_focus.html )&lt;/ref&gt; (photoinitiator)
#1X Tris/glycine buffer

The first component of the microfluidic gel electrophoretic immunoassay to be fabricated is a size-exclusion membrane.  This membrane is used to enhance analyte concentration, thus improving sensitivity of detection.  A polyacrylamide gel is utilized to fabricate this membrane.  It is designed such that the polyacrylamide gel has a pore size small enough for selectively allowing analyte molecules smaller than 10 kDa to pass through. The fabrication process begins with patterning a glass substrate to create microfluidic channels and chambers. This process is carried out by using regular photolithography and wet etch. Holes are drilled on the top glass cover. Both glass substrate and cover are then bonded together by anodic bonding. After the microfluidic structure is created, a solution of degassed 22% (15.7:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (6% bis-acrylamide cross-linker) and 0.2% (w/v) VA-086 is introduced into the channel, as shown in the diagram. A syringe can be used to load the solution into the channel. The gel precursor solution is left for equilibration for approximately 30 minutes.

The size-exclusion membrane is fabricated using laser photo-polymerization. A 355-nm UV laser sheet is used to pattern the polyacrylamide gel at the specified location, shown in the diagram, to create the membrane profile. The polyacrylamide gel membrane is exposed to the laser until polymerized, which takes approximately 15 seconds. The remaining gel solution is vacuumed out, and the channels are then cleaned by rinsing with buffer.


[[Image:uCEI_Step_2.png|right|thumb|200px|Step 2: Fabrication of separation channel &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Step 2: Fabrication of Separation Channel'''

&lt;u&gt;Materials&lt;/u&gt;:

#Degassed 8% (37.5:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (2.6% bis-acrylamide cross-linker)
#0.2% (w/v) VA-086 &lt;ref name=VA_086/&gt; (photoinitiator)
#1X Tris/glycine buffer

After the size-exclusion membrane is fabricated, the next step is to construct a separation channel. This separation channel is the place where protein separation takes place. It contains a medium porosity polyacrylamide gel. Like the membrane, the separation gel is fabricated by photo-polymerization. To fabricate the separation channel, the separation gel precursor solution is carefully loaded into the microfluidic channel by a syringe. The gel solution is composed of the degassed 8% (37.5:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (2.6% bis-acrylamide cross-linker), 0.2% (w/v) VA-086 photoinitiator, and 1X Tris/glycine buffer. The gel loading direction is indicated by the arrow shown in the diagram. The gel is loaded up to the specified location to define the separation channel.

Gel uniformity is a very important factor for the repeatability in the analysis. To guarantee uniformity, all microfluidic channels on the separation side of the membrane must be filled with gel before polymerization. Therefore, a gel plug is created to prevent the gel leakage during the subsequent gel loading. As shown in the diagram, the gel plug is fabricated by photo-polymerization such that the area not to be polymerized is protected by a dark-field mask. Usually, the photo-polymerization process takes about 10 minutes using a 100-Watt UV source.


[[Image:uCEI_Step_3.png|right|thumb|200px|Step 3: Fabrication of loading channel &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Step 3: Fabrication of Loading Channel'''

&lt;u&gt;Materials&lt;/u&gt;:

#Degassed 3.5% (37.5:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (2.6% bis-acrylamide cross-linker)
#0.2% (w/v) VA-086 &lt;ref name=VA_086/&gt; (photoinitiator)
#1X Tris/glycine buffer

In this step, the remaining microfluidic channels (without gel) on the separation side of the membrane are carefully filled with gel precursor solution as indicated by the arrow shown in the diagram. The solution contains the degassed 3.5% (37.5:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (2.6% bis-acrylamide cross-linker), 0.2% (w/v) VA-086 photoinitiator, and 1X Tris/glycine buffer. This gel solution will generate a polyacrylamide gel with large pore size and define the loading channels.

After both separation and loading channels are filled with gel, the whole microfluidic device is exposed to UV for 15 minutes. As a result, the separation and loading gels are polymerized and define separation and loading channels, respectively. This microfluidic device is now ready to use.


[[Image:uCEI_Final.png|right|thumb|200px|Complete microfluidic gel electrophoretic device &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Complete Microfluidic Device'''

The diagram shows the complete microfluidic gel electrophoretic device after fabrication. The device contains polyacrylamide gels with three different pore sizes. The gel with largest pore size is used in the loading channels to facilitate the electrophoresis of the sample and reagents by preventing bulk flow. The gel with intermediate pore size is used in the separation channel for protein separation. Finally, the gel with smallest pore size is used as a size-exclusion membrane for the enrichment process. The detail descriptions about their functions will be covered in the section entitled &lt;u&gt;Principle of Operation&lt;/u&gt;.

In the device design, all the loading channels are connected to the loading areas, which are holes drilled at the beginning (before anodic bonding). The sample and reagents are loaded into there. In addition, some holes are used as reservoirs for waste collection. These are the places to which the electric current flows. It is worth noting that in addition to being the loading areas, they are also used as the insertion points for electrodes, which are connected to a programmable supply voltage source.

When not in use, this microfluidic gel electrophoresis device must keep submerging in the buffer and store at 4°C.


====II. Principle of Operation====

Based on the same principle of electrokinetic transport of charged molecules, the microfluidic gel electrophoresis works similarly to the regular slab gel electrophoresis, but with much faster processing, more sensitive detection, and highly automated-integrated systems. In this section, the fundamental operation of the microfluidic gel electrophoresis will be discussed using the microfluidic structure described in the previous section.

The microfluidic gel electrophoretic system to be discussed consists of a structure containing microfluidic channels/reservoirs, power supply, and fluorescence detection system. The channels and reservoirs used to transport the analyte are designed such that they are filled with large pore size polyacrylamide gel.  This large pore size gel facilitates the electrokinetic transport of the analyte by preventing the bulk flow.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; The power supply is designed so that it is programmable. A pair of electrodes and their polarities can be assigned instantaneously. This provides a much better control over the electrokinetic process only attainable in microfluidic environment. Also integrated into the system is the fluorescence detection capability. It is used to detect the analyte of interest and quantify its concentration.

In this section, a step-by-step operation procedure including the principle behind each step will be discussed, assuming that the target analytes are negatively charged. Note that the discussion will mainly focus on the immunoassay application, which is more generalized to the study by Herr et al.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; A little modification can be made to the system to be used in other applications.


[[Image:uCEI_PO_1.png|right|thumb|200px|Electrokinetically loading fluorescently-labeled reporter &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Loading a Reporter of Known Concentration'''

As a tool for immunoassay study, a reporter specific to a particular protein of interest is used. Acting like a receptor with high affinity for a target protein, an antibody can be used as the reporter for the detection of protein or antigen being investigated. Without loss of generality, the term reporter will be used throughout this section.

To begin using the device, the microfluidic channels need to be filled with buffer solution. Then, the reporter solution of known concentration together with sample solution is loaded into the designated reservoir. Typically for the microfluidic device, the volume required per analysis is roughly in the order of a few tens of microliters. For the purpose of detection and quantification, the reporter is usually labeled with fluorescence tag. The detection and quantification methods will be discussed in detail later.

After the fluorescently labeled reporter is loaded, a pair of electrodes connected to the reporter and sample waste reservoirs are activated as shown in the diagram. The electric potential is then applied across both electrodes. As the reporter molecules become charged in the buffer, they are electrokinetically moved toward the sample waste reservoir as indicated by the red arrows. The reporter molecules, however, are blocked by the size-exclusion membrane, which allows only particles of size less than 10 kDa to pass through. In this loading step, only the ionic buffer can penetrate the membrane. At the end of this first electrophoresis, the increasing number of the fluorescently labeled reporter molecules gathers at the membrane on the gel side as shown in the inset.


[[Image:uCEI_PO_2.png|right|thumb|200px|Electrokinetically loading a sample &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Loading a Sample Containing Analyte of Interest'''

The next process is to load the sample electrokinetically to combine with the reporter, which already gathered at the membrane. Like the reporter, the analyte molecules become charged in the buffer. To begin the electrophoresis, the electrode contacted to the reporter reservoir is deactivated. The electrode contacted to the sample reservoir is switched on instead. The potential across these two electrodes causes the charged molecules of proteins in the sample to move electrokinetically toward the sample waste reservoir as indicated by red arrows.

Once the charged molecules of the analyte arrive the membrane, some of them whose size less than 10 kDa pass through the membrane and are collected in the sample waste reservoir. Only the larger molecules including the protein of interest stay on the gel size of the membrane as shown in the inset. This process helps increase the concentration of the analyte, improving the probability of binding between the reporter and target protein. However, the non-target proteins become more concentrated as well and might cause a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio level. Using the reporter of high binding specificity can alleviate this problem.  It is worth noting that the sensitivity and dynamic range of the microfluidic gel electrophoretic immunoassay depend on this enrichment process.

It needs to be designed carefully so that the electrophoresis occurs long enough so that more reporters and the target proteins are bound together. Normally, the concentration of the reporter used is much higher than that of the target protein. As a result, all the target protein molecules would be more likely to be detected by the reporter molecules. At the end of this second electrophoresis, the reporter and its complex including the remaining non-target proteins stay on the gel side of the membrane.


[[Image:uCEI_PO_3_New.png|right|thumb|450px|Switching electrodes to avoid running electric current through the membrane during electrophoretic separation &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Avoid Running Electric Current Through Membrane During Separation'''

It has been reported that the gel electrophoretic separation experienced irreproducible results when running the electric current through the membrane.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; Therefore, it is necessary to avoid applying the electric potential across the membrane especially during the separation process. One possible solution is to program the power supply such that the electrodes are switched before the target analytes enter the separation gel. The diagram shows the switching process that satisfies this requirement.

According to the diagram, the electric potential is initially applied across the membrane just to transport the analytes away from the membrane. Before the analytes enter the separation gel, the electrode at the upper left buffer reservoir is deactivated. At the same time, a new electrode with the same polarity at the upper right buffer reservoir is turned on. It can be seen that the flow of negatively charged analytes remains in the same course toward the buffer waste reservoir.

It is worth noting that there are other combinations of electrodes that can be used to perform this step as well. The concept is simply not to allow electrophoresis to occur across the membrane during the separation step. At the end of the third electrophoresis, all charged molecules are ready for the gel electrophoretic separation.


[[Image:uCEI_PO_4.png|right|thumb|200px|Electrophoretic separation of unbound reporter and its complex detectable by laser-induced fluorescence &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Gel Separation'''

In this step, the reporter molecules and their complex are separated by means of gel electrophoresis. The process continues by electrokinetically carrying the charged molecules into the separation gel. Since the reporter molecules and their complex have similar charge-to-mass ratio, the separation between these two species is based only on the difference in their molecular weights (MWs). It is worth noting that all non-target proteins are not investigated in this immunoassay.  Only the reporter molecules and their complex are under examination.

Since the reporter molecules are labeled with fluorescent dye, a single-point laser can be used to induce the fluorescence. This laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is monitored by a detector that will detect the presence of the unbound reporter and its complex, and then relate the intensity of the detected fluorescence to the concentration of both species. This fluorescence detection system is placed across the separation channel near the buffer waste reservoir. The concepts of detection and quantification are described next.


[[Image:uCEI_PO_5.png|right|thumb|200px|Fluorescent detection, electropherogram, and gel-like plots &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt;]]

'''Fluorescence Detection and Results'''

The single-point laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is a mean used to detect and quantify the reporter molecules and their complex. When the molecules across the laser beam, the attached dyes emit fluorescence whose intensity is measured by the detector. The detector then generates the electropherogram corresponding to the measured intensity. The area under the electropherogram peak can be related to the concentration of the target protein.

The unbound reporter can be distinguished from the complex based on the fact that the unbound reporter molecule has lower molecular weight (MW) than its complex. Therefore, the unbound reporter molecules travel electrokinetically faster in the separation gel and are detected first. The corresponding intensity gives the first peak in the electropherogram.

In case of a single pair of ligand and receptor, there will normally be two peaks in the electropherogram. Usually the first peak belongs to the receptor or reporter of smaller MW, followed by the second peak corresponding to the ligand-receptor complex of larger MW. This information can also be represented by gel-like plots, which are computer-generated. In the gel-like plots, the topmost band represents the unbound reporter molecules that arrive first. The brightness of the band conveys the information about the degree of fluorescence intensity detected. The width of the band corresponds to the width of the peak, which conveys the information about the migrating time of the analyte.

It is worth mentioning that the probability of binding between both receptor and ligand is a significant factor to the sensitivity and accuracy of the immunoassay. Therefore, the enrichment process plays an important role in raising this probability. To enhance this enrichment process, either preprocessing the sample (off-chip) or increasing the period of the electrophoretic sample loading is proven to be useful.


====III. Clinical Applications====

One of clinical applications reported was the use of this microfluidic gel electrophoretic device in assisting oral diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2008/&gt; &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; It was used for early diagnosis of the periodontal disease and to monitor the disease state and its development from human saliva. Periodontal disease or periodontitis is a putative oral disease that destroys collagen and causes a major tissue damage, connective tissue attachment loss, and bone loss. Found in the periodontitis patient saliva were matrix metalloproteinase-8 ([http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2OY4 MMP-8]), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B), and C-telopeptide pyridinoline cross-links (ICTP). These proteins were identified as disease biomarkers and became the target proteins for detection and monitoring this oral disease.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2008/&gt; Herr et al. demonstrated the detection and quantification of MMP-8 using this microfluidic gel electrophoretic device.

In their study, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies monoclonal antibody] for MMP-8 was used as a reporter, which had the specificity for binding only to the MMP-8 in the saliva. The use of this monoclonal antibody (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;MMP-8) had an advantage in that it eliminated the need for a matched pair antigen-antibody. In the reporter mixture, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein standard was also added as a reference. Both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;MMP-8* and BSA* were fluorescently labeled for the detection purpose. Note that the asterisk is used to denote the fluorescently labeled analyte. According to their study, 1 nM of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;MMP-8* and 1 nM of BSA* were used in the mixture.

In the microfluidic device, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;MMP-8* bound only to MMP-8 biomarker forming a complex of similar charge-to-mass ratio. The unbounded antibody and its complex were separated from each other by the separation gel based on the difference in their sizes and detected individually as described in the &lt;u&gt;Principle of Operation&lt;/u&gt; for microfluidic gel electrophoresis. In this immunoassay application, the BSA* with the highest mobility was detected first, followed by the remaining &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;MMP-8* and MMP-8 complex, respectively. The corresponding peaks were shown in the electropherogram and gel-like plots. The peak area or the width of the band in gel-like plot was used to calculate the concentration of MMP-8.

To be able to quantify the concentration of the endogenous MMP-8 in the saliva sample collected from the patients, a calibration curve was required to be generated first. The calibration curve was obtained from the analyses of known MMP-8 concentrations. A series of experiments were performed by adding known concentrations of the recombinant MMP-8 in the diluted saliva from healthy patients and then running the microfluidic gel electrophoresis. From the electropherogram, the peak areas of the MMP-8 complex were normalized with the peak area of BSA* and then plotted against the corresponding concentrations. A nonlinear least-squares fitting method using a four-parameter logistic model &lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; was used to obtained the calibration curve. Based on this calibration curve, the concentration of the endogenous MMP-8 complex was predicted from its normalized peak area. It was reported that the average concentrations of the MMP-8 in the healthy and disease subjects were 64.6 +/- 16.4 ng/mL and 623.8 +/- 204.0 ng/mL, respectively.&lt;ref name=Herr_AE_2007/&gt; It is worth noting that the concentration of MMP-8 in the patients classified as periodontally diseased exhibited the dynamic activity of the disease.

The validity of the results obtained from the microfluidic gel electrophoresis was verified by comparing with those obtained from the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA ELISA]). As reported by Herr et al., the results obtained from the microfluidic device were highly correlated with those from ELISA with r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.979, where r is Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. This microfluidic-based immunoassay, however, had several advantages over the conventional counterpart in that it bypassed the time-consuming reaction and washing steps required by ELISA, was more automated, required only single antibody making it applicable for wider range of applications, and needed much less amount of saliva sample per analysis.  In addition, it did not require surface immobilization of the antibody.

In addition to measuring the concentration of MMP-8 in the periodontitis patients, a clinical examination was also performed to correlate the analytical data with physiological symptoms. It was found that MMP-8 was highly correlated with bone and tissue loss, but having no correlation with bleeding upon probing. With highly sensitive detection of MMP-8 biomarker, this microfluidic-based immunoassay could provide early diagnosis that would improve the clinical treatment of this disease. Furthermore, with the use of MMP-8 inhibitor to reduce collagen degradation, it was promising that this microfluidic gel electrophoretic device could be used to monitor and track the progress of MMP-8 inhibitor therapy as well.

===Microfluidic Capillary Electrophoresis===

In this section, another type of microfluidic electrophoresis will be described.  Unlike microfluidic gel electrophoresis, microfluidic capillary electrophoresis operates on the principle of electrokinetic of bulk flow.  The difference in charge-to-mass ratio of analytes is the fundamental of electrophoretic separation in capillary microfluidic channel.  Without the need of sieving medium, the microfluidic capillary electrophoresis becomes more favorable than its gel counterpart in terms of the ease in fabrication and reusability.  The detail fabrication process and principle of operation including clinical applications of this device are described as follows.  Note that the fabrication process and principle of operation explained below are based on the published work by Backofen et al. 2002.&lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008&gt;Backofen U, Matysik F-M, Lunte CE. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2519826 &quot;A chip-based electrophoresis system with electrochemical detection and hydrodynamic injection&quot;] ''Anal Chem. Author manuscript'' available in PMC (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;


====I. Fabrication Process====

The fabrication of microfluidic structure using PDMS is easier and much less expensive than using glass.  The process begins with creating a master for molding the PDMS, which can be obtained by patterning a photoresist.  After developing, a mixture of PDMS and cross-linker is poured over the patterned photoresist and then cured.  The PDMS is peeled out and cut to create an access to the reservoir.  In the final step, this patterned PDMS is attached permanently to a glass base and ready to use.  The detail step-by-step procedure is described below.


[[Image:UCE_Fab_Step1.png|right|thumb|200px|Diagram describing a fabrication process to create a master for PDMS molding using negative photoresist and standard photolithography &lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;]]

'''Creating a Master for PDMS Molding'''

&lt;u&gt;Materials&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;

#Photomask
#4-inch silicon wafer
#SU-8 50 negative photoresist
#Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate developer

Beginning with a preparation process, a photomask is created first.  The photomask used is usually a contact photomask that can be made of glass or simply a transparency with the designed microfluidic structural layout printed on it.  The photomask is used to transfer this microfluidic pattern on to a photoresist, which is spin-coated onto a silicon wafer.  It is worth noting that the choice of photoresist to be used affects the design of photomask.  For example, if using the negative photoresist, all the microfluidic patterns need to be designed using clear field so that the UV light can go through and polymerize the contact areas of the negative photoresist.  The unexposed areas will be washed away in a developer.  On the other hand, the designed patterns are the dark field of photomask for the positive photoresist.

Before coating the photoresist, the silicon wafer is needed to be cleaned first.  A standard RCA cleaning process is applicable.  Then, the negative photoresist is spin-coated on the silicon wafer and pre-baked.  Exposing under the UV light, the coated negative photoresist is patterned with the designed microfluidic layout from the photomask.  The exposed photoresist is then post-baked and developed.  As a result, only the exposed areas of the negative photoresist remain as shown in the diagram.

'''Molding PDMS to Fabricate Microfluidic Structure'''

&lt;u&gt;Materials&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;

#PDMS oligomer
#Sylgard 184 cross-linker

After the master for PDMS molding is ready, a mixture of PDMS and cross-linker is prepared.  A 10:1 ratio of the polymer and cross-linker is applicable.&lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;  The degassed mixture is then poured onto the wafer to cover the entire photoresist master.  Finally, the molded PDMS is cured in the oven at 70 °C for 1 hour.&lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;  This process step is summarized in the diagram.  In addition, a cross-sectional view of the PDMS molded on the wafer is also provided.

After curing, the PDMS is peeled out of the wafer.  The PDMS with the transferred microfluidic structure is further processed by creating an opening for each circular reservoir region.  This opening will be used to load sample or reagent and a place to apply vacuum and pressure, which is regulated by a syringe.

'''Finalize Microfluidic Capillary Electrophoretic Device'''

&lt;u&gt;Materials&lt;/u&gt;:

#Glass plate
#Needle probe

A glass plate with coated patterned electrodes is used to enclose the microfluidic channels and reservoirs, and at the same time, provides electrical connections to the fluid in reservoirs.  The electrodes can be fabricated on glass substrate by means of evaporation of chrome and platinum.  Chrome is used as an adhesive layer between glass substrate and platinum electrodes.  The patterning of the metals can be achieved by a regular photolithography, which requires another photomask (a transparency), to form the electrodes on glass.  It is worth noting that a combination of patterned electrodes and needle probe is used in the final microfluidic capillary electrophoretic system as shown in the diagram.  The platinum needle probe is used to supply high electric potential for electrophoretic purpose and simultaneously as an electrochemical sensor.

The PDMS is permanently attached to the glass plate by oxidation using plasma.  A covalent bonding between oxygen and silicon atoms (O-Si-O) provides a permanent seal between both materials.  The complete microfluidic capillary electrophoretic device is shown in the diagram.


====II. Principle of Operation====
In general, the operation of microfluidic capillary electrophoretic device can be described by three fundamental steps – loading sample/reagents, forming sample plug, and electrophoretic separation.  The loading process described here involves manual loading using syringes to regulate the flow.  After all sample and regents are loaded, a sample plug is formed.  This step needs to be designed carefully since the concentration of the analytes relies on this step.  In the last step, the analytes are separated electrophoretically.  Unlike the size-based separation in the (microfluidic) gel electrophoresis, the separation by (microfluidic) capillary electrophoresis is based on the differences in charge-to-mass ratios of the analytes.

It is worth noting that the microfluidic capillary electrophoretic system being discussed here is used as an analytical platform where all the sample preprocessing steps are performed off-chip.  The following description focuses mainly on the analysis of negatively charged analyte in the sample.  Note that the principle of operation described below is based in part on the published work by Backofen et al. 2002.&lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;


[[Image:UCE_PO_1.png|right|thumb|200px|All microfluidic channels filled manually and equilibrated by electrophoresis &lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;]]

'''Loading Process'''

The system setup begins with loading the microfluidic reservoirs with a buffer and preprocessed sample solution such that all the reservoirs except the sample reservoir contain the buffer.  Continuing with filling the microfluidic channels with buffer, syringes are connected to the top openings of the reservoirs and used to regulate the flow.  Vacuum and pressure are applied until the channels are filled with the buffer.

The next process is to equilibrate the sample and buffer by means of electrophoresis.  To do so, the high voltage sources are connected to the system as shown in the diagram.  One possible configuration is the use of multiple supply units such as two units of U1 = 0.5 kV and a single unit of U2 = 1.2 kV.  This process allows the buffer and sample to localize in the channels as shown in the diagram.


[[Image:UCE_PO_2.png|right|thumb|200px|Sample solution flowing through the small connecting channel and entering the channels leading to the buffer and buffer waste reservoirs &lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;]]

'''Forming Sample Plug'''

For the sample to be analyzed, a predefined and controllable portion of the sample needs to be injected into the separation channel.  This predefined and controllable portion of the sample is referred to as a sample plug.  According to the microfluidic structure being discussed, the sample plug is formed by a hydrodynamic flow of the sample solution due to the difference in the solution levels in the reservoirs.  This hydrodynamic flow only occurs when all the high voltage sources are switched off.

As depicted by the diagram, the portion of sample solution flows through the small connecting channel into the channels leading to the buffer and buffer waste reservoirs.  This sample portion can be divided into two ports indicated by blue and yellow dashed outlines as shown in the inset.  The blue outline is the sample plug whose volume can be specified by design.  The yellow dashed outline indicates the portion of the sample that will flow back toward the sample waste reservoir when switching the high voltage sources back on.


[[Image:UCE_PO_3.png|right|thumb|200px|Sample plug electrokinetically moving along the separation channel toward the buffer waste reservoir &lt;ref name=Backofen_U_2008/&gt;]]

'''Electrophoretic Separation'''

When switching on all the high voltage sources, the negatively charged analyte molecules and buffer ions start to flow again by electrophoresis.  At the small connecting channel, the portion of sample solution begins to split into two parts and then move away in the opposite directions.  As depicted in the inset, the part of sample solution indicated by blue-dashed outline, or the sample plug, electrokinetically moves along the separation channel toward the buffer waste reservoir.  On the other hand, the part of sample solution outlined by the yellow dashed line electrokinetically move away toward the sample waste reservoir.  The small connecting channel is then filled by the buffer as occurred originally.

In the separation channel, the negatively charge analytes in the sample plug are separated due to the differences in their charge-to-mass ratios.  Each analyte is detected by the electrochemical sensor placed at the end buffer waste reservoir.  For the electrochemical sensor used in this microfluidic capillary electrophoretic system, the detection of each analyte is based on a reduction in voltage drop across the needle probe and reference electrode.  These voltage drops can be plotted in the electropherogram and can be used to study the analyte components such as proteins or peptides in the sample solution.


====III. Clinical Applications====

The detection and quantification of biomarkers in patients with skin lesions reported by Guzman et al. 2008 &lt;ref name=Guzman_NA_2009/&gt; is one of the clinical applications for the microfluidic capillary electrophoresis.  Based on the same fundamental concept described previously, a more sophisticated design of microfluidic capillary electrophoresis so-called the immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE) was used in their study.  IACE is a lab-on-a-chip that utilizes the microfluidic technology to incorporate the affinity-based purification, enrichment, and electrophoretic separation processes in one single microchip.  

In the clinical study of biomarkers for this inflammatory disease, IACE was used to analyze the micro-dissected samples from the patients with different stages of skin damage.  Twelve different antibodies were used to capture twelve corresponding target proteins/peptides being considered as biomarkers.  This affinity-binding also assisted the isolation of target analytes from non-target analytes in microfluidic environment, thus improving the subsequent enrichment process and reducing background noise during the analysis.  As reported, the integrated enrichment feature increased the sensitivity and enhanced the low detection limit of IACE.  The concentration as low as a few nanogram per milliliter could be detected and quantified.  With this highly sensitive capability, it was also reported that IACE could be used to monitor the progressive patterns of the disease.  The results obtained by IACE were proven consistent with the gold standard like the traditional histopathology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;High performance liquid chromatography has proven itself to very useful in many scientific fields, yet forces scientists to consistently choose between speed and resolution. Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) eliminates the need to choose and creates a highly efficient method that is primarily based on small particle separations.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Waters ACQUITY Ultra Performance LC systems have been developed to take into account all the advantages that small particle separations currently have over HPLC. Many of these advantages are primarily based on the theories behind liquid chromatography.  In general, increasing the efficiency of a separation will also increase its resolution.  Since both efficiency and optimum flow rate are inversely proportional to particle size, a decrease in the particle size will increase efficiency and speed up the flow rate.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the ACQUITY system, the particle size is decreased to 1.7um compared to 3.5um or 5um.  The particles were specifically designed to withstand wide ranges of pressure and pH, have a high load capacity, and improve efficiency.  Other innovations to the chromatography method include a high pressure solvent delivery system, to take into account the smaller particle size, fast injection cycle sample management, and specialized detectors with fiber optic flow cell design.

==Structure-Based Drug Design==

===Overview===
In the early 1980s, researchers were not able to take advantage of structure-based methods in the drug discovery process. This was due to a number of factors, the most important of which were a lack of computing power and docking programs that could test potential models as well as a lack of interest in the established community due in part to the aforementioned lack of tools.  However, in the 1990s, computing power and available programs increased exponentially as well as the ability to obtain cheaper, more reliable x-ray crystallographic structures necessary for any type of computational study.  This marked the start of a new era and the first attempts and successes were published, with the two most famous being the [[w:en:Hiv_protease_inhibitors|HIV-1 protease inhibitors]] and [[w:en:Renin|renin]] inhibitors (to combat hypertension) (Lunney). In contemporary drug discovery, structure-based methods are an integral part of the drug development process. This change can be attributed to the rapid advances in genomics and structural biology, as well as developments in information technology. The advancements of technology in several fields that are vital to the drug discovery process increased the pace of drug development. However,  many years of research are still required until a drug which is both effective and tolerated by the human body is marketable (Anderson).  Despite this new technology and increased funding by pharmaceutical companies, the issues with finding safe, effective compounds have resulted in there being no significant increase in the rate of therapeutic agent release to the general public. (Lindsay)

The drug discovery process includes many steps. First, the drug target has to be selected. In most cases this will be a protein; however, recent studies have shown that RNA, with its well defined secondary-structure, is also an effective drug target.  DNA is also a target of newer drugs, especially in chemotherapy (see below).   At least 25 percent of currently marketed drugs target [[w:en:GPCR|G-protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs), while another 22 percent affect the function of [[w:enIon_channel|ion channels]], [[w:en:protease|proteases]], [[w:en:kinase|kinases]], and [[w:en:nuclear_hormone_receptor|nuclear hormone receptors]]. Only 2 percent of therapeutic targets in 2003 were DNA or RNA.  Once a target is selected, it has to be cloned and purified in order to determine the structure. The most common method used for structure determination is [[w:en:x-ray_crystallography|X-ray crystallography]], but [[w:en:nmr|NMR]], which when applied to proteins uses multidimensional experiments that increase unique signals and the signal to noise ratio, and [[w:en:homology_modeling|homology modeling]], which uses closely related protein structures to clarify the structure of an unclear protein, are often employed as well. New methods in phase determination of molecules, along with complete automation, have allowed for high-throughput X-ray crystallography; this has greatly enhanced the speed of structure determination. As soon as the structure of the target is known and a potential ligand binding site is identified, computational methods can be used to dock a large number of small molecules into the specified position. These small molecules, which are stored in a database, are then scored and ranked based on their [[w:en:steric|steric]] and electrostatic (see also, [[w:en:ionic_bond|ionic bonds]]) interactions with the target site. The best performing compounds, called ‘hits’, are selected for biochemical assays and further testing. The hit compounds have to be effective at very low concentrations, at least at the micromolar level. The hits are further optimized into the more potent ‘leads’ by chemical synthesis to improve their potency. Selected leads are further scrutinized by rigorous cytotoxicity tests, pharmacokinetic studies, and toxicology investigations to search for side effects followed by the eventual phase 0, I, and II clinical trials for successful drug prototypes (Alanine, Anderson).

===Drug Target Selection and Identification of the Target Site===
	The selection of the drug target is mainly based on biological and biochemical considerations.  Proteomics as a tool in this area is still relatively limited due to the sheer complexity of protein expression in any given cell.  Despite this, proteomics’ usefulness has grown in other areas of the drug discovery process including biomarker identification and tracking.  The ideal drug target for structure-based drug design should bind a small molecule and should be closely associated with the disease.  The small molecule then either changes the function of the drug target, or in case of a pathogenic organism, inhibits the function of the target.  This will ideally lead to the cell death of the pathogen. In the latter case, the drug target should only be present in the diseased cells or pathogen and should have a unique function that allows for and encourages this selectivity. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the drug target guarantees that another pathway cannot restore the function of an inhibited target. The structure-based search for anti-cancer and autoimmune drugs is much more challenging, since the drug targets regulate essential cell functions. Hence, these targets are not unique and isolated; inhibition of their function not only affects mutant or over/under-activated cells, but also normal cells.  For example, the [[w:en:pi3k|phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3K) pathway is both involved in cellular growth and has been directly linked with pancreatic cancer activation (Reddy). Trying to separate convoluted pathways such as this make the drug discovery process much more complex than with other diseases.  Another option for targeting in cancer is DNA.  [[w:en:cisplatin|Cisplatin]] and [[w:en:bleomycin|Bleomycin]] cross-link and cleave DNA respectively and are used to slow down cell division, particularly in cancerous tissues. (Singh) 

	The ligand binding site of a drug target should be a pocket containing both hydrogen donors and acceptors, as well as hydrophobic residues.  In many cases, the selected target location is the active site of an enzyme, as with sildenafil citrate (Viagra), which targets the catalytic subunit of NADPH (Jeremy); however, it can also be an assembly or regulatory site, as is the case with the phosphotransferase regulatory domain the Bacillus subtilis Spo0f protein, a histidine kinase (Dai-Fu). Even protein-protein interaction sites, which are often large and planar, have been selected as target sites (2-oxoglutarate, a naturally occurring molecule, affects the monomer-monomer interactions of GlnK, an ammonia transporter [AcrB] inhibitor (Anderson, Stroud).
 
===Proteomics as a Tool to Discover Biomarkers===
‘Biomarker’ is short for ‘biological marker.’  A biomarker is a molecule, indicator, or test that can be used to measure such processes as disease progression, infection stage, and drug efficacy, as well as other various biological functions.  They can also be used as part of safety studies for therapeutic agents.  Although the most common biomarkers in use today are small molecules and proteins, the growing fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are attempting to utilize [[w:en:genotype|genotypes]], [[w:en:haplotype|haplotypes]], and [[w:en:Single_nucleotide_polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] as biomarkers  (Frank).

With the growing emphasis on biomarkers as indicators, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)[http://www.nih.gov/] began a ‘Biomarkers and Surrogate Endpoint Working Group.’[http://ospp.od.nih.gov/biomarkers/ClinicalParmacology.pdf]  This organization has set up a classification system for biomarkers.  Type 0 biomarkers are more symptomatic in nature and track disease progression over its complete history.  They are used in phase 0 clinical studies.  These clinical studies use well developed assay techniques in highly regulated populations for specific durations.  The goal of these studies is to achieve simple positive or negative results for the drug or system being studied.  Type 1 biomarkers are used to track any type of compound injected into the biological system.  The most familiar aspects are drug trials, where the researchers are looking for a specific effect.  The effect observed may be positive or negative.  The final classification is Type II biomarkers.  These biomarkers are used to determine a ‘surrogate endpoint.’  A surrogate endpoint, as defined by the FDA,[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/fast.html] “is a marker – a laboratory measurement or physical sign – that is used in the therapeutic trials as a substitute for a clinically meaningful endpoint that is a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions or survives and is expected to predict the effect of the therapy.”  In other words, a surrogate endpoint moves beyond the concept of a single biomarker and into the realm where many or no biomarkers may be sufficient.  Other symptoms including overall health and mortality may be studied to determine the efficacy of a treatment regimen.  Although surrogate endpoints are still in the early stages, two examples that have been accepted are blood pressure and cholesterol, which have a firm connection to cardiovascular health and mortality (Frank). 

	In addition to the above effects, a biomarker should correlate well with the disease condition and minimize the number of false positives, as well as false negatives. Thus, a biomarker should be able to accurately discriminate between a normal and a infected condition with high reproducibility. The challenge in proteomics research is to identify unique biomarkers from complex biological mixtures that unequivocally correlate with the disease condition. Biomarkers can be utilized for many purposes. Also, established biomarkers are useful as risk factor indicators, capable of providing information to show that a person is susceptible to a disease.  [[w:en:wt_interval|QT]] prolongation, a measure of change in the ventricular electrical cycle, is used as a assessment of a patient’s chances for survival after heart attack, as is [[w:en:troponin_t|troponin T]], a cardiac enzyme whose levels rise following a heart attack.  [[w:en:5-hydroxytryptophan|5-hydroxytryptophan]] is a metabolic precursor to seratonin, and has been found to localize around neoplasms in neuroendocrine tissue.  Labelling of these molecules allows for visualization of these events by [[w:en:fdg-pet|fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography]] (FDG-PET), which is used in visualizing many types of malignancies.  Another PET application uses SPA-RQ, a neurokinin-1 binder, whose injection is used to track binding of the drug [[w:en:aprepitant|Aprepitant™]], a drug used in chemotherapy patients to control vomiting (Frank). 

	There are currently many more biomarkers being studied and in development, and this number will continue to grow as our understanding of the body evolves.  The combination of tracer molecules and imaging techniques, as in 5-hydroxytryptophan, creates a powerful method for visualizing areas that should not be touched surgically except as a last resort.  The growing use of proteomics to find biomarkers is important as well.  Recent advances in analytical techniques such as [[Proteomics/Protein_Identification_-_Mass_Spectrometry|mass spectrometry]] and [[Proteomics/Protein_Separations_-_Chromatography|column chromatography]] have allowed for more comprehensive studies of protein expression.  In addition, [[Proteomics/Protein_Separations-_Electrophoresis/Two_Dimensional_Polyacrylamide_Gel_Electrophoresis%282D-PAGE%29|2-dimensional electrophoresis]] provides an overall view of expression, in similar fashion to gene studies.  Proteomics studies using these techniques have identified ovarian cancer, macular degeneration, and lipoprotein composition.  Development of these techniques will undoubtedly increase in the future (Frank).

=Docking &amp; Scoring=
 
[[Image:FlowchartMMP.PNG|In Silico Drug Discovery Flowchart|right]]

Following [[w:en:protein|protein]] studies and either [[Proteomics/Proteomics_and_Drug_Discovery/Virtual_Libraries|virtual library]] creation or the decision to use a particular existing library, the next steps in this type of drug discovery are docking and scoring. In docking, various [[w:en:algorithms|algorithms]] fit compounds from the virtual libraries into the specified target site or sites on a particular protein. The algorithms used in this stage often use either [[w:en:Monte_carlo_algorithm|Monte Carlo methods]], [[w:en:Genetic_algorithms|Genetic algorithms]], or incremental construction, which are elaborated upon later in this section.

After compounds are docked, they are then scored. Scoring takes into account the chemical interactions between the ligand and target, in order to determine the energy state of the complex and to rank the efficacy of the compound being scored.

The top-scoring compounds are then visually inspected in the predicted docking orientation to verify the calculated stability, before actual laboratory experiments are performed to verify and determine both the efficacy and toxicity of the drug lead.

==Principles of Molecular Docking==

The aim of [[w:en:Docking_%28molecular%29|molecular docking]] is essentially to determine the binding interactions between two molecular species, in this context either protein to protein, or protein to ligand interactions. Of course, data representing the molecule and its respective properties must be already known on order to be able to simluate its behavior. For this reason, this type of behavioral deduction is known as retrospective virtual screening (Paetz). From a computational perspective, this is modernly accomplished through simulated molecular modeling software, or algorithms. The model then analyzes a gross amount of potential conformations which can be assumed, in order to assess those conformations which appear energetically favorable. The main algorithms used to do this use Monte Carlo methods, genetic algorithms, or incremental construction.

Monte Carlo method algorithims can be used to help predict the behavior of a physical system. The use pseudo-random number generation to power calculations result in many random conformations and configurations of the ligand in the binding site, in an attempt to “randomly” find a best-fit match. Given the complexity and sheer volume of the possible interactions, this type of algorithm is well suited for applications which are designed to emulate molecular interactions. 

Genetic algorithms treat the different ligand states as members of a population. These members are mated and mutated, with the best-fit members of each generation carried on to additional generations. In working towards a best-fit case, evolution is modeled in order to produce better and better matches with each new generation. Mutations and deleterious events are used to avoid local maxima, which would give the illusion of working towards a “local” best-fit match, even though it might not be the absolute best-fit match.

Incremental construction treats the ligands as fragments that can be either rigid or flexible, depending on known  [[Organic_Chemistry/Stereochemistry|stererochemical]] principles. The rigid sections are first put into ideal positions in the target site, followed by the flexible sections. The goal of adding the flexible portions second is to be able to connect all of the rigid fragments completely and appropriately. Versions of incremental construction are similar to the clique search. In this method, the rigid fragments are selected and positioned based on specific characteristics such as ability to function in a hydrogen bond, or electrostatic interactions between functional groups and side chains (Krovat).

A major factor to be decided upon is whether the ligand, the protein, or both are going to be treated as rigid or flexible. The computation time is already significant when the ligand is treated as flexible and the protein, rigid. The reason for this scenario, which is often typical in initial screenings, is that a.) flexibility in the ligand is easier to simulate, due to the small size of the compound and b.) flexibility in the ligand can lead to a broader range of compounds that fit a particular conformation; thus, there is a set of alternatives to choose from in terms of a chemical that is cheap and easy to synthesize or acquire. Many chemicals in virtual libraries do not actually exist, or are very difficult to acquire, so this element of choice among several good matches is critical in making VLS a much cheaper alternative to traditional laboratory screening.

Treating the protein as flexible greatly increases the computation time for docking due to the vast number of conformational changes that need to be considered; however, this allows more accurate docking when proteins are flexible in vivo, especially when induced-fit proteins are being targeted. Certain ligands that would not necessarily be top matches when the protein is considered rigid, may be ranked much higher when the protein is allowed to be flexible. There are alternatives for protein flexibility that keep computation time down. One such method is to use the [[w:en:X-ray_crystallography|X-ray crystallographic]] or [[A-level_Applied_Science/Synthesising_Organic_Compounds/Spectroscopy#NMR_Spectroscopy|NMR]] structure of a protein bound to a known ligand during docking. This allows the virtual library to be docked to the protein in its ligand-bound conformation. Another method is the use of several protein structures with slightly different conformations, which is usually achieved during NMR structure determination. This set of structures, or ensemble, is used in docking to find chemical matches that dock appropriately in several of the conformational models; the goal is to find a lead that could remain docked during a transition from the unbound protein conformation to the protein-ligand conformation.

==Approaches and Algorithms==
The two commonly used approaches are ''Surface Complementarity'' and ''Simulation based'' approaches.
Surface complementarity approaches use techniques such as Fourier Transforms or Fast Fourier Transforms to convert the structural information of the receptors and ligands into mathematical grids and then check for complementarity between the structures. Simulation algorithms such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu Searching generally perform simulations using energy calculations as described later.

===Simulated Annealing ===
[[w:en:Simulated_Annealing|Simulated Annealing]] is a probalistic meta-algorithm that has many applications, one of which is molecular docking. This algorithm will create a good approximation when optimizing functions. This does this by taking the point ''s'' in the function E(''s'') and minimizing the energy, which in molecular docking will result in the optimization of protein interaction. It does this by running a series of calculations moving from the original state of ''s'', to a state of ''s’'' which is an arbitrary number. This is called a transition. Transitions are shown through an acceptance probability function n P(''e,e',T''), which depends on the energy and temperature of the two states. In the function P ''e'' is the energy, ''e’'' is the energy state the algorithm is moving to, and T is the temperature. The acceptance probability function is beneficial because with very small temperature values the computation will move to values of lower energy levels.  A requirement of the probability function is that each move must be nonzero. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
Another aspect of simulated annealing is the annealing schedule. This is where the temperature is slowly reduced as the simulation progresses.  The parameters  used in simulated annealing are the state space,  the energy function, the candidate generator procedure neighbor, the acceptance probability function, and the annealing schedule. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

===Tabu search=== 
[[w:en:Tabu_search|Tabu search]] is another type of algorithm. The difference here is that it has a memory structure and will not attempt to calculate a possibility more than twice.  It can be used for combinatorial optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best possible solution. It uses at local search procedure to move from one solution to the next.  The N*(x) function in the tabu search algorithm is set to memorize the last number (n) of possibilities it has tried so there are no repeat calculations.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This makes it more efficient than other algorithms (Hou).

==Docking Implementations==

Due to the enormous computational demand of docking and scoring algorithms, many such applications are developed with parallel programming pragmatics, so that they can be run on clusters of multiple CPUs and be greatly sped up. [[w:en:Grid computing| Grid Computing]], a rapidly growing area of parallel computing, is currently being investigated as an alternative to devoted [[w:en:computer_cluster| computer clusters]]. Grid computing, which models the electrical utility grid, would allow all of the idle computers at a pharmaceutical company to be used in a distributed computational grid. Especially at night, hundreds or even thousands of idle workstations could rival dedicated clusters, at a fraction of the cost. The tradeoff, however, is grid computing’s lack of guaranteed availability-on-demand.

==Scoring Methods==

Scoring, which evaluates the binding strength and energy state of the ligand-protein complex, follows docking during virtual drug discovery. Scoring can be done with several degrees of stringency. The most basic scoring functions consider [[w:en:chemical_bond| hydrogen bond formation, van der Waal interactions, and other electrostatic forces]]. More advanced scoring functions consider, in addition to the above forces, the [[w:en:dielectric_constant| dielectric constant]] of the solution, in addition to various chemical energy models (Anderson). More basic scoring is often done in initial screenings, with increasing levels of scoring complexity used iteratively to narrow the field of high-scoring drug leads.

Another approach aimed at “scoring” non-metallic protein to ligand interactions is based on the comprehensive analysis of specific atomic characteristics of the molecule(s) in question. While considering some of the more basic criteria listed above, such as van der Waals and electostatic interactions, an empirical score is also designated with respect to hydrophobicity, and free energy changes in the bound state (Jain). This protocol has thus far shown much promise in terms of rapid computation and accuracy, and is available on the internet under the name Binding Affinity Prediction of Protein- Ligand server, or BAPPL [http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/drugdesign/bappl.jsp].

A second phase of scoring involves evaluating the highest-scored matches visually to verify the predicted binding potential. Conformation, alignment of bonds, and the shapes of the interacting surfaces are considered in this final review step. Furthermore, size and availability/producability of the leads are included in the evaluation step. A compound that is easily synthesized but slightly less effective may be cheaper and better to investigate further than a higher-scoring ligand that does not exist outside of the virtual library.

==Issues of Concern in Docking and Scoring==

One of the first issues to be concerned with in docking is the resolution of a protein’s structure, along with the temperature of the atoms that comprise the protein. Temperature refers to the degree of uncertainty in the three-dimensional coordinates of an atom, due to resonance and vibration during the structure determination phase. This vibration is present in all atoms; however, greater vibration leads to greater temperature, and thus an atom’s determined coordinates become less reliable and accurate (Krovat).

A further concern in docking is the physiological [[w:en:PH|pH]] of the protein versus the pH of the protein during crystallization. This a major factor in locating potential hydrogen bonding sites. The protonation and deprotonation of many amino acid side chains as pH changes could mean the difference between a tightly binding ligand and one that does not bind well at all, even though the former may be a false positive and the latter, a false negative. The context of hydrogen bonds must be considered as well, because they can occupy a range of binding strengths. This factor affects scoring too.

Additional concerns include binding in broad and shallow sites, as surface geometry plays less of a role due to the absence of specific shapes that might otherwise interact. Also, unusual binding modes that might exist in vitro might not be detected during in silico docking (Krovat).

Due the difficulty in resolving membrane-bound proteins, [[w:en:homology modeling| homology modeling]], or the elucidation of molecular structure inferred from the primary sequence, is used in docking in these cases; this is in addition to the homology modeling used in determining the structure of membrane proteins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Modern History}}
The Franco-Prussian War (July 19, 1870 – May 10, 1871) was fought between France and Prussia (backed by the North German Confederation and the southern German states of Baden, Bavaria and Württemberg). The conflict marked the culmination of rising tensions between the two powers following Prussia's increasing dominance in Germany, then still a loose federation of quasi-independent territories.

=== Origins ===

The long term causes of the war can be traced back decades. France was understandably anxious about the increasing economic and political power of Prussia to it's east, and at the same time eager to pursue it's old diplomatic aims of the expansion of it's territories eastwards. Internally, the Bonapartist regime that ruled France faced increasing dissent, and some believed that a successful war against Prussia would not only provide economic and territorial gains but also prevent revolution. Prussia, on the other hand, believed that a war with France would help strengthen Germany as a whole by ending French influence, and that a victorious Prussia could achieve the ultimate goal of the unification of Germany. These tensions increased due to a number of diplomatic crises between the two nations in the 1860s, particularly over the Austro-Prussian War and France's attempt to purchase Luxembourg.

The war was finally triggered by a dispute over the possible ascension of the German Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (a member of Prussia's Hohenzollern royal family) to the Spanish throne, following the abdication of Isabella II in 1868. The French government feared that this expansion of Prussian influence would weaken France's position in Europe, not least because it made it probable that any war with Prussia would lead to war with Spain, forcing France to fight on two fronts. The French Emperor Napoleon III issued an ultimatum to the Prussian King Wilhelm I demanding that Leopold be withdrawn from candidacy for the Spanish throne, and he complied. Eager to press their perceived advantage, the French demanded a guarantee that no other Hohenzollern candidates would be put forwards, but the Prussian government refused. French public opinion was enflamed, and France declared war.


=== The War ===

There were many European nations who had motives to go to war against Prussia alongside France, but Napoleon III's mismanagement of France's foreign policy had lead to the diplomatic isolation of France, and at the outbreak of war France was unable to find any allies. In contrast, Prussia had signed treaties with the southern German states of Baden, Bavaria and Württemberg which guaranteed their support if war was declared against Prussia.

France was able straight away to field an army of about 400,000 highly trained soldiers, compared to roughly 1.2 million Prussian and southern German troops. However, the German soldiers were not regulars and would take some time to train, so the French army had an initial advantage. This was exploited by pushing forwards up to the German border, and on August 2nd the French seized the city of Saarbrücken. The Prussian army moved swiftly against them, and less than a week after Saarbrücken fell, the German forces inflicted a series of heavy defeats upon the French. The Prussian army steamrollered it's way into France, capturing Metz in October after a bloody seige. Although Napoleon III himself surrendered and was taken prisoner following the Battle of Sedan in early September, the war continued to be fought by a French republican government for several months.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Advanced Haskell}}

'''Continuation Passing Style''' (CPS for short) is a style of programming in which functions do not return values; rather, they pass control onto a ''continuation'', which specifies what happens next. In this chapter, we are going to consider how that plays out in Haskell and, in particular, how CPS can be expressed with a monad.

== What are continuations? ==
To dispel puzzlement, we will have a second look at an example from way back in the book, [[Haskell/Higher-order_functions_and_Currying#Function_manipulation|when we introduced the &lt;code&gt;($)&lt;/code&gt; operator]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; map ($ 2) [(2*), (4*), (8*)]
[4,8,16]
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is nothing out of ordinary about the expression above, except that it is a little quaint to write that instead of {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;map (*2) [2, 4, 8]&lt;/code&gt;}}. The &lt;code&gt;($)&lt;/code&gt; section makes the code appear backwards, as if we are applying a value to the functions rather than the other way around. And now, the catch: such an innocent-looking reversal is at heart of continuation passing style!

From a CPS perspective, &lt;code&gt;($ 2)&lt;/code&gt; is a ''suspended computation'': a function with general type {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; r) -&gt; r&lt;/code&gt;}} which, given another function as argument, produces a final result. The {{nowrap|a -&gt; r}} argument is the ''continuation''; it specifies how the computation will be brought to a conclusion. In the example, the functions in the list are supplied as continuations via &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, producing three distinct results. Note that suspended computations are largely interchangeable with plain values: {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;flip ($)&lt;/code&gt;}} &lt;ref&gt;That is, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; ($ x)&lt;/code&gt;}}, fully spelled out as {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; \k -&gt; k x&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; converts any value into a suspended computation, and passing &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; as its continuation gives back the original value.

=== What are they good for? ===
There is more to continuations than just a parlour trick to impress Haskell newbies. They make it possible to explicitly manipulate, and dramatically alter, the control flow of a program. For instance, returning early from a procedure can be implemented with continuations. Exceptions and failure can also be handled with continuations - pass in a continuation for success, another continuation for fail, and invoke the appropriate continuation. Other possibilities include &quot;suspending&quot; a computation and returning to it at another time, and implementing simple forms of concurrency (notably, one Haskell implementation, Hugs, uses continuations to implement cooperative concurrency).

In Haskell, continuations can be used in a similar fashion, for implementing interesting control flow in monads. Note that there usually are alternative techniques for such use cases, especially in tandem with laziness. In some circumstances, CPS can be used to improve performance by eliminating certain construction-pattern matching sequences (i.e. a function returns a complex structure which the caller will at some point deconstruct), though a sufficiently smart compiler ''should'' be able to do the elimination &lt;ref&gt;[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec-0.10.4.0/docs/Data-Attoparsec-ByteString.html attoparsec] is an example of performance-driven usage of CPS.&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;!-- re performance and CPS: see attoparsec, parsec, http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/Monads#Use__Continuation_Passing_Style. I admit newer GHC's are getting better at analyzing non-CPS, but really, there is very little other application for CPS currently --&gt;

== Passing continuations ==
An elementary way to take advantage of continuations is to modify our functions so that they return suspended computations rather than ordinary values. We will illustrate how that is done with two simple examples.

=== &lt;code&gt;pythagoras&lt;/code&gt; ===
{{HaskellExample|A simple module, no continuations|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- We assume some primitives add and square for the example:

add :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
add x y = x + y

square :: Int -&gt; Int
square x = x * x

pythagoras :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
pythagoras x y = add (square x) (square y)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Modified to return a suspended computation, &lt;code&gt;pythagoras&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:

{{HaskellExample|A simple module, using continuations|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- We assume CPS versions of the add and square primitives,
-- (note: the actual definitions of add_cps and square_cps are not
-- in CPS form, they just have the correct type)

add_cps :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; ((Int -&gt; r) -&gt; r)
add_cps x y = \k -&gt; k (add x y)

square_cps :: Int -&gt; ((Int -&gt; r) -&gt; r)
square_cps x = \k -&gt; k (square x)

pythagoras_cps :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; ((Int -&gt; r) -&gt; r)
pythagoras_cps x y = \k -&gt;
 square_cps x $ \x_squared -&gt;
 square_cps y $ \y_squared -&gt;
 add_cps x_squared y_squared $ k
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

How the &lt;code&gt;pythagoras_cps example&lt;/code&gt; works:

# square x and throw the result into the (\x_squared -&gt; ...) continuation
# square y and throw the result into the (\y_squared -&gt; ...) continuation
# add x_squared and y_squared and throw the result into the top level/program continuation &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;.

We can try it out in GHCi by passing &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; as the program continuation:
&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; pythagoras_cps 3 4 print
25
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we look at the type of &lt;code&gt;pythagoras_cps&lt;/code&gt; without the optional parentheses around {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(Int -&gt; r) -&gt; r&lt;/code&gt;}} and compare it with the original type of &lt;code&gt;pythagoras&lt;/code&gt;, we note that the continuation was in effect added as an extra argument, thus justifying the &quot;continuation passing style&quot; moniker.

=== &lt;code&gt;thrice&lt;/code&gt; ===
{{HaskellExample|A simple higher order function, no continuations|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
thrice :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
thrice f x = f (f (f x))
&lt;/source&gt;}}

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; thrice tail &quot;foobar&quot;
&quot;bar&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

A higher order function such as &lt;code&gt;thrice&lt;/code&gt;, when converted to CPS, takes as arguments functions in CPS form as well. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;{{nowrap|f :: a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;}} will become &lt;code&gt;{{nowrap|f_cps :: a -&gt; ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r)}}&lt;/code&gt;, and the final type will be &lt;code&gt;thrice_cps :: (a -&gt; ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r)) -&gt; a -&gt; ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r)&lt;/code&gt;. The rest of the definition follows quite naturally from the types - we replace &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; by the CPS version, passing along the continuation at hand.

{{HaskellExample|A simple higher order function, with continuations|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
thrice_cps :: (a -&gt; ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r)) -&gt; a -&gt; ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r)
thrice_cps f_cps x = \k -&gt;
 f_cps x $ \fx -&gt;
 f_cps fx $ \ffx -&gt;
 f_cps ffx $ k
&lt;/source&gt;}}

== The &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad ==
Having continuation-passing functions, the next step is providing a neat way of composing them, preferably one which does not require the long chains of nested lambdas we have seen just above. A good start would be a combinator for applying a CPS function to a suspended computation. A possible type for it would be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
chainCPS :: ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r) -&gt; (a -&gt; ((b -&gt; r) -&gt; r)) -&gt; ((b -&gt; r) -&gt; r)
&lt;/source&gt;

(You may want to try implementing it before reading on. Hint: start by stating that the result is a function which takes a {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;b -&gt; r&lt;/code&gt;}} continuation; then, let the types guide you.)

And here is the implementation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
chainCPS s f = \k -&gt; s $ \x -&gt; f x $ k
&lt;/source&gt;

We supply the original suspended computation &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; with a continuation which makes a new suspended computation (produced by &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;) and passes the final continuation &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; to it. Unsurprisingly, it mirrors closely the nested lambda pattern of the previous examples.

Doesn't the type of &lt;code&gt;chainCPS&lt;/code&gt; look familiar? If we replace {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; r) -&gt; r&lt;/code&gt;}} with {{nowrap|1=(Monad m) =&gt; m a}} and {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(b -&gt; r) -&gt; r&lt;/code&gt;}} with {{nowrap|1=(Monad m) =&gt; m b}} we get the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; signature. Furthermore, our old friend {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;flip ($)&lt;/code&gt;}} plays a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;-like role, in that it makes a suspended computation out of a value in a trivial way. Lo and behold, we have a monad! All we need now &lt;ref&gt;Beyond verifying that the monad laws hold, which is left as an exercise to the reader.&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Cont r a&lt;/code&gt;}} type to wrap suspended computations, with the usual wrapper and unwrapper functions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
cont :: ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r) -&gt; Cont r a
runCont :: Cont r a -&gt; (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r
&lt;/source&gt;

The monad instance for &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; follows directly from our presentation, the only difference being the wrapping and unwrapping cruft:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad (Cont r) where
    return x = cont ($ x)
    s &gt;&gt;= f  = cont $ \c -&gt; runCont s $ \x -&gt; runCont (f x) c
&lt;/source&gt;

The end result is that the monad instance makes the continuation passing (and thus the lambda chains) implicit. The monadic bind applies a CPS function to a suspended computation, and &lt;code&gt;runCont&lt;/code&gt; is used to provide the final continuation. For a simple example, the Pythagoras example becomes:

{{HaskellExample|The &lt;code&gt;pythagoras&lt;/code&gt; example, using the Cont monad|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- Using the Cont monad from the transformers package.
import Control.Monad.Trans.Cont

add_cont :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Cont r Int
add_cont x y = return (add x y)

square_cont :: Int -&gt; Cont r Int
square_cont x = return (square x)

pythagoras_cont :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Cont r Int
pythagoras_cont x y = do
    x_squared &lt;- square_cont x
    y_squared &lt;- square_cont y
    add_cont x_squared y_squared
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; ==
While it is always pleasant to see a monad coming forth naturally, a hint of disappointment might linger at this point. One of the promises of CPS was precise control flow manipulation through continuations. And yet, after converting our functions to CPS we promptly hid the continuations behind a monad. To rectify that, we shall introduce &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;, a function which gives us back explicit control of continuations - but only where we want it.

&lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; is a very peculiar function; one that is best introduced with examples. Let us start with a trivial one:

{{HaskellExample|&lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- Without callCC
square :: Int -&gt; Cont r Int
square n = return (n ^ 2)

-- With callCC
squareCCC :: Int -&gt; Cont r Int
squareCCC n = callCC $ \k -&gt; k (n ^ 2)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The argument passed to &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; is a function, whose result is a suspended computation (general type {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Cont r a&lt;/code&gt;}}) which we will refer to as &quot;the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; computation&quot;. ''In principle'', the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; computation is what the whole &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; expression evaluates to. The caveat, and what makes &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; so special, is due to &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, the argument to the argument. It is a function which acts as an ''eject button'': calling it anywhere will lead to the value passed to it being made into a suspended computation, which then is inserted into control flow at the point of the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; invocation. That happens unconditionally; in particular, whatever follows a &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; invocation in the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; computation is summarily discarded. From another perspective, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; captures ''the rest of the computation'' following the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;; calling it throws a value into the continuation at that particular point (&quot;callCC&quot; stands for &quot;call with current continuation&quot;). While in this simple example the effect is merely that of a plain &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; opens up a number of possibilities, which we are now going to explore.

=== Deciding when to use &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; gives us extra power over what is thrown into a continuation, and when that is done. The following example begins to show how we can use this extra power.

{{HaskellExample|Our first proper &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; function|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foo :: Int -&gt; Cont r String
foo x = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
    let y = x ^ 2 + 3
    when (y &gt; 20) $ k &quot;over twenty&quot;
    return (show $ y - 4)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is a slightly pathological function that computes the square of its input and adds three; if the result of this computation is greater than 20, then we return from the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; computation (and, in this case, from the whole function) immediately, throwing the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;over twenty&quot;&lt;/code&gt; into the continuation that will be passed to &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;. If not, then we subtract four from our previous computation, &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; it, and throw it into the continuation. Remarkably, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; here is used just like the 'return' ''statement'' from an imperative language, that immediately exits the function. And yet, this being Haskell, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; is just an ordinary first-class function, so you can pass it to other functions like &lt;code&gt;when&lt;/code&gt;, store it in a &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

Naturally, you can embed calls to &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; within do-blocks:

{{HaskellExample|More developed &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; example involving a do-block|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
bar :: Char -&gt; String -&gt; Cont r Int
bar c s = do
    msg &lt;- callCC $ \k -&gt; do
        let s' = c : s
        when (s' == &quot;hello&quot;) $ k &quot;They say hello.&quot;
        let s'' = show s'
        return (&quot;They appear to be saying &quot; ++ s'')
    return (length msg)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

When you call &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; with a value, the entire &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; call takes that value. In effect, that makes &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; a lot like an 'goto' statement in other languages: when we call &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; in our example, it pops the execution out to where you first called &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;msg &lt;- callCC $ ...&lt;/code&gt; line. No more of the argument to &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; (the inner do-block) is executed. Hence the following example contains a useless line:

{{HaskellExample|Popping out a function, introducing a useless line|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
quux :: Cont r Int
quux = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
    let n = 5
    k n
    return 25
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;code&gt;quux&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, and not &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt;, because we pop out of &lt;code&gt;quux&lt;/code&gt; before getting to the &lt;code&gt;return 25&lt;/code&gt; line.

=== Behind the scenes ===
We have deliberately broken a trend here: normally when we introduce a function we give its type straight away, but in this case we chose not to. The reason is simple: the type is pretty complex, and it does not immediately give insight into what the function does, or how it works. After the initial presentation of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;, however, we are in a better position to tackle it. Take a deep breath...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
callCC :: ((a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a
&lt;/source&gt;

We can make sense of that based on what we already know about &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;. The overall result type and the result type of the argument have to be the same (i.e. {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Cont r a&lt;/code&gt;}}), as in the absence of an invocation of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; the corresponding result values are one and the same. Now, what about the type of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;? As mentioned above, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;'s argument is made into a suspended computation inserted at the point of the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; invocation; therefore, if the latter has type {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Cont r a&lt;/code&gt;}} &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;'s argument must have type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. As for &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;'s result type, interestingly enough it doesn't matter as long as it is in the same {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Cont r&lt;/code&gt;}} monad; in other words, the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; stands for an arbitrary type. That happens because the suspended computation made out of the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; argument will receive whatever continuation follows the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;, and so the continuation taken by &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;'s result is irrelevant.

{{Body note|1=The arbitrariness of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;'s result type explains why the following variant of the useless line example leads to a type error:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
quux :: Cont r Int
quux = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
   let n = 5
   when True $ k n
   k 25
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;'s result type ''could'' be anything; however, the &lt;code&gt;when&lt;/code&gt; constrains it to {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Cont r ()&lt;/code&gt;}}, and so the closing {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;k 25&lt;/code&gt;}} does not match the result type of &lt;code&gt;quux&lt;/code&gt;. The solution is very simple: replace the final &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; by a plain old &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;.}}

To conclude this section, here is the implementation of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;. Can you identify &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; in it?

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
callCC f = cont $ \h -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; cont $ \_ -&gt; h a)) h
&lt;/source&gt;

The code is far from obvious. However, the amazing fact is that the implementations of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; can be produced automatically from their type signatures - Lennart Augustsson's Djinn [http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1178] is a program that will do this for you. See Phil Gossett's Google tech talk: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0OkptwfX4g] for background on the theory behind Djinn; and Dan Piponi's article: [http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/1/14/TMR-Issue6.pdf] which uses Djinn in deriving continuation passing style.

== Example: a complicated control structure ==
We will now look at some more realistic examples of control flow manipulation. The first one, presented below, was originally taken from the &quot;The Continuation monad&quot; section of the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/All_about_monads All about monads tutorial], used with permission.

{{HaskellExample|Using Cont for a complicated control structure|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

-} 
fun :: Int -&gt; String
fun n = (`runCont` id) $ do
    str &lt;- callCC $ \exit1 -&gt; do                            -- define &quot;exit1&quot;
        when (n &lt; 10) (exit1 (show n))
        let ns = map digitToInt (show (n `div` 2))
        n' &lt;- callCC $ \exit2 -&gt; do                         -- define &quot;exit2&quot;
            when ((length ns) &lt; 3) (exit2 (length ns))
            when ((length ns) &lt; 5) (exit2 n)
            when ((length ns) &lt; 7) $ do
                let ns' = map intToDigit (reverse ns)
                exit1 (dropWhile (=='0') ns')               --escape 2 levels
            return $ sum ns
        return $ &quot;(ns = &quot; ++ (show ns) ++ &quot;) &quot; ++ (show n')
    return $ &quot;Answer: &quot; ++ str
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes an integer &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation uses &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; to set up a control structure using &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; that does different things based on the range that &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; falls in, as stated by the comment at the top. Let us dissect it:

# Firstly, the &lt;code&gt;(`runCont` id)&lt;/code&gt; at the top just means that we run the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; block that follows with a final continuation of &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; (or, in other words, we extract the value from the suspended computation unchanged). That is necessary as the result type of &lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; doesn't mention &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt;.
# We bind &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; to the result of the following &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; do-block:
## If &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is less than 10, we exit straight away, just showing &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.
## If not, we proceed. We construct a list, &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt;, of digits of &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt;.
## &lt;code&gt;n'&lt;/code&gt; (an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;) gets bound to the result of the following inner &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; do-block.
### If &lt;code&gt;length ns &lt; 3&lt;/code&gt;, i.e., if &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt; has less than 3 digits, we pop out of this inner do-block with the number of digits as the result.
### If &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt; has less than 5 digits, we pop out of the inner do-block returning the original &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.
### If &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt; has less than 7 digits, we pop out of ''both'' the inner and outer do-blocks, with the result of the digits of &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt; in reverse order (a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;).
### Otherwise, we end the inner do-block, returning the sum of the digits of &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt;.
## We end this do-block, returning the String &lt;code&gt;&quot;(ns = X) Y&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, where X is &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt;, the digits of &lt;code&gt;n `div` 2&lt;/code&gt;, and Y is the result from the inner do-block, &lt;code&gt;n'&lt;/code&gt;.
# Finally, we return out of the entire function, with our result being the string &quot;Answer: Z&quot;, where Z is the string we got from the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; do-block.

== Example: exceptions ==
One use of continuations is to model exceptions. To do this, we hold on to ''two'' continuations: one that takes us out to the handler in case of an exception, and one that takes us to the post-handler code in case of a success. Here's a simple function that takes two numbers and does integer division on them, failing when the denominator is zero.

{{HaskellExample|An exception-throwing &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
divExcpt :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; (String -&gt; Cont r Int) -&gt; Cont r Int
divExcpt x y handler = callCC $ \ok -&gt; do
    err &lt;- callCC $ \notOk -&gt; do
        when (y == 0) $ notOk &quot;Denominator 0&quot;
        ok $ x `div` y
    handler err

{- For example,
runCont (divExcpt 10 2 error) id --&gt; 5
runCont (divExcpt 10 0 error) id --&gt; *** Exception: Denominator 0
-}
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

How does it work? We use two nested calls to &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;. The first labels a continuation that will be used when there's no problem. The second labels a continuation that will be used when we wish to throw an exception. If the denominator isn't 0, &lt;code&gt;x `div` y&lt;/code&gt; is thrown into the &lt;code&gt;ok&lt;/code&gt; continuation, so the execution pops right back out to the top level of &lt;code&gt;divExcpt&lt;/code&gt;. If, however, we were passed a zero denominator, we throw an error message into the &lt;code&gt;notOk&lt;/code&gt; continuation, which pops us out to the inner do-block, and that string gets assigned to &lt;code&gt;err&lt;/code&gt; and given to &lt;code&gt;handler&lt;/code&gt;.

A more general approach to handling exceptions can be seen with the following function. Pass a computation as the first parameter (more precisely, a function which takes an error-throwing function and results in the computation) and an error handler as the second parameter. This example takes advantage of the generic &lt;code&gt;MonadCont&lt;/code&gt; class &lt;ref&gt;Found in the &lt;code&gt;mtl&lt;/code&gt; package, module {{Haskell lib|p=mtl|v=2.1.2|Control|Monad|Cont}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which covers both &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; and the corresponding &lt;code&gt;ContT&lt;/code&gt; transformer by default, as well as any other continuation monad which instantiates it.

{{HaskellExample|General &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; using continuations.|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Control.Monad.Cont

tryCont :: MonadCont m =&gt; ((err -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a) -&gt; (err -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a
tryCont c h = callCC $ \ok -&gt; do
    err &lt;- callCC $ \notOk -&gt; do
        x &lt;- c notOk
        ok x
    h err
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

And here is our &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; in action:

{{HaskellExample|Using &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data SqrtException = LessThanZero deriving (Show, Eq)

sqrtIO :: (SqrtException -&gt; ContT r IO ()) -&gt; ContT r IO ()
sqrtIO throw = do 
    ln &lt;- lift (putStr &quot;Enter a number to sqrt: &quot; &gt;&gt; readLn)
    when (ln &lt; 0) (throw LessThanZero)
    lift $ print (sqrt ln)

main = runContT (tryCont sqrtIO (lift . print)) return
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

In this example, error throwing means escaping from an enclosing &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;sqrtIO&lt;/code&gt; jumps out of &lt;code&gt;tryCont&lt;/code&gt;'s inner &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;.

== Example: coroutines ==
In this section we make a CoroutineT monad that provides a monad with &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;, which enqueues a new suspended coroutine, and &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;, that suspends the current thread.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
-- We use GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving to avoid boilerplate. As of GHC 7.8, it is safe.

import Control.Applicative
import Control.Monad.Cont
import Control.Monad.State

-- The CoroutineT monad is just ContT stacked with a StateT containing the suspended coroutines.
newtype CoroutineT r m a = CoroutineT {runCoroutineT' :: ContT r (StateT [CoroutineT r m ()] m) a}
    deriving (Functor,Applicative,Monad,MonadCont,MonadIO)

-- Used to manipulate the coroutine queue.
getCCs :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m [CoroutineT r m ()]
getCCs = CoroutineT $ lift get

putCCs :: Monad m =&gt; [CoroutineT r m ()] -&gt; CoroutineT r m ()
putCCs = CoroutineT . lift . put

-- Pop and push coroutines to the queue.
dequeue :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m ()
dequeue = do
    current_ccs &lt;- getCCs
    case current_ccs of
        [] -&gt; return ()
        (p:ps) -&gt; do
            putCCs ps
            p

queue :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m () -&gt; CoroutineT r m ()
queue p = do
    ccs &lt;- getCCs
    putCCs (ccs++[p])

-- The interface.
yield :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m ()
yield = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
    queue (k ())
    dequeue

fork :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m () -&gt; CoroutineT r m ()
fork p = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
    queue (k ())
    p
    dequeue

-- Exhaust passes control to suspended coroutines repeatedly until there isn't any left.
exhaust :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m ()
exhaust = do
    exhausted &lt;- null &lt;$&gt; getCCs
    if not exhausted
        then yield &gt;&gt; exhaust
        else return ()

-- Runs the coroutines in the base monad.
runCoroutineT :: Monad m =&gt; CoroutineT r m r -&gt; m r
runCoroutineT = flip evalStateT [] . flip runContT return . runCoroutineT' . (&lt;* exhaust)
&lt;/source&gt;
Some example usage:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
printOne n = do
    liftIO (print n)
    yield

example = runCoroutineT $ do
    fork $ replicateM_ 3 (printOne 3)
    fork $ replicateM_ 4 (printOne 4)
    replicateM_ 2 (printOne 2)
&lt;/source&gt;
Outputting:

==James I (1603-1625)==
[[Image:James_I_of_England_by_Daniel_Mytens.jpg|thumb|150px|James I]]
James I was born at Edinburgh Castle on 19 June 1566.  James was the only child of Mary, Queen of Scots and her second husband, Lord Darnley.  James was a direct descendant of Henry VII through his great-grandmother Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII.  He ruled in Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 until his death on 27 March 1625.  He was also King of England and King of Ireland as James I from 24 March 1603 until his death.  He was the first monarch of England from the House of Stuart.

James was a successful monarch in Scotland, but he was an unsuccessful monarch in England. He was unable to deal with a hostile Parliament, and the refusal by the House of Commons to levy sufficiently high taxes crippled the royal finances. However, James is considered to have been one of the most intellectual British monarchs. Under him, much of the cultural flourishing of Elizabethan England continued; science, literature and art, contributed by men such as Sir Francis Bacon and William Shakespeare grew by leaps.

===Before becoming King of England===

In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, and imprisoned her. Mary was forced to abdicate the throne on 24 July, giving it to James, then only thirteen months old. He was brought up as a member of the Protestant Church of Scotland. During James VI's early reign, power was held by a series of regents, with James taking power himself in 1581, though he did not rule by himself, relying instead on the advice of his closest courtiers. He carried on ruling as King of Scotland, and then, on the death of Queen Elizabeth of England in 1603, an English Accession Council met and proclaimed James King of England. However, Scotland and England remained separate states - it was not until 1707 that the Acts of Union merged the two nations to create a new state, the Kingdom of Great Britain.

===Early reign in England===

James is noted for creating many new lords. In total, sixty-two people were raised to the English Peerage by James. Elizabeth had only created eight new peers during her 45-year reign. Upon his arrival in London, James was almost immediately faced by religious conflicts in England. He was presented with a petition from Puritans requesting further Anglican Church reform. He accepted the invitation to a conference in Hampton Court, which was subsequently delayed due to the Plague. In 1604, at the Hampton Court Conference, James was unwilling to agree to most of their demands. He did, however, agree to fulfill one request by authorizing an official translation of the Bible, which came to be known as the King James Version. 

In 1605, a group of Catholic extremists led by Robert Catesby developed a plan, known as the Gunpowder Plot, to cause an explosion in the chamber of the House of Lords, where the King and members of both Houses of Parliament would be gathered for the State Opening of Parliament. The conspirators sought to replace James with his daughter, Elizabeth, who, they hoped, could be forced to convert to Catholicism. One of the conspirators, however, leaked information regarding the plot, which was then foiled. Terrified, James refused to leave his residence for many days. Guy Fawkes, who was to be the one lighting the gunpowder, was tortured on the rack until he revealed the identities of the other conspirators, all of whom were executed or killed during capture. Dolls of Guy Fawkes are still burned each 5 November, which is known as Guy Fawkes, or bonfire, Night, to commemorate the plot.

===Conflict with Parliament and death===

Following the dissolution of the Addled Parliament, James ruled without a Parliament for seven years. Faced with financial difficulties due to the failure of Parliament to approve new taxes, James sought to enter into a profitable alliance with Spain by marrying his eldest surviving son, Charles, to the daughter of the King of Spain. The proposed alliance with a Roman Catholic kingdom was not well received in Protestant England.  James's unpopularity was increased by the execution of Sir Walter Raleigh.

James lapsed into senility during the last year of his reign. Real power passed to his son, Charles, and to the Duke of Buckingham, although James kept enough power to ensure that a new war with Spain did not occur while he was King. James died at Theobalds House in 1625 of 'tertian ague' (fever one day in every three), probably brought upon by kidney failure and stroke. He was buried in the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Charles succeeded him as Charles I.

===Issue===

James's children included Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (who died aged 18 in 1612), Elizabeth, Margaret Stuart (who died in infancy), Charles, Mary and two more children who died in infancy (Robert and Sophia).

==Charles I (1625-1649)==
[[Image:Carolus I.jpg|160px|thumb|Charles I]]
Charles I was born at Dunfermline Palace on 19 November 1600. He was the second son of James I and Anne of Denmark. He was King of England, Scotland and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649. He famously engaged in a struggle for power with the Parliament of England. He was a supporter of the Divine Right of Kings, and many in England feared that he was attempting to gain absolute power. There was widespread opposition to many of his actions, especially the levying of taxes without Parliament's consent. Religious conflicts continued throughout Charles's reign. He selected his Catholic wife, Henrietta Maria, over the objections of Parliament and public opinion.

The last years of Charles' reign were marked by the English Civil War, in which he was opposed by the forces of Parliament, who challenged his attempts to increase his own power, and by Puritans, who were hostile to his religious policies. The war ended in defeat for Charles, who was subsequently tried, convicted and executed for high treason. The monarchy was overthrown, and a commonwealth was established.

===Early life and reign===

Charles was not as well-regarded as his elder brother, Henry. However, when his elder brother died of typhoid in 1612, Charles became heir to the throne and was later made Prince of Wales. Charles ascended the throne in March 1625 and on 1 May of that year married to Henrietta Maria, who was nine years his junior. She was a sister of King Louis XIII of France. His first Parliament, which he opened in May, was opposed to his marriage to Henrietta Maria, a Roman Catholic, because it feared that Charles would lift restrictions on Roman Catholics and undermine the official establishment of Protestantism. Although he agreed with Parliament that he would not relax restrictions relating to recusants, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with Louis XIII. Charles and his wife had nine children, with three sons and three daughters surviving infancy.

===Personal Rule===

In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the Parliament which had been prorogued in June 1628. He hoped that, with the Duke of Buckingham gone, Parliament, which had been refusing to let him raise taxes, would finally cooperate with him and grant him further subsidies. Instead, members of the House of Commons began to voice their opposition to the levying of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary consent. When he requested a parliamentary adjournment in March, members held the Speaker down in his chair whilst three resolutions against Charles were read aloud. The last of these resolutions declared that anyone who paid tonnage or poundage not authorized by Parliament would &quot;be reputed a betrayer of the liberties of England, and an enemy to the same&quot;. Though the resolution was not formally passed, many members declared their approval. Afterward, when the Commons passed further measures, Charles commanded the dissolution of Parliament.

Charles decided that he could not rely on Parliament for further monetary aid. Immediately, he made peace with France and Spain. The following eleven years, during which Charles ruled without a Parliament, have been known as the Eleven Years Tyranny.

In the meantime Charles still had to get funds to maintain his treasury. Relying on an all but forgotten feudal statute passed in 1278, requiring anyone who earned £40 or more each year to present himself at the King's coronation so that he may join the royal army as a knight, Charles fined everyone who failed to attend his coronation in 1626. He reintroduced the feudal tax known as ship money, which was even more unpopular. A writ issued in 1634 ordered the collection of ship money in peacetime, although laws passed when Edward I and Edward III were on the throne said it should not be collected in peacetime. This action of demanding ship money in peacetime led to a rebellion which forced him to call parliament into session by 1640.

===Short and Long Parliaments===

A dispute with the Churches in Scotland meant that Charles needed more money. He therefore had to end his personal rule and recall Parliament in April 1640. Although Charles offered to repeal ship money, the House of Commons demanded the discussion of various abuses of power during the period of Charles's personal rule. Parliament refused to help Charles and it was dissolved in May 1640, less than a month after it assembled. It became known as the Short Parliament. Charles still tried to defeat the Scots, but failed. The peace treaty he agreed required the King to pay the expenses of the Scottish army he had just fought. Charles took the unusual step of summoning the ''magnum concilium'', the ancient council of all the Peers of the Realm, who were considered the King's hereditary counsellors. The ''magnum concilium'' had not been summoned in centuries, and it has not been summoned since Charles's reign. On the advice of the peers, Charles summoned another Parliament, which became known as the Long Parliament.

The Long Parliament assembled in November 1640 and proved just as difficult to negotiate with as the Short Parliament. To prevent the King from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required that Parliament was to be summoned at least once every three years. In May 1641, he assented to an even more far-reaching Act, which provided that Parliament could not be dissolved without its own consent. Charles was forced into one concession after another. Ship money, fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans were declared unlawful, and the hated Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. Although he made several important concessions, Charles improved his own military position by securing the favour of the Scots. He finally agreed to the official establishment of Presbyterianism, and in return got considerable anti-parliamentary support.

The House of Commons then threatened to impeach Charles' Catholic Queen, Henrietta Maria, finally leading the King to take desperate action. His wife persuaded him to arrest the five members of the House of Commons who led the anti-Stuart faction on charges of high treason, but, when the King had made his decision, she made the mistake of telling a friend who, in turn, told Parliament. Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed force on 4 January 1642, but found that his opponents had already escaped. Many in Parliament thought Charles's actions outrageous, but others had similar sentiments about the actions of Parliament itself. Several members of the House of Commons left to join the royalist party, leaving the King's opponents with a majority. It was no longer safe for Charles to be in London, and he went north to raise an army against Parliament. The Queen, at the same time, went abroad to raise money to pay for it.

===Civil war===

The English Civil War had not yet started, but both sides began to arm. Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642. He then set up his court at Oxford, from where he controlled roughly the north and west of England, Parliament remaining in control of London and the south and east. The Civil War started on 25 October 1642 with the inconclusive Battle of Edgehill and continued indecisively through 1643 and 1644, until the Battle of Naseby tipped the military balance decisively in favour of Parliament. There followed a great number of defeats for the Royalists, and then the Siege of Oxford, from which Charles escaped in April 1646. He put himself into the hands of the Scottish Presbyterian army at Newark, and was taken to nearby Southwell while his &quot;hosts&quot; decided what to do with him. The Presbyterians finally arrived at an agreement with Parliament and delivered Charles to them in 1647. He was imprisoned at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire, but was soon transferred to a number of different locations. 

===Trial and execution===

Charles was finally moved to Windsor Castle and then St James's Palace. In January 1649, the House of Commons without the assent of either the Sovereign or the House of Lords—passed an Act of Parliament creating a court for Charles's trial. The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 Commissioners (all firm Parliamentarians). The King's trial (on charges of high treason and &quot;other high crimes&quot;) began on 2 January, but Charles refused to enter a plea, claiming that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch. It was then normal practice to take a refusal to plead as an admission of guilt, which meant that the prosecution could not call witnesses to its case. Fifty-nine of the Commissioners signed Charles's death warrant on 29 January, 1649. After the ruling, he was led from St. James's Palace, where he was confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the Banqueting House.

Charles was beheaded on 30 January, 1649. One of the revolutionary leaders, Oliver Cromwell, allowed the King's head to be sewn back on his body so the family could pay its respects. Charles was buried in private and at night on 7 February 1649, in the Henry VIII vault inside St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Charles was father to a total of nine legitimate children, two of whom would eventually succeed him as king. Several other children died in childhood.

==Interregnum (1649-1660)==

The English Interregnum was the period of parliamentary and military rule after the English Civil War, between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the restoration of Charles II in 1660.

This era in English history can be divided into four periods:
# The first period of the Commonwealth of England from 1649 until 1653
# The Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell from 1653 to 1659
# The Protectorate under Richard Cromwell in 1659
# The second period of the Commonwealth of England from 1659 until 1660

===Life during the Interregnum===

Four years after Charles I's execution, Oliver Cromwell was offered the Crown. But he refused and chose instead to rule as Lord Protector. Oliver Cromwell was a Puritan and during the Interregnum, he imposed a very strict form of Christianity upon the country. Cromwell granted religious freedom otherwise previously unknown in England, but other forms of expression were suddenly limited (for instance, theatre, which had thrived under the Stuart kings and Elizabeth I, was banned).  Cromwell also imposed his own personal vision of Christianity on the masses, with feasts on days of fast disallowed and work on Sundays subject to fine. Richard Cromwell was the successor to his father. But he gave up his position as Lord Protector with little hesitation, resigning or &quot;abdicating&quot; after a demand by the Rump Parliament. This was the beginning of a short period of restoration of the Commonwealth of England, and Charles I's son, also called Charles, was soon invited back as king.

==Charles II (1660-1685)==
[[Image:Charles II of England.png|thumb|160px|Charles II]]
Charles II was born in St James's Palace on 29 May 1630. Charles was the eldest surviving son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France. He was the King of Scots from 30 January 1649 and King of England and Ireland from 29 May 1660 until his death on 6 February 1685. Unlike his father Charles I, Charles II  was skilled at managing the Parliament of England, so much so that Charles is still considered one of England's greatest kings. It was during his reign that the Whig and Tory political parties developed. He famously fathered numerous illegitimate children, of whom he acknowledged fourteen. Known as the &quot;Merry Monarch&quot;, Charles was a patron of the arts.

===Restoration===

After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, Charles's chances of regaining the Crown seemed slim. Oliver Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, Richard Cromwell. However, the new Lord Protector abdicated in 1659. The Protectorate of England was abolished, and the Commonwealth of England established. During the civil and military unrest which followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy and sought to restore the monarchy. Monck and his army marched into the City of London and forced the Long Parliament to dissolve itself. For the first time in almost twenty years, the members of Parliament faced a general election. A Royalist House of Commons was elected. The Convention Parliament, soon after it assembled on 25 April 1660, heard about the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles agreed, amongst other things, to pardon many of his father's enemies. It subsequently declared that Charles II had been the lawful Sovereign since Charles I's execution in 1649.

Charles set out for England, arriving in Dover on 23 May 1660 and reaching London on 29 May. Although Charles granted amnesty to Cromwell's supporters in the ''Act of Indemnity and Oblivion'', he went back on his pardon of the commissioners and officials involved in his father's trial and execution. Many among those who signed Charles I's death warrant were executed in 1660 in the most gruesome fashion: they were hanged, drawn and quartered. Others were given life imprisonment. The body of Oliver Cromwell was also &quot;executed&quot;.

The Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660. Shortly after Charles's coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661, the second Parliament of the reign, the Cavalier Parliament, met. As the Cavalier Parliament was overwhelmingly Royalist, Charles saw no reason to dissolve it and force another general election for seventeen years.

===Foreign policy===

In 1662 Charles married a Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza, who brought him the territories of Bombay and Tangier as dowry. During the same year, however, he sold Dunkirk, a much more valuable strategic outpost to his cousin King Louis XIV of France of France for £40,000. In 1668, England allied itself with Sweden, and with its former enemy the Netherlands, in order to oppose Louis XIV in the War of Devolution. Louis was forced to make peace with the Triple Alliance, but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions. In 1670, Charles, seeking to solve his financial troubles, agreed to the Treaty of Dover, under which Louis XIV would pay him £200,000 each year. Meanwhile, around 1670, Charles granted the British East India Company the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops, to form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas in India. Earlier in 1668 he leased the islands of Bombay for a paltry sum of ten pounds sterling paid in gold.

===Great Plague and Fire===

In 1665, Charles II was faced with a great health crisis: an outbreak of Bubonic Plague in London commonly referred to as the Great Plague of London. The death toll at one point reached 7000 per week. Charles, his family and court fled from London in July 1665 to Oxford. Various attempts at containing the disease by London public health officials all fell in vain and the disease continued to spread rapidly. On 2 September 1666 came the Great Fire of London. Although it ended the Great Plague by burning of plague-carrying rats and fleas, the fire consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including the original St. Paul's Cathedral.

===Conflict with Parliament===

Charles's wife Queen Catherine was unable to produce an heir. Charles's heir was therefore his unpopular Roman Catholic brother, James. In 1678, Titus Oates, a former Anglican cleric, falsely warned of a &quot;Popish Plot&quot; to kill the king and replace him with James. Charles did not believe the story, but ordered his chief minister to investigate. He, however, was an anti-Catholic, and encouraged Oates to make his accusations public. The people were seized with an anti-Catholic hysteria; judges and juries across the land condemned the supposed conspirators; numerous innocent individuals were executed. Later in 1678, however, the chief minister was impeached by the House of Commons on the charge of high treason. To save Lord Danby from the impeachment trial in the House of Lords, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679. A new Parliament, which met in March of the same year, was quite hostile to the king, and this led to the chief minister being forced to resign and being held prisoner in the Tower of London.

===Later years===

The Parliament of 1679 was elected at a time when there were strong anti-Catholic sentiments. It was opposed to the prospect of a Catholic monarch. An Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude James from the line of succession, was introduced. The &quot;Abhorrers&quot;, those who opposed the Exclusion Bill, would develop into the Tory Party, whilst the &quot;Petitioners&quot;, those who supported the Exclusion Bill, became the Whig Party. Fearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed, Charles dissolved Parliament in December 1679. Two further Parliaments were called in Charles's reign (one in 1680, the other in 1681), but both were dissolved because they sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill began to dissolve, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled as an absolute monarch, without a Parliament.

In 1685 Charles died suddenly. When he knew he was dying and in great secrecy, a priest was summoned to his bedside. Charles was admitted into the Catholic Church and received the last rites. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his brother, who became James II in England and Ireland, and James VII in Scotland.

==James II (1685-1688)==
[[Image:James_II_of_England.jpg|thumb|right|160px|James II]]
James II of England and VII of Scotland was born at St James's Palace on 14 October 1633. He was the second surviving son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France. He became King of England, King of Scots and King of Ireland on 6 February 1685. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over England, Scotland and Ireland. Some of his subjects distrusted his religious policies and alleged despotism, leading a group of them to depose him in the Glorious Revolution. He was replaced not by his Roman Catholic son, James Francis Edward, but by his Protestant daughter and son-in-law, Mary II and William III, who became joint rulers in 1689. The belief that James remained the legitimate ruler became known as Jacobitism (from ''Jacobus'', the Latin for James). However, James did not try to return to the throne, instead living the rest of his life under the protection of King Louis XIV of France. His son James Francis Edward Stuart and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart (''Bonnie Prince Charlie'') attempted to restore the Jacobite line after James's death on 16 September 1701, but failed.

===Early life===

Like his brother, James sought refuge in France during the Interregnum, and he served in the French army. In 1656, when his brother, Charles, entered into an alliance with Spain, an enemy of France, he joined the Spanish army. Both armies praised James's abilities. In 1660, Charles II was restored to the English Throne, and James returned to England with him. Though he was the heir, it seemed unlikely then that he would inherit the Crown, as it was thought that Charles would have legitimate children. In September 1660, James married Lady Anne Hyde, the daughter of Charles's then chief minister, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon.

===Religion===

James was admitted to the Roman Catholic Church in 1668 or 1669. His Protestant enemies in the Parliament of England then passed the Test Act, which made all civil and military officials swear an oath against certain practices of the Roman Catholic Church and receive communion in the Church of England. James refused to do this and gave up his post of Lord High Admiral as a result. Charles II opposed James's conversion, and ordered James's children be raised as Protestants, but in 1673, he allowed James (whose first wife had died in 1671) to marry the Catholic Mary of Modena.

In 1677, James allowed his daughter, Mary, to marry the Protestant Prince of Orange, William III, who was also his nephew. However, fears of a Catholic monarch remained, and got greater as Charles II's wife continued to fail to provide an heir.

===Reign and the Glorious Revolution===

Charles died without legitimate offspring in 1685, and James became king. At first, there was little opposition to him and many Anglicans supported him as the legitimate monarch. The new Parliament which assembled in May 1685 seemed favourable to James, agreeing to grant him a large income. James, however, faced the Monmouth Rebellion, which was led by Charles II's illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth declared himself King on 20 June 1685, but was defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor. Monmouth was executed at the Tower of London soon after. Despite the lack of popular support for Monmouth, James began to distrust his subjects. His judges, most notably Judge Jeffreys (the &quot;Hanging Judge&quot;), punished the rebels brutally. Judge Jeffreys' Bloody Assizes led the people to see their King as a cruel and barbarous ruler. To protect himself from further rebellions, James sought to establish a large standing army. By putting Roman Catholics in charge of several regiments, the King was drawn into a conflict with Parliament. Parliament was prorogued in November 1685, never to meet again during James's reign.

Religious tension intensified in 1686. In the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687, he suspended laws punishing Roman Catholics and other religious dissenters. In April 1688, James re-issued the Declaration of Indulgence, and ordered Anglican clergymen to read it in their churches. When the Archbishop of Canterbury and six other bishops petitioned for a change in the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel, but were acquitted. Public alarm increased with the birth of a Catholic son and heir, James Francis Edward, to Queen Mary in June, 1688. Several leading Protestants then entered into negotiations with William, Prince of Orange, who was James's son-in-law, for him to invade and become king. By September, it had become clear that William was looking to invade. James believed his army could fight them off, but when William landed on 5 November 1688, all of the King's Protestant officers went over to William's side. On 11 December, James attempted to flee to France. He was caught in Kent, but allowed to escape to France on 23 December.

When James left, no Parliament was in session, so William convened a Convention Parliament. The Convention declared on 12 February 1689 that James's attempt to flee on 11 December meant that he had abdicated and that the throne had then become vacant (instead of passing to James II's son, James Francis Edward). James's daughter Mary was declared Queen. She was to rule jointly with her husband William III. The Scottish Estates followed suit on 11 April.

William and Mary then granted their assent to the Bill of Rights. This confirmed that William III and Mary II were to be King and Queen. It also charged James II with abusing his power by suspending the Test Acts, the prosecuting of the Seven Bishops for petitioning the Crown, establishing a standing army and imposing cruel punishments. The Act also set out who would be heirs to the Crown. First were any children of William and Mary, to be followed by the Princess Anne and her children, and finally by the children of William by any subsequent marriage.

===Later years and legacy===

With a French army on his side, James landed in Ireland in March 1689. The Irish Parliament did not follow the example of the English Parliament and instead declared that James remained King. He was, however, defeated at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690. He fled back to France after the defeat departing. In France, James was allowed to live in a royal castle. An attempt was made to restore him to the throne by killing William III in 1696, but the plot failed. Louis XIV's offer to have James elected King of Poland was rejected, after which Louis no longer helped James. He died in 1701 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where he was buried.

The son of James II, James Francis Edward Stuart (known to his supporters as &quot;James III and VIII&quot; and to his opponents as the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;), took up the Jacobite cause. He led a rising in Scotland in 1715 shortly after George I became king, but was defeated. Further risings were also defeated. After the rising of 1745 led by Charles Edward Stuart, no serious attempt to restore the Stuart heir has been made.

James Francis Edward died in 1766, when he was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles Edward Stuart (known to his supporters as &quot;Charles III&quot; and to his opponents as the &quot;Young Pretender&quot;).  Charles in turn was succeeded by his younger brother Henry Benedict Stuart, a cardinal of the Catholic Church.  Henry was the last of James II's legitimate descendants.

===Children===

James had eight children by Anne Hyde, of whom only two, Mary and Anne, survived infancy. They became the next two Queens. By Mary of Modena he had six children, two of whom survived infancy. The most famous of his children by Mary of Modena was James Franci Edward Stuart. He also had a number of illegitimate children.

==William III (1689-1702) and Mary II (1689-1694)==

After the Glorious Revolution, William III and his wife, Mary II, became joint rulers.

===William===
[[Image:William_III_of_England.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William III]]
William was born in The Hague in the Netherlands on 14 November 1650. He was the son of William II, Prince of Orange, and Mary Stuart. He was Dutch aristocrat and a Protestant Prince of Orange from his birth. He was King William III of England and of Ireland from 13 February 1689, and William II, King of Scots from 11 April 1689 in each case until his death on 8 March 1702.

Eight days before he was born, his father died from battle wounds, and so William became the Sovereign Prince of Orange at the moment of his birth. On 23 December 1660, when William was just ten years old, his mother died of smallpox while visiting her brother, King Charles II in England. In her will, Mary made Charles William's legal guardian. Charles passed on this responsibility to William's paternal grandmother, the Princess Dowager Amalia, with the understanding that Charles's advice would be sought whenever it was needed. In 1666, when William was sixteen, the States General of the United Provinces of the Netherlands officially made him a ward of the government, or as William himself called it, a &quot;Child of State&quot;.  This was one in order to prepare William for a role in the nation's government.  When his time as the government's ward ended three years later, William returned to private life.

===Mary===
[[Image:mary_ii_england.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Mary II]]
Mary II was born in London on 30 April 1662. She was the eldest daughter of James II and his first wife, Lady Anne Hyde. She reigned as Queen of England and Ireland from 13 February 1689 until her death on 28 December 1694, and as Queen of Scotland from 11 April 1689 until her death. Mary came to the throne after the Glorious Revolution. Mary reigned jointly with her husband and first cousin, William III, who became the sole ruler upon her death. Mary, although a sovereign in her own right, did not wield power during most of her reign. She did, however, govern the realm when her husband was abroad fighting wars.

James II converted to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne were order by Charles II to have a Protestant upbringing, pursuant to the command of Charles II. At the age of fifteen, Princess Mary became engaged to the Protestant Stadtholder and Prince of Orange, William. William was the son of her aunt and Prince William II of Nassau. They married in London on 4 November 1677. Mary went to the Netherlands, where she lived with her husband. She did not enjoy a happy marriage, with her three pregnancies ended in miscarriage or stillbirth. She became popular with the Dutch people, but her husband neglected or even mistreated her and had an affair with one of Mary's ladies-in-waiting.

===Reign===

Although most in England accepted William as Sovereign, he faced considerable opposition in Scotland and Ireland. The Scottish Jacobites, who believed that James II remained the legitimate monarch, won a stunning victory on 27 July 1689 at the Battle of Killiecrankie, but were later beaten  within a month. William's reputation suffered after the Massacre of Glencoe in 1692, when almost one hundred Scots were murdered for not properly pledging their allegiance to the new King and Queen. Accepting public opinion, William sacked those responsible for the massacre, though they still remained in his favour.

In Ireland, where the French aided the rebels, fighting continued for much longer, although James II fled the island after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. This Battle is still commemorated each year by the Protestants in Northern Ireland. After the Anglo-Dutch Navy defeated a French fleet at in 1692, the naval supremacy of the English became apparent, and Ireland was conquered shortly after. 

From 1690 onwards, William often remained absent from England. Whilst her husband was away, Mary ruled. She was a firm ruler, and even ordered the arrest of her own uncle for plotting to restore James II to the throne. In 1692, she dismissed and imprisoned the influential John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough on similar charges. In this case the dismissal reduced her popularity and harmed her relationship with her sister Anne. When William was in England, Mary stepped aside from politics. She did, however, get involved in the affairs of the Church, in particular with Church appointments. Mary died of smallpox in 1694. After Mary II's death, William III continued to rule as king. Although he had previously mistreated his wife and kept mistresses, William deeply mourned his wife's death. Although he was brought up as a Calvinist, he converted to Anglicanism, but his popularity fell greatly during his reign as a sole Sovereign.

===William as sole ruler===

William, like many other European rulers, became concerned about who would succeed to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the Low Countries and the New World. The question became important as The King of Spain, Charles II, was an invalid with no prospect of having children, and had amongst his closest relatives Louis XIV, the King of France, and Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor. William wanted to stop either of these inheriting all Spanish lands. William and Louis XIV agreed to the First Partition Treaty, which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire: Duke Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria (whom William himself chose) would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them. The Spaniards, however, wanted to keep the Spanish territories united.

After Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox, William and Louis In 1700, the two rulers agreed to the Second Partition Treaty in 1700, under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor. This infuriated both the Spanish, who wanted the empire intact, and the Holy Roman Emperor, who wanted the Italian territories. Unexpectedly, King Charles II of Spain changed his will as he lay dying in late 1700. He left all Spanish territories to Philip, a grandson of Louis. The French ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance. Louis also angered William by recognising James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of the former King James II, who had died in 1701, as King of England. The subsequent conflict, known as the War of the Spanish Succession, continued until 1713.

Princess Anne's last surviving child, William, Duke of Gloucester, died in July 1700, and, as it was clear that William III would have no more children, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement in 1701, which provided that the Crown would go to the nearest Protestant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover and her Protestant heirs. When William III died in 1702.

===William's death===

In 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone, resulting from a fall off his horse. It was believed by some that his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, and as a result many Jacobites toasted &quot;the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat&quot;. William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife. He was succeeded by Queen Anne.

==Anne (1702-1714)==
[[Image:queen_anne_england.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Anne]]
Anne was born in St James's Palace on 6 February 1665. She was the second daughter of James, who went on to become James II, and his first wife, Lady Anne Hyde. She was Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland from 8 March 1702 until her death on 1 August 1714. Anne was the last monarch of the House of Stuart. She was succeeded by a distant cousin, George I. Anne's reign saw the two party political system develop.

===Early life===

On 28 July 1683, Anne married the Protestant Prince George of Denmark, brother of the Danish King Christian V. The union was unpopular because Denmark was pro-France union, but it was a happy one for Anne and George. Sarah Churchill became Anne's lady of the bedchamber, and, by the latter's desire to mark their mutual intimacy and affection, all deference due to her rank was abandoned and the two ladies called each other Mrs Morley and Mrs Freeman. Sarah remained Anne's closest friend, and later married John Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough. However, they had a falling out and Sarah was banned from court during the War of the Spanish Succession, when her husband was leading the English armies in the War.

By 1700, Anne had been pregnant at least eighteen times. Thirteen times, she miscarried or gave birth to stillborn children. Of the remaining five children, four died before reaching the age of two years. Her only son to survive infancy, William, Duke of Gloucester, died at the age of eleven on 29 July 1700. William and Mary did not have any children, and therefore Anne was the only individual remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights. If the line ended, then the deposed King James may have reclaimed the Throne. To stop a Roman Catholic from becoming king, Parliament enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that the Crown would go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her descendants, who descended from James I of England through Elizabeth of Bohemia.

===Early reign===

William III died on 8 March 1702, leaving the Crown to Anne.  At about the same time, the War of the Spanish Succession began. It would continue until the last years of Anne's reign, and would dominate both foreign and domestic policy. Soon after becoming Queen, Anne made her husband Lord High Admiral in control of the Royal Navy. Control of the army went to Lord Marlborough. The Duchess of Marlborough was appointed to the post of Mistress of the Robes, the highest office a lady could attain.

Anne's first government was mostly Tory. The Whigs, who were, unlike the Tories, big supporters of the Warm became more influential after the Duke of Marlborough won a great victory at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. The Whigs quickly rose to power, and almost all the Tories were removed from the ministry. The Act of Union between England and Scotland was then passed. Under the Act, England and Scotland became one realm called Great Britain on 1 May 1707.

The Duchess of Marlborough's relationship with Anne worsened during 1707. Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark, then died in October 1708, after which Anne grew even more distant from the Duchess of Marlborough. The Queen ended their friendship in 1709.

The fall of the Whigs came about quickly as the expensive War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular in England. In the general election of 1710, the electorate returned a large Tory majority. The new Tory government began to seek peace in the War of the Spanish Succession. The Tories were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the grandson of the French King, but the Whigs could not bear to see a Bourbon on the Spanish Throne. The dispute was resolved by outside events, when the elder brother of Archduke Charles (whom the Whigs supported) conveniently died in 1711 and Archduke Charles then inherited Austria, Hungary and the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. To also give him the Spanish throne was no longer in Great Britain's interests, as he would become too powerful. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 provided that peace, although it only got ratified by Great Britain when Anne created twelve new peers in one day to make sure it had enough support in the House of Lords.

Under the terms of the ratified treaty, Philip, grandson of the French King Louis XIV, was allowed to remain on the Throne of Spain, and kept Spain's New World colonies. The rest of the Spanish territories, however, wer spliy amongst various European princes. Great Britain kept of Gibraltar and Minorca, and got some French colonies in North America.

===Death and legacy===

Anne died of an abscess and fever arising from gout, at approximately on 1 August 1714. Her body was so swollen that it had to be buried in Westminster Abbey in a vast almost-square coffin. She died shortly after the Electress Sophia (8 June 1714) and so the Electress's son, George, became king of Great Britain.

Anne's reign saw greater influence in government by ministers and a decrease in the influence of the Crown. In 1708, Anne became the last British Sovereign to withhold the Royal Assent from a bill. The shift of power from the Crown to the ministry became even more apparent during the reign of George I, whose chief advisor, Sir Robert Walpole, is often described as the first Prime Minister. The age of Anne was also one of artistic, literary and scientific advancement. In architecture, Sir John Vanbrugh constructed elegant buildings such as Blenheim Palace (the home of the Marlboroughs) and Castle Howard. Writers such as Daniel Defoe, Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift flourished during Anne's reign. Sir Isaac Newton also lived during Anne's reign, although he had reached his most important discoveries under William and Mary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intro and Syntax ==


Getkey is an important feature of user interaction in TI-Basic.
getkey could be found in PGRM...Right...7...
and it will display the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
:getkey
&lt;/pre&gt;
Yes, and it will get the number of the key when that code block
is excuted. However, that getkey is very short and therefore,
it is hard to get a accurate key number. Because if you don't press
anything during it's being excuted, it will result in 0.

Keep in mind that with out doing some sort of,

&lt;pre&gt;
:getkey-&gt;X
&lt;/pre&gt;

the getkey will store its result in the Ans variable.


== Getkey with While and Goto Loops ==

How do you get an accurate recording?

well, there is a simple while loop that you could do. 
It's fairly easy so I'll explain it right here...

&lt;pre&gt;
:While 1
:getkey
:If ans
:
''Things to do''
:
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;

That works because first, you set up a loop.
And if there is nothing pressed, it will skip the if condition, then it will excute anything else below it in order.
See, if getkey returned a 0, then the calculator skips the if
condition, goes right back to the top which now again, checks for a getkey.
so this continues on till you press a key!

== Notifying a pressed button ==



This example will display &quot;BUTTON PRESSED&quot; when a button is pressed.

&lt;pre&gt;
:0&amp;rarr;K
:While K=0
:getKey&amp;rarr;K
:End
:Disp &quot;BUTTON PRESSED&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, I'll explain Line by Line...

&lt;pre&gt;
:Lbl K
&lt;/pre&gt;
that Lbl K is used so that could always loop back when you need to get the
number of key being pressed. It will make possible for a loop.

&lt;pre&gt;
:getkey&amp;rarr;K
&lt;/pre&gt;

This, is the most important part. You need the getkey to get the key number!
the '&amp;rarr;K' will store the returned value of getkey to the variable 'K'.

&lt;pre&gt;
:While K&gt;0
&lt;/pre&gt;
this while loop is also essential because you want certain things to happen
ONLY when a key is pressed. Thus, the key value is in K, it will check if K is
actually greater than 0. If it is, it will excute the code block 'Disp &quot;BUTTON PRESSED&quot;'.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Disp &quot;BUTTON PRESSED&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
You also need this in order to actually see that the button is being pressed.
When ever the While loop is excuted, the Disp command will be excuted, displaying a notice...

&lt;pre&gt;
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Possible mistake ==


This is the most important part of this code block.
If there isn't an End, this is the result...

&lt;pre&gt;
:Lbl K
:getkey-&gt;K
:While K&gt;0
:Disp &quot;BUTTON PRESSED&quot;
:
:Goto K
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now do you notice any flaw? YES!

Do you think that this code will repeat itself? NO!

Do you know why it won't repeat it self?
It won't repeat it self BECAUSE the 'End' isn't there!
Even though it has a 'Goto K' statement, its still in the
While loop, thus, if there is not keypress, that 'Goto K' won't be
excuted, resulting in quitting the program.
It's essential that you include the 'End' whenever you need to exit from a 
while loop.

== Displaying the corresponding key number with the pressed key ==


For example, this will display the key number being pressed...
You could use this as a little tool in your calculators. Just press the button you want, and it'll display its corresponding key number.
Here is goes;

&lt;pre&gt;
:Lbl 1
:getKey
:If Ans &gt; 0
:Disp Ans
:Goto 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Corresponding to specific keys ==



Now, if you want to respond to specific keys, such as the 2nd or Enter,
you change '&gt;0' to '=N' where N is the key number.
the chart is shown here:


[[Image:getkey.gif]]


Do you notice anything weird? Yes! The On is not &quot;registered&quot;. Instead of returning an integer for this key, this key will return an interrupt, meaning that it will interrupt the program. There are ASM utilities to block this On key. They are widely available at [http://www.ticalc.org TI-Calc.Org]. Anyway, look at other keys. Do you see how they are organized?


== Key organization and numbering ==


Yes, each row starts with 11...21...31...41...51...61...71...81...91...101...
and that's because then, it's easy to remember.

Here, let's use some example...

&lt;pre&gt;
:Lbl 1
:getkey
:If Ans = 11
:Disp &quot;Y= was PRESSED&quot;
:If Ans = 21
:Disp &quot;2ND WAS PRESSED&quot;
:Goto 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

the code should be self-explanatory. It checks for keys 11 or 21 being pressed and displays a corresponding message.

== Moving Pixels with Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows ==


Is the Disp thingy boring for you?
Well, let's move on and move things!

For now, we'll just move a pixel, but
as you go on, practice and get complicated!

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrDraw
:47&amp;rarr;X:31&amp;rarr;Y
:Lbl 1
:getKey&amp;rarr;K
:If K=25
:ClrDraw
:Y-1&amp;rarr;Y
:Pxl-On(Y,X)
:End
:If K=34
:ClrDraw
:Y+1&amp;rarr;Y
:Pxl-On(Y,X)
:End
:If K=24
:X-1&amp;rarr;X
:Pxl-On (Y,X)
:End
:If K=26
:X+1&amp;rarr;X
:Pxl-On (Y,X)
:End
:Goto 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, the preceding code just moved a single pixel on the screen.

== ERR-MEMORY ==
If you just pressed the buttons like crazy, and you got a error message saying: ERR-MEMORY then you're out of luck. The (dreaded) memory error is the worst feature about BASIC compared to Asm, because any BASIC program will eventually slow down and stop with a memory error if run for long enough. Main cause of memory errors: INEFFICIENT CODE and long program running time. Note that with efficient code, the running time will be much longer... here is an example of inefficient code:
&lt;pre&gt;
:0-&gt;A
:While A&lt;10
:A+1-&gt;A
:If A=5:Goto X
:End
:Lbl X
&lt;/pre&gt;
Why? The Goto label quits the While loop, but it sits in memory because it never reached the 'End' command (simply placing 'End' after Lbl X in the code above does NOT work! So mainly, to optimize your code get rid of Goto's and Lbl's they are bad for you and your program! instead replace them with more efficient Repeat, While, and For loops.
hey sorry but i made an equation set that does the samething but is faster and ahorter
1-&gt;B
1-&gt;C
Lbl0
Output(B,C,&quot;A
getkey-&gt;A
B-(A=25)+(B=34-&gt;B
C-(A=24)=(A=26-&gt;C
Goto0
storing values in B and C
Label 0
Outputs A in the coordinates
getkeys and stores in A
the equations are self explanatory if you know the key codes
and finally goto label0
hope that helps!

== cookbook pics ==

Hi! Photos for the cookbook should go on commons, provided the licensing is kosher. You should also take a look at [[Cookbook:Policy]] and [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]] to see what sort of formatting/organizational systems we have going. Yay!

:I'm a wanderer from another place too!  It really is different here - stick around &amp; in a week you will meet everyone!  There are some good people here but their ways are not like WP I promise you. BTW I &quot;delivered&quot; our attempt at community spirit too - input welcome.  Point me to the existing Spanish page (unless it floats past RC you'll be quicker) - equally ask in the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] (almost everything happens there).  I'll certainly help if I can - it is possible to make a difference here (IMO) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

Add all my &quot;bads&quot; together and you would have worthwhile collection.  IRC - yeah I keep getting nudged, part of the problem is that some of the time I am online at work and while a bit of vandalism is not that bad a chat with all the people there are might take an embarrassing amount of time.  BTW I agree with much of your user page (wp) - the rant particularly but some other stuff too --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:22, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

== Things &amp; the world in general! ==

Hey - good to hear from you - I hope all is well with you - I haven't seen you around for a while either.

# Good book status - are you MAD?  Your book is '''so''' much better than much of the other content of Wikibooks (I know - I watch RC!).  Honestly I think it should be in &quot;good book&quot; status.
# Completeness.  Now there is a puzzle.  With fiction (in most cases) there is a beginning, a middle and an end.  For textbooks I think it is unlikely that even a print version will be truly complete in the eyes of the author (or indeed other knowledgeable parties - you study a book, it tells you everything, you pick the next one and it tells you something that was missing from the 1st one??!).  For Wikibooks I would risk criticism and say none of them will ever be complete.  Again your's is far more complete than many other offerings on Wikibooks (many are more notes on the subject than a coherent book).
# Fragments.  Yes awkward.  Handled fine though, it is clear what they are.  I guess my only thought would be to make &quot;Fragmentos para fusionar&quot; a link to a subpage which had links to the fragment.  Not sure if that gains you much?
# Interaction - well yes, Wikibooks is a little like that at times.  If you will pardon the obvious flaw, it is driven by inertia at times!  I confess I spend some time on Commons &amp; Meta as well these days (I cannot find it in me to get involved in WP).

I hope the world continues to revolve in a reasonable way for you - there are days when I wonder &amp; days when I doubt it &lt;g&gt;.  Slugs are my current enemy (I said in a mail to someone earlier - not quite as low as politicians and armament suppliers but when they eat my asparagus!).  Take care --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:57, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== RFA ==

Hello celestianpower. I just wanted to drop you a line about your RFA request. A few things:
#They never go quickly, so don't despair! A decision will be made eventually, and nobody has forgotten about it.
#[[User:Withinfocus]]' comments are not meant to be insulting, although I know that anything that isnt a &quot;support&quot; vote can feel a little like a personal insult. However, it isn't a negative, it's a positive: an invitation for you to be more active on our discussion pages. We can all see the wonderful work you've done on the spanish book, and we want you to share your wisdom with others. As a good suggestion, try adding the various staff lounge pages, the [[WB:VFD|VFD page]], and the [[WB:BB|bulletin board]], so that you can add your two cents when a topic comes up.
#There are only 4 or 5 votes now, we typically like to promote admins when they have closer to 7-10 votes. Of course, there is no firm limit, it really depends on alot of issues.
Anyway, let me know if you have any questions. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 22:02, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

:When I was nominated for adminship, a long long time ago it seems, It was because I was highly active on the VfD page. I hadn't written a single line of policy, and I had read about that much. All people want to see is that you are a &quot;community member&quot;, and there are plenty of ways to go about being one. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 22:27, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

You have a message on your WP talk, please reply.--[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:55, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

You are now an administrator on English Wikibooks.

:And from me - all the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:05, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

Congrats on becoming a moderator! I've seen your work on the Spanish wikibook, and I have to say, you might be the reason that the book reached featured status. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 21:24, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Featured Books ==

There are not alot of things that need to be done to make a book &quot;featured&quot;. There is no set number of votes, but i've been typically willing to feature a book if it has about 5 support votes and no oppose votes (more oppose votes typically mean we require more support votes to compensate). But there is no firm number needed, it's all up to the judgement of the person who is willing to say &quot;this is enough&quot;. 

Once the voting is declared, you need to do a few things:
#List the book title at [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] alphabetically
#Create a Featured book template at [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Templates]] at the top of the page.
#Once the template has an image and a suitable description, it can be moved to the bottom of the page, alphabetically.
#After a while, the main page templates can be expanded to include the new book (we typically wait for a few new books, so we can just include a new round into the main page).

If you need anything else, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 14:03, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

== Need es translator ==

Hey celestianpower, how are you? I'm in need of a spanish translator to post a message on es.wikibooks about the new logo discussions: [[meta:Wikibooks/Logo]] and [[meta:Wikijunior/Logo]]. The message would only need to be short, an announcement that we are in the process of selecting new logos, we are looking for submissions, and we are trying to get more wikibookians involved. Let me know if you can help with this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:12, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the quick reply! Frankly, so long as the message gets out, I don't care how readable it is. I just want to make sure that we get wikibookians involved. Here is a basic rundown of what the message should say:
::''Discussion is starting to select a new logo for [[meta:Wikibooks/Logo|Wikibooks]] and [[meta:Wikijunior/Logo|Wikijunior]] on meta. All Wikibookians are encouraged to participate.''
:Basically, it's just a short announcement about the discussion, and the links to the discussion pages. We are probably going to get complaints that the discussion pages themselves aren't spanish-friendly, but there isn't much we can do about that. Thanks again! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:33, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Advanced Menus */ replaced &quot;symbols&quot; with the actual special chars, removed stuff that should go on talk page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Menus are useful for user interaction. By using Menus, you can list several choices which the user can pick; each choice jumping to a different label.

==Menu()==
===Syntax===
 :Menu(&quot;Title&quot;,&quot;Choice1&quot;,Label1,&quot;Choice2&quot;,Label2,...,&quot;Choice7&quot;,Label7)
*In place of any text string, you may substitute a string variable name (e.g. Str0 or Str1)
*The title can be up to 16 (display) characters
*Each choice can be up to 14 characters, any additional characters are truncated
*Menus can have a limit of 7 options.  Attempting to add more options than 7 will result in an &quot;ARGUMENT&quot; error being displayed upon attempted command execution.

===Example===
 :Menu(&quot;Menu Title&quot;,&quot;Entry One&quot;,A,&quot;Entry Two&quot;,B,&quot;Entry Three&quot;,C)

If you've entered it in your Calc or VTI, it should display something like:
 Menu Title
 1:Entry One
 2:Entry Two
 3:Entry Three
with &quot;Menu Title&quot; highlighted. 

It looks best to center the title and fill in the rest with spaces, e.g. 
 Menu(&quot;    Pick One    &quot;,&quot;Choice 1&quot;,C1,...,&quot;Choice 7&quot;,C7)  // 4 spaces on each side
This way, the entire top line will be highlighted.

If you selected 1: and pressed enter, or pressed the 1 key, it should go to label A, if you selected 2: and pressed enter, it should go to label B, and so on. 

Menu function is an easy to use function. Just follow the syntax above and you'll be fine! It is equivalent to goto, except the user can choose what to do.

== Advanced Menus ==
The generic menu function allows for great use of static menus, but when more choices are needed or when more interactive, dynamic menus are needed this getKey method tends to work better.

&lt;pre&gt;
Delvar A                   // Deletes variable A
While not(A                // Begins While loop because nothing is stored to A
getKey→A                 // Stores keypress as A
Text(Y,X,&quot;Menu Header&quot;)    // Menu Title
Text(Y,X,&quot;1.First Option&quot;) // Displays menu options, repeat for more options
[...]                       // More options
[...]
End                        // End of While loop    
If A=(key press value)     // Defines which part of the code to execute
...                          by what value was stored in A with getKey
...
End                    //Represents end of the If block
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For this method to work getKey values are needed in order to correspond with which option the user sees. Alternatively, a simple cursor may be programmed into the menu. This allows for users to press the 2nd key or the enter key to select values:

&lt;pre&gt;
Delvar K1→C               //Deletes Key variable / Stores the cursor position
Output(0,0,&quot;Title            //Display the menu (this time using output)
Output(C,0,&quot;&gt;                //Cursor
Output(1,2,&quot;Menu Item #1     //Menu item
...                          //More possible menu items if necessary
...
Repeat K=21 or K=105     //Display the menu until user presses enter or 2nd
getKey→K                //K is usually the standard for storing the getKey value
If not(K                  //This is a fancy workaround to end the loop prematurely if no key
End                         was pressed. Usually makes the program run faster...
Output(C,0,&quot;              //Clears cursor by outputting a space
(C≠1)(C≠8)((K=34)-(K=25))+C→C         //Find new value for cursor
Output(C,0,&quot;&gt;             //Output new cursor position
End
...                       //Code for the rest of your program
...                       
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Fatigue&lt;/big&gt;

*Most frequent symptom in advanced cancer patients
*No data exist about frequency of fatigue in different tumors
*Etiology is unclear; autonomic failure has been implicated
*Management includes treatment of reversible causes (e.g. mood disorders, anemia)
*No pharmacologic trials have shown improvement in cancer-related fatigue


==Anti-cholinergics==
'''''Donepezil (Aricept)'''''
*'''MD Anderson; 2007''' PMID 17687152 -- &quot;Donepezil for cancer fatigue: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&quot; (Bruera E, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3475-81.)
**Randomized. 103/142 patients with fatigue score &gt;=4 (scale 0-10) for more than 1 week. Treated with 1) donepezil 5mg x 7days vs. 2) placebo. Everyone donepezil open label second week
**Outcome: No difference by FACIT-F or ESAS
**Conclusion: No difference from placebo


==Psychostimulants==
'''''Methylphenidate (Ritalin)'''''
*'''MD Anderson; 2006''' - PMID 16648508 &amp;mdash; &quot;Patient-Controlled Methylphenidate for Cancer Fatigue: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.&quot; Bruera E et al. JCO May 1 2006: 2073–2078.
**Randomized to 5 mg methylphenidate q2h as needed (patient controlled) vs placebo.
**No significant difference from placebo.


==Antidepresants==
'''''Paroxetine (Paxil)'''''
*'''Rochester; 2003''' PMID 14673053 -- &quot;Differential effects of paroxetine on fatigue and depression: a randomized, double-blind trial from the University of Rochester Cancer Center Community Clinical Oncology Program.&quot; (Morrow GR, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Dec 15;21(24):4635-41.)
**Randomized. 479/549 patients undergoing chemo for the first time, and reported fatigue at their 2nd cycle. Treated with 1) oral paroxetine 20mg qd x8 weeks vs. 2) placebo
**Outcome: No difference in fatigue between groups; but benefit in depression score
**Conclusion: No impact on fatigue</text>

==Dyspnea==
===Supplemental oxygen===
*'''MDACC''', 2003 - PMID 14694916 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized controlled trial of supplemental oxygen versus air in cancer patients with dyspnea.&quot; Bruera E et al. Palliat Med. 2003 Dec;17(8):659-63. 
**Randomized pts with advanced cancer without severe hypoxemia (SaO2 &gt; 90%) at rest with dyspnea. Randomized to supplemental oxygen or air (5 L/min) by nasal cannula.
**No significant difference in dyspnea, fatigue, or distance walked.


==Pneumonitis==
*Management
**From [http://www.oncolink.org/experts/article.cfm?c=2&amp;s=37&amp;ss=117&amp;id=2483 University of Pennsylvania Oncolink]
***Oral steroid therapy titrated over several weeks (Prednisone 60 mg/day x2 weeks, very slow taper over 3-12 weeks)
***Pentoxifylilne could be considered to decrease progression to radiation fibrosis
***May take 3-18 months for symptoms to fully resolve and/or stabilize. Any further significant improvement after 18 months is rare, due to progression to radiation fibrosis</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&amp;pi;  Bonding===
In General Chemistry, '''pi bonds''' (&amp;pi; bonds) are covalent electron bonds where two lobes of one involved electron orbital overlap two lobes of the other involved electron orbital.  What this means is, when two atoms are sufficiently close and when they each have one electron that is not being shared, the two electron orbits can essentially &quot;overlap&quot; causing a new bond between the atoms.  Any atom capable of forming more than one electron can form pi bonds, so it is relatively common to find pi bonds in molecules containing two or more nitrogen or carbon atoms, but one would never find (in nature) pi bonding between hydrogens, halogens or other atoms which prefer to share only one electron.

The Greek letter π in the name refers to ''p'' orbitals, since the orbital symmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the ''p'' orbital when seen down the bond axis. ''P'' orbitals most often engage in this sort of bonding, however, ''d'' orbitals can also engage in the formation of pi bonds.

Pi bonds are usually weaker than ''sigma bonds'' (&amp;sigma; bonds) because pi bond orbitals extend further from the positive charge of the atomic nucleus, which therefore requires additional energy. From the perspective of quantum mechanics, this bond weakness is explained by significantly less overlap between what were previously ''p'' orbitals due to the parallel orientation of the orbitals. The pi bond by itself is ''weaker'' than a sigma bond, but pi bonds are ''only'' found in combination with sigma bonds, so the combination of the two bonds is '''stronger'' (and shorter in length) than either bond would be by itself.


===Two or More ''p''-Orbitals Can Form a π-Bond===
Atoms with double bonds or triple bonds as found in nature always have one sigma-type bond and the rest pi-type bonds. Pi bonds result from parallel orbital overlap: the two combined orbitals meet lengthwise and create more diffuse bonds than the sigma bonds.  No commonly-occurring natural substance has more than three bonds to another atom, and if there are three bonds it is safe to assume that the three bonds consist of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.

It is important to note that atoms will not generally form more bonds than predicted by their place in the Periodic Table of Elements.  Electrons in pi bonds are also often referred to as &quot;pi electrons&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello there

I'm afraid Wikibooks is geared towards textbooks rather than novels. Unfortunately, this means that your wikinovel will need to be removed. Hopefully you will be able to find an alternative wiki for it.

So that you are able to fully preserve your work, I'll hold off deleting it for a week, which should give you ample time to create your own copy if you do not already have one.

If you wish to contribute towards writing textbooks in the future, or would like to consult a free online textbook in the future, then we'd be more than happy to see you here.

All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Types:'''
__TOC__


== Types ==
The two main types of protein chips are analytical and functional.  With analytical protein chips, the proteins being studied are in the solution that is washed over the chip.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;&gt;Twyman R.M. ''Principles of Proteomics''; BIOS Scientific Publishers: Oxon, U.K., 2004; Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Analytical chips are primarily used to identify the contents of an analyte.  With functional protein chips, the proteins being studied are attached to the chip.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;  Functional chips are primarily used to study interactions between the protein of interest and other molecules.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Analytical ===

Analytical chips are classified according to the capture molecule that is affixed to the chip.  The molecule can be very specific as to the types of proteins it binds to.  Examples of these specific molecules include antibodies, antigens, enzymatic substrates, nucleotides and other proteins.  Analytical chips can also contain molecules that bind to a range of proteins.  These molecules are similar to the ones used in liquid chromatography.  The techniques include reverse phase, cation exchange and anion exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;

Reverse phase protein chips, also known as reverse phase protein arrays (RPA),  are related to analytical microarrays and are used to identify different levels of expression of proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;Hall, D.A., Ptacek, J., Snyder, M. 2007. Protein Microarray Technology. Mech Ageing Dev., 128(1), 161-167.&lt;/ref&gt;   RPAs have become well used to the point where they may even be considered a separate type of protein chip all together.  RPAs are high-throughput technology that involves the use of two pre-existing technologies known as laser capture microdissection (LCM) and microarray fabrication.  LCM visualizes stained tissue cells of interest under a microscope in real time.  Once visualized, the cells are then isolated and lysed and placed into the spots of the microarray.  An antibody that can be detected by a fluorescent is used to probe the slides.  RPA allows for the protein to be immobilized in order to be analyzed instead of the typical protein microarrays which immobilizes the antibody probe.  This is how it got the name ‘reverse phase’.  This process allows that the protein need not be labeled since the protein lysate has already been denatured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charboneau&quot;&gt;Charboneau, L., Scott, H., Chen, T., Winters, M., Petricoin, E.F., Liotta, L.A., Paweletz, C.P. 2002. Utility of reverse phase protein arrays: Applications to signaling pathways and human body arrays. Briefings in Functional genomics and Proteomics, 1(3), 305-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of RPAs over other types include the ability to run different test samples in each individual array spot and only require a single antibody to probe an entire array slide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tibes&quot;&gt;Tibes, R., Qiu, Y., Lu, Y., Hennessy, B., Andreeff, M., Mills, G.B., Kornblau, S.M. 2006. Reverse phase protein array: validation of a novel proteomic technology and utility for analysis of primary leukemia specimens and hematopoietic stem cells. Molecular Cancer Theory, 5(10), 2512-2521.&lt;/ref&gt;  This use of a single antibody eliminates the need to run multiple analytes, and instead, a single one is measured and then compared to the different test samples that were applied to the individual spots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheehan&quot;&gt;Sheehan, K.M., Calvert, V.S., Kay, E.W., Lu, Y., Fishman, D., Espina, V., Aquino, J., Speer, R., Araujo, R., Wulfkuhle, J.D., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of Reverse Phase Protein Microarrays and Reference Standard Development for Molecular Network Analysis of metastatic Ovarian Carcinoma. Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics, 4(4), 346-355.   This process is optimal for cell populations with low cell count due to its ability to run a single analyte for a greater number of spots in the array, for example, all of the proteins present in the cell.  

A major use of RPAs is to view the different stages of progressing cancer along with studying signaling transduction pathways.  They can be used to determine different activation statuses of proteins over a set amount of time or due to certain treatment conditions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;/&gt; 


=== Functional ===
Unlike analytical chips, there is only one type of functional chip.  Functional chips are used to discover additional information and properties about a particular protein.  These properties  include binding strength, biochemical functions and protein-protein interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;

The major methods used to characterize an organism's proteome often result in the denaturing of the sample thus ruling out any functional studies.  Current functional analysis methods are mostly [[Wikipedia:en:In-vivo|''in vivo'']] techniques which have inherent variabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertone&quot;&gt;Bertone P, Snyder M. ''Advances in functional protein microarray technology''. FEBS, 2005; 272(5400-5411).&lt;/ref&gt;  The benefits of functional analysis using these chips is that proteins can be identified and studied [[Wikipedia:en:In-vitro|''in vitro'']] while they are still biochemically active and in their multimeric complexed form.

There are many challenges when developing a functional protein array including creating an expression clone library, actual protein production which includes isolation and purification, adaptation of microarray technology, stabilizing the proteins on the array, and keeping the concentrations of the protein constant between slides as well as between spots on the same slide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertone&quot;/&gt;

Functional arrays have many uses including the complete characterization of an organism's whole proteome.  A study by Zhu ''et al.'' developed a yeast proteome array that contained proteins from 93% of the organism's 6280 protein-coding genes.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu H, Bilgin M, Bangham R, Hall D, Casamayor A, Bertone P, Lan N, Jansen R, Bidlingmaier S, Houfek T et al. (2001) Global analysis of protein activities using proteome chips. Science  293, 2101–2105&lt;/ref&gt;  Other experiments include large scale screenings of proteomes for phospholipid-binding and calmodulin-binding specificities.  

Protein chips enable us to study biochemical interactions on an unprecedented scale.  Thousands of proteins can be screened for protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, and protein-small molecule interactions simultaneously.  The ''in vitro'' nature of the method ensures that it has advantages over current functional assay methods, and its parallel, quantitative format propels it above many other techniques in the field.

'''Analysis:'''
__TOC__



== Analysis ==
Within the realm of protein chip analysis, there are several hurdles presently being cleared by scientists experimenting at the fringe of this technology.  Several of the main challenges facing scientists include: dynamic protein concentrations, almost overwhelming numbers of unique proteins, and creation of specific probes for each protein.


Dynamic protein concentration refers to the reality that the exact number of any given protein within a cell can be drastically different than the exact number of another protein within the same cell.  In fact, there are current estimates that place the difference in protein numbers between those expressed at the lowest levels and those expressed at the highest levels at an order of magnitude of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, a million million fold difference can exists between the rarest and the most abundant proteins.


To further complicate the issue of dynamic protein concentrations, the exact number of any given protein will fluctuate based on which type of cell is being considered.  Of course, there are some proteins, known as [http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1513423 housekeeping proteins], that are highly expressed in every cell.  These proteins are needed for the basic structure and functions that keep the cell alive.  Housekeeping proteins aside, cells of different tissues will often have varying protein concentration profiles.  For example, proteins that are expressed at high concentrations in heart tissue will most likely be expressed at different concentrations in liver tissue.  Therefore, methods that detect a protein in one cell type may not work for a different cell type.


Unfortunately, scientists are often interested in those proteins that are rare and present in low concentrations.  One method devised in order to overcome this limitation has been the removal of abundant proteins.  Usually, there are a very small number of proteins that are present in copious quantities.  Through the removal of these proteins, scientists can reduce the order of magnitude differences between the lowest and highest expressed proteins.  However, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification protein purification] can be a very laborious and time consuming process and many scientists recognize that it may be prudent to run several protein chip experiments, each analyzing a different range of protein concentrations.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]


Another massive challenge exists in determining a specific probe for each protein.  Currently, one attempt to solve this problem is in the designing of specific antibodies.  In the past, antibodies have been created through the immunization of animals.  This method, however, is not high-throughput enough to be considered effient for protein chip experimental design.  Instead, methods are being developed in order to create antibody libraries.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]  A few examples from [http://www.molecularstation.com/protein-microarrays/ Molecular Station] are listed below.
*Phage antibody display
*Ribosome display
*SELEX (Systomatic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment)
*mRNA display
*Affibody display


Antibody approaches can be narrowed somewhat by creating antibodies that bind specific protein groups and not specific proteins.  An alternative to antibody usage exists in aptamers, or short oligonucleotides which are much easier to create, but can be difficult to select for a specific protein.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]


In order to analyze the results of the protein chip it is necessary to determine the types or numbers of proteins that were bound to the capture agents (for analytical chips) or the number of interactions the proteins had (for functional chips).  Analysis of protein chips can be broken into two categories:  Labeled and Label-Free.  Analysis of protein chips can be a difficult and tricky process.  Many intuitive methods have been developed, but each has its own limitations.  Short descriptions of these methods and their limitations exists below.


=== Labeled ===

This type of analysis involves labeling either with radioactivity or fluorescence.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  The label can be attached directly to the protein or capture agent (such as an enzyme or substrate) and detected immediately.  The label can also be attached to a different molecule (such as an antibody, antigen or substrate) that is washed over the chip as part of a second step.  This prevents the label from altering the conformation of the proteins being studied.


However there are several issues that arise with labeled protein chips.  Although methods exist to prevent a label from altering protein conformation, a probability of interference with protein interactions still exists.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]  Label influence on binding properites, along with a knack for having a lack of reproducability[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], provide for a couple of significant issues which can be seen as sufficient reasoning for using a label-free approach.


==== Common Detection Methods ====
===== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA ELISA] (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) =====
ELISA assays are useful tool in the detection of antigens or proteins.  A specific antibody is used to target the desired antigen or protein.  The complex that forms from the antibody-antigen binding is bound by another antibody which recognizes such complexes.  The latter antibody is attached to an enzyme thus 'enzyme-linked' is part of the acronym, ELISA.  The binding of the antigen will usually trigger a reaction that can be observed and qualified or quantified.

A very useful animation of both a positive and negative ELISA reaction can be found [http://www.biology.arizona.edu/IMMUNOLOGY/activities/elisa/technique.html here].

Useful as ELISA assays may be, they are unfortunately prone to false positives as many non-specific protein-antibody interactions can occur.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]


===== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA#Sandwich_ELISA Sandwich Immunoassay] =====
Sandwich immunoassays, a version of an ELISA assy, use fluorescently labeled antibodies for the probe and laser scanning for collecting the data.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]


===== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling Isotopic labeling] =====
Isotopic labeling involves using a radio isotope-labeled analyte for the probe and X-ray film for collecting the data.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  The attachment of unusual isotypes provides the information needed to identify specific markers, or in this case, proteins.

Molecules containing these isotopes can be distinguished by either [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry| mass spectrometry]] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy].[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]  There are various isotopes and each has a different mass therefore leading to the utilizaion of [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry| mass spectrometry]].  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy Infrared spectroscopy] can be used because the various isotopes have different vibrational modes.


===== Planar Waveguide =====
Planar waveguides involve using fluorescently labeled antibodies for the probe and a charge-coupled device for collecting the data.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide_%28optics%29 Waveguides] typically involve the detection of electromagnetic waves.  The term planar simply refers to the geometry of the system resembling a plane.

Planar waveguides may offer the exciting ability to analyze systems in real-time thus enabling the study of protein interaction kinetics.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]


===== Electro-Chemical =====
Electro-chemical detection involves using metal-coupled analyte for the probe and a conductivity measurement for collecting the data.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]



==== Data ====

Like DNA microarrays, protein chip experiments using fluorescent labeling provide data in the form of images with spots of varying intensities.  These images are then analyzed using software packages similar to those used for DNA microarray analysis.  Two examples of the types of analysis performed are the quantification of spot intensities and the comparison of intensities between control and experimental conditions.

==== Software ====

Software packages used for analysis of labeled protein chips include:
*[http://www.pnl.gov/statistics/ProMAT/ Protein Microarray Analysis Tool (ProMAT)] is a freely available software package used to evaluate the intensity of the spots.  ProMAT was developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
*[http://www.zeptosens.com/index2.html ZeptoVIEW PRO] is a commercially available software package from Zeptosens that allows quantification of spot intensity and is used with their protein chips.


=== Label-Free ===

This type of analysis takes advantage of the properties of the proteins and includes mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]


==== [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry| Mass Spectrometry]] ====

Certain chips, such as the [http://www.ciphergen.com/MasterPage.aspx?URL=/products/pc/ ProteinChips] by Ciphergen, can be coupled to a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  Improved resolution can be obtained by using SELDI mass spectrometry.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  Data collection and analysis are performed in the same manner as mass spectrometry performed after protein separation techniques such as liquid chromatography.

==== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon_resonance Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)] ====

Surface plasmon resonance is an optical effect produced when polarized light is shone on a specially designed protein chip.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  The chip needs to contain a thin metal film that will cause the light to refract.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  The angle of refraction depends on the mass of the molecule bound to the chip so a protein with a substrate bound to it will cause the light to refract at a different angle than a protein with no substrate.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  The different angles can be measured by a photodiode array.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  Additionally, surface plasmon resonance can be coupled to mass spectrometry for protein identification using microrecovery from the chip surface.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]


Surface plasmon resonance has the ability to provide real-time analysis.  The consequences of such are that it becomes possible to study the kinetics of protein interactions.  Detection resolution, a challenge discussed previously on this page, represents a drawback to SPR analysis.  Planar waveguides may provide for a real-time analysis with improved detection resolution.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]


==== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)] ====

Atomic force microscopy uses changes in surface topology to detect protein interactions.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]  It is a high resolution technique and the data is collected in the form of topographical maps.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Analysis#References| &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lets share some info about parkour. ==

Also finally Knuxus I read your note on &quot;parkour, not pure parkour.&quot; I disagree, i think this is a black and white issue, either it is the fastest way to cross something or it isn't. No contest. - [[User:Ukemi|Ukemi]]

Okay, ive done some basic edits but i have to go now, exams tomorrow. You may have to touch up spelling (abbreviated?) and layout/style stuff, since i don't know how to do that properly in wikipedia. Also considering adding more to the origins sections, such as herbetism, and david belles original goals and opinions, there is a wikiquote article with le parkour quotations. The exercises section should also be redone, i have no idea how good hindu squats are but if your taking this off Matt Furey rewrite now, and also i have heard they can damage your knees because your knee hangs over your toes. APK has the WOD, and parkour.net has a full workout posted there, so steal or link to that. Apart from that, good work on this, its a work in progress but it has the makings of a good article. - [[User:Ukemi|Ukemi]]

Hey Knuxus, M2 (love APK btw, and im in Australia :), you guys have awesome articles). Im just gonna skim through this and change some stuff, I saw the parkour (also called Freerunning) thing on the heading and cringed, so if you don't mind im just gonna go through this. If you want some really good articles on this stuff go to www.aparkour.com , an Australian traceur started this to provide insurance for his friends to begin volunteer schools, both for just general traceurs but also specifically for disadvantaged groups and those in youth prisions, a la Yamakasi and some of Urban Freeflows PK events. Lots of good stuff there, especially on spirit.  - [[User:Ukemi|Ukemi]]

Please help me improving this book with photos, texts, videos and other stuff that might improve it.--[[User:Knuxus|Knuxus]] 16:01, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

Requesting for someone to interlink this article with a portuguese wikibooks page by the same name(Parkour). --[[User:Knuxus|Knuxus]] 20:47, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

I'll happily lend a hand with writing the book but unfortunatley I'm rather busy currently. Anyhow, just a quick pointer, you may want to scrap the picture of David Belle on the front page, it shows him doing a backflip which is not parkour, it's tricking. There are plenty of other better pictures of Belle out there. I'd love to see this finished though, it could become a great resource. [[User:Aj*|Aj*]] 21:08, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

Thank you Aj, your comment is truly useful, the photo will be changed to something more Parkourish --[[User:Knuxus|Knuxus]] 21:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
Changes done, but I think there is a lot of better images which could be more illustrative, like from the movie, or even real photos, I just couldn´t find them, if someone has something, please feel free to change...--[[User:Knuxus|Knuxus]] 22:07, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

I'll be happy to help, I need to see what proper ettiquette is for these pages. for example, american parkour.com (my website) has some good tutorials for these moves which I'd be happy to contribute, but they must remain the property of american parkour (properly credited). please feel free to email me m2rock@yahoo.com to discuss. Thanks! [[User:M2|M2]] 17:19, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

I really have nothing to discuss about, just put your content and then we will see, if you want credits you may put it, i dont have any problems with pub, as long as it remains in the subject.

I am moving &quot;360 Underbar&quot; to &quot;Parkour Moves&quot; and renaming to &quot;Reverse Underbar&quot;. This move is useful anytime you need to go under a bar and must go head first instead of feet first. [[User:M2|M2]] 16:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)


Please put any info you want, with all of your copyrights and references to your site, if you want to put your pictures and videos you may do it also, you can put as many as you want, as long as it stays on topic. This is not my projects, I only initiated it, it is yours, and fully yours, you may do whatever you want, well, it still has to remain legal...
--[[User:Knuxus|Knuxus]] 10:07, 7 July

Why include Aesthetic moves since they're not Parkour?

Answering that question: often many aestethic moves are used in parkour, they are parkour, but not pure parkour... and since there is no tricking wikibook i think they should remain here...--[[User:Knuxus|Knuxus]] 13:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

:Um, no. Aesthetic moves, or moves that will not aid you in overcoming an obstacle efficiently are not parkour and never will be, see Free Running. There is no such thing as pure parkour and this guide is very misinformed. I recommend reading Wikipedia's entry on Parkour and simply linking to that or pulling that content for the &quot;What is&quot; and &quot;History&quot; sections. --[[User:Undaunted|Undaunted]] 21:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

== Images used ==

I think we should add more images to Commons instead of linking to external picture sites. That way we won't have so many 404 errors, and can display them here. --[[User:Explodicle|Explodicle]] ([[User talk:Explodicle|talk]]) 22:01, 4 May 2009 (UTC)


== Other ==

At the beginning of the text, ''&quot;Le Parkour (also called Parkour, and abbreviated PK)&quot;''. ''Parkour'' is said twice. I think that the original writer meant that the first of the two to be written ''parcours''. --[[User:Darren-Jaguar|Darren-Jaguar]] ([[User talk:Darren-Jaguar|talk]]) 11:09, 17 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

==History==
===Nucleic Acid Microarrays===
The use of [[Wikipedia:en:DNA_microarrays|microarrays]] for gene expression profiling was first published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Schena M, Shalon D, Davis RW, Brown PO. (1995). Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray. Science. Oct 20; 270 (5235): 467-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technology allowed scientists to analyze thousands of [[Wikipedia:en:Mrna|mRNAs]] in a single experiment to determine whether expression is different in disease states.  Unfortunately, mRNA levels within a cell are often poorly correlated with actual protein abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Gygi SP, Rochon Y, Franza B, Abersold R: Correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in yeast. Mol. Cell Biol. 19, 1720-1730 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be due to many factors including degradation rate of mRNA versus proteins and post-transcriptional controls and modifications.  Measuring the amount of protein directly would bypass any mRNA inconsistencies and give a true level of gene function, however traditional protein characterization methods were slow and cumbersome.  These combined factors were the impetus behind the creation of protein chips.

===Deficiency of Traditional Protein Characterization Methods===

[[Image: LC_MS_pic.jpg|thumb|A liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) instrument. This technique is low throughput compared to protein chips because protein chips can test for thousands of proteins on a single chip in a single experiment.]]

Before the advent of protein chips, protein measuring and characterization was done using  two different methods: [[2D gel electrophoresis]] coupled with [[mass spectrometry]], and [[liquid chromatography]].  These methods can separate and visualize a large number of proteins per experiment, however they are time consuming when compared to protein chips.  Their process is very low-throughput because of lack of automation.  Reproducibility is also a factor because of the large amount of sample handling.  A better, more standardized, higher-throughput method needed to be invented for protein measuring and characterization.

===Protein Chip Precursors to Modern Day===

[[Image: ELISA pic.jpg|thumb|The equipment and reagents used in an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), a precursor of protein chips.]]

Immunoassays, the precursor to protein chips available since the 1980s, exploit the interactions between [[Wikipedia:en:Antibodies|antibodies]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Antigen|antigens]] in order to detect their concentrations in biological samples.  Their creation, however, is tedious and expensive.  As a response to this, researchers at Harvard University combined the technologies of immunoassays and DNA microarrays to develop the protein chip.&lt;ref&gt;MacBeath G, Schreiber S. (2000). Printing Proteins as Microarrays for High-Throughput Function Determination. Science. Sep 08; 289 (5485): 1760-1764.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their landmark paper, published in 2000, &quot;Printing Proteins as Microarrays for High-Throughput Function Determination,&quot; Gavin MacBeath and Stuart Schreiber described how to create protein chips and demonstrated three types of applications that would benefit from this new technology.  The strengths of their approach were the use of readily available materials (i.e. glass slides, polyacrylamide gel), the relative ease of implementation (robotic microarray printers), and compatibility with standard instrumentation.

Within the past five years, many companies, including [http://www.biacore.com Biacore], [http://www.invitrogen.com Invitrogen], and [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com Sigma-Aldrich], have begun production of industrial level protein array systems that can be used for drug discovery and basic biological research.  Commercial entities have made protein chip research a streamlined and standardized process on the same level as DNA microarrays compared to its inception in 2000.

Academic research plays a huge role in the development and improvement of these technologies. The collaboration of academic research with systems such as the Affymetrix GeneChip and the Human Genome Initiative has allowed for friendly competition, resulting in the advancement of technologies. With more develops come a better understanding and encourages even more research towards these fields. 

[http://www.Affymetrix.com Affymetrix] is a company that has been manufactures microarrays, named GeneChip, since 1992. They have 13 locations across the world with headquarters located in the US (California), UK, Japan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Affymetrix.&quot; Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 5 Feb 2007, 03:19 UTC.

==== Degenerate Music ====

==== Socialist Realism ====


==Impressionism and symbolism==

Impressionism emerged from France in the late 19th century. There were two main composers, Claude Debussy, and Maurice Ravel. 

In reaction to the Romantic period, it used more expression in the atmosphere of the piece rather than the music itself. 

Whole tone scales were prominently used, and the songs were usually instrumental. Woodwinds were dominant in the pieces, while strings blended colors instead of making block sounds.

It had indefinite rhythms, and it was more fluid filled with downbeats.

Simplicity and abstraction was explored, and was greatly influenced by non-Western arts and Dadaism. Artists sought fresh concepts in foreign music, such as Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe.

Light, lacy chords develop the shimmery and hazy atmosphere of Impressionistic music. Dissonance was usually left unresolved, creating irregular phrases and concealed cadences.

Rather than using triads and four-note chords as used previously, five-note combinations known as '''ninth chords''' (1-3-5-7-9) were brought up. This formed dissonant polychords of 6 and 7 notes.

It was the transition from the Romantic period to the Modern era. Though its duration was fleeting, Debussy and Ravel are considered some of the greatest composers.

==Expressionism==

Expressionism was the German response to French Impressionism. The Germans dug down to the depths of the soul, whereas the French explored the impressions of the outer world.
Some composers influenced by this style was Arnold Schoenberg.
The musical characteristics of Expressionism include wide leaps in the melody and the use of instruments in extreme registers.

== Avant Garde ==
# Harsh, experimental music
# Represents the fury of the world, a defiance
# It set out to express the unsayable 
# Controversial 
# Starts after World War 2
→Composers came back with shell shock
→They were absolutely terrified and wanted to convey the horrors of war

== 12-Tone System &amp; Serialism ==

== Minimalism ==

== Jazz ==

==Claude Debussy==

==Maurice Ravel==

==Neoclassicism==

==Igor Stravinsky==
==== Characteristics ====
# Russian
# Most popular modernist of all
# Neoclassical and nationalist for the first half of his career
→Influenced by Russian folk music
→He would take fragments of melodies and change them into something new
# Wanted to surprises his audiences through rhythm 
# In the latter part of his career he began using the 12-tone system (after 1944)

==== Famous Pieces ====
# The Rite of Spring

==Anton Webern==

==Bela Bartok==

==Dmitri Shostakovich==

==== Characteristics ====
# Russian
# Social Realist
→ The communist version of a modernist
→ Bound by the policies of Stalinism and the USSR
→ He tried to push the envelope with these policies and was sometimes criticized
# USSR's star composer
→ I know it doesn't make any sense that he tried to push it and was still the best but he was
# Had to be patriotic to Russia and serve the masses 
# New music to reflect the new society (of the Soviet government)
# Always on the fence with Stalin's government, constantly risking prosecution because of the nature of Stalinism

==== Famous Pieces ====
# Lady Macbeth (Opera)
→ It was sexual, about betrayal and murder
→ Stalin didn't like it
# 5th Symphony
→ Was to be released while Stalin was on one of his purges
→ One note out of place would have meant his end
→ A triumph

==Applications==
Protein chips are a powerful resource which offers high-throughput methodology approaching that of DNA microarrays thus narrowing the gap between genomics and proteomics.


Protein chip experiments, like the field of proteomics itself, can be divided into two types of questions.
#Qualitative - What is it?  What does it do?  Does it interact with anything?
#Quantitative - How much is there?


Protein chip applications are numerous and span the entire field.  They include:
*Probing a tissue extract for disease markers
*Investigating protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, and protein-drug interactions
*Determining the amount of a protein in a particular sample
*Identifying antibodies in a particular sample


Some specific examples of protein chip applications are:
* Looking for hepatitis B antibodies in a human blood sample
* Identifying biomarkers for ovarian cancer
* Diagnosing SARS


==Example Application==
Zhu, H. et al. (2001) utilized protein chips in an effort to study the yeast proteome.[[Proteomics/Protein Chips/Applications#References| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]  Protein chips offer a high throughput method of analyzing such data.  However, hurtles had to be cleared in order to over express the proteins from the proteome.

Zhu, H. et al.  utilized high copy expression vectors and recombinant technology to clone 5800 ORFs from the yeast genome, which translates into approximately 80% of the yeast proteome.  The expressed proteins were printed to the protein chips using a microarrayer and two varieties of protein chip surfaces: aldehyde-treated and nickel coated.  Although both treatments were successful, the nickel coated chip was superior to the aldehyde-treated chip.

The group then checked the reproducibility of their protein spotting attempts.  They found that more than 93% of the proteins were surely attached to the chip, and, in repeating the experiment, found that more than 95% of the proteins were correctly reproduced.

The main goal, or application if you will, of this experiment was to determine protein function.  In order to do this, the proteins on the chips were tested for protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions.

The group provides a good example of how the results were interpreted.  They probed the proteins on the chip for calmodulin binding functionality and observed both known and unknown calmodulin binding proteins.  Calmodulin is a calcium binding proteins that is very conserved and is involved in many cellular processes.  Through the analysis of the sequences of these proteins, Zhu, H. et al. were able to develop consensus sequences that identify motifs that should be associated with calmodulin binding.

Limitations of the study include confounding through indirect protein interactions and the possible absence of some post-translational modifications.

The effects of this study were to elucidate the potential of protein chips for observing protein - protein, protein - lipid, and protein - drug interactions within an eukaryotic cell's proteome.

'''Manufacture:'''
__TOC__


==Manufacture==
Protein chips and DNA microarrays are manufactured in a similar fashion.  Both involve spotting a biological component (such as DNA or proteins) onto a coated glass slide or other substrate such as gel pads and microwells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;&gt;Twyman R.M. ''Principles of Proteomics''; BIOS Scientific Publishers: Oxon, U.K., 2004; Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  For protein chips, the slide must be coated with a substance that will bind the proteins without denaturing them.  There are variety of binding methods available including absorption, cross-linking and hybridization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;
===Chip Formats===
====Glass Slide Chips====

[[File:Biochip.jpg|thumb|A glass slide biochip that can support proteins or nucleic acids. Each chip can have thousands of gel drops about 100 microns in diameter that contain a specific protein or peptide.]]

Glass slide chips are advantageous because they can be used with standard microarray equipment and are inexpensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;  They are prone, however, to evaporation of samples and cross contamination.  The first methods for creating protein chips on glass slides involved placing the proteins in small gel pockets that were attached to the glass surface&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliskov, A.V., E.N. Timofeev, S.A. Surzhikov, A.L. Drobyshev, V.V. Shick, and A.D. Mirzabekov. 1999. Fabrication of microarray of gel-immobilized compounds on a chip by copolymerization. BioTechniques 27:592-600.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The process then evolved to attaching the proteins with a crosslinking agent that coated the glass&lt;ref&gt;MacBeath, G. and S.L. Schreiber. 2000. Printing proteins as microarrays for high-throughput function determination. Science 289:1760-1763.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This agent would bind to the primary amines on the proteins, while a 40% glycerol solution would prevent dehydration due to evaporation.  Most array spotting is now done in a high humidity enviornment to control evaporation.

====Well Chips====
Using wells instead of coated glass slides reduces the problem of evaporation and cross contamination between spots.  However, this method is more expensive and is not compatible with DNA microarray spotting equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;
====3D Matrix Gels====
A third method is to use a 3D matrix created by polyacrylamide gel pads.  This method limits evaporation and allows the proteins to remain in an aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, this method allows for stronger binding of the proteins.  Like the microwell method, this method is more expensive and can't be used with traditional DNA microarray spotting equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twyman&quot;/&gt;
===Protein Attachment Methods===
The surface of the chip must be modified to allow the proteins to bind properly.  An attachment layer which usually consists of a sugary gel such as dextran-based hydrogel&lt;ref&gt;Lofas S, Johnsson B, Tegendahl K, Ronnberg I: Dextran modified gold surfaces for surface plasmon resonance sensors; immunoreactivity of immobilized antibodies and antibody-surface interaction studies. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 65, 423-431 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; is coated onto the chip.  The noise level for these types of attachment layers is high, however, because of the non-specificity of the medium.  Cross-linkers can be used that covalently bind to certain groups on proteins, allowing for much more specific binding.  The cross-linkers could, however, effect the conformation or activity of the proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu H, Snyder M. Protein arrays and microarrays. Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2001 Feb;5(1):40-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to remember that unlike nucleic acids, different proteins will be effected in different ways by the surface chemistry of the chip, i.e. a certain treatment will tightly bind some proteins but may denature others.
===Protein Delivery Methods===



Many protein chips made currently are spotted using automated technology&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrayit.com/Products/Printing/&lt;/ref&gt;, with spot densities greater than 30,000 spots per chip, though some low density chips may still be hand spotted.  In addition to spotting, peptides can be synthesized on the chip via [[Wikipedia:en:Photolithography|photolithography]].&lt;ref&gt;Talapatra A, Rouse R, Hardiman G.

==Docking and Scoring Tools==

The search space in a docking problem consists of all possible conformations (the relative positions of atoms in the 3D structure of a molecule, independent of the coordinate system) and configurations /orientations (the positions of atoms of a molecule after undergoing a rotation and translation in a coordinate system of the protein paired with the ligand). With present computing resources, it would be impossible to exhaustively explore the search space for all possible poses (a pose is the name given to the configuration of the conformation of a molecule in a coordinate system). Needless to say, every docking simulation is a trade-off between accuracy and speed and a good docking tool is expected to maintain a reasonably good balance between the two. The success of a docking program can be said to depend on depend on two components: the scoring function and the search algorithm. 
*A scoring function discriminates correct (experimentally verified) docking poses from incorrect ones. It estimates the binding affinity between ligand and receptor.
*A search algorithm finds the best docking pose measured by the scoring function
There are many competitive docking tools available from various sources, ranging from expensive and feature-rich corporate suites to simple yet powerful applications developed by academic/ research institutes. 

===DOCK===
DOCK was developed by the team led by Irwin Kuntz at the University of California, San Francisco (http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/). The most recent version, DOCK 6; is written in C++ and is functionally separated into independent components, thereby conferring program flexibility. The Kuntz lab provides source code for all programs and they are available free of charge for academic institutions, however industrial organizations are charged a licensing fee.
Following are some of the applications cited by the authors for DOCK: 
* predict binding modes of small molecule-protein complexes 
* search databases of ligands for compounds that inhibit enzyme activity 
* search databases of ligands for compounds that bind a particular protein 
The main DOCK executable is run command line from a standard unix shell and windows users need to run it using a Linux-like environment like Cygwin. 
DOCK uses an “incremental construction” docking algorithm, which essentially means that the ligands are initially ‘fragmented’: 
*a base ‘anchor’ is selected 
*the anchor fragment is placed/ anchored to the active site
*followed by incremental addition of the other fragments
The active site of the protein is identified by the program sphgen, which also generates the sphere centers filling the site. Scoring grids are generated by the program grid. The program DOCK then matches the spheres to the ligand atoms and uses the scoring grids to evaluate ligand orientations and finally minimizes the energy based scores. A comprehensive tutorial for DOCK 6 and the docking process in general can be found here: http://www2.umdnj.edu/~kholodvl/tut/DOCK60_intro_linux.pdf

===GLIDE===
Glide is a commercial product marketed as “A complete solution for ligand-receptor docking” by Schrödinger (http://www.schrodinger.com/). Some of the highlights of the tool include:
*A range of speed vs accuracy options, from the HTVS (high-throughput virtual screening) mode for millions of compounds, to the SP (standard precision) mode, to the XP (extra precision) mode with advanced scoring.
*User-friendly interface: Glide automates calculations for large libraries of compounds and organizes docking results in both summary and detailed reports. The ‘Maestro’ user interface provides advanced visualization and analysis tools to examine ligand-receptor interactions.
*Cross-platform (Linux, SGI, and IBM/AIX) and Parallel processing support. 

Glide uses a “Stochastic Search” docking algorithm. The algorithm approximates a complete systematic search over ligand positions, orientations, and conformations in the receptor site. The energy minimization stage utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm.  

The enhanced features and easy-to-use interface of Glide, however comes at a cost that is both financial and computational.

===Yucca===
Yucca is a very recent and new algorithm specifically for small molecule docking, developed by Vicky Choi at the Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech. The algorithm (still under active development), is based on an efficient heuristic for local search and has been used in conjunction with the conformer generator OMEGA (Optimized Molecular Ensemble Generation Application) to generate a set of low-energy conformers. 
Yucca utilizes a “multiconformer” algorithm. The conformers obtained from OMEGA are then rigidly docked and the configurations are coarsely sampled. Each configuration is then improved locally to a local minimum.

Comparative evaluation of Yucca with the other existing algorithms seems to prove it to be a competitive tool, however it is still being developed and tweaked to add and improve features. Among the improvements being made are: the tool’s own conformer generator, a better scoring function, flexible receptor docking and virtual screening.


Other available software tools include:
*'''BAPPL''' [http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/drugdesign/bappl.jsp]
The Binding Affinity Prediction of Protein-Ligand server is a tool which can be used to calculate the binding energy of a non-metallo protein-ligand complex. 
*'''AutoDOCK''' [http://www.scripps.edu/mb/olson/doc/autodock/]
AutoDOCK, like DOCK, attempts to determine the orientation of a compound in a drug target.  AutoDOCK, being a docking and scoring package, also contains scoring functions. AutoDOCK has also been applied to the problem of [[w:en:Protein-protein_docking|protein-protein docking]] . 
*'''Docking Study with HyperChem''' [http://www.molfunction.com/software5.htm]
A newer system that claims to use novel docking algorithms. 
*'''FleXX'''[http://www.biosolveit.de/download/]
FleXX is another widely used docking program, known for its speed compared to many other applications. 
*'''Molecular Docking Server''' [http://www.dockingserver.com]
Molecular docking server is an internet service that calculates the site, geometry and energy of small molecules interacting with proteins.
*'''ZLAB'''[http://zlab.bu.edu/zlab/index.shtml] 
ZLAB is free academically but requires a paid license through Accelrys commercially. It is a two-stage docking system with ZLAB performing initial FT calculations and RLAB optimizing the highest scoring hits.

See the ''Wikipedia Molecular docking'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_docking] site for links to additional softwares.

Although there are currently, many applications that simulate intermolecular interactions, there is still much room for improvement. Newer applications and algorithms are being developed constantly and the struggle for the perfect balance between accuracy and speed remains one of the critical factors.
For instance, Glide, in spite of being among the best performers in terms of accuracy and ease of use, loses out heavily on computational time. Institutionally designed packages such as DOCK and AutoDock also have strengths as they are constantly worked on and updated. Most such academic software, however are command-line based and pose a steep learning curve for most users. Various other problems such as flexible receptor docking (which is, at this point enormously computationally expensive) are still areas of active research.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}

The '''Parkour Roll''' is a very important skill to learn properly. The purpose of this roll is to lighten the impact of a fall or landing during your run. Practice safe rolls without much speed or height at first, on grass.

== Steps ==
* Land on the balls of your feet. If your heels fall back on the ground - the roll is useless. You must maintain forward momentum for the roll to have any purpose.
* Keep your legs at a ninety degree (right) angle when you land. this will prevent you from injuring your knees, and keep your forward momentum.
* Your hands should be out in front of you pulling you into this movement. It helps to form a diamond shape with the hands. Place the forearm that corresponds with the shoulder you are most comfortable rolling with on the ground.
* Upon impact you should move your gaze down to your waist line and tuck your chin in.
* Pull your shoulder forward with your hands. At the same time push off from your toes.
* Roll onto your shoulder in a diagonal motion. Keep your legs tucked, so that your body is tense and strong. 
* Now from your shoulder roll onto the muscle surface of your gluteus maximus. If you roll onto your hip or the side of your pelvis, you'll probably end up bruising yourself.
* Roll up on to one knee, and use the continuing momentum to come up on both feet. This last position will vary from person to person.

This is my grandmother's recipe, she refuses to measure things, so these are all approximates.  It makes enough food for at least 4 people.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 whole [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]], cut up (skin optional) 
* 2 standard size containers of [[cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* [[cookbook:Onion|onion]] (not [[cookbook:Red onion|red]])
* 2-3 cups (480g - 700g) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[cookbook:Bacon|bacon grease]] or [[cookbook:oil|oil]]

== Equipment ==
* big pot
* pan with lid (or an old plate to cover)

== Procedure ==

Put on a (BIG) pot of water to [[cookbook:boil|boil]] (for dumplings)

=== Chicken ===
# [[cookbook:Chop|Chop]] up onions (we like them done very small to hide them from the kids) and [[cookbook:brown|brown]] them in your pan (the heavier the better) with some bacon grease (traditional) or lard or your preferred kind of oil (healthier but, if you ''must'', then use olive oil for flavor). 
# When the onions have softened and well colored, add the chicken to the pan. Brown rapidly, then season with paprika (to taste), turn heat down, add enough water added to cover the bottom of the pan and cook on low. Keep covered but with the lid slightly cocked to prevent boiling.
 
=== Dumplings ===
Make these while the chicken is cooking.

# Take flour, eggs, salt (just a pinch) and water at room temperature (to be added as needed) and mix to a sticky consistency (for dumplings to be ‘sticky’ inside have wetter dough; for dry the same all through, make a dryer dough).
# Use a desert spoon (or a [[cookbook:Melon Baller|melon baller]] for smaller dumplings) to drop dough into boiling water (to keep them from sticking to the spoon, let it heat up in the water).
# When the dumpling floats, its done. Remove, put in a bowl (a ''tiny'' slick of melted fat/oil on the bottom might help if they stick) and keep them to one side in a warm place.

=== Assembly ===
# Now your chicken is cooked (chicken should be cooked to 160&amp;nbsp;°F) and your dumplings are all done (make sure they are thoroughly drained).
# Add dumplings and sour cream to pan, stir thoroughly but carefully to coat.
# Add more paprika, until it is more pink (or orange) than white.
# Taste sauce: it may need more paprika or salt. Sometimes it is easier to remove the chicken, and then pour the dumplings and sour cream over the top to coat (when serving), depending on how big your pan is.

Use [[cookbook:Rye Bread|rye bread]] (with seeds) to sop up the sauce when you're done eating.

== General Overview ==

'''''Riddle Manor''''' is the ancestral home of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]]. For much of this story, it stands empty.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] we read the story of how Tom Riddle Sr. and his parents were found dead one morning fifty years ago, and how the gardener, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], was suspected of their murders until it was found that they apparently had not been murdered by anything, but had simply died... possibly of fright. We also see how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] has moved into that house, and we see him killing Frank. Other clues through the course of the book lead us to believe that Voldemort is using the house as his base of operations; in fact, according to what we are later told by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]], he has moved his base of operations to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]]'s house, where he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] take up residence after Mr. Crouch is placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. After Crouch's escape, Voldemort and Wormtail do return to Riddle Manor, and remain there until the end of the book.

While no direct mention of the Manor is made in other books, we do see some of its environs in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']].

== Analysis ==

Riddle Manor is not, strictly speaking, necessary. It is true that a shut-in, poverty-stricken girl like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]] is most likely to become infatuated with the local lord of the Manor, as he will have all the appropriate accouterments – attendants, property, jewelery – and financial means to lift our poor peasant out of her downtrodden existence and into the lap of luxury. Though likely any reasonably well-off Muggle would have served the purpose, it is much more romantic if the lord of the manor falls for the peasant girl; and Merope seems to have been preconditioned to be romantic. One must assume that Riddle Manor is created purely to highlight the romance that Merope can force with her phial of love potion.

After the death of the Riddle family, the house, we are told, reverted to some mysterious people in London who tried, unsuccessfully, to rent it out. While we are never told who the people in London are, it is possible that they are, knowingly or otherwise, agents of Tom Marvolo Riddle, who could have assumed that he was the heir, being the late Tom Riddle's son. One wonders, though, whether he would not try to dispose of anything that reminded him of his Muggle father. As the house certainly must remind him of the late Tom Riddle, one must wonder why Tom Marvolo Riddle would choose to live in it.

While evidence in the text does indicate that Tom Riddle and Merope Gaunt did get married (Dumbledore uses the terms &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; to refer to them, and refers to Merope as &quot;Merope Riddle&quot; at least once), one wonders exactly how title to Riddle Manor got transferred. As the manor and lands were purely Muggle property, Tom Marvolo Riddle would have necessarily had to deal with the Muggles he hated, in order to secure his claim to the property and arrange agents to take care of it. One has a rather ludicrous image of Tom Marvolo Riddle, wand concealed up his sleeve, dealing with an army of faceless bureaucrats.

In fact, except for the one night when Frank Bryce was killed, we do not know where Voldemort was living. He could well have chosen to leave Riddle Manor that night for some place with less associations for him. Or he could have chosen to stay there, as a way of spiting his deceased father and grandparents. We do know that he was in the environs of Little Hangleton in June, when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] ended.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is tempting to believe that Voldemort created a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], the one embedded in the ring of the Peverells that Voldemort had stolen from his uncle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]], via the murder of Tom Riddle Sr. Evidence in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] is inconclusive: Riddle's conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], that we see in the Pensieve, suggests that Riddle did not yet know how to create a Horcrux. During that conversation, Tom asks about Horcruxes, and we see that Tom is wearing the Gaunt ring. It is possible that Tom had already created a Horcrux, in the ring, and his question is designed to put Slughorn more at ease about his abilities and ideas; we can see that the main thrust of his questions is more to do with the possibility of creating multiple Horcruxes. Dumbledore does state that Tom had no longer wanted to wear the ring once it was a Horcrux, and while this must be supposition on Dumbledore's part, he was usually accurate in his guesses. Additionally, we have Tom's look of triumph when he has received the information about Horcruxes from Slughorn; given the author's usual efficiency, we have to think that he has done more here than just hoodwink Slughorn. Tom must have gotten some real information from Slughorn to merit that amount of joy.

The author has stated that it was the death of Tom's father that allowed him to create his first Horcrux; presumably he only chose to hide the Horcrux away, rather than keeping it close to himself, when he had created a second one. This would imply that Dumbledore had made a trivial error; as mentioned, Dumbledore believed at that time that Tom knew how to make a Horcrux, but not that he had done so. Dumbledore likely believed that the ring had only been made into a Horcrux via the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]; at that point, likely, Tom stopped wearing the ring, hiding it in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|Gaunt shack]], because he now had the Diary as a backup. In this case, Tom's look of triumph at the conclusion of his talk with Slughorn probably relates to his having learned that making multiple Horcruxes was possible.

It is possible that Frank Bryce's murder was used to create the final Horcrux of the set that Voldemort was planning; bringing the circle to closure, by generating the last piece of his &quot;''immortality''&quot; in the abandoned home of his hated father, would likely have appealed to Voldemort's sense of humour. It is also possible that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]]' death was used to create a Horcrux; at that point, he would have been keen to finish the full set, and would have had no way to know that Frank would so conveniently present himself. The author has stated in an interview that the sixth and final Horcrux was created by means of the death of Bertha Jorkins, which does make it more of a matter of expedience than a plan. This is borne out by the non-snake-like behaviour of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] when passing by Frank Bryce in the hallway; Nagini likely would have behaved quite differently if she had not already been carrying a fragment of Voldemort's soul.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== An Overview of GCC Architecture. Compilation of an expression. ===

This section is based on a Red Hat magazine article {{ref|rh_magazine}}.

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) comprises a number of compilers for different programming languages. The main GCC executable '''gcc''' processes source files written in C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, Fortran, or Ada and produces an assembly file for each source file. It is a driver program that invokes the appropriate compilation programs depending on the language of the source file. For a C source file they are the preprocessor and compiler '''cc1''', the assembler '''as''', and the linker '''collect2'''. The first and the third programs come with a GCC distribution; the assembler is a part of the GNU binutils package. This book describes the internals of the preprocessor and compiler '''cc1'''.

Each compiler includes three components: a front end, a middle end, and a back end. GCC compiles one file at a time. A source file goes through all three components one after another. Its representation is modified when it goes from a component to the next. [[:Image:GCC_ast_rtl_obj.jpg|Figure 1]] illustrates the components and the source file representations associated with each of them. The ''abstract syntax tree (AST)'', ''register transfer language (RTL)'', and ''object'' are the main representations.

[[Image:GCC_ast_rtl_obj.jpg|center|550px|GCC front end, middle end, and back end with source file representations.]]

==== Main Representations ====

The purpose of the front end is to read the source file, parse it, and convert it into the standard ''abstract syntax tree (AST)'' representation. The AST is a dual-type representation: it is a tree where a node can have children and a list of statements where nodes are chained one after another. There is one front end for each programming language.

The AST is then used to generate a ''register-transfer language (RTL)'' tree. RTL is a hardware-based representation that corresponds to an abstract target architecture with an infinite number of registers. An RTL optimization pass optimizes the tree in the RTL form. Finally, a GCC back end generates the assembly code for the target architecture using the RTL representation. Examples of back ends are the x86 back end and the MIPS back end.

In the next sections we describe the internals of the C front end and the x86 back end. The compiler starts with its initialization and command line options processing. After that the C front end preprocesses the source file, parses it and performs a number of optimizations. The back end then generates the assembly code for the target platform and saves it to a file.

=== Auxiliary Data Structures ===

GCC has a number of additional data structures that facilitate code development, for example vector and heap.

The macros defined in '''vec.h''' implement a set of templated vector types and
associated interfaces.  These templates are implemented with
macros, as we're not in C++ land.  The interface functions are
typesafe and use static inline functions, sometimes backed by
out-of-line generic functions.  The vectors are designed to
interoperate with the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.4/gccint/GTY-Options.html GTY] machinery.

Because of the different behavior of structure objects, scalar
objects and of pointers, there are three flavors, one for each of
these variants.  Both the pointer and structure object variants
pass pointers to objects around -- in the former case the pointers
are stored into the vector and in the latter case the pointers are
dereferenced and the objects copied into the vector.  The scalar
object variant is suitable for int-like objects, and the vector
elements are returned by value.

There are both 'index' and 'iterate' accessors.  The iterator
returns a boolean iteration condition and updates the iteration
variable passed by reference.  Because the iterator will be
inlined, the address-of can be optimized away.

The vectors are implemented using the trailing array idiom, thus
they are not resizeable without changing the address of the vector
object itself.  This means you cannot have variables or fields of
vector type -- always use a pointer to a vector.  The one exception
is the final field of a structure, which could be a vector type.
You will have to use the embedded_size &amp; embedded_init calls to
create such objects, and they will probably not be resizeable (so
don't use the 'safe' allocation variants).  The trailing array
idiom is used (rather than a pointer to an array of data), because,
if we allow NULL to also represent an empty vector, empty vectors
occupy minimal space in the structure containing them.

Each operation that increases the number of active elements is
available in 'quick' and 'safe' variants.  The former presumes that
there is sufficient allocated space for the operation to succeed
(it dies if there is not).  The latter will reallocate the
vector, if needed.  Reallocation causes an exponential increase in
vector size.  If you know you will be adding N elements, it would
be more efficient to use the reserve operation before adding the
elements with the 'quick' operation.  This will ensure there are at
least as many elements as you ask for, it will exponentially
increase if there are too few spare slots.  If you want to reserve a
specific number of slots, but do not want the exponential increase
(for instance, you know this is the last allocation), use a
negative number for reservation.  You can also create a vector of a
specific size from the get go.

You should prefer the push and pop operations, as they append and
remove from the end of the vector. If you need to remove several
items in one go, use the truncate operation.  The insert and remove
operations allow you to change elements in the middle of the
vector.  There are two remove operations, one which preserves the
element ordering 'ordered_remove', and one which does not
'unordered_remove'.  The latter function copies the end element
into the removed slot, rather than invoke a memmove operation.  The
'lower_bound' function will determine where to place an item in the
array using insert that will maintain sorted order.

When a vector type is defined, first a non-memory managed version
is created.  You can then define either or both garbage collected
and heap allocated versions.  The allocation mechanism is specified
when the type is defined, and is therefore part of the type.  If
you need both gc'd and heap allocated versions, you still must have
'''''exactly''''' one definition of the common non-memory managed base vector.

If you need to directly manipulate a vector, then the 'address'
accessor will return the address of the start of the vector.  Also
the 'space' predicate will tell you whether there is spare capacity
in the vector.  You will not normally need to use these two functions.

Vector types are defined using a DEF_VEC_{O,P,I}(TYPEDEF) macro, to
get the non-memory allocation version, and then a
DEF_VEC_ALLOC_{O,P,I}(TYPEDEF,ALLOC) macro to get memory managed
vectors.  Variables of vector type are declared using a
VEC(TYPEDEF,ALLOC) macro.  The ALLOC argument specifies the
allocation strategy, and can be either 'gc' or 'heap' for garbage
collected and heap allocated respectively.  It can be 'none' to get
a vector that must be explicitly allocated (for instance as a
trailing array of another structure).  The characters O, P and I
indicate whether TYPEDEF is a pointer (P), object (O) or integral
(I) type.  Be careful to pick the correct one, as you'll get an
awkward and inefficient API if you use the wrong one.  There is a
check, which results in a compile-time warning, for the P and I
versions, but there is no check for the O versions, as that is not
possible in plain C.  Due to the way GTY works, you must annotate
any structures you wish to insert or reference from a vector with a
GTY(()) tag.  You need to do this even if you never declare the GC
allocated variants.

An example of their use would be,

  DEF_VEC_P(tree);   // non-managed tree vector.
  DEF_VEC_ALLOC_P(tree,gc);    // gc'd vector of tree pointers.  This must
                               // appear at file scope.
  
  struct my_struct {
    VEC(tree,gc) *v;      // A (pointer to) a vector of tree pointers.
  };
  
  struct my_struct *s;
  
  if (VEC_length(tree,s-&gt;v)) { we have some contents }
  VEC_safe_push(tree,gc,s-&gt;v,decl); // append some decl onto the end
  for (ix = 0; VEC_iterate(tree,s-&gt;v,ix,elt); ix++)
    { do something with elt }


==== Additional Representations ====

{{GNU_C_Compiler_Internals_Additional_Representations_{{{1}}} }}

{{GCC_take_home|GCC is a compiler collection that consists of a front end for each programming language, a middle end, and a back end for each architecture. The main representations that each source file goes through are AST in the front end, RTL in the middle end, and the assembly representation in the back end. GCC compiles one file at a time.}}

=== GCC Initialization ===

[[Image:Gcc_init.jpg|center|GCC initialization.]]

The C front end includes the C/C++ preprocessor and the C compiler. Program '''cc1''' includes both the preprocessor and C compiler. It compiles a C source file and generates an assembly (.S) file.

The compiler frontend and backend interact with each other using callback functions called language hooks. All hooks are included into a global variable struct lang_hooks lang_hooks that is defined in file langhooks.h. There are the following types of hooks: hooks for tree inlining, hooks for call graph, hooks for functions, hooks for tree dump, hooks for types, hooks for declarations, and language-specific hooks. The default values for the hooks are defined in file ''langhooks-def.h''.

GCC initialization consists of command line option parsing, initializing the back end, creating the global scope, and initializing the built-in data types and functions.

Each declaration is associated with a scope. For example, a local variable is associated with its function's scope. A global declaration is associated with the global scope. 

File ''toplev.c'' contains the main '''cc1''' function ''toplev_main()'' and global variables that define the state of the compiler. Variable ''current_function_decl'' is the declaration of the function being compiled or ''NULL'' if between functions. 

Function ''toplev_main()'' is the function that processes the command-line options, initializes the compiler, compiles a file, and frees up the allocated resources. Function ''decode_options()'' processes the command-line options and sets the corresponding variables within the compiler.

Following the command line option parsing function ''do_compile()'' is called. It performs the back-end initialization by calling function ''backend_init()''.

Backend initialization includes a number of steps. Function
init_emit_once() generates RTL expressions for a number of
registers: pc_rtx for the program counter, cc0 for the condition,
stack_pointer_rtx, frame_pointer_rtx, etc. They are saved in array
global_rtl.

After that, function ''lang_dependent_init()'' performs language-dependent initialization which includes the initialization of a front-end and a back-end. The C initialization function ''c_objc_common_init()'' creates built-in data types, initializes the global scope and performs other initialization tasks. Function ''c_common_nodes_and_builtins()'' creates pre-defined types described in file '''builtin-types.def.''' 

The standard C types are created at the initialization time. The following table presents several types:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC builtin types
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Variable Name
| C type
|- align=left
| char_type_node
| char
|-
| integer_type_node
| int
|-
| unsigned_type_node
| unsigned int
|-
| void_type_node
| void
|-
| ptr_type_node
| void*
|}

GCC built-in functions are the functions that are evaluated at compile time. For example, if the size argument of a ''strcpy()'' function is a constant then GCC replaces the function call with the required number of assignments. The compiler replaces standard library calls with built-in functions and then evaluates them once the function's AST is constructed. In case of ''strcpy()'', the compiler checks the size argument and uses the optimized built-in version of ''strcpy()'' if the argument is constant. ''builtin_constant_p()'' allows to find out if the value of its argument is known at compile time. GCC builtins are used beyond GCC. For example, the string processing library of Linux kernel uses ''builtin_constant_p()'' to invoke the optimized version of a string processing function if the string size is known at compile time. 

GCC evaluates each builtin function using a corresponding ''expand_builtin()'' function. For example, ''builtin_strcmp()'' is evaluated using ''expand_builtin_strcmp()''. The following table gives examples of GCC builtins:

{{GCC_take_home|GCC initialization consists of command line option parsing, initializing the back end, creating the global scope, and initializing the built-in data types and functions.}}

=== Parser and Preprocessor ===

Following the initialization, function ''do_compile()'' calls function ''compile_file()''. This function invokes ''parse_file()'' front-end language hook which is set to function ''c_common_parse_file()'' for C language. The latter function invokes function ''finish_options()'' which initializes the preprocessor and handles '''-D''', '''-U''', and '''-A''' command line options (which are equivalent to ''#define, #undef,'' and ''#assert'' respectively). The C preprocessor handles the preprocessor directives such as ''#define'', ''#include'' in the source code.

==== Parser ====

{{GNU_C_Compiler_Internals_Parser_{{{1}}} }}

==== Preprocessor ====

The preprocessor is implemented as a library. The C language lexer function ''c_lex()'' calls the '''libcpp''' function ''cpp_get_token()'' which handles the preprocessor keywords. The state of the preprocessor is defined by variable ''cpp_reader *parse_in''. Type ''struct cpp_reader'' contains most importantly the list of text buffers being processed. Each buffer corresponds to a source file (.c or .h). Function ''cpp_get_token()'' calls appropriate functions for legitimate preprocessor keywords. For example, when ''#include'' is encountered, function ''do_include_common()'' is invoked. It allocates a new buffer and places it on top of the buffer stack making it the current buffer. When a new file is compiled the buffer is popped off the stack and the compilation of the old file continues.

Function ''do_define()'' is called whenever a new macro is defined using ''#define'' keyword. 

{{GCC_take_home|The preprocessor takes care of the preprocessor directives, for example #include and #ifdef.}}

=== From Source Code to AST ===

After running the preprocessor GCC constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) for each function of the source file. An AST is a number of connected nodes of type ''struct tree''. Each node has a ''tree code'' that defines the type of the tree. Macro ''TREE_CODE()'' is used to refer to the code. Tree codes are defined in files '''tree.def''' and '''c-common.def'''. Trees with different tree codes are grouped into ''tree classes''. The following tree classes are defined among others in GCC:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC tree classes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Tree Class
| Explanation
|- align=left
| 'd'
| declarations
|- 
| '&lt;'
| comparison
|- 
| '2'
| binary arithmetic
|}


There are two types of trees: ''statements'' and ''expressions''. Statements correspond to the C constructs, for example an expression followed by a ';', a conditional statement, a loop statement, etc. Expressions are what the statements are built up from. Examples of expressions are an assignment expression, an arithmetic expression, a function call, etc. Examples of tree codes are given in the following table:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC tree codes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center

|-
| FUNCTION_DECL

| DECL_SOURCE_FILE(t) - source file; DECL_NAME(t) - variable name;
|-
| ARRAY_TYPE
| 't'
| array type
| TREE_TYPE(t) - type of an array element; TYPE_DOMAIN(t) - type of index;
|-
| DECL_STMT
| 'e'
| variable declaration
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - variable; DECL_INITIAL(TREE_OPERAND(t,1)) - initial value;

|}

In addition to the tree code that defines the type of the tree, a number of operands different for each tree type are available. For example, an assignment expression has two operands which correspond to the left and right sides of the expression. Macro ''TREE_OPERAND'' is used to refer to the operands. Macro ''IDENTIFIER_POINTER'' is used to find the name of an identifier that an ''IDENTIFIER_NODE'' tree represents. The following table presents several tree nodes, their purpose, and their operands.

Each tree has a type that corresponds to the type of C expression that it represents For example, the type of the ''MODIFY_EXPR'' node is the type of the left-hand side operand. ''NOP_EXPR'' and ''CONVERT_EXPR'' trees are used for type casting.

Tree ''NULL_TREE'' is equivalent to ''NULL''. Function ''debug_tree()'' prints out the tree to ''stderr''.

When a new identifier is lexed, it is added to the pool of strings that GCC maintains. The tree code of an identifier is ''IDENTIFIER_NODE''. When the same identifier is lexed again, the same tree node is returned. Function ''get_identifier()'' returns the tree node for an identifier. 

[[Image:Gcc_decl.jpg|center|Parsing variable declaration.]]

A new variable declaration is processed in a number of function calls. First, function ''start_decl()'' is called with the name of the declaration, its type as returned by the lexer, and its attributes. The function calls ''grokdeclarator()'' that checks the type and argument nodes and returns a tree with the code appropriate for the declaration: ''VAR_DECL'' for variables, ''TYPE_DECL'' for types, etc. The declarartion is then added to the ''scope''. A scope contains all declarations created within a function, but does not contain global declarations. There is also the global scope that contains global declarations. When a function is parsed, its declarations are attached to its body as a ''BLOCK'' node. When a declaration is created, the identifier node is associated with the declaration node using ''IDENTIFIER_SYMBOL_VALUE''. Function ''lookup_name()'' returns the declaration for a given identifier. When a declaration leaves the scope the tree attributes ''C_DECL_INVISIBLE'' is asserted.

A ''symbol table'' is not maintained in GCC. Instead, the compiler uses the pool of identifiers and ''C_DECL_INVISIBLE'' attribute. Language hook ''lang_hooks.decls.getdecls()'' returns the variables in the scope chained together.

Functions ''start_init()'' and ''finish_init()'' are called for an initialized declaration. Function ''finish_decl()'' finalizes the declaration. For an array declaration it computes the size of an initialized array. Then function ''layout_decl()'' is called. It computes the size and alignment of the declaration.

Parsing a function depends on the presence of its body. A function declaration is parsed using the same functions as those used for variable declarations. For a function definition, function ''start_function()'' is called. Then the compiler parses the body of the function. When the function ends function ''finish_function()'' is called.

Functions ''start_decl()'' and ''start_function()'' take declaration's ''attributes'' parameter as one of their arguments. The attributes are described in the GCC Manual. Attributes are extensions of GNU implementation of C. The following table presents a few of them and explains their purpose:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ Function attributes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Attribute
| Explanation
|- align=left
| constructor
| call function automatically before main()
|-
| destructor
| call function automatically after main()
|-
| alias
| alias to another function

|}

For each type of C statement there is a function that constructs a tree node of the corresponding type. For example, function ''build_function_call()'' builds a ''CALL_EXPR'' node for a function call. It takes the identifier of the function name and the arguments as its parameters. The function finds the function declaration using ''lookup_name()'' and type casts the arguments using ''default_conversion()''.

After a function has been parsed, use macro ''DECL_SAVED_TREE'' to
access its body. It is represented with a ''BIND_EXPR'' tree which binds
local variables to statements. ''BIND_EXPR_VARS'' gives a chain of
declared variables. ''BIND_EXPR_BODY'' returns a tree of ''STATEMENT_LIST''
type.

The following API allows one to traverse a statement list and to
manipulate it:

| link chain after iter
|-
| tsi_next(&amp;iter)
| next element of the list
|-
| append_to_statement_list(tree, &amp;stmt_list)
| append tree to stmt_list
|}

It is possible to instrument function prolog/epilog at this level as
demonstrated in ''gimplify_function_tree()''. To add a statement to
function epilog, use ''TRY_FINALLY_EXPR'' tree. Its first operand are the
old statements, the second argument is the epilog statements. This
type of treet instructs the following passes to execute the
statements when a common exit basic block of a function is created.

To instrument function prolog, prepend the tree
with the desired statements. Therefore, ''BIND_EXPR_BODY'' will have the
prolog and the ''TRY_FINALLY_EXPR'' tree.

The ASTs are then converted into the SSA and eventually to the RTL representations. Whether the conversion occurs after parsing each function or when the whole file is parsed is controlled by the compiler option '''-funit-at-a-time'''. It is false by default. 

{{GCC_take_home|GCC parser builds the AST representation of the source file. ASTs are built up of tree nodes. Each node has a code. Tree nodes correspond to the statements and expressions of C. Function debug_tree() prints out the tree.}}

=== From AST to GIMPLE ===

An AST is gimplified when gimplify_function_tree() is eventually called from finish_function().

GIMPLE representation is based on SIMPLE described in {{ref|simple_paper}}

According to this paper, the goal is to represent the tree as basic
statements:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GIMPLE trees
|- align=left
| x=a binop b
| x=a
| x=cast b
| f(args)
|-
| *p=a binop b
| *p=a
| *p=cast b
| -
|-
| x=unop a
| x=*q
| x=&amp;y
| x=f(args)
|-
| *p=unop a
| *p=*q
| *p=&amp;y
| *p=f(args)
|}

Temp variables are created as necessary in functions
create_tmp_var() and declare_tmp_vars().

At this stage, GCC optimizes of complex conditional expressions, that is

  if (a || b) stmt;

is translated into

  if (a) goto L1;
  if (b) goto L1; else goto L2;
  L1:
  stmt;
  L2:

Also, each branch of a conditional expression is wrapped into
STATEMENT_LIST tree.

=== From GIMPLE to RTL ===

''Register Transfer Language'' represents an abstract machine with an
infinite number of registers. Type ''rtx'' describes an instruction. Each RTL expression has a code and machine mode.

Similarly to ASTs, codes are grouped in a number of classes. They are defined in mode-classes.def.

|+ Classes of RTL expressions

| something that matches in insns (e.g, MATCH_DUP)
|-
| RTX_AUTOINC
| autoincrement addressing modes (e.g. POST_DEC)
|-
| RTX_EXTRA
| everything else
|}

Machine modes listed in file machmode.def specify a size and format of data at the machine level. At the syntax tree level, each ..._TYPE and each ..._DECL node has a machine mode which describes data of that type or the data of the variable declared.

A list of instructions is built when function is compiled. Function emit_insn() adds an instruction to the list.  A variable declaration AST has its RTL already generated. Use DECL_RTL
to access it. Function emit_cmp_and_jump_insns() outputs a conditional
statement. emit_label() prints out a label. These functions  chain instructions
one after another. Macros PREV_INSN and NEXT_INSN are used to traverse
the list.

It is possible to access the first and last instructions using 
first_insn and last_insn. get_insns() gives the first insn of the current sequence or current function.

Use debug_rtx() to print out an RTL instruction on the screen and
function print_rtl() to print a list of RTL expressions.

A number of functions create the nodes. For example, gen_label_rtx()
build a label. The most generic functions are located in the
target-specific directory. For example, x86 architecture rtl
generation files genrtl.c and genrtl.h are in ./host-i686-pc-linux-gnu. 

=== From RTL to Object ===

Each target architecture has its description represented as struct
gcc_target targetm. Default initializers are available in file
targhooks.c

The backend generates the assembly code for the specified target platform. Function ''output_asm_insn()'' is called for each instruction written to the assembly file. Function ''final_start_function()'' generates the prolog of the function before it is saved to the assembly file.

=== Lowering Passes ===

The processing of a function includes its ''lowering'' when a number of
optimization passes are applied to it in function
tree_lowering_passes(). As a result of lowering a function its
control-flow graph is generated. A subsequent call to function
cgraph_create_edges() uses basic block information to augment edges of
the callgraph with invocations that the current function
performs. References to functions yet undefined are saved in function
record_references().

===Switch Statement===

Let us consider how a switch statement is translated from the source
code to GIMPLE to RTL.

Function c_parser_switch_statement() is called when the statement is
encountered in the source code. A typical switch statement has a
number of case statements that might have breaks. Therefore, the
parser has c_break_label tree that marks the place where switch
ends. The function parses the body of the statement and generates
LABEL_EXPR tree for the break label if at least one break was
found. Function c_finish_case() attaches the body to the SWITCH_EXPR
tree as one of its operands. In addition, this tree has two other
operands: switch condition and switch labels. The operands are
accessed using macro SWITCH_COND(), SWITCH_BODY(), and
SWITCH_LABELS(). The labels are not filled in at the parse time.

A switch statement is gimplified in function
gimplify_switch_expr(). The idea is to separate the body from the
decision part and generate switch labels to make it possible to
redirect execution to the appropriate case after verifying the
condition. We will consider the case when default label exists. This
function has two pointers to the
statement list: pre_p which is the list of side effects and expr_p
which is the statement itself.

The body of the switch is gimplified in
gimplify_to_stmt_list(). Case labels are saved in field case_labels of
variable struct gimplify_ctx gimplify_ctxp. Then the function creates
a TREE_VEC of labels and initializes
them with the corresponding case label. The TREE_VEC is assigned
to SWITCH_LABELS operand of switch statement which is then appended to
the pre_p list. The original statement is then
overwritten with the SWITCH_BODY using expr_p pointer. Finally, the
SWITCH_BODY operand of the switch statment in the side effects list is
wiped out so that it contains labels only.

From this point on it is clear that compiler tries to represent the
original statement using a jump table which maps each possible index
value to the address of the corresponding case. Function expand_case()
implements this idea. It generates a table_label at which jump
instructions for each possible index value are generated. Then
function try_tablejump() is called which expands index tree into index
rtl and invokes do_tablejump(). This function generates absolute
index rtl which combines the base address table_label and index
offset. It emits jump instruction to the proper entry of the jump
table afterwards. The execution continues in function
expand_case(). The jump table is generated using SWITCH_LABELS:

 labelvec[i] = gen_rtx_LABEL_REF (Pmode, label_rtx (n-&gt;code_label));

A number of jump instructions are emitted finally:

 if (CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE || flag_pic)
   emit_jump_insn (gen_rtx_ADDR_DIFF_VEC (CASE_VECTOR_MODE,
                                          gen_rtx_LABEL_REF (Pmode, table_label),
                                          gen_rtvec_v (ncases, labelvec),
                                          const0_rtx, const0_rtx));

      <text xml:space="preserve">==toString() method for each structure as in Java==

==Invoke a block of code from a function as in Ruby==

Linux implementation of lists allows to invoke a block of code on each element of the list:

[http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/nfs/pagelist.c?v=2.4.20#L199 pagelist.c]:

        list_for_each_prev(pos, head) {
                 struct nfs_page *p = nfs_list_entry(pos);
                 if (page_index(p-&gt;wb_page) &lt; pg_idx)
                         break;
        }

list_for_each_prev takes the code in the brackets as a parameter. The trick is to use a macro that rolls out to a for() loop whose body becomes the code in the brackets. The goal of this project is to allow programmers to use code blocks in function calls. 

==Dereference function results when a structure is returned==

C allows one to dereference the return value of a function if it is a pointer to a structure:

  get_struct()-&gt;field=0;

If the function returns the structure, not a pointer to it, then a compile-time error is generated:

  get_struct().field=0;
  &gt; request for member `field' in something not a structure or union

This extension addresses the problem of dereferencing structures that are return values.

==Use functions to initialize a variable==

When a variable is defined and initialized the initializer is constant. You will get an error if you try to use a function, no matter what this function is:

  int getint() { return 1; }
  int i=getint();
  &gt; initializer element is not constant

When a variable is used the function it was initialized with is called.

==Default values of function arguments as in C++==

  void func(int a=0) {
    printf(&quot;a=%d\n&quot;, a);
  }
  int main() {
    func();
  }
  &gt; syntax error before '=' token

==Reference parameters as in C++==

  void test(int &amp;a, int &amp;b);
  int x,y;
  test(x,y);


==GCC switches in object file==
[http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Record%20GCC%20command%20line%20switches%20in%20object%20files GCC switches in object file]

==Type information at run-time==

There is no type information in C language available at run-time. The idea is to allow program to get the names and offsets of a structure's field at run time, the symbolic name of an enum declaration, etc. For example, instead of writing

   enum tree_code code;
   ...
   switch (code) {
     case VAR_DECL:
       printf(&quot;VAR_DECL\n&quot;);
       break;
     case BLOCK:
       printf(&quot;BLOCK\n&quot;);
       break;
     ...
   }

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Function overloading in C ==

The C function overloading extension aims at including a C++ feature
to  C language which allows use functions with the same name but
different argument types. The cfo/test.c example of GEM demonstrates
this feature:

 void ec_aa_add(int from, char *to);
 void ec_aa_add(int from, int to);
 ...

are used to add an element to a pool data structure.

The idea behind the implementation of the extension is to rewrite each
function declaration so that the new name includes the type
information of function's arguments. In the above case, the modified
names are ec_aa_add_int_char_ptr and ec_aa_add_int_int. The
compilation continues normally with the updated names.

Because of the above modification, the call names need modification as
well. The renaming takes into account the types of the arguments so
that the appropriate function is called. For example, the compiler
will modify

 ec_aa_add(1,2);

to

 ec_aa_add_int_int(1,2);

Three hooks are used in this extension. Functions cfo_start_decl() and
cfo_start_function() intercept declarations. They call
cfo_alias_decl() that replaces the name using argument types. To
preserve the library code for the programs that do not use CFO
extension, the following technique is used. If the function name is
encountered first time, an alias is
created to its old name so that one can invoke the function using either
of them. Thus, the legacy code will use the old name, while the
CFO-compiled code will use the type-augmented name. Finally, the
declaration name is updated to include type information.

Hook cfo_build_function_call() is invoked from the parser when a new
function call is found. It replaces the name of callee function with
the name that takes into account the types of actual-in arguments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==High and Low Culture==
The book shows the meeting of high and low culture. Dora and Nora represent low culture, they do not perform film, it is a flop and is shown in fleapits. 

The meeting of high and low culture can be seen in the way that a PhD student attempts to contact Dora and Nora to interview them about their appearance in the film version of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. The Hazard Dynasty, which performed Shakespeare, is now forced to appear on the game show 'Lashings of Lolly'.  

While the Hazards live in luxury, Dora and Nora live in a terraced house in Brixton.

The novel shows the decline of high culture. Shakespeare and music halls to the mass media (Lashings of Lolly).

Gorgeous George is used to represent the decline of the British Empire. He once sang &quot;Rose of England, breathing England’s air, Flower of majesty beyond compare…&quot;. He has a map of the British Empire on his body but after the war he is forced to play Bottom in 'The Dream'. He is eventually seen on the streets where Dora gives him money. Dora's phrase &quot;Lo how the mighty have fallen&quot; could equally apply to British imperialism (''The practice of one country extending its control over the territory, political system, or economic life of another country''). It is known that Angela Carter became interested in the relationship between imperialism and British identity.[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5060]  

High culture such as Shakespeare is reduced to low culture by lines such as &quot;2b or not 2b&quot;

Carter could be seen as doing this so as to universalize Shakespeare for the masses (something that Ranulph once tried to do). Shakespeare has come to personify the epitome of &quot;high culture,&quot; which is not necessarily true (after all, his plays often featured bawdy humor and more bumbling, even slapstick characters so as to appeal not only to the educated with references to ancient literature but also to the general public).
By doing this, Carter blurs the lines between high and low culture and tries to bring Shakespeare back to his roots. She therefore goes against traditional views and the established norm, a theme which runs through the novel.

==Legitimacy and Illegitimacy==
*The word Hazard is an archaic word for Chance showing how the two families are connected.

*Gorgeous George presents a theme of the novel illegitimacy with his joke which ends in the punch line &quot;'E's not your father!&quot; this line reverberates throughout the novel. Specifically, to Saskia and Imogen about Melchior at his 100th birthday party.

*Not only are Dora and Nora illegitimate but they performed in the &quot;lower-class&quot;  music halls rather than &quot;upper-class&quot; Shakespeare. This is pointed out on the first page, they come from the &quot;bastard side of old father Thames&quot;.  Also, Melchior's place at Eaton Square is on the other side of the river; the legitimate side.

*There is irony in the fact that Saskia and Imogen ridicule Dora and Nora, as they are in fact illegitimate themselves. However, Dora and Nora are  jealous of the two throughout the novel as they are accepted by Melchior. 

*There are also question marks over Melchior and Perry's parentage. Perry even questions whether Pretty Kitty is the mother of Dora and Nora.

*The novel itself celebrates romantic illegitimacy - being born on the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot;.

== Patriarchy ==
''Social organization that structures the dominance of men over women.''


Melchior embodies patriarchal society, however Peregrine ridicules him by making him jump for his crown and by producing a macaw from his clothes during 'The Dream'.

&quot;old father Thames&quot;  - from the beginning of the novel, Carter introduces the theme of a male-dominated society.

However, Carter adopts what can be seen as a rather balanced perspective. On the one hand she criticizes fatherhood (&quot;a moving feast,&quot; dealing with absent fathers) and the traditional male-dominated society, yet on the other hand motherhood is brought into question. Indeed, Carter allows the reader to even sympathize with the shallow Melchior in that he in turn has had problems with his own absent father (this is also a counter-argument to the question as to whether Carter is sexist). 

Additionally, in Chapter 5, Carter almost again makes the reader pity Melchior in that he may not be that terrible a father in actual fact, it was just impossible for him to live up to the expectations of his daughters. 
Once again, the argument is balanced.

==Nature vs. Nurture==
*&quot;Triumph of Nature over Nurture Ducky&quot;

*Melchior raises Saskia and Imogen and they turn out like brats!

Perry and Grandma Chance raise Dora and Nora and they are the opposite of Saskia and Imogen

Just about every male in the novel is represented poorly! Even your opinion of Perry is challenged after the incestuous end to the novel.

==Identity==
Identity is another theme in 'Wise Children' 

*Grandma chance is described as “inventing herself” and inventing the family. The way in which Dora's family has been invented can be seen in the way that Wheelchair replaced Grandma Chance. 

*I was…not the Dora he’d fallen for (Piano Man) – Nora and Dora swap places. 
 
*‘We were a pretty girl!’ – Dora and Nora’s identity is almost one, Dora seems to revel in the duality between her and her sister and the recognition it gives them  

*&quot;We were bereft…of a good deal of ourselves, too – Dora feels that she has lost part of herself after Grandma Chance’s death.

*“A wonder of the plastic surgeon’s art” – Genghis Khan’s first wife changed her appearance to look like Dora.

*Dora and Nora's first performance is Babes In The Wood, a play of &quot;two children abandoned in a wood&quot;. Their situation is much like Dora and Nora's, abandoned by their father, left to survive without the aid of a male role model. (R.O)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Language and Narrative voice in Wise Children==

There are several narrative strategies used in Wise Children. Angela Carter uses a first person narrative allowing an intimate tone to be created between the characters of the novel and the reader.
The novel has conversational as well as chatty elements to its tone with which Carter talks to the reader through Dora Chance, intimacy is even created through Dora's crude language such as the line &quot;bugger the robin&quot; and by talking to the reader as if they are in the room with Dora. An example is when she is looking at a photo of Tiffany she states &quot;isn't she lovely?&quot; as if she is expecting a response. The tone of the narrative is also quite reflective.

The plot of Wise Children is non-linear: it doesn't follow a chronological plot line. Dora can frequently revert from the present to the past in a few short paragraphs. This reflects the carnivalesque elements of the book: with the idea of chaos and dissaray.

Narrative techniques include:

==Riddles==
Q. Why is London like Budapest 
A. Because it is two cities divided by a river.
which links to a tale of two cities by Dickens where London and Paris are referred to.

==Direct Address==

&quot;Good Morning let me introduce myself. My name is Dora Chance&quot;

==Crude Language==

&quot;Bugger the robin&quot;

&quot;And wars are facts we cannot fuck away...&quot;

&quot;There's more to fathering then fucking...&quot;

&quot;...Don't be a bitch Dora...&quot; (commenting on herself)

&quot;We can still lift a leg higher than your average dog, if called for.&quot;

&quot;We were wet for it, I tell you! Such a rush of blood to our vitals when we started to dance!&quot;

==Refrains==

&quot;What a joy it is to dance and sing&quot;

&quot;Hope for the best, expect the worst&quot; - Grandma Chance's wisdom

&quot;Lo, how the mighty have fallen.&quot;

==Theatrical Metaphor==

&quot;I made my bow five minutes ahead of Nora&quot;

&quot;That was my last curtain call...&quot; (after sleeping with Perry)

&quot;Enter Daisy&quot; 

==Shakespearean Quotations==

&quot;Give me your hands, if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends&quot;. (A Midsummer Night's Dream)

&quot;Making the beasts with two backs&quot; (Othello)

By basing the event of the day and the novel itself, Carter is comparing and drawing similarities between everyday life and Shakespeare. This ties in with the theme of high-low culture and bringing Shakespeare back to the masses.

==Misquotations==

&quot;Did she fall or was she pushed? That was the question&quot; - Link to Hamlet (to be or not to be, that was the question)

'To butter or not to butter'-My lady Margerine.

==Mimicry==

&quot;She would look teddibly, teddibly British&quot;

&quot;She made mountaynes out of molehills&quot; 

&quot;...a nayce musical comedy...&quot;

==Withholding knoweldge==

&quot;Irish? Who's he?&quot; - The reader must read much further on to understand the disorientating first few pages. The changes in time frame whet the readers appetite by giving information on characters which occur much later in the novel.

&quot;No. Wait. I'll tell you all about it in my own good time.&quot;

==Dora as a narrator==
Dora can be seen as an unreliable narrator on several occasions she fails to recollect the next part of the story, as she is telling it from memory.

*&quot;I have a memory, though I know it cannot be a true one...&quot; 
*&quot;I could have sworn that...&quot; 
*&quot;these days, half a century and more later, I might think I did not live but dreamed that night...&quot; 
*&quot;I misremember. It was sixty-odd years ago you know&quot; 
* &quot;At my age, memory becomes exquisitively selective&quot;
*&quot;drunk in charge of a narrative&quot;
*&quot;We watch so many old movies our memories come in monochrome.&quot;
&quot;As I remember it, a band struck up out of nowhere&quot;

Labels such 'unreliable narrator' and 'magical realism' are inadequate for the complexities of Carters fiction. Rather it can be said that it is more the structure of the novel not being in order allows Dora to weave in new characters and themes.

===Longer, Quotation-Based Questions===
*'''Using the following extract as a starting point, consider the ways Carter presents the characters of Lady Atalanta, Imogen and Saskia.'''

''All in good time I shall reveal to you how it has come to pass that we inherited, in her dotage and, come to that, in ours, the first wife of our illegitimate father. Suffice to say that nobody else would have her. Least of all her own two daughters. Bloody cows. 'The lovely Hazard girls', they used to call them. Huh. Lovely is as lovely does; if they looked like what they behave like, they'd frighten little children. We've been storing Wheelchair in the basement for well-nigh thirty years. We've got quite attached to her. Earlier on, Nora used to take her out shopping, give her some fresh air and that, until she nearly starts a riot, she says to the bloke at the salad stall: 'Have you got anything in the shape of a cucumber, my good fellow?' After that, we had to keep her home for her own sake. Sometimes she goes on a bit, on and on, on and on and bloody on, in fact, worrying away at how Melchior took the best years of her life then deserted her for a Hollywood harlot - his Number Two bride - and how the 'lovely Hazard girls' did her out of all her money and how she fell downstairs and can never walk again and on and on and on and on until you want to throw a blanket over her, like you do to shut up a parrot. But there's not a scrap of harm in her and, besides, we owe her one from way back.''


*'''Using the following extract as a starting point, consider Carter's presentation of family conflicts and disappointments in the novel.'''

''He watched expectantly as they tore off the wrappings. The boxes were of metal, it turned out, with little holes drilled in the top. Curiouser and curiouser. Imogen got hers open first, peered in, then gave a little scream and dropped it. Saskia looked at hers and said: 'Good God!' Inside each box was a little nest of leaves and, inside the nest, a caterpillar. 'Named after you,' said Peregrine. 'Saskia Hazard. Imogen Hazard. Two of the most beautiful butterflies in all the rainforest. You'll go down in all the textbooks. As long as people love butterflies, your names will be on their lips, you'll have a kind of beautiful eternity. They are rare species, just like you both.' Saskia and Imogen stared blankly at their boxes. No doubt they'd hoped for a little oil well each. 'Is that all?' said Imogen. She poked the caterpillar with her fork. It did not stir. 'I think mine's dead,' she said. Saskia snapped her box shut and dropped it on the table. 'Thanks a lot,' she said, with heavy irony.''


*'''How typical is this extract of Dora's reaction to her experiences throughout the novel?'''
''And my heart stood still, I was seventeen again, I was a virgin powdering my nose with beating heart, for there was lilac, lilac everywhere. In bowls in jars in cornucopias. White lilac, the evening's floral theme. I was all misty because of the smell of lilac as we processed in the long line towards where our father was receiving in an alcove, seated on a sort of throne. He wasn’t wearing a monkey suit or tails unlike most of his gusts, but had on a rather majestic and heavily embroidered purple caftan. I thought, colostomy; but that caftan made a lovely contrast to his longish, pewter coloured hair, still thick and heavy. There were rings on his fingers, like a king, or a pope, and a big gold medallion around his neck. He looked regal but festive. My heart gave a thump and the beat started to speed up. We waited patiently in line to wish him 'Happy birthday', standing in line between a theatrical knight and a TV presenter who babbled insanities at one another across us which pissed us off, but we decided to tolerate the invisibility of old ladies-note that, even dressed up like four penny ham-bones, our age and gender still rendered us invisible-because it was special occasion, although as a general rule, we debate invisibility hotly. I snatched at the champagne a couple of times as it waltzed past I was bloody nervous, I can tell you.''


*'''Using the following extract as a starting point, consider the ways in which Carter uses Grandma Chance and Kitty in the novel.'''
''Nine Months later, her heart gave out when we were born. Apart from that I don't know anything about her. We don't even know what she looked like, there isn't a picture. She was called Kitty, like a little stray cat. Fatherless, motherless. Perhaps Mrs. Chance's house was even a haven to her, in spite of the stairs - she must have run up and down the stairs twenty times a day, thirty times a day. And the grates to be leaded, the front steps to be scoured. ''
'' Not that Mrs Chance was what the French called exigeante. She didn’t run the fanciest boarding house in Brixton, it barely managed to cling to respectability by the skin of its teeth, and you could have said the same of her. There were Boston ferns, in green glazed pots, on stands, and Turkey rugs, but the whole place never looked plausible. It looked like the staged set of a theatrical boarding house, as if Grandma had done it up to suit a role she’d chosen on purpose. She was a mystery was Mrs. Chance. '' 
 

*'''The following is the ending of Wise Children. How appropriate do you find it as the conclusion to the novel?'''
''The window on the second-floor front window of 41 Bard Road went up, a head came out. Dreadlocks. That Rastafarian. ‘You two, again,’ he said. ‘Have a Heart!’ we said. ‘We’ve got something to celebrate, tonight!’ ‘Well, you just watch it, in case a squad car comes by,’ he said. ‘Drunk in charge of a baby carriage at your age.’ We’d got so many songs to sing to our babies, all the old songs, that we didn’t pay him any attention. ‘Gee, we’d like to see you looking swell, babies!’ and the Hazard theme song, ‘Is You Is or Is You Ain’t’. Then there were songs from the show that nobody else remembers. ‘2b or not 2b’, ‘Hey nonny bloody no’, ‘Mistress Mine’, and Broadway tunes and paper moons, and lilacs in the spring, again. We went on dancing and singing. ‘Diamond bracelets Woolworths doesn’t sell.’ Besides it was our birthday wasn’t it, we’d got to sing the silly song about Charlie Chaplin and his comedy boots all the kinds were singing and dancing in the street the day we were born. There was singing and dancing all along Bard Road that day and we’ll go on singing and dancing until we drop in our tracks, won’t we kids? What a joy it is to dance and sing.''      



*'''The following extract is taken from the novel after the fire in Melchior’s house when he believes his father’s paper crown is lost. Using the passage as a starting point, explore how the writer uses the idea of a ‘flimsy bit of make-believe’ through the novel.'''

''‘My crown, my foolish crown, my paper crown of a king of shreds and patches,’ he lamented. ‘The crown my father wore as Lear – to have survived so many deaths, so much heartbreak, so many travels…and now, gone up in smoke! Oh, my dear girl, we mummers are such simple folk . . . superstitious as little children. The fire was welcome to take everything, the frills and furbelows, the toys and the gewgaws, the oil paintings, the cloisonné, the Elizabethan oak . . . . but, oh, my crown! That cardboard crown, with the gold paint peeling off. Do you know, can you guess, my dear, how much it meant to me? More than wealth, or fame, or women, or children . . .’ I’d better believe that, what he said about children. I was amazed to see him so much moved, and on account of what? A flimsy piece of make-believe. A nothing. ‘What shall I do without my crown? Othello’s occupation gone!’''


*'''Remind yourself of the following extract which describes the set of the film of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Using the extract below as a starting point, consider the importance of the film-making episode in the novel.''' 

''The wood near Athens covered an entire stage and was so thickly art-directed it  came up all black in the rushes, couldn’t see a thing, so they spayed it in parts with silver paint to lighten it up. The concept of this wood was scaled down to fit the size of fairy folk, so it was all twice as large as life. Larger. Daisies as big as your head and as white as spook, foxgloves as tall as the tower of Pisa that chimed like bells if shook. Gnarled, fissured tree-trunks; sprays of enormous leaves – oak, ash, thorn, like parasols, or gilder planes, or awnings. Bindweed in streamers and conkers, deposited at intervals in heaps on the ground. Yes, conkers. All spikes. And rolling around at random underfoot, or stuck on buds, or hanging in mid-air as if they’d just rolled off a wild rose or out of a cowslip, imitation dewdrops, that is, big faux pearls, suspended on threads. And clockwork birds as well – thrushes finches, sparrows, larks – that lifted up their wings and lowered their heads and sang out soprano, mezzo, contralto, joining in the fairy songs.''


*'''Using the following extract as a starting point, consider how Carter presents Melchoir in the novel.'''

''And my heart stood still, I was seventeen again, I was a virgin powdering my nose with beating heart, for there was lilac, lilac everywhere. In bowls in jars in cornucopias. White lilac, the evening's floral theme. I was all misty because of the smell of lilac as we processed in the long line towards where our father was receiving in an alcove, seated on a sort of throne. He wasn’t wearing a monkey suit or tails unlike most of his gusts, but had on a rather majestic and heavily embroidered purple caftan. I thought, colostomy; but that caftan made a lovely contrast to his longish, pewter coloured hair, still thick and heavy. There were rings on his fingers, like a king, or a pope, and a big gold medallion around his neck. He looked regal but festive. My heart gave a thump and the beat started to speed up.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Importance of Shakespeare in 'Wise Children'==

Shakespeare is seen to be important to the Hazard dynasty, as it is Shakespeare that is perpetuating it. The way that the novel's characters' lives are almost guided by Shakespeare is another example of magical realism. Shakespeare has had the quote, &quot;It's a wise child that knows its own father&quot; accredited to him, however it has also been accredited to Homer and Mark Twain. 

Shakespeare is presented in &quot;Wise Children&quot; as “high culture”. It is the culture of Melchior who comes from the right side of the tracks.  However there is a blurring between this high and low culture, as Dora is able to quote Shakespearean lines.

Carter changes the plot when borrowing from some of Shakespeare’s plays. For example, Tiffany rejects Tristram whereas Hero chooses Claudio. But then perhaps this is expected from a feminist writer, as throughout Wise Children the female characters are always the most dominant.

Melchior’s obsession with Shakespeare can be seen in the way that he refers to Dora and Nora as “Peaseblossom! Mustardseed!” Melchior is portrayed as obsessed with his acting; this causes Lady A to make her dramatic speech accusing Melchior of leaving her womb empty. Angela Carter makes several more references to Shakespeare

*&quot;Shakespeare was a kind of God for him&quot; – A quote about Ranulph (Melchior's father) 
*&quot;Shakespeare, to whom our family owed so much&quot; 

Throughout the novel, there are numerous references to the works of William Shakespeare. Carter attempted to provide reference to every Shakespeare play however did not manage it completely:

==Twelfth Night==
*What You Will, the West End show, which Melchior Hazard appears, is an alternative title for Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. 

*Estella is described as playing Viola
&quot;She worked the provincial circuits, Juliet, Rosalind, Viola, Portia...&quot;

*The triple marriage in the third chapter is an allusion to the triple marriage at the end of Twelfth Night.

==Much Ado About Nothing==

*Estella 'A Star Danced' Hazard is a reference to a line in the Shakespearean play Much Ado About Nothing where Beatrice says:

&quot;No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!&quot;

Estella is also described as playing the character of Beatrice.

There is a parallel with Much Ado About Nothing as Hero is hidden believed to be dead like Tiffany.

*A lot of disguise and deception occurs within the novel (the Chance sisters swapping perfumes to disguise each other as the other, Genghis Khan's first wife assuming the guise of Dora)

*Carter explores tragedy through comedy (e.g. pedophilia with Lewis Carroll, miscarriages on stage, domestic violence with Nora)

==Hamlet==

*Another Shakespearean reference is the house, which Dora and Nora live in at 49, Bard Road, Brixton, London. Dora also muses whether or not a parcel should be delivered to “2b or not 2b” a version of Hamlet’s often quoted line “To be or not to be”. There is also a misquotation of this line when My Lady Margarine is mocked saying &quot;To butter or not to butter&quot;

There is a parallel between the Shakespearean play Hamlet and Tiffany’s shaming on the game show ‘Lashings of Lolly’. She appears mad and delusional like the character Ophelia. Ophelia carries flowers and sings just like Tiffany does. Ophelia drowns which is how it is suggested that Tiffany has died.

There is a parallel with Hamlet as Melchior has multiple marriages like Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother

Saskia tries to poison Melchior at his 100th party via the cake. Poison is a key tool in Shakespearean literature as a means of killing off the king or important person. Claudius poisons King Hamlet, and tries to poison the younger Hamlet. This attempt is successful. What is particularly significant is that in the final scenes, the poison intended for Hamlet kills Gertrude, Claudius's wife and sister. Saskia almost poisons Tristram, highlighting the previously hinted-at incestuous relationship between them. In Wise Children, the Hazard family are portrayed as an illegitimate royalty (for example, the paste board crown echoes the fakeness of their royalty), which is why the poison is unsuccessful. In all Shakespearean tragedy involving the poisoning of a king or lord, they are always successful, but as Melchior isn't real royalty - the attempt on his life is unsuccessful. A kind of echo to Shakespearian cliche-ism.

Melchior quotes Claudius with his line “pretty, pretty lady,” when he covers Tiffany on Lashings of Lolly.

==Othello==
There is also a parallel with the Shakespearean play Othello when Ranulph kills himself, his wife Estella and Cassius Booth. This mirrors the plot of Othello. Othello believes that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio. When Othello is performed by the Hazards, Iago is played by Cassius Booth. Ranulph shoots Cassius before killing Estella and turning the gun on himself mirroring Othello’s suicide. Ranulph cannot separate life from art.

==A Midsummer Night's Dream==
Chapter 3 focuses on a film version of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' .The reworking of A Midsummer Night's Dream is more one of atmosphere rather than one of plot.

==Romeo and Juliet==
Old Nanny is presented as the nurse in 'Romeo and Juliet' during chapter five.

Melchior is playing Romeo when Grandma Chance finds him. He refuses to acknowledge paternity of Dora and Nora. 

==Merchant of Venice==
*Estella Hazard is described as playing Portia 
&quot;Here she is as Juliet, as Portia, as Beatrice&quot;

*She is also mentioned acting in &quot;the casket scene&quot; (Merchant of Venice) and the &quot;sleepwalking scene&quot; (Macbeth)

*The title of the play &quot;Wise Children&quot; is a reference to the Merchant of Venice (Act 2 Sc 2) when Launcelot says:

&quot;it is a wise father that knows his own child.&quot;

Shakespeare was changing a line of Homer's Odyssey: &quot;My mother,&quot; answered Telemachus, &quot;tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a wise child that knows his own father.&quot;

==A Winter's Tale== 
Estella made her debut as Mamillius in 'A Winter's Tale’, which is described as &quot;somewhat pedantic&quot;

Saskia quotes the line &quot;which some call natures bastards&quot; when insulting Dora and Nora.

==Julius Caesar==
Melchior in old age &quot;Your could hardly tell his Brutus (Julius Caesar) from his Antony&quot; (Antony and Cleopatra&quot;).

==Antony and Cleopatra==
Melchior in old age &quot;Your could hardly tell his Brutus (Julius Caesar) from his Antony&quot; (Antony and Cleopatra&quot;).

Dora says that Tristram is the 'last gasp of the Imperial Hazard Dynasty that bestrode the British theatre like a colossus for a century and a half', similar to how Anthony is described in Anthony and Cleopatra.

==Macbeth==
There is a parallel with Macbeth, Saskia is witch-like. Dora describes her as a witch on several occasions 

My Lady Margarine is like Lady Macbeth because she is the driving force behind her husband (e.g. forcing him to appear on TV)

Ranulph Hazard says &quot;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot; on a wax cylinder

Peregrine Hazard says 'Birnam Wood... Is just now creeping up on Dunsinane' when he takes Dora and Nora to see Melchior.

==King Lear==
There is a parallel with King Lear as this play focuses on sibling rivalry, the good daughter is rejected and there is mistreatment of parents. Both Ranulph and Melchior marry their ‘Cordelia’. Melchior can be seen as King Lear and Saskia and Imogen as Regan and Goneril as they reject him. 

Ranulph is quoted acting in King Lear when he says &quot;Be your tears wet?&quot; 

Melchior is introduced as the 'Prince of players!' and told to 'reclaim his crown.' a reference to King Lear.

Tiffany also bears a resemblance to King Lear when she appears on Tristram's gameshow. She says &quot;You only lent it to me! Nothing was mine, not ever!&quot;, and strips off her shirt, an allusion to King Lear's revelation after his downfall during which he realises that if he lost his kingdom so easily it couldn't have really been his, and so he strips himself of all clothing in order to rid himself of his temporary material possessions.

==As You Like It==
‘One Man in his Time…’ is a quote from 'As You Like It'. 

Dora and Nora stay in a hotel called the Forest of Arden, which is described as being ever so 'As You Like It'.

Estella is described as playing Rosalind
&quot;She worked the provincial circuits, Juliet, Rosalind, Viola, Portia...&quot;

==Henry V==

Cry God for Harry, England and St George!' when entering Melchior's 100th Birthday party.

==Richard III==
Melchior is described as becoming Richard III when he gets angry trying to get his crown from Peregrine

==Measure for Measure==
Dora says during 'The Dream' that they would perform the substitute bride bit in 'Measure for Measure' and 'All's Well that Ends Well'

==All's Well That Ends Well==
Dora says during 'The Dream' that they would perform the substitute bride bit in 'Measure for Measure' and 'All's Well that Ends Well'

==Richard II==

Dora keeps a picture of Melchior as Richard II in her drawers.

==Coriolanus==
&quot;I spotted Coriolanus stoutly buggering Banquo's ghost&quot; - At the Christmas Party. 

==Henry IV, Part I==
Dora paraphrases the quote Shakespeare, discretion is the better part of valour. This originates from Henry IV
where Falstaff says: 'The better part of valour is discretion; in the which better part I have saved my life.' 

==Henry IV, Part Two==
As if, when the young King meets up again with Jack Falstaff in Henry IV, Part Two, he doesn't send him packing but digs him in the ribs, says, &quot;I have a job for you!&quot;.

Perry is very similar to Falstaff, with his Red hair, weight and his jocular character. Falstaff appears in Henry 1V parts 1 and 2 and the Merry Wives of Windsor (when he 'comes back from the dead', like Perry)

==A Comedy of Errors==
A Comedy of Errors contains  two sets of twins - one high-born and one-low born.  

==Timon of Athens==

“Timon, Caesar, John of Gaunt” – Dora lists the Shakespearean roles appropriate for older men.

==The Tempest==
When filming 'The Dream' Dora says: &quot;Water!, water, everywhere! Did he think it was the bloody ''Tempest''?&quot;

&quot;bound for oblivion nor leave a wrack behind&quot; - line from the Tempest...describing Dora's attitude towards life and death

On Ranulph and Estella falling in love: “the stuff that dreams are made of”. cf “Such stuff as dreams are made on” – Prospero

==The Taming of the Shrew==
Angela Carter quotes the song &quot;Brush Up on Your Shakespeare&quot; by Cole Porter – This is a song taken from the musical Kiss Me Kate based on Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. 

==The Merry Wives of Windsor==

Perry is very similar to Falstaff, who appears in the Merry Wives of Windsor.

==Sonnets==
Saskia and Imogen are described as &quot;The darling buds of may&quot; (Sonnet 18) conveying their legitimacy. 

The Sonnet 'O Mistress Mine' is quoted.

==General==
Dora and Nora are born on April 23rd which as well as being Melchior's birthday is Shakespeare's birthday.

The novel ''Wise Children'' is also presented in five chapters like a Shakespearean play with five acts. ''Wise Children'' also blends comedy and tragedy in a way that can be seen in Shakespearean plays e.g. ''Much Ado About Nothing''. Wise children could be seen as a parody of the Shakespearean tragedy.

The opening chapter, like in the first Act of a Shakesperian play, introduces all the characters and sets the scene. On the other hand, the final chapter offers resolution, redemption and ties up any loose ends.

Some names are almost speaking names (My Lady Margarine, Wheelchair, Pretty Kitty). These were often used in Shakesperian plays, and makes the characters more memorable.

Using pre-existing characters practically lifted from Shakespeare's plays she can almost paint her own characters in short hand.

In the final chapter of the novel, Dora Chance gives Gorgeous George a £20 note with Shakespeare's face on the back of it; symbolising the end of the novel and Carter's main focus that the plot is based on the character's lives around Shakespeare

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Magical Realism==

The book is an example of Magical Realism. The novel switches between actions, which are described as being so extravagant that the reader has to suspend their disbelief to everyday dialogue between characters. ''Wise Children'' cannot be looked at as a realistic level. However Carter does blend the absurd with realism. Many of the character's emotions are real - Dora's longing for acceptance from Melchior, however this is contrasted by absurd moments.     

 
Examples of Magical Realism include:

*Grandma Chance's ghost who visits Dora and Nora before they go to Melchior's 100th birthday. 
*The end of chapter two where Dora has sex  as the building is burning down 
*The coincidence that there are so many twins.   
*&quot;She’d got a fishbowl on her head with a fish in it. I kid you not&quot; - Imogen's headwear at the end of the novel. 
* The amount of 'coincidental' links to Shakespeare
* The majority of events that occurred during the filming of 'The Dream'
* Peregrine - everything about him, his appearance, (the size of him), how he always seems to disappear and then turn up miraculously. Links with carnivalesque/carnival, &quot;he was like a travelling carnival&quot;.
 

Wikipedia has an article on magical realism, which you may want to read: [[w:Magic realism|Magic realism]]. For the purposes of studying this novel the definition of magical realism could be Magical &quot;magical elements appear in an otherwise realist setting&quot;.

==Theatrical references==
Dora makes  theatrical references: 

*I made my bow fives minutes after Nora  
*The curtain call of my career as a lover (Dora with Perry)

==Allusions to fairy tales==
There are also many allusions to fairy tales 
*Once upon a time
*Cinders, you shall go to the ball
*Saskia is described as the wicked fairy (in sleeping beauty)
*Melchoir is portrayed as the fairytale villain

==Carnivalesque==
The term &quot;carnivalesque&quot; refers to a certain  spirit that pervaded the medieval European carnivals as described by a Russian  named Mikhail Bakhtin. According to Bakhtin, carnival was a time when all the hierarchies that were so firmly established in medieval life were inverted. Similarly in 'Wise Children' hierarchy is inverted - Lady A becomes known as Wheelchair and is compared to a sheep. 

Another aspect of the carnivalesque is chaos and flux - this can be seen in the way that the novel refuses to give a chronological account of events and instead the narrative jumps between different generations.  

The refrain &quot;What a joy it is to dance and sing&quot; is asking readers to enjoy the lighter side of life. 

There are many references to the carnival in ‘Wise Children’ 

*Peregrine says “Life is a carnival”
*‘The carnival’s got to stop, some time’
*Peregrine is the one character that embodies the carnivalesque.
*He is a magician who can summon doves out of handkerchiefs. 
*Make a set of china and cutlery disappear after an afternoon picnic.
*Remove a scarlet macaw from Melchior's tights. 

*Dora remembers her time with Perry fondly. She describes the trip to Brighton as the happiest time of her life. He can do magic tricks and exhibits extravagant behaviour – e.g. having an affair with Lady A.  

*He appears at every party or extravaganza such as the weddings at the end of the dream and Melchior’s 100th birthday.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}

A '''Cat leap''', also known as a '''Saute de Chat''', is a common technique in parkour in which a traceur cannot make a jump from one point to another with his or her feet, and therefore must run at the 2nd point (usually a wall), and grab the top with their hands while simultaneously preventing their body from slamming into the wall using their feet.
[[File:Saut de chat.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|A traceur landing in a cat leap]]

To execute a cat leap, run at the top of a wall.  Your legs should be extended partially in front of you once airborne.  Absorb the impact with your legs first, potentially bending your knees and landing on the balls of your feet.  Once the feet touch, grab the top of the wall with your hands. The cat leap has been completed. You may either drop down, jump to another wall, or pop on top or over current wall.

== Variations ==
In a variation of a cat leap, the body can either be partially on top of the wall (versus just the arms),  or the feet may be slid down the wall, to further avoid impact.

==The Laws of Indices==

# &lt;math&gt;x^ax^b = x^{a+b}\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;x^{-n}=\frac{1}{x^n}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

# &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}} = \frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}} \times \frac{b-\sqrt{c}}{b-\sqrt{c}} = \frac{a(b-\sqrt{c})}{b^2-c}&lt;/math&gt;

==Polynomials==

===Parabolas===
If f(x) is in the form &lt;math&gt;a(x + b)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt;
# -d is the axis of symmetry
# e is the maximum or minimum value
Axis of Symmetry = &lt;math&gt;\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

===Completing the Square===
&lt;math&gt; ax^2+bx+c=0\,&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;

===The Quadratic Formula===
* The solutions of the quadratic &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0&lt;/math&gt; are: &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
* The discriminant of the quadratic &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;/math&gt;

==Errors==
# &lt;math&gt;Absolute\ error = value\ obtained - true\ value&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Relative\ error = \frac{absolute\ error}{true\ value}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Percentage\ error = relative\ error \times 100&lt;/math&gt;



==Coordinate Geometry==
===Gradient of a line===
&lt;math&gt;m=\frac {y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Point-Gradient Form===
The equation of a line passing through the point &lt;math&gt;\left (x_1 , y_1 \right )&lt;/math&gt; and having a slope m is &lt;math&gt;y - y_1 = m \left ( x - x_1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Perpendicular lines===
Lines are perpendicular if &lt;math&gt;m_1 \times m_2=-1&lt;/math&gt;

===Distance between two points===
&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-point of a line===
&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {{x_1} + {x_2}}{2} ; \frac {{y_1} + {y_2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===General Circle Formulae===
&lt;math&gt;Area = \pi r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Circumference = 2 \pi r\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

===Equation of a Circle===
&lt;math&gt;\left (x - h \right )^2 + \left (y - k \right )^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.

==Differentiation==
===Differentiation Rules===
# Derivative of a constant function: &lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} \left (c \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# The Power Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} \left (x^n \right) = nx^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;
# The Constant Multiple Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} c f \left ( x \right ) = c \frac{dy}{dx} f \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;
# The Sum Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} \begin{bmatrix} f \left ( x \right ) +  g \left ( x \right ) \end{bmatrix} = \frac{dy}{dx} f \left ( x \right ) +  \frac{dy}{dx} g \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;
# The Difference Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} \begin{bmatrix} f \left ( x \right ) -  g \left ( x \right ) \end{bmatrix} = \frac{dy}{dx} f \left ( x \right ) -  \frac{dy}{dx} g \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;

===Rules of Stationary Points===
*If &lt;math&gt;f' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' \left ( c \right ) &lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then c is a local maximum point of f(x). The graph of f(x) will be concave down on the interval.
*If &lt;math&gt;f' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' \left ( c \right ) &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then c is a local minimum point of f(x). The graph of f(x)  will be  concave up on the interval.
*If &lt;math&gt;f' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f''' \left ( c \right ) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then c is a local inflection point of f(x).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Translation of curves==

Many curves are translations of the basic curve of the same degree. For example &lt;math&gt;y=(x+1)^2+1&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; by 1 unit up on the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and one unit to the left on the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis, &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, so the full translation is &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. It is useful to remember the translations of curves, so that you can easily sketch graphs from the basic shape.

===Vertical translation===

The constant term moves the entire graph vertically by that much. For example, &lt;math&gt;y=x^2+3&lt;/math&gt; will move the graph upwards by 3 units, and &lt;math&gt;y=x^2-3&lt;/math&gt; will move the graph down by 3 units.

===Horizontal translation===

When a number is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; before it is squared, the entire graph will move in the opposite direction by the same amount. For example, &lt;math&gt;y=(x-3)^2&lt;/math&gt; will move the graph to the right by 3 units, and &lt;math&gt;y=(x+3)^2&lt;/math&gt; will move the graph to the left by 3 units. It may be confusing that the graph moves in opposite directions, but with the translations, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has to be smaller or larger to give the same result that it used to, so positive numbers move it in the negative direction, and vice versa. You can imagine that the numbers on the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis are changed by the amount of the translation, so in &lt;math&gt;y=(x-3)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the origin &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is now &lt;math&gt;(-3,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===General translations===

In general, &lt;math&gt;y=(x-t)^2+s&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} t \\ s \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Baroque sonata==

By the time of Arcangelo Corelli, two polyphonic types of sonata were established: the sonata da chiesa (church sonata) and the sonata da camera (&quot;ordinary&quot; sonata, literally chamber sonata).

The sonata da chiesa, generally for one or more violins and bass, consisted normally of a slow introduction, a loosely fugued allegro, a cantabile slow movement, and a lively finale in some binary form suggesting affinity with the dance-tunes of the suite. This scheme, however, was not very clearly defined, until the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Friderich Handel, when it became the essential sonata and persists as a tradition of Italian violin music – even into the early 19th century, in the works of Boccherini.

The sonata da camera had consisted almost entirely of idealized dance-tunes, but by the time of Bach and Handel such a composition drew apart from the sonata, and came to be called a suite, a partita, an ordre, or, when it had a prelude in the form of a French opera-overture, an overture. On the other hand, the features of sonata da chiesa and sonata da camera then tended to be freely intermixed. Bach, however, while not using the titles themselves, nevertheless keeps the two types so distinct that they can be recognized by style and form. Thus, in his six solo violin sonatas, Nos. 1, 3, and 5 are recognizably sonate de chiesa; and Nos. 2, 4, and 6 are explicitly called partitas, but are admissible among the sonatas as being sonate da camera.[citation needed] Bach is also cited as being among the first composers to have the keyboard and solo instrument share a melodic line, whereas previously most sonatas for keyboard and instrument had kept the melody exclusively in the solo instrument.

The term sonata is also applied to the series of over 500 works for harpsichord solo, or sometimes for other keyboard instruments, by Domenico Scarlatti, originally published under the name Essercizi per il gravicembalo (Exercises for the Harpsichord). Most of these pieces are in one binary-form movement only, with two parts that are in the same tempo and use the same thematic material, though occasionally there will be changes in tempo within the sections. Many of the sonatas were composed in pairs, one being in the major and the other in the parallel minor. They are frequently virtuosic, and use more distant harmonic transitions and modulations than were common for other works of their time. They are admired for their great variety and invention.

The genre – particularly for solo instruments with just the continuo or ripieno – eventually influenced the solo movements of suites or concerti that occurred between movements with the full orchestra playing, for example in the Brandenburg Concerti of Bach. The trio sonatas of Vivaldi, too, show parallels with the concerti he was writing at the same time.

The sonatas of Domenico Paradies are mild and elongated works of this type, with a graceful and melodious little second movement included. The manuscript on which Longo bases his edition of Scarlatti frequently shows a similar juxtaposition of movements, though without any definite indication of their connection. The style is still traceable in the sonatas of the later classics, whenever a first movement is in a uniform rush of rapid motion, as in Mozart's violin sonata in F (K. 377), and in several of Clementi's best works.

==The Chorale and Church Cantata==
Chorales tend to have simple and singable tunes, because they were originally intended to be sung by the congregation rather than a professional choir. They generally have rhyming words and are in a strophic form (with the same melody being used for different verses). Within a verse, most chorales follow the AAB pattern of melody that is known as the German Bar form.  (Lutheran)

==The Baroque Suite==
The Baroque Suite is a group of dances usually in the same key.  Each piece is usually in binary form (A-A-B-B) or ternary form (A-B-A).  The standard dances in the suite are the allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue.

==Arcangelo Corelli==
influential Italian violinist and composer of Baroque music.  His compositions are distinguished by a beautiful flow of melody and by a mannerly treatment of the accompanying parts, which he is justly said to have liberated from the strict rules of counterpoint.

==Claudio Monteverdi==
# One of the most important early baroque composers
# Wrote Orfeo, first great opera
# Music director at San Marco

==Henry Purcell==
is generally considered to be one of England's greatest composers. He has often been called England's finest native composer. Purcell incorporated Italian and French stylistic elements but devised a peculiarly English style of Baroque music.

==George Frideric Handel==

==Antonio Vivaldi==

==Johann Sebastian Bach==

#* Could have 2, 3, 4 contrasting themes
#* Sections balance each other

==Sonata form==
The practice of the Classical period would become decisive for the sonata; the term moved from being one of many terms indicating genres or forms, to designating the fundamental form of organization for large-scale works. This evolution stretched over fifty years. The term came to apply both to the structure of individual movements (see Sonata form and History of sonata form) and to the layout of the movements in a multi-movement work. In the transition to the Classical period there were several names given to multimovement works, including divertimento, serenade, and partita, many of which are now regarded effectively as sonatas. The usage of sonata as the standard term for such works began somewhere in the 1770s. Haydn labels his first piano sonata as such in 1771, after which the term divertimento is used very sparingly in his output. The term sonata was increasingly applied to either a work for keyboard alone (see Piano sonata), or for keyboard and one other instrument, often the violin or cello. It was less and less frequently applied to works with more than two instrumentalists; for example piano trios were not often labelled sonata for piano, violin, and cello.
Initially the most common layout of movements was:
1.	Allegro, which at the time was understood to mean not only a tempo, but also some degree of &quot;working out&quot;, or development, of the theme. (See Charles Rosen's The Classical Style, and his Sonata Forms.) 
2.	A middle movement which was, most frequently, a slow movement: an Andante, an Adagio, or a Largo; or, less frequently, a Minuet or Theme and Variations form. 
3.	A closing movement, early in the period sometimes a minuet, as in Haydn's first three piano sonatas, but afterwards, generally an Allegro or a Presto, often labelled Finale. The form was often a Rondo.

==Theme and variations==

==Minuet and trio==
Minuet is a social dance of French origin for two persons, usually in 3/4 time.  The name is also given to a musical composition written in the same time and rhythm, but when not accompanying an actual dance the pace was quicker.  The minuet and trio eventually became the standard third movement in the four-movement classical symphony.

==Rondo==
In rondo form, a principal theme (sometimes called the &quot;refrain&quot;) alternates with one or more contrasting themes, generally called &quot;episodes,&quot; but also occasionally referred to as &quot;digressions,&quot; or &quot;couplets&quot;. The overall form can be represented as ABACADA ... The number of themes can vary from piece to piece, and the recurring element is sometimes embellished or shortened in order to provide for variation.
Classical pieces often end with a rondo. The fourth movement of a piece is often a rondo. Concertos and sonatas, however, have the third movement as a rondo.

==The classical symphony==
•	4 movements, of which the first would usually be a fast movement in sonata form, the second a slow movement, the third either a minuet and trio or a ternary dance-like (scherzo) movement in &quot;simple triple&quot; metre, finishing with a fourth, fast movement in rondo and/or sonata form. 
•	Instrumental, to be played by an orchestra of the relatively moderate size customary at the time. 
The normal four movement form became, then:
1. Quick, in a binary form or later sonata form 
2. Slow 
3. Minuet and trio (later developed into the scherzo and trio), in ternary form 
4. Quick, sometimes also in sonata form. Other common possibilities are Rondo form or sonata-rondo

==The classical concerto==
It is conventional to state that the first movements of concertos from the Classical period onwards follow the structure of sonata form.

==Classical chamber music==

==Joseph Haydn==
Joseph Haydn is one of the most prominent composers of the Classical period, and is called by some the &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot; and &quot;Father of the String Quartet&quot;.
A central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical motifs, usually devised from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly. Haydn's musical practice formed the basis of much that was to follow in the development of tonality and musical form. He took genres such as the symphony, which were at the time shorter and subsidiary to more important vocal music, and slowly expanded their length, weight and complexity.
Haydn's work became central to what was later described as sonata form, and his work was central to taking the binary schematic of what was then called a &quot;melodie&quot;. It was a form divided into sections, joined by important moments in the harmony which signalled the change. One of Haydn's important innovations (adopted by Mozart and Beethoven) was to make the moment of transition the focus of tremendous creativity. Instead of using stock devices to make the transition, Haydn would often find inventive ways to make the move between two expected keys

==Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart==
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. His output of over 600 compositions includes works widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music.
Mozart's music, like Haydn's, stands as an archetypal example of the Classical style. His works spanned the period during which that style transformed from one exemplified by the style galant to one that began to incorporate some of the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque, complexities against which the galant style had been a reaction. Mozart's own stylistic development closely paralleled the development of the classical style as a whole. In addition, he was a versatile composer and wrote in almost every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. While none of these genres were new, the piano concerto was almost single-handedly developed and popularized by Mozart. He also wrote a great deal of religious music, including masses; and he composed many dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.
The central traits of the classical style can all be identified in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are hallmarks, though a simplistic notion of the delicacy of his music obscures for us the exceptional and even demonic power of some of his finest masterpieces.

==Ludwig van Beethoven==
He is generally regarded as one of the great composers in the history of music, and was a crucial figure in the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western classical music.
Beethoven was also one of the first composers to work freelance — arranging subscription concerts, selling his compositions to publishers, and gaining financial support from a number of wealthy patrons — rather than seek out permanent employment by the church or by an aristocratic court.

==The art song==
An art song is a vocal music composition, usually written for one singer with piano accompaniment. By extension, the term &quot;art song&quot; is used to refer to the genre of such songs. The art song repertoire is considered by afficionados to create (in the right hands) musical experiences unsurpassed in sophistication, subtlety and dramatic truth.

==Franz Schubert==
(1797-1828) An Austrian composer. He wrote some 600 Lieder (songs), completed seven symphonies, with his first at 16. His &quot;Great&quot; C Major was considered too difficult, his 8th is the famous &quot;Unfinished Symphony.&quot; Lliturgical music, operas, and a large body of chamber and solo piano music. He is particularly noted for his genius for original melodic and harmonic writing. He was the primary inventor of the Art Song.

==Robert Schumann==
(1810-1856) A German composer and pianist. He was one of the most famous Romantic composers of the nineteenth century, as well as a famous music critic. An intellectual as well as an aesthete, his music reflects the deeply personal nature of Romanticism. Introspective and often whimsical, his early music was an attempt to break with the tradition of classical forms and structure which he thought too restrictive. He ruined his fingers using one of his inventions intended to strengthen them. He was mentally institutionalized later on in his life.He also created the first music magazine: ''Die Neue Zeitschrift für Musik''

==Clara Wieck Schumann==
a German musician, one of the leading pianists of the Romantic era, as well as a composer, and wife of composer Robert Schumann.  (social restrictions bc woman)

==Frederic Chopin==
(1810-1849) Frederyk Franciszek Chopin, is a Polish born composer is one of the greatest romantic composers of all times. He is well known for his musical introduction to nationalism such as Polonez, Mazurek which are folk songs. They are written in 3-4 time and has characteristics of moderato and has a very European country mood. Chopin is also very well known for his Nocturnes which are more serious and carry a slower tune.

==Franz Liszt==
(1831-1886) Learned the piano at age 6, wrote his first concerto at 9, and his first opera at 14.  He wanted to be the 'Paganini' of the piano. Played wild concerts, usually involving many pianos in the event that he might break one. 
Famous works: ''Hungarian Rhapsodies''

==Felix Mendelssohn==
(1809-1847) He did his best work in his teenage years, a master of the melody. He remade songs that he heard as he traveled about Europe, he remade them to have no words. He also published some of his sister, Fanny Mendelsohn's, music. ''4th Symphony, Italian''
Mendelssohn  was a romantic whose compositions were deeply rooted in the classical period.  His talent was just as phenomenal as Mozart's.

==Program music==
program music is anything that is associated with a story, poem, scene, or an idea. romantic music is most effected, as it is most closely associated with literature.

==Hector Berlioz==
Born 1803-1869, Nationality is French, born in Cote Saint - Andre, near Grenoble, best known for his writings on and innovations with orchestration

==Nationalism in Nineteenth-Century music==

==Peter Illyich Tchaikovsky==

==Bedrich Smetana==

==Antonin Dvorak==

==Johannes Brahms==

==Guiseppe Verdi==

==Giacomo Puccini==
an Italian composer whose operas, including La bohème, Tosca, and Madama Butterfly, are among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire.  (successor to Verdi)

==Richard Wagner==
a German composer, conductor, music theorist, and essayist, primarily known for his operas (or &quot;music dramas&quot; as he later came to call them). Unlike most other great opera composers, Wagner always wrote the scenario and libretto for his works himself.
Wagner's compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their contrapuntal texture, rich chromaticism, harmonies and orchestration, and elaborate use of leitmotifs: musical themes associated with specific characters, locales, or plot elements. Wagner pioneered advances in musical language including extreme chromaticism and atonality which greatly influenced the development of European classical music.

==Gustav Mahler==
(1860-1911) [[w:Gustav Mahler|Gustav Mahler]] was a Bohemian-Austrian composer and conductor.  Mahler was best known during his own lifetime as one of the leading orchestral and operatic conductors of the day. He has since come to be acknowledged as among the most important post-romantic composers.
The spirit of the Lied (German for song) constantly rests in his work.  Keenly aware of the colourations of the orchestra, the composer filled his symphonies with flowing melodies and expressive harmonies, achieving bright tonal qualities using the clarity of his melodic lines. Among his other innovations are expressive use of combinations of instruments in both large and small scale, increased use of percussion, as well as combining voice and chorus to symphony form, and extreme voice leading in his counterpoint. His orchestral style was based on counterpoint; two melodies would each start off the other seemingly simultaneously, choosing clarity over a mass orgy of sound.
This is shown most clearly by his approach to the issue of so-called 'progressive tonality'.  Progressive tonality is the name given to the compositional practice whereby a piece of music does not finish in the key in which it began, but instead 'progresses' to an ending in a different key.

      <text xml:space="preserve">John Locke: “The Philosopher of Freedom”
	Since the beginning of recorded history, many influential [political] theorists have contributed greatly to the formation of various governments and societies, as well as issues dealing with humanity in general.  One theorist of significant importance, especially to the creation of the United States government, is none other than John Locke.  Locke, who was one of the greatest philosophers in Europe at the end of the seventeenth century, was strongly opposed to authoritarianism on both the individual level as well as the societal level.  Locke believes that if people use reason to find the truth and determine what functions of a government are legitimate, that human life will flourish (Uzgalis).  Two of Locke’s most important works include, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and The Second Treatise on Civil Government.  The life of John Locke, the importance and content of the previously mentioned works, and their overall influence on the west will be discussed in detail.  
	John Locke was born on August 29, 1632 (to Puritan parents) in Wrington, a village located in Somerset (Great Britain).  Locke’s father was a lawyer and also served as a captain for the Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War (Uzgalis).  His mother was the daughter of a tanner who was said to be very beautiful.  Locke was baptized the same day he was born and shortly after his birth, his family moved to Pensford, and Locke grew up in the rural village of Belluton.  In 1647, Locke was sent to the famous Westminster School, located in London (Uzgalis).  After completing Westminster, Locke went to Christ Church College at Oxford.  Locke was a gifted student; however he was discontent with the curriculum of his time (which authorities did not appreciate).  He was interested in the modern philosophers of the time, not the classical material that was being taught (Uzgalis).  Locke earned his bachelor’s degree in 1656 and his master’s degree in 1658.  He also studied medicine and in 1667 Locke moved into Lord Ashley’s (eventually Earl of Shaftesbury), home and served as his personal doctor (although he didn’t receive his degree in medicine until 1674).  Locke was not only Shaftesbury’s personal doctor, but he was his “secretary, researcher, political operative and friend” (Uzgalis). 
The influence of Shaftesbury helped to shape Locke’s political thought and also placed him at the very heart of English politics in the 1670s and 1680s. Shaftesbury appointed Locke to several minor government positions and in 1669, as one of his official jobs, Locke wrote a constitution for the Carolina Colony in North America (Uzgalis). In 1671 Locke began to write one of his most famous works, the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which took his almost twenty years to complete due to his heavy involvement in Shaftesbury's political affairs.  In 1675, after Shaftesbury lost his political positions, Locke left for England where he studied with several French scientist and philosophers (Uzgalis).  After returning to England in 1679, Locke returned to Oxford where he stayed until he fled to Holland (in 1683) after being suspected of being involved in the Rye House Plot.  While in Holland, Locke finished his Essay Concerning Human Understanding in 1690 and in the same year, he published his Two Treatises on Civil Government (Uzgalis).  After these works were published, Locke earned the reputation as the “leading philosopher of freedom”.  After a prolonged decline in his health, Locke died in 1704 and was buried in Essex.
As previously mentioned, the Essay Concerning Human Understanding is one of Locke’s most famous and influential works.  This essay is broken down into four books, which explain the theory of knowledge.  The first book called “Of Innate Ideas” attacks the Cartesian view of knowledge that states that human beings are born with the ideas that they have.  Locke’s argues against the possibility of “innate propositional knowledge” and then continues by arguing against the possibility of innate ideas such as God.  After arguing against the Cartesian view, Locke gives his own theory of the origins of knowledge.  Most simply put, Locke says we develop our opinions from life experiences.
In the second book, Locke describes his theory of ideas.  His argument is that everything in our mind is an idea, and that all ideas come in through the senses or through reflection.  In this book, Locke also explains that people have two types of ideas, simple and complex ideas (on which simple ideas are the building blocks for complex ones.  In the second book, Locke also makes the distinction between primary and secondary qualities in their relation to people’s ideas.  Locke switched gears in the third book and begins a discussion of the philosophy of language.  Locke claims that words stand for ideas and relies heavily on his theory of ideas to support this claim. Locke also says that if there is not a clear or definite idea that our words refer to we should not use those words.  Finally, Locke says that all people should use the same words to refer to the same things, and that this will keep language from leading people astray. 
	The final book of Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding is titled &quot;Of Knowledge and Opinion,&quot; and as the title suggests, explains the theory of knowledge. Locke begins by defining knowledge as “the perception of strong internal relations that hold among the ideas themselves, without any reference to the external world”.  In other words, knowledge depends on the perception of a necessary connection.  In this book, Locke also lists the four relationships between ideas that he would count as knowledge.  They include, identity, relation, coexistence, and actual existence.  Locke identifies three different grades of knowledge with intuition as the highest, followed by demonstration, and finally sensitive knowledge.  The rest of book four discusses opinions, and Locke says that gaining a better opinion of the world is a good thing, but that one must understand that opinions will never reach the level of knowledge.
Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding is primarily concerned with issues in epistemology and metaphysics (SparkNotes Staff).  Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that is concerned with knowledge, belief, and thought.  Metaphysics on the other hand is the philosophy related to what there is in the world (i.e. God) (SparkNotes Staff).   During a time of great skepticism, Locke laid the foundation that other British Empiricists such as George Berkeley, Thomas Reid, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, used as a basis their own work (SparkNotes Staff).
	Locke’s other and equally famous work is The Second Treatise on Civil Government and has been described as a cornerstone of Western political philosophy.   Locke begins by making the point that no one can claim certain rights, because it is not possible to locate heirs of Adam.  He also defines political power as the right of “making laws and penalties of death, and consequently all less penalties for the regulation of property….and all this only for the good of the public good” (Locke).  
	The state of nature is the major topic Locke discusses, and is a state in which everyone is equal and no-one has power over anybody else.  People are in this state of nature until the form some type of pack.  Locke defines the state of war as “of enmity and destruction”, which brings about the law of self-preservation to protect ones self.  He also says that the state of war and the state of nature explaining they are not the same.  Locke says that the natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power and that the only time slavery is acceptable is during a state of war.  The next discussion is about various types of power.  Locke says that paternal power is necessary until the child is old enough add a meaningful contribution to society.  When it comes to civil power, or marriage, the man and then woman have power over everyone else in the household.  And finally when it comes to political power, Locke says that no one ever outgrows his authority.
	Next, Locke talks about the beginning of political societies and how they form from the majority.  Following the beginning of political societies, Locke talks about the ends of political society and says that people give up their natural freedoms to protect their interests.  After forming societies, the people must choose the form of government they are going to use (oligarchy, hereditary monarchy, elective monarchy, etc.).  To Locke, the legislative power is very important, and says that the legislative power must preserve the society, follow established laws, not raise taxes without consent of the people, and cannot transfer the power of law making.  Locke says that legislation should only be in session when there is need for a new law; on the other hand, the executive branch should always be in session, and the federal power which should also be in session handles international affairs.  Next, Locke points out that the legislative power is most powerful, but the people are still above it.  Finally, Locke defines tyranny as the “exercise of power beyond right” and says that a good leader is bound by the legislative power and has the duty of working for the people.  Locke says that when the need for the dissolution of a government comes about, that the people become free, and form a civil-state to avoid chaos and eventually form a new legislative power. 
 Perhaps the most important point that Locke makes in his Second Treatise on Civil Government when the governing abuse the power the people have entrusted them with, the people should rebel against their government and replace it with one that will serve them appropriately (Carmichael). This joining of “ideas--consensual, limited government based upon natural human rights and dignity, and unlimited personal property, based on those same rights, makes the Second Treatise a perfectly-constructed argument against absolutism and unjust governments” (Carmichael). It appeals both to abstract moral notions and to a more grounded view of the self-interest that leads people to form societies and governments (Carmichael). 
John Locke was not afraid to challenge the notion of Divine Right to advance the rights of life, liberty, property, and religious tolerance for all people. It wasn’t until the end of his life that Locke’s philosophy began to take hold in the minds of many Europeans (Kunze). However, his ideas of liberty spread to America and took root in the minds of many colonists who then demanded the rights they were denied.  It is the opinion of some that the part of Locke’s writing that most influenced the creation of the United States constitution was the idea that the power to govern was given with the permission of the people (Kunze).  Without the influence of Locke, the United States Constitution would most likely be profoundly different than it is today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">would like some idea about light. One book gave specific amounts of light each day for chicks but how do you do this when you use a heat lamp as the heat source?

Well I can offer some advice. When I use a heat lamp I am trying to keep the Temperature at around 90 deg. F  shield this with foil or a pie pan. Use an incandescent light on a timer available from most hardware stores set it at standard days or around 10 to 12 hour intervals. But I will tell you that I have also had good luck just leaving the light on day and night for the first week. Chicks sleep when they want to. So you can be very scientific and use shields and timers or just caveman it and leave the heat lamp on. I always use heat at one end of the enclosure. This allows space for the chicks to escape the heat if need be.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikisource:The Sonnets]], file copyright problem ==

Thanks for trying to contribute to Wikibooks, but you do not need to put Shakespeare's sonnets here.

I have deleted the sonnets that you added to Wikibooks because all of the sonnets are already available at '''[[Wikisource:The Sonnets]]'''. Wikibooks is [[WB:WIW|a project for writing textbooks]], while Wikisource is a project for storing previously-published works such as Shakespeare.

Also, you uploaded a file, '''[[:Image:ArtTimeline.xls]]''', but you did not specify its copyright status. You were supposed to choose a license from the menu on the [[Special:Upload]], but since you did not, you need to go to '''[[:Image:ArtTimeline.xls]]''', click &quot;edit this page&quot;, and provide information about the file, including an '''[[WB:ICT|image copyright tag]]'''. I do not otherwise know how to help you here, because I cannot open an &quot;xls&quot; file on my computer, so I do not know whether this file is a copyright violation or whether it belongs on Wikibooks.

Do understand though, that your ArtTimeline.xls file will be '''DELETED on or after 10 May 2006''' unless you can provide information to justify its presence on Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:11, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Please do not create empty pages ==

Empty pages, like the ones that you created for Final Fantasy X/Glitzball/Agents, are completely useless. This is because empty pages confuse readers. Also, the wiki software (in web browsers that support color) uses red for all links to nonexistant pages; if you create an empty page, the link becomes blue for no reason; the red indicates that there is no content and that any wiki user can try to create a page with content.

Thanks, and I hope this encourages you to create pages that actually have text on them. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:37, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prometheus, whose name means &quot;forethought&quot;, was the brother of Epimetheus.  During the war of the Titans, Prometheus, foreseeing the victory of Zeus, fought on the Olympians side.  Epimetheus, looking to the past, kept fighting with the Titans.

After the victory, Prometheus was given the task by Zeus of creating all life on Earth.  He then also made humans from clay without Zeus' permission.  This upset Zeus; but Prometheus was able to save humanity.

At the first animal sacrifices, Prometheus tricked Zeus into choosing the bones and entrails for the gods' portion by wrapping them in enticing fat, while the choice cuts were hidden under the stomach.  This resulted in human celebrants receiving the choice meats at future animal sacrifices.

Prometheus was reputed to have felt pity on the early days of humanity, and decided to share with them the gift of fire, which only the deities knew. For this, he was punished by being chained to a pole on the side of a mountain and have his subsequently regenerating lungs eaten day after day by an eagle.  To punish humanity, Zeus sent Pandora along with Pandora's box.

After 30,000 years, Prometheus was released from his torture because he possessed a great secret.  This secret was that Zeus could only be overthrown by a child he fathered by the nymph Thetis.

==Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:Ion exchange.jpeg]]==
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Ion exchange.jpeg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:Ion exchange.jpeg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence

The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government.

==Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:3 G.jpg]]==
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:3 G.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:3 G.jpg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence
#[[w:public domain|Public Domain]]

*The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an [[w:open content|open content]] license like the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] licence.  If you have the '''express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence''', use the image copyright tag: {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}.  The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government .  Non-free licence governments are listed [[w:Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note that '''none''' of these functions are meant to be used in outdoors mode. They will not return proper values. Also, if you are writing a creature or terrain script, be sure to look up the calls &lt;CODE&gt;[[../Terrain Script and Creature Script Calls#short my_loc_x()/|my_loc_x()]]&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;[[../Terrain Script and Creature Script Calls#short my_loc_y()/|my_loc_y()]]&lt;/CODE&gt;.

==''short'' char_loc_x(''short'' which_char)==
:Returns the x coordinate of the character ''[[../Lexicon#which_char/|which_char]]''.

==''short'' char_loc_y(''short'' which_char)==
:Returns the y coordinate of the character ''which_char''.

==''short'' char_dist_to_loc(''short'' which_char,''short'' x, ''short'' y)==
:Returns the distance of character ''which_char'' from location {''x'',''y''}.


&lt;SPAN style=&quot;color: #9999CC; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;'''UNCONFIRMED'''&lt;/SPAN&gt;: Using [[../Constants#ME/|ME]] here, or '''-1''', from a creature script doesn't seem to work right. It gives a distance number, but does not give the distance from the creature whose script was running. I had to use the creature's number. You can do this through using the constant [[../Constants#my_number/|my_number]].

==''short'' char_on_loc(''short'' x,''short'' y)==
:Returns the number of the character on space {''x'',''y''}. If there is no character there, returns '''-1'''. Unlike &lt;CODE&gt;char_on_spot()&lt;/CODE&gt;, this call also checks if one of the player’s characters is there.

==''short'' dist_to_waypoint(''short'' which_char,''short'' which_point)==
:Returns the distance of character ''which_char'' from waypoint ''which_point''.

==''short'' group_dist_to_loc(''short'' which_group,''short'' x, ''short'' y)==
:Returns the distance of closest character in group ''which_group'' to the location {''x'',''y''}. Remember that group 0 is the party (in case you want to see who in the party is closest to a point). If the group is empty, the distance returned is 10000.

==''short'' my_dist_from_start()==
:This call can only be made from a [[../Lexicon#Creature Script/|creature script]]. Returns the character’s distance, in spaces, from where it started.

==[[European History]] Wikibook==

Hello! I'm a Wiki user who's trying to study European History but I have trouble downloading this wikibook's PDF version; perhaps my computer is too slow. Do you mind if you send me the PDF copy of the European History Wikibook through e-mail? My e-mail address is: hfc1102@gmail.com ---- Thank you!! [[User:68.48.32.65|68.48.32.65]] 20:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

===General Scope of the Project===
As I understand, the purpose of this book is to give general information in an accessible manner about wide scope of general European history for English speakers interested in the subject. Thus I can agree on using simple language. However, the way in which that information was given is unsystematic, sometimes overly simplified, other times confusing and out of context (more on terminology and bibliography in the next section), perhaps even somewhat innacurate, tendentious, or otherwise questionable. In subsequent sections I shall try to illustrate. [[User:TheUg|TheUg]] 20:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
===Resources, Glossaries ''etc.''===
Interesting to see what resources did you use for some of the chapters. I know my history, and have no trouble navigating in facts, figures, terms, putting them in context, making conclusions and so forth. However, we need to understand, that many kids will have trouble understanding concepts, issues, even basic terminology used there. I’ll give you particular examples below, but here’s the general idea: after each chapter and/or section make a list of resources (bibliography), glossary with basic explanation of terms used and, mayhaps, links to Wikipedia articles for those interested in deeper understanding. [[User:TheUg|TheUg]] 20:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
===Russian Revolution of 1917===
Let this be my first set of examples.

'''Terminology:''' term “soviet” was used for the first time out of the blue, only with later hint on “woker council”, without explanation of the idea behind it, and therefore later ambiguous usage. Same applies to Duma, “zemstvo”, and so forth.

Also I deem incorrect description of ЧК, НКВД and КГБ, as “secret police groups”. First of all, it’s incorrect in terms of time frame (possible to put it as “CheKa (later NKVD, KGB)”. Secondly, NKVD was not a “secret police group”, but rather, in American terms, “Department of Interior” (Or, in Russian way, “Ministry of Internal Affairs” (law enforcement and Interior Forces (somewhat analogous to American National Guard) under one umbrella)), which incorporated in itself elements of so-called “secret police” (later taken out into separate entity, such as KGB). And thirdly, these were not the only mechanisms of political supression, as implied in context.

'''Percipitating Factors''', should be reorganised and generalised. For instance, it should say in general about the crisis of the absolutism (just like the causes of many other European revolutions of preceding era), some factors (such as Russo-Japanese war) should be put in context, and some things, such as Stolypin’s reforms or congress of the first State Duma (representative, although only consultative, parliament) after the Revolution of 1905, should be deemed as positive attempts by the system to reform itself, albeit those attempts were perhaps futile in all eventuality.

And also must be mentioned the general importance of that particular set of circumstances in that it determined the scape of European and world politics for many decades ahead, and still echoes nowadays.

'''Rasputin''', I believe, was not all that important. Yes, people talked about him and his perceived influence on the royal family, but it was mostly in tabloid terms, and I doubt he was akin the “grey cardinals” of the past, or Roves and Cheyneys of today.

'''Civil war''', again, was greatly simplified. Tere were many political parties of many colours, vying for dominance, international intervention (expeditionary forces of Western powers) was there for many various reasons, importance and implications were as big as the preceding revolutions themselves, nevermind sheer magnitude of the conflict. All in all, it is a bit more complicated, bloody, and politically devisive than known to you American civil war, which in itself wasn’t that black-and-white as some might portray it today, I am sure.

These are some things, I felt, we should discuss before we draft or even start editing right and left. [[User:TheUg|TheUg]] 20:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

==[[WB:NC]]==
Please stick to &quot;European History/Chapter name or number&quot; as the naming format. For more, see [[WB:NC]]. I suggest &quot;European History/Chapter name&quot; rather than number.

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:10, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

'''Strategies for Survival'''

''	Numbers (&quot;r&quot;)''
large number of offspring
no parental care
short pregnancy 
breed when young
pioneers
niche generalists

e.g., insects, fish

''        Investment (&quot;k&quot;)''
        
late maturity
specialists (niche)
mainly predators
high trophic level (generalization)
adapted to stable environment

e.g., elephants, dolphins

'''Factors affecting populations'''

Predators - How many?
Food availability - how much, where (is there need to travel?), is it difficult to obtain food? 
Habitat availability - are they specialists/generalists?, can they live anywhere?, Is their habitat being degraded?
Reproduction - are mates easy to find? does it require much effort?

Carrying Capacity (Def: The number of organisms a particular area can support)

	If organisms exceed the carrying capacity; a negative feedback loop occurs - organisms eat all the food = no food leads to dying out

Growth Rates (Def: The time a population takes to grow by a particular percentage)

It often depends on population density. populations grow fastest at low population densities (e.g., birds of prey, limited by prey availability)
-Intermediate density (locusts need reasonable densities to reproduce etc.)
-High Densities (seabirds less vulnerable to predators when in large group)

Fastest growth rates have quickest response to change; slow growth has slow response to changes

Generation Time (Def: The time taken for an individual to reach sexual maturity, and produce offspring)

Population grow in two ways - 
&quot;S&quot; curve-
initial slow growth, as population increases limiting factors such as food supply, slow growth rate. Levels out as the population approaches the carrying capacity. 

&quot;J&quot; curve-
Large populations build up over time and then crash before building up again. Common in population of primary consumers, in communities with few species where extreme abiotic (physical) factors may control population growth. Also, natural predators are few, or completely absent.

Succession (Def: The change in vegetation in an area over time (or sometimes over distance)

Can be: 
	Primary Succession (from bare earth)
or
	Secondary Succession (disturbed land recovering)

Primary Succession - After a volcanic explosion/glacial scrape
	Dust accumulates on rock surface, seeds begin to grow.

This is the first stage in the succession process - hardy, small colonizers (typically less complex organisms)
Usually occurs in dry environments with plenty of sunlight

Secondary Succession - Recovering growth from disturbed lands

'''Example of Forest Succession'''

Grass-forbs
-Dominated by small grass and small shrubs

Shrubs-seedlings
-Trees appear on the scene and begin to dominate. The shade intolerant species grow rapidly and dominate over shade tolerant species.

Sapling-pole 
-Trees dominate and out-compete shrubs

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello all!

I mostly created an account to work with Wikiversity, thougth I may do some work with Wikibooks as well. My background with wikis does not, unfortunatly, include much editing. There's something about Wikipedia that just seems too... intimidating. Well, I do use Wikipedia whenever I need to look anything up!

Anyways, the relevent personal information is that I am currently an undergraduate student at UCSB double majoring in Physics and Math and I hope to put my use in both fields and my organization abilities to use in helping Wikiversity.

== Verb 'ser'/Verbo &quot;ser&quot; ==
You learned, at the last lesson, that there were two copula verbs in Portuguese. You've already learned the first one, ''&quot;estar&quot;''. Now it is time to learn the other one, '''ser''', which denotes a permament situation or condition. It is not a regular verb. The verb ser is conjugated in the '''present indicative''' as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Person
! Portuguese
! English
|-
! 1. s.
| &lt;small&gt;eu&lt;/small&gt; s'''ou'''
| &lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt; am
|-
! 2. s.
| &lt;small&gt;você&lt;/small&gt; '''é'''
| &lt;small&gt;you&lt;/small&gt; are
|-
! 3. s.
| &lt;small&gt;ele/ela&lt;/small&gt; '''é'''
| &lt;small&gt;he/she/it&lt;/small&gt; is
|-
! 1. p.
| &lt;small&gt;nós&lt;/small&gt; s'''omos'''
| &lt;small&gt;we&lt;/small&gt; are
|-
! 2. p.
| &lt;small&gt;vocês&lt;/small&gt; s'''ão'''
| &lt;small&gt;you all&lt;/small&gt; are
|-
! 3. p.
| &lt;small&gt;eles/elas&lt;/small&gt; s'''ão'''
| &lt;small&gt;they&lt;/small&gt; are
|-
|}

See some examples:
: ''Nós '''somos''' alunos.'' (&quot;We ''are'' students.&quot;)
: ''Eles '''são''' felizes.'' (&quot;They ''are'' happy.&quot;)

To ilustrate the difference between ''&quot;ser&quot;'' and ''&quot;estar&quot;'', compare the next two phrases:
: ''Eu '''estou''' alegre.'' &amp;ndash; ''&quot;I '''am''' happy (right now).&quot;''
: ''Eu '''sou''' alegre.'' &amp;ndash; ''&quot;I '''am''' happy (a happy person).&quot;''

== Possessive pronouns/Pronomes possessivos ==
The '''possessive pronouns''' (''pronomes possessivos'') in Portuguese are the same than the '''possessive adjectives'''. As adjectives, they agree in gender and number with the possessed thing. They are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;6&quot; | Possessive pronouns and adjectives
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; | Portuguese
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | English
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Masculine
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Feminine
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Adjective
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Pronoun
|-
! Singular
! Plural
! Singular
! Plural
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| meu
| meus
| minha
| minhas
| my
| mine
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| seu
| seus
| sua
| suas
| his, her, its
| his, hers, its
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| nosso
| nossos
| nossa
| nossas
| our
| ours
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| seu
| seus
| sua
| suas
| their
| theirs
|-
|}

Just like adjectives and nouns, the plural forms are made adding '''-s'''.

: '''''meu''' apartamento'' (&quot;my apartment/flat&quot;)
: '''''meus''' apartamentos'' (&quot;my apartments/flats&quot;)
: '''''minha''' casa'' (&quot;my house&quot;)
: '''''minhas''' casas'' (&quot;my houses&quot;)

The inflection patterns of ''&quot;teu&quot;'' (compare with ''&quot;tu&quot;'') and ''&quot;seu&quot;'' are the alike.

: '''''seu''' livro'' (&quot;''his/her/its/their'' book&quot;)
: '''''seus''' livros'' (&quot;''his/her/its/their'' books&quot;)
: '''''sua''' revista'' (&quot;''his/her/its/their'' magazine&quot;)
: '''''suas''' revistas'' (&quot;''his/her/its/their'' magazines&quot;)

The pronouns ''&quot;vosso&quot;'' (compare with ''&quot;vós&quot;'') and ''&quot;nosso&quot;'' (compare with ''&quot;nós&quot;'') are inflected just like adjectives.

: '''''nosso''' trabalho'' (&quot;''our'' work&quot;)
: '''''nossos''' trabalhos'' (&quot;''our'' works&quot;)
: '''''nossa''' piada'' (&quot;''our'' joke&quot;)
: '''''nossas''' piadas'' (&quot;''our'' jokes&quot;)


As ''&quot;você&quot;'' and ''&quot;vocês&quot;'' are address pronouns, they behave as third person pronouns. So, the possessive forms of them are ''&quot;seu&quot;''-words. This is a important and confuse point, as you saw that ''&quot;seu&quot;'' can mean either ''&quot;your(s)&quot;'', ''&quot;his&quot;'', ''&quot;her(s)&quot;'', ''&quot;its&quot;'' and ''&quot;their(s)&quot;''. So instead of using ''&quot;seu&quot;'' (which have that lot of meanings) one changes it for:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Portuguese
! English
|-
| dele
| of him
|-
| dela
| of her
|-
| deles
| of them (masculine)
|-
| delas
| of them (feminine)
|-
| de vocês
| of you all
|-
|}

Those are all contractions of the preposition ''&quot;de&quot;'' and the personal pronouns ''&quot;ele&quot;'', ''&quot;ela&quot;'', ''&quot;eles&quot;'', ''&quot;elas&quot;''. The same rule applies for ''&quot;vocês&quot;'' (but no contraction can be made between ''&quot;de&quot;'' and ''&quot;vocês&quot;''). So, the possessive form used is ''&quot;de vocês&quot;'' (''&quot;of you&quot;'').

: ''o escritório '''dele''''' (&quot;''his'' office&quot;)
: ''o escritório '''dela''''' (&quot;''her'' office&quot;)
: ''o escritório '''deles''''' (&quot;''their'' office&quot;)
: ''o escritório '''delas''''' (&quot;''their'' office&quot;)
: ''o escritório '''de vocês''''' (&quot;''your'' office&quot;)

At everyday language, ''&quot;seu&quot;'' is used only as possessive form of ''&quot;você&quot;'', making things much easier.

But some even do not use ''&quot;seu&quot;'' for ''&quot;você&quot;'', because of the confuse meanings it may have. Those use ''&quot;teu&quot;'' instead. It is grammatically wrong because ''&quot;teu&quot;'' is the possessive form of ''&quot;tu&quot;''. Grammatically, one must use the pronoun alongside with its respective possessive form: ''&quot;tu&quot;'' with  ''&quot;teu&quot;'' and ''&quot;você&quot;'' with ''&quot;seu&quot;''.

Concluding, the possessive pronouns are:

|}

== Common greetings, thanks and goodbyes/Cumprimentos, agradecimentos e despedidas comuns ==
Portuguese greetings (''&quot;cumprimentos&quot;'') and goodbyes (''&quot;despedidas&quot;'') are quite simple. The most usual ones among them are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''Common greetings'''
|-
! Portuguese
! English
! Notes
|-
| ''oi'', ''olá''
| ''hello'', ''hi''
|
|-
| ''bom dia''
| ''good morning''
| (lit. ''&quot;good day&quot;'') it is spoken only at morning
|-
| ''boa tarde''
| ''good afternoon''
|-
| ''boa noite''
| ''good evening''
|
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''Common goodbyes'''
|-
! Portuguese
! English
! Notes
|-
| ''tchau''
| ''bye''
|
|-
| ''até (a próxima vez)''
| ''see you''
| (lit. ''&quot;until the next time&quot;'')
|-
| ''boa noite''
| ''good night''
|-
|}


This ''obrigado'' means &quot;thank you&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;obligated&quot; means ''obrigado'').


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Gender of the speaker
! Singular
|-
! Masculine
| obrigad'''o'''
|-
! Feminine
| obrigad'''a'''
|-
|}

Some actually say ''&quot;muito obrigado&quot;'' insted of ''&quot;obrigado&quot;'' (''&quot;muito&quot;'' means ''&quot;very&quot;'').

: '''''Obrigado''' por sua ajuda!'' (&quot;''Thank you'' for your help!&quot;)
: '''''Muito obrigado''' por sua ajuda!'' (&quot;''Thank you very much'' for your help!&quot;)

Orally, there is also a reduced form of ''&quot;obrigado&quot;'':

: '''''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Brigado''' por sua ajuda!'' (&quot;''Thanks'' for your help!&quot;)

== Days of the Week and Months/ Dias da semana e meses ==
=== Days of the week/Dias da semana ===
Most of the names of the days of the week today, are adaptations made in the medieval age from the Classical Latin roots, this is true to other Latin based languages such as Spanish or Italian. But in Portuguese this was made in an easier way, naming it after fairs (naming system used in Ecclesiastical Latin). So, except for Sunday and Saturday, the days of the week are formed by ordinal numbers plus the Portuguese word for ''&quot;fair&quot;'':

== Introduction to verbs/Introdução a verbos ==
The infinitive of all verbs in Portuguese language end in '''-r'''. The vowel before the '''-r''' is called the '''stem vowel''', and it rules the conjugation of the verb. The '''root''' is what comes before the stem vowel. There are three stem vowels, that divides the verbs in three groups:

* '''first conjugation''' (''&quot;primeira conjugação&quot;''): infinitive ends in '''-ar'''.
* '''second conjugation''' (''&quot;segunda conjugação&quot;''): infinitive ends in '''-er'''.
* '''third conjugation''' (''&quot;terceira conjugação&quot;''): infinitive ends in '''-ir'''.

Also, there are some infinitives that end in '''-or'''. Those are all derivate forms of the verb ''&quot;pôr&quot;'', (''&quot;to put&quot;'') that is an irregular verb. All its derivates follow ''&quot;pôr&quot;''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s conjugation pattern. This verb comes from the old Portuguese ''&quot;poer&quot;'' (Latin ''&quot;ponere&quot;''), so all verbs in '''-or''' are considered to be irregular verbs of the ''second conjugation''.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

The '''Reuben''' or '''Reuben sandwich''' is a grilled or toasted sandwich made with corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. It is typically made with rye bread though originally it may have been served on pumpernickel bread.

The origins of the Reuben are contested. One account holds that Reuben Kulakofsky (sometimes spelled Reubin), a grocer from Omaha, Nebraska, was the inventor, perhaps as part of a group effort by members of Kulakofsky's weekly poker game held in the Blackstone Hotel from ca. 1920-1935. The participants, who nicknamed themselves &quot;the committee,&quot; included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu.

=Authentic Recipe=

== Ingredients ==
* ½ pound (225g) sliced [[Cookbook:Beef|corned beef]]
* ¼ cup (60ml) drained [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]]
* 2 tablespoons chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|sweet onion]]
* 2 tablespoons creamy Russian dressing
* 2 slices [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 1-3 slices [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

== Procedure ==

# Combine the sauerkraut, onion, and parsley
# Spread the dressing on two slices bread
# Pile layers of corned beef, cheese, and sauerkraut mixture on one slice
# Add second slice of bread
# Butter the outside of the bread
# Grill until lightly browned, roughly 5-10 minutes

=Modern Variation=

==Ingredients==

* 12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] thinly sliced cooked corned [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or deli corned beef 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], softened 
* 8 slices [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] or pumpernickel bread
* 8 slices [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]], well drained
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Thousand Island Dressing|Thousand Island dressing]]

==Procedure==

# Lightly spread butter on one side of each bread slice.
# Heat large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] over medium heat until hot.
# Place 2 bread slices, butter side down, in skillet.
# Top each bread slice with 2 slices cheese, 1 tablespoon dressing, 3 ounces corned beef and ¼ of the sauerkraut.
# Top sandwich with bread slice, butter side up.
# Cook sandwiches 4 to 6 minutes or until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, turning once.
# Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
# Serve with additional Thousand Island dressing, if desired.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* A modern variation of the Reuben substitutes [[Cookbook:Thousand Island Dressing|Thousand Island Dressing]] for the traditional Russian dressing.
* The Reuben has a &quot;sister&quot; sandwich, the Rachel, which is made with [[Cookbook:Pastrami|pastrami]] or [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] in place of corned beef (and sometimes coleslaw in place of sauerkraut).
* A Georgia Reuben is a Reuben made with turkey and coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. 
* A Reuben served in a Jewish delicatessen would not contain cheese or butter, as dietary laws forbid meat and dairy in the same dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Have you ever wanted to write a secret message where nobody could look in except you and the person you are writing to because it is ''invisible'' to all? If you do we can tell you how...
==Writing in Invisible Ink==
===You Will Need===
*A piece of paper
*A paintbrush
*Half a lemon
*A small dish

===Method===
[[File:Wikijunior Lemon.png|right|Squeeze half a lemon]]
*Squeeze the half lemon over the dish so the juice drops into a bowl 
*Dip the paintbrush in the juice and write your message on the paper
{{-}}

==To Reveal Your Message==
===You Will Need===
*An oven

===Method===
*Gently heat the oven to a warm temperature
*Put your piece of paper in the oven &amp; when the lemon juice turns brown, take your paper out of the oven and read the message!

==Principle==
Lemon juice, and any other things made from plants, are called '''organic chemicals''' and contain [[w:carbon|carbon]]. When organic chemicals burn the carbon, which is black, breaks off from the molecule, like wood turns black when it is burned. Instead of lemon juice, you could use any fruit juice or tree sap (''don't'' cut a living tree to get the sap), but this experiment works best with colourless or light-coloured liquids.

      <comment>/* Stink Bomb */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Popping Cork==

[[Image:Vinegarbottle.png|right]][[Image:Bakingpowderpack.png|right]]
you will need:
*a small glass bottle,
*a cork that fits in the bottle,
*baking soda,
*vinegar,
*piece of paper,
*water.

#Pour some baking soda in the bottle by folding the paper and putting the baking soda in it and then slowly slide the baking soda into the bottle.
#Wet the cork in the water so it is wet. Pour some vinegar into the bottle, shove the cork in and stand really far from it!
#The cork will pop out because baking soda is a chemical, called sodium bicarbonate.
When it is mixed with vinegar it makes a gas called carbon dioxide, so the cork flies out!

{{-}}

==Stink Bomb==
You will need:
* Wine vinegar
* Bicarbonate of soda

The more of the ingredients the bigger the fizz and the stinkier it will get!

# Pour the wine vinegar into a container followed by the bicarbonate of soda.
# Watch the mixture fizz and bubble
# Smell the mixture then run away because it will stink!

==Bubbley Bang==

What you need:
*water
*measuring cup
*zip-lock bag
*tablespoon
*baking soda
*vinegar

'''Warning! Only do this experiment outside or somewhere where it doesn't matter if things get wet!'''
#Mix a tablespoon of baking soda with some water, and pour the mixture into the zip-lock bag.
#Add a tablespoon of vinegar, close the bag, and move away.
#If the experiment has worked, the zip-lock bag should explode.

==Principle==

When the vinegar and baking soda come in contact, a chemical reaction occurs. A gas called carbon dioxide is released. When this happens, bubbles form, and pressure builds, because the density of carbon dioxide is much less than the density of the baking soda or  vinegar. Eventually this pressure cannot be contained within the container and the weakest part of the container (in this case, the cork) bursts.

This experiment demonstrates an acid-base reaction. Acids and bases are measured on something called the “pH” scale, where anything below a 7 is an acid, anything above a 7 is a base. When the acid and base mix, they create a reaction, which breaks bonds between the molecules of the acids and bases. In some cases, this reaction can produce heat (which is why many cartoons show acids as being able to burn through steel and other materials) or and it always releases some molecule, in this case carbon dioxide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Radio Education

Radio had been used in education for a period of more than 80 years. It has in that time been used in many various ways. Its uses comprise school broadcasting, informal general education, social action programming and adult basic education and literacy.

In Australia, radio has been used for direct teaching, whereby radio schools are used to connect children in secluded farmsteads in the outback together with a teacher sited many hundred miles away. There are two examples of radio direct teaching 1. In the farmsteads having short wave receive and transmit radio, enabling the learners to partake directly in the lesson. 2. Parent offer the back up support, in this way a teacher operates in the same way to a classroom and the teacher except that the learners are at a distance (Bates, 2005)

Distance teaching universities frequently employ radio for its advertising and enrolment value, as well as for teaching. The Open University in Britain uses this system more often for discussion of course materials, alternative viewpoints to those contained in the printed materials, source material for analysis and for performance e.g. dramatization literature, etc. 

Radio has been used lengthily as an educational medium in developing countries. The radio has supported educational programs in a wide range of subjects area and in many different countries. Below will follow some examples of how radio is been utilised in developing countries:

v	India, for rural development.
v	Swaziland, for public health purposes.
v	Nigeria, for management courses for agriculture sector.
v	Kenya, in support for correspondence courses.
v	The Dominion Republic, in support pf primary education.
v	Philippines, for nutrition education.
v	Paraguay, to offer primary schools instruction. http://cade.icaap.org/vol2.2/7_Nwaerondu_and_Thompson.html 
v	Namibia, in the Oshakati area of northern Namibia, local radio is part of non- formal education project entitled “cattle is our livelihood” to improve cattle keeping practice among local farmers. http://www.col.org/knowledge/ks_radio.htm


Radio like other available instruments and channels of communication and social action could be used to assist put across essential knowledge and enlighten and educate people on social issues. In addition radio can be mobilised to comprehend the potential towards meeting basic education for all. http://www.col.org/events/0006commradio.htm

Radio is an effectual system for delivery of education to larger numbers of people. In facilitates information exchange at the community level, acting as a “community telephone”. Radio plays a vital educational role as the sole medium for formal and non-formal education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These calls are all meant to be made in the scenario script, either in the state '''[[../Constants#LOAD_SCEN_STATE/|LOAD_SCEN_STATE]]''' or '''[[../Constants#START_SCEN_STATE/|START_SCEN_STATE]]'''. They can, however, be made anywhere.

==''void'' add_item_to_shop(''short'' which_shop,''short'' which_item,''short'' how_many)==
:This call should be made in the state START_SCEN_STATE. This places 1 or more &quot;items&quot; in store ''which_shop''. ''which_shop'' ranges from 0&amp;ndash;129. Normally, the &quot;item&quot; placed is an item of type ''which_item''. The argument ''how_many'' defines the quantity of the item added to the store. 

:However, if you pick certain high values of ''which_item'', you can put into the store things besides items &amp;mdash; you can also have spells, alchemy recipes, and skills.

Values for ''which_item'' are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|0&amp;ndash;499
|Quantity ''how_many'' items of type ''which_item''.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|2000&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''''x'''''
|Mage spell '''''x'''''. ('''''x''''' ranges 0&amp;ndash;19, ''how_many'' is the highest level of the spell that can be bought in the store.)

|Skill '''''x'''''. (Each purchase gives the character 1 level of the skill. ''how_many'' is the maximum number of levels of the skill that can be bought.)
|}


'''Note''':
*Items
**Any given shop can only have 25 '''types of items''' in stock.
**If ''how_many'' is greater than 500, the store will have an infinite quantity of the item ''which_item''.
*In all cases, you will want to put a number above 0 for ''how_many''. If you don't, the item will disappear from the store.

== What are constrained systems ==

In many cases in mechanics, the motion of bodies is constrained in some way: for example, a massive bead may be constrained to move along a bent wire of certain shape; a massive cylinder may be rolling along a surface (but not sliding or flying around); or two masses may be connected by a rigid stick of fixed length.

In each of these cases, there are forces acting on the constrained bodies. In the above examples, the wire produces a force on the bead, the plane acts by the force of friction on the cylinder, and the stick pulls or pushes on the two masses. These forces may vary in time and we do not know the magnitude of these forces in advance. We know, however, that these forces are at every time exactly such as to guarantee that the constraints hold. The bead would fly away if there were no forces acting on it, but the wire provides a force that keeps the bead in place.  The two masses connected by a rigid stick experience a force from the stick that is exactly necessary to keep them at a constant distance from each other. (This is what it means that the stick is &quot;rigid&quot;.)

In the Newtonian approach to mechanics, these systems are treated by introducing variables &lt;math&gt;F_1, F_2, ...&lt;/math&gt; representing the unknown forces, and solving the system of equations for the unknown forces and accelerations. This procedure might be complicated; moreover, we are not always interested in the magnitudes of these unknown forces. 

In the Lagrangian approach, there are two straightforward ways to treat constrained systems:

* The method of '''solving the constraints'''. In this method, we introduce the generalized coordinates in such a way that the constraints are automatically satisfied. For example, suppose a point mass is constrained to move along a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. We might describe this situation by saying that the Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; are constrained to satisfy the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=R^2&lt;/math&gt;. Now we can introduce the angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as the &quot;generalized coordinate&quot; and express the Cartesian coordinates of the point mass as &lt;math&gt;x=R\cos\phi,y=R\sin\phi&lt;/math&gt;. These coordinates ''solve the constraint'' for all &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The power of the Lagrangian approach is that ''any'' generalized coordinates are good enough; so we can now directly write the Lagrangian in terms of the function &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; and forget about the fact that the system is constrained. We shall automatically obtain the correct equations of motion.

* The method of '''Lagrange multipliers'''. In this method, we do not try to introduce new generalized coordinates that solve the constraints. (This may be difficult; not all algebraic equations can be solved!) Instead, we formulate the variational problem ''in the presence of constraints'': the correct trajectory &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; is such that the action functional has an extremum while the constraint equations are satisfied. For example, if a point mass is constrained to move along a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, but is otherwise unforced, then the Lagrangian is &lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2}(\dot x^2+\dot y^2)&lt;/math&gt; and the constraint is &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=R^2&lt;/math&gt;. The correct trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t),y(t)&lt;/math&gt; will be such that the integral &lt;math&gt;\int L dt&lt;/math&gt; has the minimum value while the constraint holds at every &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we need to solve the problem of '''conditional minimization'''.


== Conditional minimization and Lagrange multipliers ==


A conditional minimization problem can be solved by the method of '''Lagrange multipliers'''. One takes a different, specially modified Lagrangian that describes the fact that the system is constrained. The modified Lagrangian is equal to the normal Lagrangian plus special terms containing ''Lagrange multipliers''. Let us now explain this method.

For simplicity, consider the minimization of a function &lt;math&gt;F(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to variables &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the constraint that &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. 

First recall how the problem would be solved without the constraint: the minimum (or, more generally, an extremum) of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; would be the point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; where the partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;F(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; vanish:
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F(x,y)}{\partial x}=0, \quad \frac{\partial F(x,y)}{\partial y}=0. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This would give a system of two equations that determines the two unknowns &lt;math&gt;x_*,y_*&lt;/math&gt;. 

With the constraint, the above system of equations will not give the correct answer because the solution &lt;math&gt;x_*,y_*&lt;/math&gt; most probably will not satisfy the constraint: &lt;math&gt;G(x_*,y_*)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Let us look at the problem geometrically. The constraint &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt; determines a curve or several curves in the &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; plane; we are looking for the point ''on that curve'' where the function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has an extremum. Let us imagine the level lines of the function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the lines &lt;math&gt;F(x,y)=A&lt;/math&gt; for various values of the constant &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The constraint curve &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt; may go across the level lines of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;; it means that the value of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; changes along the curve. It is clear from this geometric consideration that the extremum of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; along the constraint curve will be the point where the constraint curve is ''tangent'' to some level line of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. A condition for two curves to be tangent is that their normal vectors are parallel. The normal vector to a curve &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;(\partial G(x,y) /\partial x, \partial G(x,y)/\partial y)&lt;/math&gt;. The normal vector to the surface line &lt;math&gt;F(x,y)=A&lt;/math&gt; has components  &lt;math&gt;(\partial F(x,y) /\partial x, \partial F(x,y)/\partial y)&lt;/math&gt;. These two vectors are parallel if there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F(x,y)}{\partial x} = \lambda \frac{\partial G(x,y)}{\partial x}, \quad \frac{\partial F(x,y)}{\partial y} = \lambda \frac{\partial G(x,y)}{\partial y}. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; This is, together with the constraint &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;, a system of three equations that determines the three unknowns &lt;math&gt;x,y,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we can solve the conditional minimization problem.

Note that the equations are the same as for minimization of the function &lt;math&gt;K(x,y,\lambda)\equiv F(x,y)-\lambda G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the three variables &lt;math&gt;x,y,\lambda&lt;/math&gt; without any constraints. Therefore, the conditional minimization problem is equivalent to a normal minimization problem for the different function, &lt;math&gt;K(x,y,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. This new function is built by adding the original function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and the constraint &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by an extra variable &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This variable is called the '''Lagrange multiplier.'''

=== Example of using Lagrange multipliers ===

Here is a worked example. Suppose we need to maximize the function &lt;math&gt;F(x,y)=5x+12y&lt;/math&gt; under the constraint &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt;.
First, we write the constraint in the form &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, we may take &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=1-x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt;. (It does not matter how we choose the function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, as long as the constraint is equivalent to the equation &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then we make a new function &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K(x,y,\lambda)=F(x,y)-\lambda G(x,y)=5x+12y+\lambda(x^2+y^2-1).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Then we need to minimize this function with respect to the three variables &lt;math&gt;x,y,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
We obtain the system of equations:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;5+2\lambda x=0,\quad 12+2\lambda y=0,\quad x^2+y^2-1=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It is easy to solve these equations:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{5}{13}, \quad y=\frac{12}{13}, \quad \lambda =-\frac{13}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
These are the required values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The value of the Lagrange multiplier &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is useless for us now (but it will be useful when we apply this method to problems in mechanics!).

=== General case ===

The general form of the constrained optimization problem is the following. We need to find an extremum (or all extrema) of a given function &lt;math&gt;F(x_1, ..., x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x\equiv \{x_1, ..., x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is an array of variables satisfying &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; different constraints &lt;math&gt;G_1(\boldsymbol x)=0, ..., G_m(\boldsymbol x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. 

The geometric consideration that I showed you for the simple case (the example with functions &lt;math&gt;F(x,y),G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; above) can be generalized to many dimensions and many constraints: one considers level surfaces of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and surfaces given by the constraints. A constrained extremum will be at a point &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt; if the level surface of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; are tangent to the constraint surface at that point. The constraint surface is an intersection of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; different surfaces &lt;math&gt;G_j=0&lt;/math&gt;, each having its own normal vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol n_j = \partial G_j / \partial \boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown using elementary vector algebra (I omit the proof) that the normal vector &lt;math&gt;\partial F/\partial \boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt; to the level surface of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; must be  a linear combination of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; normal vectors &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol n_j&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the conditions for the constrained extremum to be located at a point &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt; are that (1) &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy all the constraints and (2)  that there should exist &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; numbers &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F}{\partial \boldsymbol x} = \lambda_1 \frac{\partial G_1}{\partial \boldsymbol x} + ... + \lambda_m \frac{\partial G_m}{\partial \boldsymbol x} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It is easy to see that these conditions are equivalent to the conditions for an extremum of a new function
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol \lambda) \equiv F(\boldsymbol x) - \lambda_1 G_1(\boldsymbol x) -... -\lambda_m G_m(\boldsymbol x),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with respect to &lt;math&gt;(m+n)&lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n, \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, without any constraints. 

Let us then formulate the recipe to solve the problem of constrained optimization.
We introduce an array &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \lambda&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; different Lagrange multipliers &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \lambda \equiv \{\lambda_1, ...,
\lambda_m\}&lt;/math&gt; and build a new function 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol \lambda) \equiv F(\boldsymbol x) - \lambda_1 G_1(\boldsymbol x) -... -\lambda_m G_m(\boldsymbol x).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We then find an extremum of this function with respect to the total set of &lt;math&gt;(m+n)&lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, ...,x_n, \lambda_1, ...,\lambda_m&lt;/math&gt;. In order to do that, we need to solve a system of &lt;math&gt;(m+n)&lt;/math&gt; equations:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial K}{\partial x_1}=0, ..., \frac{\partial K}{\partial x_n}=0, \frac{\partial K}{\partial \lambda_1}=0, ..., \frac{\partial K}{\partial \lambda_n}=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
By solving these equation, we will obtain a set of values &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt; which we are interested in. The values of the auxiliary variables &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j&lt;/math&gt; can be discarded.

== Motion constrained to a surface ==

Let us now consider the Constrained Mechanical Problem Number One: A point mass is moving in a potential &lt;math&gt;V(\boldsymbol x)&lt;/math&gt; and, additionally, is constrained to move along a surface given by an equation &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. (This can be physically realized by e.g. a mass point sliding without friction on top of a curved surface.)

According to the Lagrangian approach, we must find an extremum of the action,
&lt;math&gt;S=\int L(\boldsymbol x, \dot {\boldsymbol x})dt&lt;/math&gt;, under the condition that &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol x(t))=0&lt;/math&gt; for all times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
We can apply the method of Lagrange multipliers. Note that we have, in effect, ''infinitely many'' constraints---one constraint for each moment of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we need to introduce a set of infinitely many Lagrange multipliers, one Lagrange multiplier for each &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It is convenient to arrange this set of Lagrange multipliers into a ''function'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;. 

According to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we need to build a &quot;modified action&quot; which is equal to old action minus the sum of all the constraints multiplied by their respective Lagrange multipliers. Therefore, the new action is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde S[\boldsymbol x(t), \lambda(t)]  = \int L(\boldsymbol x, \dot {\boldsymbol x}) dt - \int \lambda(t) G(\boldsymbol x(t)) dt. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Solving the constrained optimization problem is equivalent to finding an extremum of the functional &lt;math&gt;\tilde S&lt;/math&gt; with respect to arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

It should now be clear how to approach the  &quot;Constrained Problem Number One&quot; in principle. What remains is some technical work: 

* Deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations from the modified action &lt;math&gt;\tilde S&lt;/math&gt; and solving them. This will be a system of equations for the unknown functions &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Interpreting the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;. It will turn out that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the force that is needed to keep the point mass moving only along the surface &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. So the Lagrange multipliers have a direct physical interpretation in this case. Namely, we shall show that the ''time-dependent'' force &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol F(t)&lt;/math&gt; exerted by the surface is equal to &lt;math&gt;-\lambda(t) \partial G/\partial \boldsymbol x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.


=== Example ===

A massive bead is set on a wire curved in the vertical plane (coordinates &lt;math&gt;x,z&lt;/math&gt;) as a plot of the function &lt;math&gt;z=C x^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a given constant. The only external force is the gravitational field of the Earth. We would like to determine the equation of motion for the position of the bead.

Choose the constraint function as &lt;math&gt;G(x,z)=z-C x^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then the modified Lagrangian is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde L = \frac{1}{2} (m\dot x^2+m\dot z^2)-mgz-\lambda(z-C x^2).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The Euler-Lagrange equations are derived in the standard way:
* Variation w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; gives: &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x(t) = \lambda(t) 2 C x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
* Variation w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt; gives: &lt;math&gt;m\ddot z(t) = -mg - \lambda(t) &lt;/math&gt;
* Variation w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt; gives: &lt;math&gt; 0 = z(t) - C x^2(t) &lt;/math&gt;

It is not easy to solve these equations by hand, but deriving them is straightforward and requires &quot;no thinking&quot;, as physicists say. (That is, we simply follow general rules, and we do not need to make any special decisions or find special tricks for each particular situation.)

Exercise:
There is an arbitrary choice in selecting the constraint function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we could have selected &lt;math&gt;G(x,z)=2x^2-2z/C&lt;/math&gt; or even &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=x-\sqrt{z/C}&lt;/math&gt;, and the constraint line &lt;math&gt;G(x,z)=0&lt;/math&gt; remains the same. Show that the equations of motion also remain the same, up to a change in the definition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Lagrange multipliers and constraining forces ===

We see from the equation for &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the above example that &lt;math&gt;-\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt; looks like the component of the normal force in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction. So it is clear that the Lagrange multiplier &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is somehow related to the unknown constraining force. We shall now derive this relationship in a more general case.

Consider again the Constrained Problem Number One. We solved it by using the modified Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;\tilde L = L - \lambda(t)G(\boldsymbol x)&lt;/math&gt;. The term &lt;math&gt;-\lambda(t)G(\boldsymbol x)&lt;/math&gt; looks like an extra piece of potential energy, although it depends on time through the factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;). So this is a somewhat weird kind of potential energy, but let us examine it in more detail. As long as the point mass remains within the constraint surface, we have &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol x)=0&lt;/math&gt; and this &quot;extra potential energy&quot; is equal to zero. But if the point mass could move a little bit off the constraint surface, say in a direction given by a small vector &lt;math&gt;\delta \boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt;, then this &quot;extra potential energy&quot; would change by 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \delta V = \delta \boldsymbol x \cdot \frac{\partial (\lambda G)}{\partial \boldsymbol x}. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This looks like ''work done by a force''. The force is directed ''orthogonally'' to the constraint surface and is equal to
&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol F= -\lambda\frac{\partial G}{\partial \boldsymbol x}.&lt;/math&gt; But we expect precisely this kind of force to act on the mass point by the constraining device. 

Let us verify more formally that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol F&lt;/math&gt; is in fact the ''constraining force'' we were looking for. The Euler-Lagrange equations that follow from the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;\tilde L&lt;/math&gt; are of the form
&lt;center&gt;&quot;mass &lt;math&gt;\cdot &lt;/math&gt;acceleration&quot;  &lt;math&gt; \equiv \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {\boldsymbol x}}= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol x} - \lambda(t) \frac{\partial G}{\partial \boldsymbol x}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The term &lt;math&gt;\partial L / \partial \boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt; describes the usual &quot;free&quot; forces due to potential energy in the original Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Now it is clear that the term &lt;math&gt;-\lambda\frac{\partial G}{\partial \boldsymbol x}&lt;/math&gt; describes the additional forces due to constraints.

Exercise: There is, of course, an arbitrary choice in defining the constraint function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, we may choose the constraint function as &lt;math&gt;17G&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;G^3&lt;/math&gt; or some other function &lt;math&gt;f(G)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Show that the constraining force does not depend on the choice of the function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; would change appropriately for every different choice of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;!).

Exercise: Figure out how to compute the constraining force &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol F&lt;/math&gt; if there are several independent constraints &lt;math&gt;G_1(\boldsymbol x)&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;G_n(\boldsymbol x)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Constraints involving velocities ==

So far we considered only constraints that are expressed by functions of coordinates, such as &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. This form of the constraints covers a wide range of applications. However, there exist important cases where physical constraints cannot be expressed in this way. For example, the motion of a massive ball that is rolling on a surface without sliding, or the motion of a skater who is sliding on ice, can be described only using complicated constraints that involve velocities and coordinates at the same time. Such constraints, which are not equivalent to a simple function of coordinates, are called '''nonintegrable''' or '''nonholonomic constraints''', whereas the constraints of the type we considered are called '''integrable''' or '''holonomic'''. 

One would think that nonholonomic constraints could be simply added to the Lagrangian with Lagrange multipliers. It turns out, however, that the result is ''not'' the correct equations of motion for the problem! The main reason is that velocities &lt;math&gt;\dot {\boldsymbol x}&lt;/math&gt; are not varied independently from the coordinates &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol x&lt;/math&gt;, so the standard procedure involving the Lagrange multipliers is not the correct way to implement nonholonomic constraints. A special theory (based on the so-called '''Appell equation''') was developed to derive the equations of motion for systems with nonholonomic constraints. However, this theory is beyond the scope of the minimal standard course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">BBC Jam – Learn, explore and create with the BBC’s fun learning service

In January 2006 the BBC launched a new digital curriculum service known as BBC Jam. It is a free on-line service aimed at five to sixteen year olds and can be accessed either at home or at school. The service aims to offer a learner centred approach to learners least likely to succeed through more traditional learning environments.
It aims to do this by providing an innovative combination of curriculum-based activities, video games, audio and animation and includes opportunities for learners to write teen soap storylines in French, and create audio, video and games. Content in maths, English, science, geography, French and business studies is available and materials will build over the next two years. However the launch has not been without its problems. There was concerted opposition to the proposal for a new online curriculum from commercial companies leading to a judicial review sought by educational software companies who argued that the use of state money to fund the BBC's plans would be illegal under European law. In early 2003 an out of court settlement was reached. In 2005, the online content was piloted in hundreds of UK schools.
The BBC intends to provide a service that complements the existing marketplace for education services and will exclude teacher focused provision, concentrating more on learner centred activity establishing a dialogue directly with learners rather than teachers and parents. 
This Learner centred approach is designed to provide learning resources that motivate the learner and make a real difference, both to their personal development and to their understanding of a topic. This approach will provide a complementary educational experience to other forms of learning, and the BBC will exclude covering those areas where it feels that it will be difficult to offer a new or distinctive approach.
The Department for Culture and Media and Sport has placed conditions on the range and scope of the learning topics the BBC Digital Curriculum Service can cover and in general the Department requires the service to stimulate, support and reflect the diversity of the UK, to innovate continually and to promote technological and pedagogical experimentation and to be distinctive from, and complementary to, services provided by the commercial sector. Additionally issues of access will need to be addressed and many subjects will have Welsh language versions of the content, and some subjects will also be made available as Scottish Gaelic or Irish Gaelic versions.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Hungarian uses the Latin alphabet, just like English. However, the alphabet is slightly different.
Hungarian uses two kinds of '''diacritics''': the ''Acute accent'' (´) indicates long vowels, the ''umlaut'' (¨) modifies the pronunciation of sounds ''O'' and ''U'', like in German and the ''double acute accent'' (˝) is used for long vowels with umlaut (''Ő'' is pronounced as a long ''Ö'').

==How many people speak this language?==
There are about 15 million people speaking Hungarian but only about 9.5-10 million of these live in Hungary ([[Wikijunior:Europe/Hungary|click here]] to learn about Hungary). The others in the surrounding countries and all around the world, most of them in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Romania|Romania]] and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Slovakia|Slovakia]].

==What is the history of this language?==
Hungarian is a Uralic language like Finnish and Estonian.

Before 1000 AD Hungarian had a different writing system called Old Hungarian script. It looks like this:
[[Image:Old_hungarian_script_sample_rovasiras.png|100px]]. This reads ''rovásírás''.

One of the first text written in Hungarian is ''the founding declaration of the Benedictine Abbey of Tihany'' from 1055.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Imre Kertész, who won a Nobel Prize in literature, Sándor Petőfi, Géza Gárdonyi, Ferenc Molnár, ''[[w:Category:Hungarian writers|click here to see more...]]''

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Box|
'''Important''': Hungarians use the '''Eastern order''' which means that natively the ''family name'' goes first and the ''given name'' is last. This way ''Sándor Petőfi'' is said as ''Petőfi Sándor'' in Hungary.

[[File:Satellite View of Japan 1999.jpg|thumb|upright|A satellite image of Japan]]
Japan today is a modern democracy and economy comparable to the European and USA model of politico-economics. A wealthy nation of more than 100 million people that is extensively involved in world wide commerce. It is now common to see Japanese tourists througout the world and Japan itself now features as a popular destination for Western tourists. Japanese products from high-tech companies like Sony are to be found all over the world and have played their part in enriching society and culture - one only has to think of the once ubiquitous &quot;Walkman&quot; of the 1980s. This has not always been the case and throughout most of its history Japan practised an &quot;isolationist&quot; policy that allowed trade and contact with foreigners but restricted their movement and influence to small enclaves on the coast. 

Japan is located on an archipelago of mountainous, volcanic islands in the northwestern corner of the Pacific Ocean. Before the Spanish began sending ships between Mexico and the Philippines late in the 16th century there was almost no naval activity in the Pacific ocean that had the capacity to disturb Japan in any way. To the Japanese, the Pacific was a boundary of their world, not a route to somewhere else. They never had to give any thought to what might be on the other side.

To the south, there is an almost continuous chain of islands extending from Tanegashima, just off the southern end of Kyushu, down through and beyond the Ryukyu Islands all the way to Taiwan. There is no doubt that there has been movement of people up and down this chain and the people of the Ryukyu's have spoken a dialect of Japanese for a long time. However, the islands are simply too small to have ever become important. The Ryukyu Islands long had no official contact with Japan, but dealt rather with China for several centuries. They were taken under Japanese control in the 17th century to make sure that they did not fall into the hands of the Spanish or Portuguese, but were not incorporated into the Japanese state at that time, being a private possession of the Daimyo of Satsuma.

To the north, Japan was bounded by the large island of Hokkaido. This also was never considered a part of Japan before the Russians appeared on the scene and the Japanese took steps to establish a presence there in order to keep them out. The native peoples of Hokkaido were neither numerous enough nor technologically advanced enough to cause the Japanese any concern.

Japanese trade during its early history was mainly with Korea and China. The Japanese islands are laid out in such a way that from the Chinese point of view they are largely hidden behind Korea. It is about 500 miles across the East China Sea from Shanghai to Nagasaki. In early days that was an extremely dangerous voyage (shipbuilding technology being primitive) and communication was usually by way of Korea and the Shantung Peninsula, reducing the longest water crossing to 200 miles or so. Korea was a nervous country, being relatively small and living next to dangerous neighbors in China and Manchuria, and through much of its history it discouraged active contact. This policy applied to Japan as well. The periods of time during which Japan and Korea officially ignored each other are significantly longer than the ones during which they had frequent contact. Fishermen and others crossed all the time, of course, but without noticeable impact on higher culture.

All of this makes Japan an unusual place. It really is different from any other place, even Korea and China, in architecture, clothing styles, food, literature, music and dance, social customs, weapons and armor, political habits, and religion. Despite modern business suits and McDonalds, it remains different today, as anyone who spends significant time there will quickly discover.

About 75% of Japan is heavily forested mountain land that is thinly populated. Almost everyone lives in a restricted number of relatively flat lands close to the seacoast, all of which are separated from each other by mountains, which come down to the sea in many places. Land transportation has always been difficult and until railroad lines began to be constructed, wheeled transport was not commonly used. Bulky goods were transported along the coast by boat, and if people didn't take a boat they normally walked. Generally, only soldiers rode horses. There were only a few places near cities where there were bridges over rivers. People waded the shallow ones and took ferries across the deep ones.

There are three main islands and a large number of small ones. One ancient name for the country was &quot;the 88 islands&quot;. The biggest island is Honshu (which means mainland), the next in size is Kyushu (which means 9 provinces), and the third is Shikoku (which means 4 provinces).

When the country was first unified politically, the government laid out a series of routes (it would be stretching it to call them roads) which, because of the mountains, established natural regions. It is well to get familiar with these because you will see these names all of the time. The Inland Sea (between Honshu and Shikoku) side of Honshu was called the Sanyodo (route on the sunny side of the mountains) and the Japan Sea route on the other side of Honshu was the Sanindo (the shady side). The mountains between these are particularly rough, so these really are almost different worlds. Honshu north and east of the ancient capital area (modern Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara) is wider, and so there were three routes, one on the Japan Sea coast, Hokurikudo (northern route), and two on the Pacific Ocean side of the main mountains, the Tokaido (eastern ocean route) and the Tosando (eastern mountain route), which meet each other north of Mt Fuji and near the future location of Tokyo. Other terms that are widely used are Tohoku (meaning northeast) for the far northeastern part of the country, Kanto (east of the barrier) for the large plain surrounding modern Tokyo, Kansai (west of the barrier) for the capital area, which is also called Kinai (inner region) or Kinki (near by region). The area between the Kanto and the Kansai is often called Chubu (middle part).

==Administrative Units==

There are three different schemes for dividing Japan into administrative units. In the late 7th and early 8th centuries the government set up a system that created what we conventionally refer to as provinces. When the system was finalized there were 66 of them. A province was given a local government structure that included a governor who was sent out from the capital. Even after that system collapsed the feudal regimes of the medieval period continued to use the province as a convenient geographical descriptor, and the system was not formally abolished until the 19th century. Then the government established a new system with different units that we have agreed to call prefectures in English. There are 47 prefectures, so they are bigger than the old provinces, and their names and boundaries ignore the province system completely. 

In between, the Tokugawa Shogunate had its own system which was entirely different. It is hard to describe briefly because it was constantly changing with the ebb and flow of politics. The government directly ruled about 1/3 of the country, including all of the big cities. There was no formal division of this area into units. The rest of the country was assigned to quasi-feudal vassals as privately held domains (called han). The larger han were directly administered by their owners who collected their own taxes and maintained their own military forces. The smaller han were usually fictional in that the central government ran them and the owner was entitled to a fixed annual revenue paid out of the government treasury. The biggest han were all located on the periphery of the country and might be as big as a prefecture, but many were quite small.

The government liked to keep the vassals who had han nervous and obedient. Han were constantly being enlarged or shrunk. Many were abolished and many new ones were established over the years. Han lords (daimyo) were not infrequently forced to give up one han and move to another on the other side of the country. It is therefore not really possible to create a map of han. It would require a large book of maps to show all of the changes in the system.

There are good articles in Wikipedia on &quot;The Provinces of Japan&quot; and &quot;The Prefectures of Japan&quot;. There is also a &quot;List of Han&quot; that is self-described as incomplete. However, it includes the major ones. I strongly recommend that anyone who is interested in historical topics should buy a modern tourist guidebook to Japan as a source of good maps and geographical information, although everything will be shown and described in terms of the modern prefectures. A large proportion of the tourist highlights are things that have survived from earlier historical periods and these will be described and pictured.

There is also a list of Prefectures on the page [[Japanese_History/Japan_Today#Administrative_divisions|&quot;Japan Today&quot;]].

==Pronunciation==

In the 19th century a system was devised for rendering Japanese syllabic script into our alphabet by a missionary named Hepburn. This became widely used and you will find it in many older books. There is a description in Wikipedia under &quot;Hepburn Romanization&quot; It was replaced almost universally in the English speaking world by a new system that makes it particularly easy for English speaking people to pronounce Japanese, at the cost of leaving certain things out. This is confusingly called the &quot;Modified Hepburn System,&quot; though it is very different from the original. I believe that it was mainly created by E.O.Reischauer, historian and sometime US ambassador to Japan. There is a similar system, nearly identical, in fact, which was officially adopted by the Japanese government. However, the Japanese do not romanize Japanese often, roman letters (romaji in Japanese) being normally used only for foreign words and phrases, so you will see the American &quot;modified Hepburn&quot; system more often than anything else.

There are no sounds in Japanese that are not also in English and the spelling is regular. All consonants are the same as ours. The letter &quot;i&quot; is pronounced as it would be in Italian or Spanish, which is to say like the &quot;e&quot; in me. The &quot;e&quot; is pronounced as in merry. The sound we mostly use &quot;i&quot; for is spelled &quot;ai&quot; in Japanese. The letter &quot;o&quot; is always the &quot;o&quot; in row (a boat), and the &quot;u&quot; is always like shoe. The letter &quot;a&quot; by itself is as in father. 

If you should listen to the way that Japanese pronounce things, you will hear them pronounce the same vowels in two different ways. One variant is short and quick, in the other the sound is held much longer than we ever do in English. Tokyo sounds more like To-o-kyo-o. Technically, one is supposed to indicate this by using a macron over &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; when they are lengthened, but this causes so much trouble in practice, especially with computers (searching and sorting are both messed up), that it is almost never done. The official Japanese system uses the circumflex accent ^ instead of the macron. That is about the only thing that is different. 

For those who know Japanese it is relatively easy to know when to use long and when to use short vowels. That is because this issue came into the language with the adoption of many Chinese loanwords. There are a lot more sounds in Chinese than in Japanese. The word that the Japanese represent as &quot;chu&quot; with a long &quot;uu,&quot; for example, is pronounced as &quot;jung&quot; in modern Chinese. The Japanese can't handle the &quot;ng&quot; sound and the long &quot;u&quot; is the result. The Japanese actually spell this out in their syllabary, writing the equivalent of &quot;Toukyou&quot; or &quot;chuu&quot;. The original Hepburn notation captured this distinction. However, it has many annoying features and the new system is better. I should perhaps mention that I am only talking about systems intended for English speakers. There are many others in the world, and since they are designed with the spelling conventions of a different language in mind, they often look strange to our eyes. I have seen the French and German ones.

==Writing==

In Chapter 9 of the first volume of the &lt;i&gt;Cambridge History of Japan&lt;/i&gt; Edwin Cranston observes that the modern Japanese have what is probably the most complicated writing system in the world. Fortunately, it is not really necessary to know anything about it in order to explore Japanese history. There is an article on it in Wikipedia, and a wikibook (for learners) at [[Japanese]].

The main complicating factor is that in nearly all cases Chinese characters are used for the very large number of Chinese loan words in Japanese. These are pronounced according to Japanese renderings of the original Chinese. Nearly every character also has one or more additional readings which are native Japanese words, and characters are routinely used in normal writing with these readings also.

Since Japanese is an inflected language (one in which words are changed to reflect differences in grammatical usage) and Chinese characters don't inflect, an inflected word is written using a Chinese character to establish the main meaning and then the inflected ending is spelled out using Japanese-developed characters that represent one of 51 different syllables. There are two independent versions of this &quot;syllabary&quot;, one with &quot;curvy&quot; characters (hiragana) and one with angular ones (katakana). The first is used most commonly, these days, with the second used in ways similar to the ways we use bold-face or italic characters, or for spelling foreign words. Both can therefore be used in the same block of text. Often foreign words are converted to sounds that the Japanese can say and are spelled out using katakana, but it is also not uncommon to simply plug in the original roman letters. One block of text can therefore use four different writing systems. Complicated indeed, you don't need to know this but it is good to understand the difficulties the translator faces.

==Dates==

Both Korea and Japan adopted the Chinese calendar system and retained it until they switched to the western system in recent times. The Chinese system was a complex one that was a mixture of lunar and solar elements. There are good articles on this in Wikipedia, including details of both the Chinese and Japanese variants. The everyday calendar was a lunar one which would inevitably fall out of synchronization with the solar calendar. This was handled by making adjustments on the same general principle as our &quot;leap year&quot;. An extra month was added whenever necessary to prevent new year's day from deviating too much from its &quot;home position&quot; in the solar calendar. This is because the lunar month was set at 30 days, which means 360 days to the year. An extra month was not added every year, and the rules for deciding when to do it are the main difference between the Chinese and Japanese versions of the system. Most people will be aware that the Chinese lunar new year occurs later than our modern new year, and that it occurs on different dates from year to year. 

There are names for the months in Japanese but they are not used in official documents, even today. It is simply first month, second month, and so on. It is possible to convert dates from the lunar calendar to the modern calendar, but it would be a lot of trouble and no one bothers. If you see a date in historical writing that says 15th day of the 3rd month, it will be a lunar calendar date and it will probably not fall in March. After the Japanese changed to the modern calendar, authors will usually write March 15th (though the Japanese still say 3rd month).

The exact date is not really so important unless you want to organize a celebration of the thousandth anniversary of some famous event. A more serious matter for the reader of history is counting years. The Romans dated everything by the names of the two consuls for the year. You would need to have a complete list (one was on display in the Forum) in order to arrange things in their proper order. The Chinese were not quite as bad, but almost. They very early developed the custom of proclaiming an auspicious &quot;reign title,&quot; something like &quot;perfect harmony&quot; and then dating things in terms of that. If &quot;perfect harmony&quot; then suffered some catastrophe, like a dangerous rebellion, the court might very well decide to change its luck by coming up with a new name. This could happen at any time during the year. So, the 14th day of the 5th month of the 6th year of &quot;perfect harmony&quot; could be followed by the 15th day of the 5th month of the first year of &quot;glorious dawn.&quot; Later on, the historians would clean things up by retroactively using &quot;glorious dawn&quot; for the whole year, but the government offices would still be full of files containing documents with the now imaginary 6th year of &quot;perfect harmony&quot; written all over them. And, as in the Roman case, you need to have a list of all the reign names to keep track. This system was started by the Han dynasty in 163 BC. 

Every dynasty used its own titles (often recycling names already used one or more times). Taking only important dynasties, there are just under 400 of them. Initially the Korean kingdoms simply used the Chinese titles, but they soon enough started inventing their own, as did the Japanese. This is where the January problem comes in. In Japan the first year of Kansei &quot;lenient government&quot; corresponds approximately to 1789. If I write Kansei first year, first month, first day, that is a purely Japanese date. If I try to make things clearer by saying 1789, first month, first day, you might now be thinking something very different. What I will do in my essays is use 1789 most of the time because it should not be necessary for a reader to have a list of all of the year names. However, this will be a lunar date and the first day of the year would not be January first, but sometime in the spring. If I should have some reason to use more precise dates, then I will say Kansei 1 (1789). Should it ever come up, there is a program on the Web called &quot;nengocalc&quot;. &quot;Nengo&quot; is the name for a reign title. Nengocalc permits you to reliably convert back and forth from traditional dates to modern dates. The Japanese still use reign titles, by the way, but they now follow the convention started by the Chinese in the Ming dynasty where each emperor uses only one. If I have counted correctly the official Japanese total is now 247, including a period in the 14th century when there were rival emperors using different titles simultanously. There were also &quot;unofficial&quot; titles used at various times in the past. The reign title associated with the current emperor is Heisei. Heisei 1 was 1989. After his death the emperor will be known as &quot;the Heisei Emperor.&quot; The reigning emperor is always referred to as Tenno Heika, &quot;his majesty the emperor.&quot; Only foreigners would ever call him Emperor Akihito.

==Names==

Japanese, Korean, and Chinese names are always written family name first. Writers in English frequently reverse them, but this opens the way to confusion and I prefer to keep the proper order at all times. Mao is the family name and Tse-tung the personal name.

In China the Ch'in dynasty began a convention that continued down to the end of the dynastic system whereby an emperor was given a reign name that had no relation to the name he had borne previously to his enthronement. This name was usually awarded only after his death, and it was often descriptive. For example, the most militaristic of the Han emperors is named Han Wu-ti, meaning &quot;the martial emperor of the Han dynasty.&quot; A milder mannered Han emperor was Wen-ti, the scholarly or cultured emperor. For the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties the emperor's postumous name was the same as the reign title used when he was alive. That has also become the rule in Japan but applies only to the last four emperors, the Meiji Emperor, the Taisho Emperor, the Showa Emperor, and the reigning Heisei Emperor.

Prior to that each emperor was given a postumous name separately from the system of reign titles. This custom was started late in the 8th century but all earlier emperors were given reign names at that point and historians routinely use them because they are short and simple and at no time is it considered proper to identify the living emperor by using his ordinary name.

Cities, the central fixtures of our very civilization, are home to a vast portion of the world's population. They bring together people, commerce and industry. Since ancient times, people have built settlements - simply because they are far better for business than isolated, singular homes. But what are the planning, design and architectural considerations which need to be taken into account to make them truly work? What would the ideal suburb look like? How far should the nearest train station be? Easy-to-navigate grids or interesting and endlessly variable cul-de-sacs and curved streets?

These and similar concerns have vexed city planners for centuries, and the results have been as numerous as they have been amazingly varied. An endless variation on the city theme: central business districts with high-rise glass temples of commerce, leafy suburbs just a subway ride from the city and endless highways which snake from district to district.

This book aims to explain some of the thousands of tribulations regarding city design, from major points like street layouts to seemingly trivial concerns such as urban beautification. The topic is vast, but the study of where we live is one that is perhaps universally important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Zoning?==
'''Zoning''' is the term (chiefly utilised in North America) used to the describe the pre-assigned &quot;function&quot; of an area of land by local governments. Zoning allows authorities to designate specific areas which may be used for a particular purpose. For those of you familiar with the PC game ''SimCity'', you will know all about '''RCI'''. RCI, short for ''Residential, Commercial and Industrial'', is an abbreviation used to describe the three major zoning categories.

Zoning is the principal reason that you don't find many shopping malls on sleepy cul-de-sacs or mansions beside factories. Using '''zones''' forces the three categories together, for organisational purposes as well as common sense, and creates neighbourhoods, commercial districts and industrial estates.

Here are the three RCI zoning categories explained in a little more detail:

*'''Residential''' refers to dwellings, either one-family residences or larger buildings such as apartment buildings.

*'''Commercial''' describes businesses, almost always offices or retail outlets (shops). Of the three categories, commercial developments are those most likely to be exempt from zoning and allowed to be built alone. This is simply because having all the ''Wal-Marts'' or all the petrol stations in one place doesn't make business sense.

However, this page is about the positioning of these zones, their sizes and their impact based on the first two factors.

[[File:Zonemodel1.png|200px|right]]
In the 1920s, a man named Earnest Burgess invented the first true '''zone model'''. A zone model is essentially a plan of a common style of zoning, indicating the areas where RCI developments are located and their respective wealth. This not only showed where the buildings were, but also how the wealth was distributed, and explained which zones ended up close to each other as a result of low income. His model showed the major trends in zoning and its impact, all with one simple diagram: the Concentric Ring Model.

'''The Concentric Ring Model''' shows that in the centre of most developments is a central business district (CBD), and surrounding that (often separated by a ring of undeveloped land) is a manufacturing sector, under the industrial &quot;umbrella&quot;. Of course, not many people want to live near factories, so after that comes low wealth residential development. As one moves further from the central area of activity, the income of residents increases - they have been grouped by the zones. Here is the model on the right, and the legend for all of the diagrams on this page is to the left.

'''''Please note that this is a graphical representation only and does not indicate a perfectly circular street plan!'''''

In the late 1930s, economist Homer Hoyt revised the above model to account for modern transport arteries, and realised that a more realistic zoning model evolving in many cities was not one of relative uniformity but of a more irregular nature, with businesses flowering around transport routes and residences flocking to business. It was this trend which led to the second major zone model in use today.

[[File:Zonemodel2.png|150px|left]]
'''The Sector Model''' (shown left) features the same CBD as the Concentric Ring Model, but this time it is completely encompassed by a &quot;poor&quot; residential area, with two opposing branches. To one side of these branches is the industrial area dealing with manufacturing. Note how this undesirable &quot;neighbour&quot; is separated from the higher-end homes by the low wealth areas, so the residential areas 2 and 3 are only next to other houses.

By the end of World War II, many large cities had evolved to take on a new form. While retaining their original CBDs (and relatively similar low-medium-high wealth &quot;bands&quot; radiating from it), they had grown to such a size that one centralised, all-purpose business centre was impractical for several reasons: the lengthy commute from outlying areas, the lack of a focal point for local commerce and the increase in &quot;heavy&quot; industry - highly polluting, particularly undesirable factories. Therefore, the Sector Model was adapted to create the final, and most globally accurate, zone model.

[[File:Zonemodel3.png|250px|right]]
'''The Multiple Nuclei Model''' (to the right) shows the typical original layout: CBD, neighboured by manufacturing industries, themselves next to the low-wealth residential zones. Next to that are the medium-wealth homes, and finally the wealthy residences. However, several new aspects have emerged which were not present in the first two models:
*A zone of heavy industry (area 7) on the fringes of the poorer residential areas. When the industries became larger, they were pushed as far from the central areas as possible, settling in the low-wealth zones, where potential employees were abundant and they would not overly damage the economy by eating into the wealthy areas.
*In area 8, a zone appeared which had rarely existed before. It is an outlying business district. When cities became so large that districts were themselves comparable to cities in size, it was clear that a 2-hour daily commute to get to places of work or retail would not suffice, so offices became decentralised: while the CBD still thrived with big multi-nationals, more local businesses shifted their headquarters to outlying areas. New commercial centres were formed, feeding the needs of their individual areas. These specialised, more local &quot;focuses&quot; of communities have become almost global concepts; a standard fixture of most metropolitan areas.
*Perhaps the most important modern zone in any city is the suburb, shown at area 9. Suburbs, which are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this book, are the ultimate solution to alleviating the pressures of the city: leave it! These very town-like communities are almost completely residential and are usually separate from the main populated area, thrown apart from it by a belt of green, undeveloped land. This almost entirely post-war fixture of cities has reduced the strain both on the city and its inhabitants.
*It is important to note that these models differ in different regions of the world.  Wealthy residential areas are usually located on the outlying areas of a city in Anglo-America, whereas in Europe more wealthy areas of a city lie in the center, closer to the CBD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">i think there is a mistake; the question starts with the divisor being &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 3x - 1&lt;/math&gt; and the answer is correct with this divisor. a simple mistake, they have put &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 3x +1&lt;/math&gt; on a few of the lines. somewhat confusing and i cannot edit the picture myself 
hope this helps

There's another mistake - in the example of dividing polynomials, the remainder comes out as -18x+15</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Soapboat1.png]]

== Simple Steps ==

Make a boat (flat as in the one shown in the picture above). Make sure to not to make the slit too big.

Cut a small piece of a bar of soap (enough to fit in the slit shown in the picture above).

Place the piece of soap in the slit of your boat.

Now, get a large bowl of water (or anything that collects water that has a large space for your boat to move around). (Use ordinary water).

Place your boat on the surface of the water and watch your boat move itself forward!

[[Image:Soapboat2.png]]

== What causes this? ==

Water is made up of tiny particles smaller than dust called molecules. These molecules are really close to each other at the water's surface and so cause a sort of tension. (You see this tension when insects or leaves float on the surface of the water. This tension looks like if the water is covered with a clear plastic).

When the soap touches the surface of the water, it breaks this tension by moving the molecules away from each other. This causes large spaces between the molecules near the soap.

Water molecules from under the water's surface rush upwards to fill the spaces to recreate the tension. This causes a push from the area of the boat where the soap is. Since the soap is at the back of your boat, it causes a push from there (like someone pushing a car from the back).

(This is also the principle of how soap gets your hands cleaner than when you wash them with water alone. When you wash your dirty hands with water alone, the water's surface tension blocks any more water from touching your hands. This causes only a little bit of dirt to be washed away. When you add soap, the soap breaks this surface tension and allows water to continue to touch your hands and so more dirt gets washed away easily.)

;Memory
:A system with memory is any system where the output depends on more than just the current value of the input. For example, a system that averages the values of the last five seconds of input and gives that as its output demonstrates memory. Confusingly, a system that can predict the future (say, a function that gives the output you are going to give it in 2 seconds) also demonstrates memory.
;Invertability:
:An invertible system is any system where the original signal can be reproduced from the systems output. 
;Causality
:A causal system is a system that depends only on the current and previous inputs. So a system that gets values from the future may have memory, but it is not causual.
;Stability
:A stable system will produce a finite output if the input is finite. An unstable system can create an infinitely big answer, for some finite input. 
;Time Invariance
:A time invariant system is a system where the same input gives the same output, regardless of how long the system's been running for. An example of a time invariant system is an amplifier.
;Linearity
:A linear system scales the output in the same way as the input and is additive.
::&lt;math&gt;
\forall x_1(t) \mapsto y_1(t) , x_2(t) \mapsto y_2(t)
\Longrightarrow a*x_1(t)+b*x_2(t) \mapsto a*y_1(t)+b*y_2(t)  
&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus a linear systems responds with zero when the input is zero.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Logical Mathematical Intelligence'''

Logical Mathematical Intelligence is one of the most securely documented intelligences.  Piaget [1] describes the intelligence as the ability to handle objects, moving to the ordering of the objects and grows into the ability to think formally about relationships without objects.  One of the simplest forms of the application of logical mathematical intelligence is counting.

The use of this intelligence is demonstrated in the form of problem solving but not necessarily mathematical problems; it involves the act of selecting key points of information in a logical systematic sequence.  Thus the investigation and analysis of data leading to results can assist in underpinning the understanding, not just taking the information on face value [2].

The use of Logical Mathematical Intelligence in the form of the usage of reasoning skills to unravel a mystery has been the trade mark of many of the worlds leading detectives.  Other professions [3] that demonstrate the ability to use Logical Mathematical Intelligence are physicists, computer programmers and accountants, famous people with a high level of Logical Mathematical intelligence include; Albert Einstein and Bill Gates.

Many authors demonstrate their ability to make best use of Logical Mathematical Intelligence when composing a novel.  The structure of the novel is planned, research is conducted and data collected and analysed before presenting in a logical sequence often being changed or re-written to suit the writers and readers needs.

Children’s games have been created and refined over the centuries to assist in the development of Logical Mathematical Intelligence.  These include mathematical puzzles, strategic war games even word association type games all of which can be found throughout the civilised world.

The most recent example that has attained almost euphoric status is a mathematical puzzle designed to stimulate Logical Mathematical Intelligence called ‘Sudoku’[4].  The aim of the puzzle is to enter numbers 1 trough to 9 in a grid.  The grid is usually 9 x 9 in size separated into smaller grids of 3 x 3 also called regions.  The rules that govern the placement of the individual numbers are that you must only have one occurrence of a number in any given column, row and region.  Some numbers are already placed in the grid these are called the givens.  The more difficult puzzles require the use of Logical Mathematical Intelligence and can seldom be accomplished by scanning alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Screen Magnification Technology'''

Screen Magnification Technology is one of the many assistive technologies available to support people with disabilities.  The technology comes in a number of different formats dependent on the individual needs of the user.  The most common formats are;

•	Video Magnifiers
•	Magnification Software
•	Optical Character Recognition Systems
•	Speech Systems
•	Braille Technology

Video Magnifiers are video or Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) that capture and project an image on a video monitor, television screen or computer monitor.  The camera can have the ability to zoom in on information giving the opportunity to vary the magnification available.  Lower priced models may use an auto focus lens that gives less flexibility; both types of camera require their own light source.  Cameras can be mounted on a stand in which case the media to be viewed has to be moved or the camera can be mobile allowing the media to remain stationery.  Video magnifiers offer the user the choice of viewing black letters on a white background or white letters on a black background. 

Magnification Software is a programme that remains on the computer and is called upon as required.  The software allows the user to magnify information that is being made available on screen.  People with only slight visual impairment may not need to use the software and can generally use a larger screen with a lower resolution that allows pixels to be displayed in a larger size.

Optical Character Recognition Systems allow the user to scan prepared text into a computer and have the text read back using synthetic speech.  The system can only recognise prepared text and as yet can do little with hand written information or drawings and pictures.  The system has three main stages; scanning the information, recognition and reading.  The system takes into account logical sequence of language and uses a lexicon to assist in spell check techniques.  When the information has been scanned, recognised and read it can be stored in electronic format for future use.

Speech Systems are made up of two parts the synthesiser that handles the speech element and the recognition software that tells it what to say.  The system used by the PC is a text – to – speech system that is governed by all the usual phonemes and grammar rules that allow words to be pronounced correctly.

Braille Technology takes information and converts from text into Braille.  The output can be produced as printed Braille format or can be sent to a receiver that raises touch sensitive pins so that the blind person can get an immediate output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Educational Geography Games'''

There is a vast array of Educational Geography Games available to both parents and educationalist aimed at developing and improving the geographical knowledge and awareness of individuals.  Games have been created to satisfy the need to make learning fun, in a subject area that at times can become dry or bland games can reinvigorate the learning experience.  Games have the advantage of turning repetitive activity that is vital to memory retention into a competitive activity with the possibility of experiencing the winning sensation whilst learning.

Educational Geography Games come in all shapes and sizes;

•	Card games
•	Board games
•	Puzzles
•	Touch ‘n’ Learn
•	Interactive maps
•	Online competitions

The games can provide a fun learning environment for all ages from baby through all the key stages leading to adulthood.  Games have been designed to be extremely flexible and can cover complex or simple topics.  The games can provide a learning environment that covers specific geographic locations to enhance the learning at a localised level or can be broad enough to cover the countries of the world. 

Card games range from the more traditional games like ‘snap’ where two pictures or words that are the same produces a winning combination, to the more modern and probably more complex card game of ‘Top Trumps’.  This game of cards comprises multiple ranges of data a covering a range of attributes of a geographical location.  Players compare information at random with the highest or best value winning the hand.

Board games invariably contain the element of travel across a country or region taking account of key locations, places of interest and climate.  Some more strategic board games involve the capture of territory and enable the player to understand what the economic drivers are within individual countries or areas.

Puzzles can be in picture format or words.  Pictures can be used to associate wildlife, plants and landscape to countries of origin.  Word searches can provide the learner with a test of memory or logic.

Touch ‘ n ‘ Learn systems can be used from the earliest age to help associate places with names. Young children can make good use of this type of equipment to build up a basic understanding of geography.

Interactive maps allow learners to find out in great detail about specific areas of the globe.  Often these are supported by computer software that contains a database of information that can produce very detailed facts to help inform the learning process.

Finally on-line games give the learner the opportunity to pit their skills and knowledge against another player anywhere in the world.  A good example of this can be found at Geosense

This page will discuss some of the fundamental basics of EM wave propagation.


== Electromagnetic Spectrum ==

{{Wikipedia|Electromagnetic_wave}}

::[[Image:cont_emspec2.jpg]]


== Radio Waves ==

{{Wikipedia|Radio_waves}}


Maxwell first predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves in the 19th century. He came to this conclusion by careful examination of the equations describing electric and magnetic phenomenon. It was left up to Hertz to create these waves, and Marconi to exploit them.

In spite of one hundred years of study, exactly what radio waves are and why they exist, remain somewhat of a mystery.

Electromagnetic waves in free space, or TEM waves, consist of electric and magnetic fields, each at right angles to each other and the direction of propagation.

::::[[Image:tem_wave.gif]]


The relationship between wavelength and frequency is give by:

::::&lt;math&gt;c = \lambda f&lt;/math&gt;

::where c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000,000 m/s in vacuum), f is the frequency of the wave, and λ is the wavelength of the wave.

Radio waves can be reflected and refracted in a manner similar to light. They are affected by the ground terrain, atmosphere and other objects.

Maxwell’s equations state that a time varying magnetic field produces an electric field and a time varying electric field produces a magnetic field. This is kind of a chicken and egg situation.

Radio waves propagate outward from an antenna, at the speed of light. The exact nature of these waves is determined by the transmission medium. In free space, they travel in straight lines, whereas in the atmosphere, they generally travel in a curved path. In a confined or guided medium, radio waves do not propagate in the TEM mode, but rather in a TE or TM mode.

Radio waves interact with objects in three principle ways:

::Reflection – A radio wave bounces off an object larger than its wavelength.
::Diffraction – Waves bend around objects.
::Scattering – A radiowave bounces off an object smaller than its wavelength.

Because of these complex interactions, radio wave propagation is often examined in three distinct regions in order to simplify the analysis:

::Surface (or ground) waves are located very near the earth’s surface.
::Space waves occur in the lower atmosphere (troposphere).
::Sky waves occur in the upper atmosphere  (ionosphere).

The boundaries between these regions are somewhat fuzzy. In many cases, it is not possible to examine surface waves without considering space waves.

===Surface Waves===

These are the principle waves used in AM, FM and TV broadcast. Objects such as buildings, hills, ground conductivity, etc. have a significant impact on their strength.
Surface waves are usually vertically polarized with the electric field lines in contact with the earth.

::[[Image:surface_wave.gif]]


====Refraction====

Because of refraction, the radio horizon is larger than the optical horizon by about 4/3. The typical maximum direct wave transmission distance (in km) is dependent on the height of the transmitting and receiving antennas (in meters):

:::&lt;math&gt; d_{\max }  \approx \sqrt {17h_t }  + \sqrt {17h_r } \quad {\rm{km}}&lt;/math&gt;


However, the atmospheric conditions can have a dramatic effect on the amount of refraction.

:::[[Image:refraction_distance.gif]]


=====Super Refraction=====

In super refraction, the rays bend more than normal thus shortening the radio horizon. This phenomenon occurs when temperature increases but moisture decreases with height. Paradoxically, in some cases, the radio wave can travel over enormous distances. It can be reflected by the earth, rebroadcast and super refracted again.


=====Sub refraction=====

In sub refraction, the rays bend less than normal. This phenomenon occurs when temperature decreases but moisture increases with height. In extreme cases, the radio signal may be refracted out into space.


===Space Waves===

These waves occur within the lower 20 km of the atmosphere, and are comprised of a direct and reflected wave.
The radio waves having high frequencies are basically called as space waves. These waves have the ability to propagate through atmosphere, from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna. These waves can travel directly or can travel after reflecting from earth’s surface to the troposphere surface of earth. So, it is also called as Tropospherical Propagation. In the diagram of medium wave propagation, c shows the space wave propagation. Basically the technique of space wave propagation is used in bands having very high frequencies. E.g. V.H.F. band, U.H.F band etc. At such higher frequencies the other wave propagation techniques like sky wave propagation, ground wave propagation can’t work. Only space wave propagation is left which can handle frequency waves of higher frequencies. The other name of space wave propagation is line of sight propagation. There are some limitations of space wave propagation.

# These waves are limited to the curvature of the earth.
# These waves have line of sight propagation, means their propagation is along the line of sight distance.

The line of sight distance is that exact distance at which both the sender and receiver antenna are in sight of each other. So, from the above line it is clear that if we want to increase the transmission distance then this can be done by simply extending the heights of both the sender as well as the receiver antenna. This type of propagation is used basically in radar and television communication.

The frequency range for television signals is nearly 80 to 200MHz. These waves are not reflected by the ionosphere of the earth. The property of following the earth’s curvature is also missing in these waves. So, for the propagation of television signal, geostationary satellites are used. The satellites complete the task of reflecting television signals towards earth. If we need greater transmission then we have to build extremely tall antennas.

====Direct Wave====

This is generally a line of sight transmission, however, because of atmospheric refraction the range extends slightly beyond the horizon.


====Ground Reflected Wave====

Radio waves may strike the earth, and bounce off. The strength of the reflection depends on local conditions. The received radio signal can cancel out if the direct and reflected waves arrive with the same relative strength and 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; out of phase with each other.

Horizontally polarized waves are reflected with almost the same intensity but with a 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; phase reversal.

Vertically polarized waves generally reflect less than half of the incident energy. If the angle of incidence is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; there is very little change in phase angle.

===Sky Waves===

These waves head out to space but are reflected or refracted back by the ionosphere. The height of the ionosphere ranges from 50 to 600 km.

Radio waves are refracted by the ionized gas created by solar radiation. The amount of ionization depends on the time of day, season and the position in the 11-year sun spot cycle. The specific radio frequency refracted is a function of electron density and launch angle.

A communication channel thousands of kilometers long can be established by successive reflections at the earth’s surface and in the upper atmosphere. This ionospheric propagation takes place mainly in the HF band.

The ionosphere is composed of several layers, which vary according to the time of day. Each layer has different propagation characteristics:

::D layer – This layer occurs only during the day at altitudes of 60 to 90 km. High absorption takes place at frequencies up to 7 MHz.
::E layer – This layer occurs at altitudes of 100 to 125 km. In the summer, dense ionization clouds can form for short periods. These clouds called ''sporadic E'' can refract radio signals in the VHF spectrum. This phenomenon allows amateur radio operators to communicate over enormous distances.
::F layer - This single nighttime layer splits into two layers (F1 and F2) during the day. The F1 layer forms at about 200 km and F2 at about 400 km. The F2 layer propagates most HF short-wave transmissions.

Because radio signals can take many paths to the receiver, multipath fading can occur. If the signals arrive in phase, the result is a stronger signal. If they arrive out of phase with each other, they tend to cancel.

Deep fading, lasting from minutes to hours over a wide frequency range, can occur when solar flares increase the ionization in the D layer.

The useful transmission band ranges between the LUF (lowest usable frequency) and MUF (maximum usable frequency). Frequencies above the MUF are refracted into space. Below the LUF, radio frequencies suffer severe absorption. If a signal is near either of these two extremes, it may be subject to fading.

Meteors create ionization trails that reflect radio waves. Although these trails exist for only a few seconds, they have been successfully used in communications systems spanning 1500 km.

The Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights cause random reflection in the 3 - 5 MHz region. Aurora causes signal flutter at 100 Hz to 2000 Hz thus making voice transmission impossible.

== Fading and Interference ==

Radio signals may vary in intensity for many reasons.

===Flat Earth Reflections (Horizontal Polarization)===

There are at least two possible paths for radio waves to travel when the antennas are near the earth: direct path and reflected path. These two signals interact in a very complex manner. However, ignoring polarization and assuming a flat earth can produce some interesting mathematical descriptions.

:::[[Image:direct_relected_wave.gif]]

:::''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = direct wave path length

:::''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = reflected wave path length

:::&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''p'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' difference in path lengths

:::''d'' = distance

From the geometry we can observe:

:::&lt;math&gt;p_1^2  = \left( {h_r  - h_t } \right)^2  + d^2&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;p_2^2  = \left( {h_r  + h_t } \right)^2  + d^2&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;p_2^2  - p_1^2  = \left( {h_r  - h_t } \right)^2  + d^2  - \left( {h_r  + h_t } \right)^2  - d^2  = 4h_r h_t &lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\left( {p_2  - p_1 } \right)\left( {p_2  + p_1 } \right) = 4h_r h_t &lt;/math&gt;

But&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \left( {p_2  - p_1 } \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d \approx p_1  \approx p_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\Delta p2d \approx 4h_r h_t &lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;\Delta p \approx \frac{{2h_r h_t }}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

If the difference in the two paths &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''p'', is 1/2 &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; long, the two signals tend to cancel. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''p'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the two signals tend to reinforce. The path difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''p'' therefore corresponds to a phase angle change of:

:::&lt;math&gt;\varphi _p  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }\Delta p = \frac{{4\pi h_r h_t }}{{\lambda d}}&lt;/math&gt;

The resultant received signal is the sum of the two components. The situation is unfortunately made more complex by the fact that the phase integrity of the reflected wave is not maintained at the point of reflection.

If we limit the examination of reflected waves to the horizontally polarized situation, we obtain the following geometry:

:::[[Image:vector_sum.gif]]

Applying the cosine rule to this diagram, we obtain a resultant signal of:

:::&lt;math&gt;E_r  = E_1 \sqrt {2\left( {1 - \cos \varphi _p } \right)}  = 2E_1 \sin \left( {\frac{{\varphi _p }}{2}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The signal strength of the direct wave is the unit distance value divided by the distance: &lt;math&gt;E_r  = \frac{{E_0 }}{d}&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, the received signal can be written as:

:::&lt;math&gt;E_r  = \frac{{2E_0 }}{d}\sin \left( {\frac{{2\pi h_r h_t }}{{\lambda d}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For small angles this can be approximated by:

:::&lt;math&gt;E_r  \approx \frac{{2E_0 }}{d}\frac{{2\pi h_r h_t }}{{\lambda d}} = E_0 \frac{{4\pi h_r h_t }}{{\lambda d^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;

===Multipath Fading===

The received signal is generally a combination of many signals, each coming over a different path. The phase and amplitude of each component are related to the nature of the path. These signals combine in a very complex manner. Some multipath fading effects are characterized by delay spread, Rayleigh and Ricean fading, doppler shifting, etc. Fading is the most significant
phenomenon causing signal degradation. There are several different categories of fading:

::* Flat fading: the entire pass band of interest is affected equally (also known as narrow or amplitude varying channels).
::*Frequency selective fading: certain frequency components are affected more than others (also known as wideband channels). This phenomenon tends to introduce inter-symbol interference.
::*Slow fading: the channel characteristics vary at less than the baud rate.
::*Fast fading: the channel characteristics vary faster than the baud rate.

====Time Dispersion====

Time dispersion occurs when signals arrive at different times. Signals traveling at the speed of light move about 1 foot in 1 nanosecond. This spreading tends to limit the bit rate over RF links.

====Rayleigh Fading====

The Rayleigh distribution can be used to describe the statistical variations of a flat fading channel. Generally, the strength of the received signal falls off as the inverse square of the distance between the transmitter and receiver. However, in cellular systems, the antennas are pointed slightly down and the signal falls of more quickly.

:::[[Image:Rayleigh_fading_doppler_10Hz.gif|300px]]

====Ricean Fading====

The Ricean distribution is used to describe the statistical variations of signals with a strong direct or line-of-sight component and numerous weaker reflected ones. This can happen in any multipath environment such as inside buildings or in an urban center.

A received signal is generally comprised of several signals, each taking a slightly different path. Since some may add constructively in-phase and others out of phase, the overall signal strength may vary by 40 dB or more if the receiver is moved even a very short distance.

====Doppler Shift====

A frequency shift is caused by the relative motion of the transmitter and receiver, or any object that reflects/refracts signal. This movement creates random frequency modulation. Doppler frequency shift is either positive or negative depending on whether the transmitter is moving towards or away from the receiver.
 
This Doppler frequency shift is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;f_d  = \frac{{v_m }}{c}f_c &lt;/math&gt;

''v&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the relative motion of the transmitter with respect to the receiver, ''c'' is the speed of light and ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the transmitted frequency. In the multipath environment, the relative movement of each path is generally different. Thus, the signal is spread over a band of frequencies. This is known as the Doppler spread.


===Atmospheric Diffraction===

Radio waves cannot penetrate very far into most objects. Consequently, there is often a shadow zone behind objects such as buildings, hills, etc.

The radio shadow zone does not have a very sharp cutoff due to spherical spreading, also called Huygens’ principle. Each point on a wavefront acts as it were a point source radiating along the propagation path. The overall wavefront is the vector sum of all the point sources or wavelets. The wavelet magnitude is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1 + \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is measured from the direction of propagation. The amplitude is a maximum in the direction of propagation and zero in the reverse direction.

== Reflection ==
Reflection normally occurs due to the surface of earth or building &amp; hills which have large dimension relative to the wavelength of the propagation waves. The reflected wave changes the incident angle.

There is similarity b/w the reflection of light by a conducting medium. In both cases, angle of reflection is equal to angle of incidence. The equality of the angles of reflection &amp; incidence follows the second law of reflection for light.

This page will discuss the topic of signal propagation through physical mediums, such as wires. 


==Transmission Line Equation==

{{Wikipedia|Transmission_line}}

Many kinds of communication systems require signals at some point to be conveyed over copper wires.

The following analysis requires two assumptions:

::• A transmission line can be decomposed into small, distributed passive electrical elements
::• These elements are independent of frequency (i.e. although ''reactance'' is a function of frequency, resistance, capacitance and inductance are not)

These two assumptions limit the following analysis to frequencies up to the low MHz region. The second assumption is particularly difficult to defend since it is well known that the resistance of a wire increases with frequency because the conduction cross-section decreases. This phenomenon is known as the skin effect and is not easy to evaluate.

::[[Image:transmission_line.gif]]


The purpose behind the following mathematical manipulation is to obtain an expression that defines the voltage (or current) at any time (''t'') along any portion (''x'') of the transmission line. Later, this analysis will be extended to include the frequency domain.

Recall the characteristic equations for inductors and capacitors:

:::&lt;math&gt; v = L\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;    and    &lt;math&gt; i = C\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;


===Kirchoff's Voltage Law===

Kirchoff's voltage law (KVL) simply states that the sum of all voltage potentials around a closed loop equal zero. Or in other words, if you walked up a hill and back down, the net altitude change would be zero.

::Applying KVL in the above circuit, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt; v\left( {x,t} \right) = R\Delta xi\left( {x,t} \right) + L\Delta x\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}}\left( {x,t} \right) + v\left( {x + \Delta x,t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


::Rearranging:

:::&lt;math&gt; v\left( {x,t} \right) - v\left( {x + \Delta x,t} \right) = R\Delta xi\left( {x,t} \right) + L\Delta x\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}}\left( {x,t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


::But the LHS (left hand side) of the above equation, represents the voltage drop across the cable element &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt;, therefor:

:::&lt;math&gt;\Delta v = R\Delta xi\left( {x,t} \right) + L\Delta x\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}}\left( {x,t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


::Dividing through by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\Delta v}}{{\Delta x}} = Ri\left( {x,t} \right) + L\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}}\left( {x,t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


::The LHS is easily recognized as a derivative. Simplifying the notation:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial x}} = Ri + L\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;


This expression has both current and voltage in it. It would be convenient to write the equation in terms of current or voltage as a function of distance or time.


===Simplifying the Equation (trust me)===

The first step in separating voltage and current is to take the derivative with respect to the position ''x'' ('''Equation 1'''):

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial x^2 }} = R\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial x}} + L\frac{{\partial ^2 i}}{{\partial x\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;


::The next step is to eliminate the current terms, leaving an expression with voltage only. The change in current along the line is equal to the current being shunted across the line through the capacitance ''C'' and conductance ''G''. By applying KCL in the circuit, we obtain the necessary information ('''Equation 2'''):

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial x}} = Gv + C\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;


::Taking the derivative with respect to time, we obtain ('''Equation 3'''):

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 i}}{{\partial x\partial t}} = G\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}} + C\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


::Substituting ('''Equation 2''') and ('''Equation 3''') into ('''Equation 1'''), we obtain the desired simplification:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial x^2 }} = R\left[ {Gv + C\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}}} \right] + L\left[ {G\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}} + C\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial t^2 }}} \right]&lt;/math&gt;


::Collecting the terms, we obtain:

::'''The Transmission Line Equation for Voltage'''

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial x^2 }} = RGv + \left( {RC + LG} \right)\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}} + LC\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


This equation is known as the transmission line equation. Note that it has voltage at any particular location ''x'' as a function of time ''t''.

::Similarly for current, we obtain:

::'''The Transmission Line Equation for Current'''

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 i}}{{\partial x^2 }} = RGi + \left( {RC + LG} \right)\frac{{\partial i}}{{\partial t}} + LC\frac{{\partial ^2 i}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


But we're not quite done yet.

===Solving the Transmission Line Equation===

Historically, a mathematician would solve the transmission line equation for ''v'' by assuming a solution for ''v'', substituting it into the equation, and observing whether the result made any sense. An engineer would follow a similar procedure by making an “educated guess” based on some laboratory experiments, as to what the solution might be. Today there are more sophisticated techniques used to find solutions. In this respect, the engineer may lag behind the mathematician by several centuries in finding applications for mathematical tools.

To solve the transmission line equation, we shall guess that the solution for the voltage function is of the form:

:::&lt;math&gt; v\left( t \right) = e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \gamma x} &lt;/math&gt;


The first term represents a unity vector rotating at an angular velocity of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; radians per second, in other words, a sine wave of some frequency. The second term denotes the sinusoid being modified by the transmission line, namely its amplitude decaying exponentially with distance. If we let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a complex quantity, we can also include any phase changes which occur as the signal travels down the line.

:The sine wave is used as a signal source because it is easy to generate, and manipulate mathematically. Euler’s Identity shows the relationship between exponential notation and trigonometric functions:

::'''Euler's Identity'''

::::&lt;math&gt; e^{j\omega t}  = \cos \left( {\omega t} \right) + j\sin \left( {\omega t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


::Going back to our educated guess, we will let &lt;math&gt;\gamma  = \alpha  + j\beta&lt;/math&gt;, therefore:


::::&lt;math&gt; v\left( t \right) = e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x}  = e^{ - \alpha x} e^{\left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right)j} &lt;/math&gt;

::The term &lt;math&gt; e^{ - \alpha x} &lt;/math&gt; represents the exponential amplitude decay as this signal travels down the line.  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is known as the attenuation coefficient and is expressed in Nepers per meter.

::The term &lt;math&gt; e^{\left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right)j} &lt;/math&gt; represents the frequency of the signal at any point along the line. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;  component is known as the phase shift coefficient, and is expressed in radians per meter.

::Substituting our ''educated guess'' 

::::&lt;math&gt; v\left( t \right) = e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x}  &lt;/math&gt;


::into the transmission line equation for voltage, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial x^2 }}\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] = RG\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] + \left( {RC + LG} \right)\frac{\partial }{{\partial t}}\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] + LC\frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial t^2 }}\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right]&lt;/math&gt;


This looks pretty intimidating, but if you can do basic differentials and algebra, you can do this!


====Simplifying the Equation (trust me)====

The idea now is to work through the math to see if we come up with a reasonable solution. If we arrive at a contradiction or an unreasonable result, it means that our educated guess was wrong and we have to do more experimenting and come up with a better guess as to how voltage and current travel down a transmission line.

Let's look at this equation one term at a time:

::::LHS = RHS Term 1 + RHS Term 2 + RHS Term 3


::Starting with the left hand side (LHS) we get the following simplification:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial x^2 }}\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] = \frac{\partial }{{\partial x}}\left[ { - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] = \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)^2 e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} &lt;/math&gt;


::Believe it or not, the RHS Term 1 does not need simplifying.

::Simplifying the RHS Term 2, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( {RC + LG} \right)\frac{\partial }{{\partial t}}\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] = \left( {RC + LG} \right)j\omega \left( {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;


::Simplifying the RHS Term 3, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt; LC\frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial t^2 }}\left[ {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] = LC\frac{\partial }{{\partial t}}\left[ {j\omega e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right] =  - LC\omega ^2 e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} &lt;/math&gt;


::Let's put it all back together:

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)^2 e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x}  = RG\left( {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right) + \left( {RC + LG} \right)j\omega \left( {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right) - LC\omega ^2 \left( {e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;
 

::Note that each of the four terms contain the expression &lt;math&gt; e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x} &lt;/math&gt;.

::Therefore we end up with:

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)^2  = RG + \left( {RC + LG} \right)j\omega  - LC\omega ^2 &lt;/math&gt;


::And this can be further simplified to:

::'''Attenuation and Phase Shift Coefficients'''

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  + j\beta  = \gamma  = \sqrt {\left( {R + j\omega L} \right)\left( {G + j\omega C} \right)} &lt;/math&gt;


This result is not self contradictory or unreasonable. Therefore we conclude that our educated guess was right and we have successfully found an expression for attenuation and phase shift on a transmission line as a function of its distributed electrical components and frequency.


===Lossless Transmission Line===

Signal loss occurs by two basic mechanisms: signal power can be dissipated in a resistor [or conductance] or signal currents may be shunted to an AC ground via a reactance. In transmission line theory, a lossless transmission line does not dissipate power. Signals, will still gradually diminish however, as shunt reactances return the current to the source via the ground path. For the power loss to equal zero, R = G = 0. This condition occurs when the transmission line is very short. An oscilloscope probe is an example of a very short transmission line. The transmission line equation reduces to the voltage equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial x^2 }} = LC\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


::and the current equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 i}}{{\partial x^2 }} = LC\frac{{\partial ^2 i}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


To determine how sinusoidal signals are affected by this type of line, we simply substitute a sinusoidal voltage or current into the above expressions and solve as before, or we could take a much simpler approach. We could start with the solution for the general case:

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  + j\beta  = \gamma  = \sqrt {\left( {R + j\omega L} \right)\left( {G + j\omega C} \right)} &lt;/math&gt;


::Let ''R'' = ''G'' = 0, and simplify:

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  + j\beta  = \sqrt {\left( {j\omega L} \right)\left( {j\omega C} \right)}  = \omega \left( {LC} \right)^2 j&lt;/math&gt;


::Equating the real and imaginary parts:

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\beta  = \omega \sqrt {LC} &lt;/math&gt;


This expression tells us that '''a signal travelling down a lossless transmission line, experiences a phase shift directly proportional to its frequency.'''


====Phase Velocity====

A new parameter, known as phase velocity, can be extracted from these variables:

::::&lt;math&gt; V_p  = \frac{1}{{\sqrt {LC} }} = \frac{\omega }{\beta }&lt;/math&gt; meters per second


Phase velocity is the speed at which a fixed point on a wavefront, appears to move. In the case of wire transmission lines, it is also the velocity of propagation., typically: 0.24c &lt; Vp &lt; 0.9c .

The distance between two identical points on a wavefront is its wavelength (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) and since one cycle is defined as 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians:


::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\beta }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega  = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;


::therefore:

::::&lt;math&gt; V_p  = \lambda f&lt;/math&gt;


In free space, the phase velocity is 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; meters/sec, the speed of light. In a cable, the phase velocity is somewhat lower because the signal is carried by electrons. In a waveguide transmission line, the phase velocity exceeds the speed of light.


===Distortionless Transmission Line===

A distortionless line does not distort the signal phase, but does introduce a signal loss. Since common transmission lines are not super conductors, the signal will decrease in amplitude but retain the same shape as the input. This characteristic is essential for long cable systems.

Phase distortion does not occur if the phase velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is constant at all frequencies.

By definition, a phase shift of 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians occurs over one wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

::Since

::::&lt;math&gt;V_p  = \lambda f\quad \quad \lambda  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\beta }\quad \quad f = \frac{\omega }{{2\pi }}&lt;/math&gt;


::Then:

::::&lt;math&gt;V_p  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\beta } \times \frac{\omega }{{2\pi }} = \frac{\omega }{\beta }&lt;/math&gt;


This tells us that in order for phase velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be constant, the phase shift coefficient &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, must vary directly with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

::Recall

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma  = \sqrt {\left( {R + j\omega L} \right)\left( {G + j\omega C} \right)}  = \alpha  + j\beta &lt;/math&gt;


The problem now is to find &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. This can be done as follows:

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma  = \sqrt {\left( {\frac{{R + j\omega L}}{{j\omega L}}} \right)\left( {j\omega L} \right)\left( {\frac{{G + j\omega C}}{{j\omega C}}} \right)\left( {j\omega C} \right)}  = j\omega \sqrt {LC} \sqrt {1 + \frac{R}{{j\omega L}}} \sqrt {1 + \frac{G}{{j\omega C}}} &lt;/math&gt;


It may seem that we have lost &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, but do not give up. The 2nd and 3rd roots can be expanded by means of the Binomial Expansion.

::Recall:

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( {1 + x} \right)^n  = 1 + nx + \frac{{n\left( {n - 1} \right)}}{{2!}}x^2  + \frac{{n\left( {n - 1} \right)\left( {n - 2} \right)}}{{3!}}x^3  +  \cdots &lt;/math&gt;


::In this instance ''n'' = 1/2. Since the contribution of successive terms diminishes rapidly, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is expanded to only 3 terms:

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma  \approx j\omega \sqrt {LC} \left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{R}{{j\omega L}} - \frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{R}{{j\omega L}}} \right)^2 } \right)\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{G}{{j\omega C}} - \frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{G}{{j\omega C}}} \right)^2 } \right)&lt;/math&gt;


This may seem complex, but remember it is only algebra and it will reduce down to simple elegance. Expanding the terms we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma  \approx j\omega \sqrt {LC} \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{G}{{j\omega C}} - \frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{G}{{j\omega C}}} \right)^2  + \frac{1}{2}\frac{R}{{j\omega L}} - \frac{1}{4}\frac{{RG}}{{\omega ^2 LC}} \\ 
  - \frac{1}{{16}}\frac{R}{{j\omega L}}\left( {\frac{G}{{j\omega C}}} \right)^2  - \frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{R}{{j\omega L}}} \right)^2  \\ 
  - \frac{1}{{16}}\left( {\frac{R}{{j\omega L}}} \right)^2 \frac{G}{{j\omega C}} + \frac{1}{{64}}\left( {\frac{R}{{j\omega L}}} \right)^2 \left( {\frac{G}{{j\omega C}}} \right)^2  \\ 
 \end{array} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;


::Since &lt;math&gt;\gamma  = \alpha  + j\beta &lt;/math&gt;, we merely have to equate the real and imaginary terms to find &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

::::&lt;math&gt;\beta  \approx \omega \sqrt {LC} \left\{ {1 + \underbrace {\frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{G}{{\omega C}}} \right)^2  - \frac{1}{4}\frac{{RG}}{{\omega ^2 LC}} + \frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{R}{{\omega L}}} \right)^2 }_{{\rm{Difference}}\;{\rm{of}}\;{\rm{squares}}} + \underbrace {\frac{1}{{64}}\left( {\frac{R}{{\omega L}}} \right)^2 \left( {\frac{G}{{\omega C}}} \right)^2 }_{{\rm{Very}}\;{\rm{small}}}} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;


::Or

::::&lt;math&gt;\beta  \approx \omega \sqrt {LC} \left\{ {1 + \frac{1}{8}\left( {\frac{R}{{\omega L}} - \frac{G}{{\omega C}}} \right)^2 } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;


::Note that if &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{{\omega L}} = \frac{G}{{\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\beta  \approx \omega \sqrt {LC} &lt;/math&gt;

From this we observe that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. 


::Therefore the '''requirement for distortionless transmission is:''' 

::::''RC = LG'' 


{{Wikipedia|Heaviside_condition}}

::This is one of the essential design characteristics for a broadband coax cable network.

If we equate the real terms, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  \approx \sqrt {RG} &lt;/math&gt;


So there is a reason to study algebra after all!


==The Frequency Domain==

Signal analysis is often performed in the frequency domain. This tells us how the transmission line affects the spectral content of the signals they are carrying.

To determine this, it is necessary to find the Fourier Transform of the transmission line equation. Recall:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial x^2 }} = RGv + \left( {RC + LG} \right)\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}} + LC\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


and recall (hopefully) the Fourier Transform (which converts the time domain to the frequency domain):

::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = F\left( \omega  \right) = \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {e^{ - j\omega t} f\left( t \right)dt}&lt;/math&gt;


To prevent this analysis from ‘blowing up’, we must put a stipulation on the voltage function namely, that it vanishes to zero at an infinite distance down the line. This comprises a basic boundary condition.

::::&lt;math&gt;{\text{let}}\quad v \to 0\quad {\text{as}}\quad x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;


This stipulation is in agreement with actual laboratory experiments. It is well known that the signal magnitude diminishes as the path lengthens.

Likewise, a time boundary condition, that the signal was zero at some time in the distant past and will be zero at some time in the distant future, must be imposed.

::::&lt;math&gt;{\text{let}}\quad v \to 0\quad {\text{as}}\quad t \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;


Although engineers have no difficulty imposing these restrictions, mathematical purists, are somewhat offended. For this and other reasons, other less restrictive transforms have been developed. The most notable in this context, is the Laplace transform, which does not have the same boundary conditions.

Having made the necessary concessions in order to continue our analysis, we must find the Fourier Transform corresponding to the following terms:


::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}\left\{ v \right\}\quad \quad \quad \mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial v}}
{{\partial t}}} \right\}\quad \quad \quad \mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}
{{\partial t^2 }}} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;


::::&lt;math&gt;{\text{Let:}}\quad \quad \quad \mathbb{F}\left\{ v \right\} = V&lt;/math&gt;


::Then applying the transform on the derivative, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial v}}
{{\partial t}}} \right\} = \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {e^{ - j\omega t} \frac{{\partial v}}
{{\partial t}}dt} &lt;/math&gt;


This equation can be solved by using integration by parts:

::::&lt;math&gt;\int {u\,dv}  = uv - \int {v\,du} &lt;/math&gt;


::::&lt;math&gt;{\text{let}}\quad u = e^{ - j\omega t} \quad \quad \quad \therefore du =  - j\omega e^{ - j\omega t} &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;{\text{and}}\quad dv = \frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}}\quad \quad \quad \therefore v = v&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\therefore \mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial v}}
{{\partial t}}} \right\} = e^{ - j\omega t} \left. v \right|_{ - \infty }^\infty   - \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {v\left( { - j\omega e^{ - j\omega t} } \right)dt} &lt;/math&gt;


Applying the boundary conditions when t goes to infinity makes the 1st term disappear.

::::&lt;math&gt;\therefore \mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial v}}
{{\partial t}}} \right\} = j\omega \int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {e^{ - j\omega t} v\,dt} &lt;/math&gt;


Note that the resulting integral is simply the Fourier Transform. In other words:

::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial v}}
{{\partial t}}} \right\} = j\omega \mathbb{F}\left\{ v \right\} = j\omega V&lt;/math&gt;

::similarly:

::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}\left\{ {\frac{{\partial ^2 v}}
{{\partial t^2 }}} \right\} = \left( {j\omega } \right)^2 \mathbb{F}\left\{ v \right\} = \left( {j\omega } \right)^2 V&lt;/math&gt;


We can now write the transmission line equation in the frequency domain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 V}}
{{\partial x^2 }} = RGV + \left( {RC + LG} \right)j\omega V + LC\left( {j\omega } \right)^2 V&lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt;V = V\left( \omega  \right) = \mathbb{F}\left\{ {v\left( t \right)} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;


::Rearranging the terms, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 V}}
{{\partial x^2 }} = \left[ {RG + \left( {RC + LG} \right)j\omega  + \left( {j\omega L} \right)\left( {j\omega C} \right)} \right]V&lt;/math&gt;

::or

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 V}}
{{\partial x^2 }} = \left[ {\left( {R + j\omega L} \right)\left( {G + j\omega C} \right)} \right]V&lt;/math&gt;

::since:

::::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt {\left( {R + j\omega L} \right)\left( {G + j\omega C} \right)}  = \alpha  + j\beta  = \gamma &lt;/math&gt;

::then

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 V}}{{\partial x^2 }} = \gamma ^2 V&lt;/math&gt;

::or

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 V}}{{\partial x^2 }} - \gamma ^2 V = 0&lt;/math&gt;


This represents the most general form of the transmission line equation in the frequency domain. This equation must now be solved for V to observe how voltage (or current) varies with distance and frequency. This can be done by assuming a solution of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;V = \underbrace {Ae^{ - \gamma x} }_{{\text{forward}}\;{\text{wave}}} + \underbrace {Be^{\gamma x} }_{{\text{reverse}}\;{\text{wave}}}&lt;/math&gt;


These terms represent an exponential decay as the signal travels down the transmission line. If we ignore any reflections, assuming that the cable is infinitely long or properly terminated, this simplifies to:

::::&lt;math&gt;V = V_0 e^{ - \gamma x} &lt;/math&gt;


To verify whether this assumption is correct, substitute it into the equation, and see if a contradiction occurs. If there is no contradiction, then our assumption constitutes a valid solution.

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial x^2 }}V_0 e^{ - \gamma x}  - \gamma ^2 V_0 e^{ - \gamma x}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{{\partial x}}\left( { - \gamma ^2 V_0 e^{ - \gamma x} } \right) - \gamma ^2 V_0 e^{ - \gamma x}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma ^2 V_0 e^{ - \gamma x}  - \gamma ^2 V_0 e^{ - \gamma x}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;


Thus we validate the assumed solution. This tells us that in the frequency domain, the voltage or current on a transmission line decays exponentially:

::::&lt;math&gt;V = V_0 e^{ - \gamma x} &lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma  = \sqrt {\left( {R + j\omega } \right)\left( {G + j\omega } \right)}  = \left| \gamma  \right|\angle \varphi  = \alpha  + j\beta &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\gamma  = {\text{ propagation}}\;{\text{constant}}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  = {\text{ attenuation}}\;{\text{coeficient}}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\beta  = {\text{phase}}\;{\text{coefficient}}&lt;/math&gt;


In exponential notation, a sinusoid may be represented by a rotating unity vector, of some frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt;e^{j\omega t}  = \cos \omega t + j\sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;


Note that the magnitude of this function is 1, but the phase angle is changing as a function of ''t''.

::If we let: &lt;math&gt;V_0  = e^{j\omega t} &lt;/math&gt;

::Then: &lt;math&gt;V_0  = e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \gamma x}  = e^{j\omega t} e^{ - \left( {\alpha  + j\beta } \right)x}  = \underbrace {e^{ - \alpha x} }_{{\text{attenuation}}\;vs.\;x}\overbrace {e^{j\left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right)} }^{{\text{phase}}\;vs{\text{.}}\;t\;{\text{and}}\;x}&lt;/math&gt;


This result is quite interesting because it is the same solution for the transmission line equation in the time domain. The term &lt;math&gt;{e^{ - \alpha x} }&lt;/math&gt; represents an exponential decay. The signal is attenuated as length ''x'' increases. The amount of attenuation is defined as:

::Attenuation in Nepers: &lt;math&gt;N = \left| {\ln e^{ - \alpha x} } \right| = \alpha x&lt;/math&gt;

::Attenuation in dB: &lt;math&gt; = 20\log e^{ - \alpha x}  \approx 8.68589\alpha x&lt;/math&gt;


This allows us to determine the attenuation at any frequency at any point in a transmission line, if we are given the basic line parameters of'' R, L, G, &amp; C''.

The term &lt;math&gt;{e^{j\left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right)} }&lt;/math&gt; represents a rotating unity vector since:

::::&lt;math&gt;e^{j\left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right)}  = \cos \left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right) + j\sin \left( {\omega t - \beta x} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


The phase angle of this vector is &lt;math&gt;{\beta x}&lt;/math&gt; radians.

==Characteristic Impedance==

The characteristic impedance of a transmission line is also known as its surge impedance, and should not be confused with its resistance. If a line is infinitely long, electrical signals will still propagate down it, even though the resistance approaches infinity. The characteristic impedance is determined from its AC attributes, not its DC ones.

      <comment>some techniques for improving wireless communication, including (but not limited to) antennas.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

This page will discuss Wireless EM wave propagation, and some basics about antennas.

== Isotropic Antennas ==

{{info|In communication we talk about 'antennas'; insects have 'antennae'}}

An isotropic antenna radiates it's transmitted power equally in all directions. This is an ideal model; all real antennas have at least some directionality associated with them. However, it is mathematically convenient, and good enough for most purposes.

{{info|A radio antenna is an example of an isotropic antenna}}

=== Power Flux Density ===

If the transmitted power is spread evenly across a sphere of radius R from the antenna, we can find the power per unit area of that sphere, called the '''Power Flux Density''' using the Greek letter Φ (capital phi) and the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \frac{P_T}{4 \pi R^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;P_T&lt;/math&gt; is the total transmitted power of the signal. 

=== Effective Area ===

The '''effective area''' of an antenna is the equivalent amount of area of transmission power, from a non-ideal isotropic antenna that appears to be the area from an ideal antenna. For instance, if our antenna is non-ideal, and 1 meter squared of area can effectively be modeled as .5 meters squared from an ideal antenna, then we can use the ideal number in our antenna. We can relate the actual area and the effective area of our antenna using the ''antenna efficiency'' number, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{A_e}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

The area of an ideal isotropic antenna can be calculated using the wavelength of the transmitted signal as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\lambda^2}{4 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Received Power ===

The amount of power that is actually received by a receiver placed at distance R from the isotropic antenna is denoted &lt;math&gt;P_R&lt;/math&gt;, and can be found with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;P_R = \Phi_R A_e &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_R&lt;/math&gt; is the power flux density at the distance R. If we plug in the formula for the effective area of an ideal isotropic antenna into this equation, we get the following result: 

:&lt;math&gt;P_R = \frac{P_T}{(4 \pi R / \lambda)^2} = \frac{P_T}{L_P}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;L_P&lt;/math&gt; is the path-loss, and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;L_P = \left( \frac{4 \pi R}{\lambda} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of power lost across freespace between two isotropic antenna (a transmitter and a receiver) depends on the wavelength of the transmitted signal.

== Directional Antennas ==

A directional antenna, such as a parabolic antenna, attempts to radiate most of its power in the direction of a known receiver.

{{info|A &quot;satellite dish&quot; is an example of a parabolic antenna}}

Here are some definitions that we need to know before we proceed:

;Azimuth Angle:The Azimuth angle, often denoted with a θ (Greek lower-case Theta), is the angle that the direct transmission makes with respect to a given reference angle (often the angle of the target receiver) when looking down on the antenna from above.
;Elevation Angle:The elevation angle is the angle that the transmission direction makes with the ground. Elevation angle is denoted with a φ (Greek lower-case phi)

=== Directivity ===

Given the above definitions, we can define the transmission gain of a directional antenna as a function of θ and φ, assuming the same transmission power:

:&lt;math&gt;G_T(\theta, \phi) = \frac{\Phi_{\theta,\ \phi}}{\Phi_{isotropic}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Effective Area ===

The effective area of a parabolic antenna is given as such:

:&lt;math&gt;A_e = \eta \frac{\pi D^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Transmit Gain ===


:&lt;math&gt;G_{max} = \frac{4 \pi A_e}{\lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If we are at the transmit antenna, and looking at the receiver, the angle that the transmission differs from the direction that we are looking is known as Ψ (Greek upper-case Psi), and we can find the transmission gain as a function of this angle as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;G(\Psi) = \left( \frac{2J_1((\pi D / \lambda) sin(\Psi))}{sin(\Psi)} \right)^2 \left( \frac{\lambda}{\pi D} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;J_1(\ )&lt;/math&gt; denotes the first-order bessel function.

=== Friis Equation ===

The '''Friis Equation''' is used to relate several values together when using directional antennas:

:&lt;math&gt;P_R = \frac{P_T G_T G_R}{L_P}&lt;/math&gt;

The Friis Equation is the fundamental basis for '''link-budget analysis'''.

== Link-Budget Analysis ==

If we express all quantities from the Friis Equation in decibels, and divide both sides by the noise-density of the transmission medium, N0, we get the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C/N_0 = EIRP - L_P + (G_R/T_e) - k&lt;/math&gt;

Where C/N0 is the received carrier-to-noise ratio, and we can decompose N0 as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;N_0 = kTe&lt;/math&gt;

k is Boltzmann's constant, (-228.6dBW) and Te is the effective temperature of the noise signal (in degrees Kelvin). EIRP is the &quot;Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power&quot;, and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;EIRP = G_T P_T&lt;/math&gt;

To perform a link-budget analysis, we add all the transmission gain terms from the transmitter, we add the receive gain divided by the effective temperature, and we subtract boltzman's constant and all the path losses of the transmission.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion#BDSM]] ==

The [[BDSM]] book that you started is presently in the &quot;Votes for undeletion&quot; process. It was originally deleted by an administrator, and we have temporarily undeleted it again while the Wikibooks community at large discusses whether to restore the book.

The main concern seems to be that [[BDSM]] is somehow &quot;original research&quot;. However I checked; BDSM does not seem to be a new invention. My own concern is that I do not want how-to guides about a practice as dangerous as BDSM, even guides oriented toward making it safer.

Once Wikibooks had a &quot;Manual of Crime&quot;, all about arson, carjacking, rape, and such. We deleted it. Then we had &quot;How to cheat on tests and examinations&quot;, about how to be academically dishonest. We deleted it. We had a page about how to be an Internet troll. We deleted it. BDSM (which was unknown to me before it appeared on Wikibooks) does not have the same problem, but it is risky and dangerous, with entertainment as its only goal.

Further, if the intent is to write mostly for Wikipedia (in [[Wikipedia:BDSM]] and linked articles), and only submit leftovers to Wikibooks, then the [[BDSM]] book would not have fared well here. What I suggest you do, if you want to write BDSM content on a wiki other than Wikipedia, is to try either of the two wikis linked from the bottom of the [[Wikipedia:BDSM]] page. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:16, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Hooks ===

GEM framework is designed to facilitate development of compiler extensions. The idea of GEM is similar to the idea of [http://lsm.immunix.org/ Linux Security Modules] (LSM), a project that defines hooks throughout Linux kernel that allow one to enforce a security policy. 

GEM defines a number of hooks throughout GCC's source code. It is implemented as a patch to GCC. With GEM, a compiler extension is developed as a stand-alone program. It is compiled into a dynamically-linked module which is specified as the command line argument when GCC is invoked. GCC loads the module and calls its initialization function. The module then registers its hooks that are call-back functions in GCC. 

In addition to the compiler hooks, GEM provides macros and functions that simplify extension development. In this chapter we will first introduce the hooks that GEM framework adds to GCC. Then we describe the typical issues in extension programming.

The project home page is at http://research.alexeysmirnov.name/gem

GEM adds several hooks throughout GCC source code. New hooks are added to GEM as necessary.

* Hook '''gem_handle_option''' to function ''handle_option()'' which processes each command line option. The hook takes the current option as its argument. If the hook returns value '''GEM_RETURN''' then GCC ignores the option.

* Hook '''gem_c_common_nodes_and_builtins''' which is called after all standard types are created. The GCC extension can create additional types.

* Hook '''gem_macro_name''' allows one to save the name of the macro being defined. Another GEM hook '''gem_macro_def''' is called when the macro definition is parsed. Using the macro name of the new macro definition it is possible to re-define the macro. This hook is added to function ''create_iso_definition()''.

* Hooks '''gem_start_decl''' and '''gem_start_function''' are called when a function or variable declaration/definition starts.

* Hook '''gem_build_function_call''' allows one to modify the name and the arguments of a function call.

* Hook '''gem_finish_function''' is inserted to ''finish_function()'' which is called from from grammar file. The compiler extension receives the function body of the function before it is translated into RTL.

* Hooks '''gem_output_asm_insn''' and '''gem_final_start_function''' are added to function ''output_asm_insn()'' which is called for each instruction of the assembly code and function ''final_start_function()'' called when the assembly code is written to the file, respectively. The former hook receives the text that is written to the file which allows it to modify the output. The latter hook can modify function's prolog.

{{GCC_take_home|GEM hooks are defined mostly at the AST level. A few hooks are defined at the assembly level. The new hooks are added as necessary.}}

=== Traversing an AST ===

When the function's AST is constructed one can instrument it. GEM's gem_finish_function hook receives the AST of a function. The idea is to traverse the AST and instrument the AST nodes as necessary. Function ''walk_tree()'' takes the AST, the callback function, the optional data, ''NULL'' by default, and the walk_subtrees parameter, NULL by default. The callback function is called for each node of the AST before the operands are traversed. If the callback function modifies the ''walk_subtree()'' variable then the operands are not processed.

The following code demonstrates the idea:

   static tree walk_tree_callback(tree *tp, int *walk_subtrees, void *data) {
     tree t=*tp;
     enum tree_code code = TREE_CODE(t);
     switch (code) {
     case CALL_EXPR:
       instrument_call_expr(t);
       break;
     case MODIFY_EXPR:
       instrument_modify_expr(t);
       break;
     }
   }
   walk_tree(&amp;t_body, walk_tree_callback, NULL, NULL);

{{GCC_take_home|Function walk_tree() traverses an AST applying user-defined callback function to each tree node.}}

=== Instrumenting an AST ===

In this section we describe functions that create new tree nodes and how to add the new nodes to an AST.

{{GNU_C_Compiler_Internals_Instrumenting_an_AST_{{{1}}} }}

=== When to Instrument ===

In this section we will describe when each of GEM hooks is used.
{{GNU_C_Compiler_Internals_When_to_Instrument_{{{1}}} }}

=== Function Prolog/Epilog ===

The assembly instructions are written to the assembly file:

   #define OUTPUT_ASM_INST(inst) \
     p=inst;                     \
     putc('\t', asm_out_file);   \
     while (*p++) putc(p, asm_out_file);  \
     putc('\n', asm_out_file);   
   OUTPUT_ASM_INST(&quot;pushl %%eax&quot;);
   OUTPUT_ASM_INST(&quot;popl %%eax&quot;);

{{GCC_take_home|Assembly instructions are added to function prolog and epilog using hooks gem_output_asm_insn and gem_final_start_function.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The walk_tree callback function can instrument the AST. Functions build1() and build() construct new tree nodes. The former function takes one operand, the latter one takes more then one operand. The following code computes the address of the operand, same as '&amp;' C operator:

   t = build1(ADDR_EXPR, TREE_TYPE(t), t);

The following example refers to an array element arr[0]:

   t = build(ARRAY_REF, integer_type_node, arr, integer_zero_node);

The following example builds an integer constant:

   t = build_int_2(value, 0);

Building string constant is more difficult. The following example demonstrates the idea:

   tree gem_build_string_literal(int len, const char *str) {
      tree t, elem, index, type;
      t = build_string (len, str);
      elem = build_type_variant (char_type_node, 1, 0);
      index = build_index_type (build_int_2(len-1, 0));
      type = build_array_type (elem, index);
      T_T(t) = type;
      TREE_READONLY(t)=1;
      TREE_STATIC(t)=1;
      TREE_CONSTANT(t)=1;
      type=build_pointer_type (type);
      t = build1 (ADDR_EXPR, type, t);
      t = build1 (NOP_EXPR, build_pointer_type(char_type_node), t);
      return t;
   }

To build a function call one needs to build the list of arguments. Then the CALL_EXPR is constructed:

   t_arg1 = build_tree_list(NULL_TREE, arg1);
   t_arg2 = build_tree_list(NULL_TREE, arg2);
   ...
   TREE_CHAIN(t_arg1)=t_arg2;
   ...
   TREE_CHAIN(t_argn)=NULL_TREE;
   t_call = build_function_call(t_func_decl, t_arg1);

The constructed tree node is added to the AST as a statement or as an expression. A statement is added to the linked list of statements using TREE_CHAIN:

   t_stmt=build_stmt (EXPR_STMT, t_call);
   TREE_CHAIN(t_cur)=t_stmt;

Adding a tree node as an expression is the same as using '()' C operator. The new expression is added as the first argument of the operator. The result of the operator is the result of its second argument:

   t_res = build(COMPOUND_EXPR, TREE_TYPE(t), t_call, t);

If you want to add the call after t then you need to build a compound statement. This is equivalent to using curly brackets in C:

   static tree gen_start_scope() {
     t_hdr = build_stmt (COMPOUND_STMT, NULL_TREE);
     ss = build_stmt (SCOPE_STMT, NULL_TREE);
     SCOPE_BEGIN_P(ss)=1;
     SCOPE_PARTIAL_P(ss)=0;
     TREE_CHAIN(t_hdr)=NULL_TREE;
     TREE_OPERAND(t_hdr, 0)=ss;
     return t_hdr;
   }

   static tree gen_end_scope() {
     ss = build_stmt (SCOPE_STMT, NULL_TREE);
     SCOPE_BEGIN_P(ss)=0;
     SCOPE_PARTIAL_P(ss)=0;
     return ss;
   }

   static tree scope_stmt(tree t) {
     t_res=gen_start_scope();
     TREE_CHAIN(TREE_OPERAND(t_res, 0)) = t;
     while (TREE_CHAIN(t)) t = TREE_CHAIN(t);
     TREE_CHAIN(t)=gen_end_scope();
     return t_res;
   }

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Lookup of a Declaration in the Symbol Table ====
   
  void gem_find_symtab(tree *t_var, char *name) {
    tree t_ident = get_identifier(name);
    if (t_ident) *t_var = lookup_name(t_ident); else *t_var=NULL_TREE;
  }

==== Building Tree Nodes ====

The ''walk_tree'' callback function can instrument the AST. Functions ''build1()'' and ''build()'' construct new tree nodes. The former function takes one operand, the latter one takes more then one operand. The following code computes the address of the operand, same as '&amp;' C operator:

   t = build1(ADDR_EXPR, TREE_TYPE(t), t);

The following example refers to an array element arr[0]:

   t = build(ARRAY_REF, integer_type_node, arr, integer_zero_node);

The following example builds an integer constant:

   t = build_int_cst(NULL_TREE, 123);

Building a string constant is more difficult. The following example demonstrates the idea:

   tree gem_build_string_literal(int len, const char *str) {
      tree t, elem, index, type;
      t = build_string (len, str);
      elem = build_type_variant (char_type_node, 1, 0);
      index = build_index_type (build_int_2(len-1, 0));
      type = build_array_type (elem, index);
      T_T(t) = type;
      TREE_READONLY(t)=1;
      TREE_STATIC(t)=1;
      TREE_CONSTANT(t)=1;
      type=build_pointer_type (type);
      t = build1 (ADDR_EXPR, type, t);
      t = build1 (NOP_EXPR, build_pointer_type(char_type_node), t);
      return t;
   }

To build a function call one needs to find the function's declaration and build the list of arguments. Then the CALL_EXPR is constructed:

   gem_find_symtab(&amp;t_func_decl, &quot;func&quot;);
   t_arg1 = build_tree_list(NULL_TREE, arg1);
   t_arg2 = build_tree_list(NULL_TREE, arg2);
   ...
   TREE_CHAIN(t_arg1)=t_arg2;
   ...
   TREE_CHAIN(t_argn)=NULL_TREE;
   t_call = build_function_call(t_func_decl, t_arg1);

If you want to build a list of statements { stmt1; stmt2; ... }, then you need to use function  ''append_to_statement_list()'':

   tree list=NULL_TREE;
   for (i=0; i&lt;num_stmt; i++) {
     BUILD_FUNC_CALL1(t_call, t_send, t_arr[i], NULL_TREE);
     append_to_statement_list(t_call, &amp;list);
   }

==== Adding Nodes to a Tree ====

GCC 4.1 has an interface that allows one to add a chain of nodes into another chain of nodes implemented in file '''tree-iterator.c'''. Functions ''tsi_start()'' and ''tsi_last()'' create a tree statement iterator and assigns it to the first or the last tree in the list, respectively. Functions ''tsi_link_before()'' and ''tsi_link_after()'' link a statement using the iterator either before or after the current statement. There is also function ''append_to_statement_list()'' that adds a node to a list. If the specified list argument is ''NULL_TREE'' then a new statement list is allocated.

==== Building Function and Variable Declarations ====

A global declaration is added in hook gem_c_common_nodes_and_builtins(). In this following example we build a structure type and create a global variable of this type. The structure has a field of type unsigned int and a function pointer field.

   t_log = make_node(RECORD_TYPE);
   decl_chain = NULL_TREE;
   field_decl = build_decl(FIELD_DECL, get_identifier(&quot;addr&quot;), unsigned_type_node);
   TREE_CHAIN(field_decl)=decl_chain;
   decl_chain=field_decl;
   DECL_FIELD_CONTEXT(decl_chain) = t_log;
   ...
   t_func_type = build_function_type_list(void_type_node, unsigned_type_node, NULL_TREE);
   field_decl = build_decl(FIELD_DECL, get_identifier(&quot;add_addr&quot;), build_pointer_type(t_func_type);
   TREE_CHAIN(field_decl)=decl_chain;
   decl_chain=field_decl;
   DECL_FIELD_CONTEXT(decl_chain) = t_log;
   ...
   TYPE_FIELDS(t_log) = nreverse(decl_chain);
   layout_type(t_log);
   pushdecl(build_decl(TYPE_DECL, get_identifier(&quot;log_t&quot;), t_log));
   decl = build_decl(VAR_DECL, get_identifier(&quot;log&quot;), build_pointer_type(t_log));
   DECL_EXTERNAL(decl)=1;
   pushdecl(decl);&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

==Introduction==

The end of World War I saw the European combatant nations exhausted, an entire generation of young men dead on the battlefield, and political conditions vastly changed from those before the war.  The German, Austrian and Russian monarchies had been driven from power and replaced with democratic or revolutionary governments, and many European ethnic groups which had been subject to these three states seized the chance to obtain independence.  It was against this background that the victorious powers attempted to bring permanent peace to Europe.  The victors of the war were quick to blame Germany for starting the war and resolved to punish her, and this is exactly what took place at the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. the treaty was so harsh on Germany mostly because France and Italy were angry with them.

==The Treaty of Versailles of 1919==

[[Image:WilsonVersailles.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[w:Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] and the American peace commissioners during the negotiations on the Treaty of Versailles.]]

At the Peace of Paris or Treaty of Versailles, the &quot;Big Four&quot; convened to discuss what the result of the end of the war should be.  The big four consisted of the United States, represented by President Woodrow Wilson; Britain, represented by Prime Minister Lloyd-George; France, represented by Clemenceau, who wanted most of all to get revenge against Germany; and Orlando of Italy.  Germany and Russia were not invited, as Germany was defeated, and Russia had made a separate peace with Germany in 1917, and was feared because of the rise of the revolutionary Bolsheviks there.

At the discussions, many taking part looked to President Wilson for leadership, as the United States was the least damaged and seemingly the most neutral victor, and because the members saw Wilson's 14 Points plan provide an idealistic road map to a new future.

===Wilson's Fourteen Points===

Wilson's Fourteen Points were democratic, liberal, enlightened, and progressive - a new type of treaty designed to make peace forever secure.  The key aspects of his propositions were to disallow secret treaties in the future, allow freedom of the seas, provide for arms reduction, allow the self-determination of nations, and to establish the League of Nations, which Wilson saw as a key instrument to prevent future war.

===The Treaty's Treatment of Germany===

In contrast to Wilson's idealism, the Treaty of Versailles was harsh, brutal, punitive, and retributive, especially because France still had lingering anger over the Franco-Prussian war.  The aspects of the Treaty were designed to attempt to prevent Germany's ability to wage war in the future.  It ordered that France would control the Saar valley, rich in coal and iron, for 15 years, and that France would have Alsace-Lorraine returned.  The Rhineland between France and Germany would be demilitarized as a buffer zone between the two nations.  Germany's colonies were divided between France and Britain, and Germany itself lost all together 13.5% of land and 12.5% of her population. The German navy was confiscated and the German army was limited to 100,000 members, and no submarines, planes, or artillery were permitted.  Germany was forced to pay brutal war reparations in the amount of 132 billion gold marks. Finally, Article 231, or the War Guilt Clause, was a strictly retributive measure, ordering Germany and her allies to bear full responsibility for the war.

==Problems of Germany After World War I==

Germany's new democratic government, the so-called Weimar Republic, faced serious problems following the Treaty of Versailles.  Though Kaiser Wilhelm II had abdicated and the wartime military leadership had lost its authority, Germans widely refused to admit that their army had lost the war.  A significant number believed that Germany could have continued to fight and eventually gotten the upper hand, and that surrender was a &quot;stab in the back&quot; of an army capable of winning the war.   

While this severely undermined the credibility of the new republic, the notion that the German army could have continued the war and eventually won is rejected by most historians, due to the introduction of fresh U.S. forces and Germany's weakness after four years of battle.  In fact, in late 1918 the German High Command, facing a powerful Allied offensive toward German soil and exhaustion of their own troops, turned in desperation to Germany's democratic politicians and asked them to form a government which the Allies would find acceptable for negotiations.

Immediately after the war, the Weimar Republic encountered severe economic problems.  Millions of demobilized soldiers arrived home to find little or no work.  Hunger was widespread.   In addition, France and Britain owed war debts to the United States, and in order to pay them demanded reparation from Germany.  Germany was unable to pay, so France seized the industrial towns of the Ruhr valley.  The German response was to print money to pay the unemployed workers of the Ruhr, which resulted in massive hyperinflation in Germany.

Politically, there was near-chaos for several years, as fringe political groups on both the left and the right openly and violently battled each other and the central government.  The Spartacists, or communists, staged uprisings in Berlin and other cities and briefly seized power in Bavaria.  The Freikorps, various bands of demobilized soldiers who did not want to lay down their arms, crushed the Bavarian coup d'état. However, the Freikorps also sought to overthrow the Weimar Republic's government with a coup of their own in 1920, which failed when German workers responded with a general strike.  

This was the atmosphere in 1919 when a small right-wing party in Munich took in a new member, an army corporal named Adolf Hitler.  A skilled orator and politician, Hitler rapidly rose to head the National Socialist German Worker's Party, known as the Nazis.  

==German Prosperity Returns==

In the late 1920s, prosperity returned to Germany, primarily as a result of U.S. efforts through the Dawes Plan of 1924 and the Young Plan of 1929.  These plans provided loans to the Weimar Republic and gave the Republic a realistic plan for reparation payments, helping to restore economic stability.

This prosperity had a diminishing effect on the radical groups of the right and left.  The appeal of these groups was reduced as a result of a prosperous Germany.

==The Rise of Pacifism and Isolation in the 1920s==

During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.  After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.  Thus, Europe took a number of steps to ensure peace during the 1920s.

At the Washington Naval Conference in 1921, the United States, Great Britain, France, Japan, and Italy agreed to build no new battleships for ten years and to reduce the current size of their navies.

During the Locarno Treaties of 1925, Germany unconditionally guaranteed the borders of France and Belgium and pledged to never violate the borders of Czechoslovakia and Poland.

In 1926, Germany joined the League of Nations.  The League was one of the major means that Europeans ensured peace during the time.

In 1928, 65 nations signed the Kellogg Briand Pact, rejecting war as a means of policy.  In 1934, Russia joined the League of Nations.

==Democracies in Europe from 1919 through 1939==

While fascism rose in Europe, the liberal democracies in the Britain and France were encountering isolationism and pacifism, as explained above, as well as problems with unemployment and colonial struggles.  As a result of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the concept that government is responsible for meeting the social needs of its citizens became increasingly popular.

===Britain===

After World War I, Britain faced a number of problems.  One of the most serious was unemployment, with approximately 2 million people on the &quot;dole,&quot; or Britain's welfare system.  This resulted in the rise of the Labour party.  The Labour party created a modern welfare state in Britain, creating an old age pension, medical care, public housing, and unemployment relief.

The British industries, now antiquated and falling behind, were selling less as the United States stepped up to the industrial plate.

Members of British colonies, such as Ireland, Egypt, India, and Palestine, were finding the ideals of the Enlightenment appealing and were beginning to resist British rule.

Finally, the Great Depression caused massive problems in Britain.

Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, a member of the Labour Party, enacted a policy of &quot;retrenchment,&quot; which cut social spending, disallowed employment for women, and installed 100% tariffs on foreign goods.  He enacted the ideas of [[w:Keynesian economics|Keynesian Economics]], authored by J.M. Keynes, which advocated increased government spending during a depression in order to put money into the economy.

===France===

The Third Republic of France was the governing body from 1870 until 1940.  Although it was widely disliked for its political instability and corruption, it did manage to deliver a golden age, what became known as the ''belle epoque'', for Paris.  The city acquired many distinctive new monuments and public buildings, foremost among them the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the World Exhibition of 1889. It was renowned as a centre for the arts, with the Impressionists taking their inspiration from its new vistas. At the same time, Paris acquired a less savoury reputation as the &quot;sin capital of Europe&quot;, with hundreds of brothels, revues and risqué cabarets such as the famous Moulin Rouge. The city also acquired its metro system, opened in 1900.

In 1877, President MacMahon tried to dissolve parliament out of disgust with the premier and to seize more power.  However, the French people elected the same deputies to Parliament.  The French people clearly wanted to prevent another dictator from taking power.

In 1886-1889, General Boulanger came close to overthrowing the government.  He gained large support among monarchists, aristocrats, and workers, pleading to fight Germany.  However, he lost his courage at the moment of the coup, and he fled to Belgium and committed suicide.

In 1894, a French Jewish army officer named Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused of treason in what became known as the &quot;Dreyfus Affair,&quot; showing that anti-Semitism was still strong in France, especially in the army and the Catholic Church.  Émile Zola wrote the famous letter &quot;J'Accuse!&quot; which helped raised support for Dreyfus, who was eventually pardoned and restored to rank.  Thus, in 1905 France enacted the separation of church and state.

After World War I, France encountered a number of problems.  They had difficulty with the cost and burden of rebuilding the nation, and they lost all of their investments in Russia as a result of the Russian Revolution.  The reparations were not paid by Germany as expected.  Additionally, tax evasion was common in France at the time.

By the late 1920s, prosperity had been restored.  However, the Great Depression of the 1930s triggered political unrest and social turmoil.  In 1934, the socialists and communists fought the fascists in the Chamber of Deputies, one of the houses of parliament, and threw ink at each other.  As a result of the unrest, the people elected a &quot;Popular Front,&quot; a coalition of socialists, liberals, and communists, to govern.  The leader of the Popular Front was Leon Blum, who during his tenure enacted family subsidies, welfare benefits, two weeks of vacation, a forty hour work week, and collective bargaining.  Leon Blum was replaced in 1938 by Eduard Daladier.

==Challenges to Democracy in the 1930s==

As a result of the Great Depression, fringe groups such as fascists and communists became more appealing to the general populace of Europe.

===Causes of the Great Depression===

The Great Depression occurred because of a number of reasons.  Low wages at the time resulted in less purchasing power.  An agricultural depression and falling prices resulted in increased agricultural output but decreased demand.  Overproduction in the factories, and overexpansion of credit, as well as the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 also contributed greatly.  Actions pursued when the Great Depression was still in its infancy involved the [[w:Fed|Fed]]'s untimely raise in interest rates (in hopes to lure foreign investment), and later on, the [[w:Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Smoot–Hawley Tariff]] created immediate tariff backlash across the world and collapsed a great majority of world trade.

===Effects on the Colonies===

These changes in Europe resulted in more calls for autonomy in the colonies, and the influence of Woodrow Wilson's proposed &quot;self-determination&quot; of nations grew.

In 1931, the Statute of Westminister created the &quot;Commonwealth of Nations&quot; consisting of Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the Irish Free State, and South Africa.  These nations were given autonomy but were linked to Britain through trade.

In the 1930s, India began yearning for autonomy.  The Muslim League and the Indian National Congress called for a greater role of Indians in their government.  Gandhi's &quot;civil disobedience&quot; led to an end to British rule, and in 1935 the Government of India Act provided India with an internal self-government.  In 1947 India gained its independence and split with Pakistan.

In 1908, &quot;Young Turks&quot; overthrew Abdul Hamid II of Turkey and ruled the nation until 1918.  After World War I, Kemal Atatürk took the leadership of Turkey.  In 1923 he moved the capital from Constantinople to Ankara, beginning the Republic of Turkey.  Finally, in 1930, he changed the name of Constantinople to Istanbul.  Atatürk established western dress, the Latin alphabet, and banned polygamy from Turkey.  In 1936, women were given suffrage and were allowed to serve in parliament.

==Fascism in Germany and Italy==

Italy experienced a turn to fascism after World War I, and Benito Mussolini took control as dictator of the nation.  Soon afterward, Germany under Hitler took the same turn.  Fascism was a new form of government, initiated by Mussolini, that promoted extreme nationalism and national unity; an emphasis on masculinity, youth, aggression, and violence; racial superiority; one supreme leader with superhuman abilities; the rejection of individual rights; the use of secret police, censorship, and propaganda; a militaristic and aggressive foreign policy; strict central control of the economy; and the holding of the individual as subordinate to the needs of society as a whole.

===The Italian Fascist Regime===

The liberal establishment of Italy, fearing a socialist revolution inspired by the ideas of the Russian Revolution, endorsed the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. After several years of struggle, in October 1922 the fascists attempted a coup (the &quot;Marcia su Roma&quot;, i.e. March on Rome); the fascist forces were largely inferior, but the king ordered the army not to intervene, formed an alliance with Mussolini, and convinced the liberal party to endorse a fascist-led government. Over the next few years, Mussolini (who became known as &quot;Il Duce&quot;, the leader) eliminated all political parties (including the liberals) and curtailed personal liberties under the pretext of preventing revolution.

===The Rise of Fascism and Hitler in Germany===

[[Image:Adolf_Hitler_1937.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Adolf Hitler]]

At the beginning of the 1930s, Germany was not far from a civil war. Paramilitary troops, which were set up by several parties, intimidated voters and seeded violence and anger among the public, who suffered from high unemployment and poverty. Meanwhile, elitists in influential positions, alarmed by the rise of anti-governmental parties, fought amongst themselves and exploited the emergency authority provided in the Weimar Constitution to rule undemocratically by presidential decree.

After a succession of unsuccessful cabinets, on January 29, 1933, President von Hindenburg, seeing little alternative and pushed by advisors, appointed Adolf Hitler Chancellor of Germany.

On 27 February, the Reichstag was set on fire. Basic rights were abrogated under an emergency decree. An Enabling Act gave Hitler's government full legislative power. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the rule of democratic law, a policy that Hitler had outlined in his biography 'Mein Kampf.' The new regime made Germany a one-party state by outlawing all oppositional parties and repressing the different-minded parts of the public with the party's own organisations SA and SS, as well as the newly founded state security police Gestapo.

Industry was closely regulated with quotas and requirements in order to shift the economy towards a war production base. Massive public work projects and extensive deficit spending by the state helped to significantly lower the high unemployment rate. This and large welfare programmes are said to be the main factors that kept support of the public even late in the war.

In 1936, German troops entered the demilitarised Rhineland in an attempt to rebuild national self-esteem. Emboldened, Hitler followed from 1938 onwards a policy of expansionism to establish Greater Germany, that is, one German nation state, starting with the unification with Austria (called &quot;Anschluss&quot;) and the annexation of the Sudetes region in Bohemia from Czechoslovakia. The British Prime Minister realized that his policies of appeasement towards Germany were being taken advantage of. To avoid a two-front war, Hitler concluded the [[w:Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], a treaty of non-aggression, with the Soviet Union.

==The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939==

In 1923, a coup led by General Miguel Primo de Rivera formed a new government in alliance with King Alfonso XIII Bourbon.  In 1930, opposition to Primo de Rivera's right wing government led to his resignation.  Out of a desire for democracy and socialism by the populace of Spain, Alfonso was overthrown in 1931 and a republic declared.  In 1936, a Popular Front of leftists forces was elected to Parliament and took control of the government. Anticlerical actions of leftists and their direct attacks on Catholic churches and monasteries angered all conservative Spaniards. Left and right-wing political militants clashed on the streets. In July of 1936, rebellion broke out among a big part of army units. It was supported by conservative forces of all kinds of social background and the fighting began.

The nation broke into two factions.  The Republicans, or &quot;Loyalists,&quot; consisted of communists, socialists, anarchists, and liberals, and received some international support as well as big military and financial aid from Stalin.  The &quot;Nationalists&quot; consisted of monarchists, angered Catholic believers, landowners, the army, members of the &quot;Falange&quot; party, traditionalists and received a great deal of direct aid from Italy and Germany.

In 1936, Great Britain, France, and the United States signed a non-intervention pact regarding the civil war.  In 1937, the town of Guernica, a civilian town, was attacked and bombed by the German airforce.  In 1939, nationalists took Barcelona and Madrid, and General Francisco Franco announced the end of the Civil War.  From 1939 until 1975 Franco would rule as dictator in Spain.

==Again to War, the Outbreak of World War II==

The Treaty of Versailles produced so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; powers.  Germany, who was the loser of the war, had harsh reparations imposed against them.  Italy got nothing out of the Peace of Paris. Hungary lost two thirds of her territory and each third ethnic Hungarian was placed  under foreign rule.  Japan didn't receive the racial equality clause they desired, even after defeating the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War.  The Soviet Union was snubbed at the Peace of Paris as well, as it was not invited to attend.

===Aggressive Actions by the Axis Powers and Western Response===

In 1933, Germany left the League of Nations.  In 1934, Germany attempted to annex Austria.  In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia while Germany reoccupied the Saar valley and began conscription and open rearmament.  In 1936, Germany remilitarized the Rhineland.  In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and the Sudetenland.  

The prevalence of pacificism in the 1920s in Europe meant that European nations were reluctant to interfere in the actions of the revisionist powers.  In addition, the nations of the Treaty of Versailles began to feel guilt for their treatment of Germany, and believed that they had wronged Germany.  Moreover, the areas that Germany initially invaded were all of German heritage, and the leaders of the nations wondered if perhaps Germany should be allowed to take those territories.  The leaders met at the Munich Conference in 1938, and Hitler promised to take no more aggressive actions. 

In 1939, however, Germany seized the rest of Czechoslovakia, showing that war was inevitable and that appeasement had failed.  Poland and Hungary also participated, taking sections of Czech and Slovak territory adjacent to their borders.  During the same year, Italy and Germany signed the &quot;Pact of Steel&quot; alliance.  

British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain responded to the occupation of Czechoslovakia by giving a guarantee to Poland that Britain would go to war against Germany if Germany attacked Poland.  The Polish government had not requested this alliance. Many historians have seen the guarantee as Chamberlain opening his eyes to Hitler's aggressive plans, but some others hold that it foolishly made war much more likely, by encouraging Poland to defy Germany in any negotiations over the Polish Corridor and the city of Danzig.

Possibly in response to Chamberlain's action, Germany and the Soviet Union shocked the Western powers by signing a non-aggression pact.  This pact showed that war was imminent because two systems mutually pledged for the other's destruction came to agreement.

On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland with its new war machine using what was called lightning warfare or Blitzkrieg.  As a result, on September 3, 1939, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany.  On September 17, 1939, the U.S.S.R. invaded Poland.  In 1940, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Treaty, forming the Axis powers.

===The Second World War===

After the invasion of Poland on September 1st 1939, between the fall of 1939 and the spring of 1940 the Allies did not directly attack Germany in the west, but rather they engaged in harassing operations which had become known as the &quot;phony war.&quot; This allowed Germany to  finish the mobilization of its forces.  In April of 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The next month Belgium, the Netherlands, and France were attacked. Within six weeks, France had surrendered.

Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of Britain in May 1940.  Churchill was dedicated to the destruction of Hitler, whatever the cost and using any means necessary.  Churchill opened a new era in warfare by launching an unprecedented bombing campaign against civilian targets in Germany.  The Germans retaliated, and the heroic British defense became what is known as the Battle of Britain.   London and many other cities in England were hard-hit with large civilian casualties.  

In 1941, Germany invaded Russia in an attempt to destroy communism, enslave the Russians, and get oil that was desperately needed to power the German war machine.  However, the invasion failed, and winter hit Russia, causing massive death and destruction among Germany's army.

In 1942, Germany attempted to siege the Russian city of Stalingrad, but the attack ultimately ended in Soviet victory and the defeat of the Germans.  Also during 1942, the British and the United States defeated German forces in North Africa.

By 1943, the Allies had landed in Italy and were beating back Mussolini's forces.  During 1943, the Battle of Kursk, the largest armored engagement of all time, also took place on the Eastern Front.  Again, the Soviets were highly victorious against German forces. On September 8, 1943, Italy surrendered to the allies.

By 1943, an immense bombing campaign by the U.S. and Britain was under way to break Germany's will to fight by destroying her cities and making her population homeless.  Almost every major city was devastated with huge loss of life, but postwar studies showed that the bombing had little effect on industrial production, and may have strengthened Germans' will to fight.

On June 6, 1944, Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy on what has become known as D-Day.  The offensive was successful for the Allies, and the Allies suffered far fewer casualties than expected.  This marked the beginning of the end of the war.  In December 1944, the Battle of the Bulge, the German's last major offensive in Western Europe, took place in Belgium.  The result of this battle was a victory for the Allies and the crushing of much of the remainder of Germany's forces.  On May 8, 1945, Victory in Europe Day occurred as the Russians took Berlin.

===Conclusion of the War===




As the war neared the end, two major conferences took place to discuss how to most effectively terminate the war.

====The Yalta Conference====

The Yalta Conference began on February 11, 1945.  In attendance were U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.  Yalta resulted in a number of essential provisions.

The first was the establishment of the United Nations, an international organization that describes itself as a &quot;global association of governments facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, and social equity.&quot;  The United Nations replaced the League of Nations, and was given the capacity to enforce itself militarily.

Yalta called for a four part dismemberment of Germany, with a portion going to each the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and Russia.  This was based upon the fact that while Germany was not unified it did not present nearly the threat that it did as a unified nation.

War criminals were tried at Nuremberg, marking the first time that members of an army were held to international standards.

Poland was reconstituted, albeit with large territorial changes and placement in the Soviet sphere of influence.  Reparations were enforced against Germany, and it was agreed that Russia would enter the war against Japan after the defeat with Germany.

Finally, the parties agreed to the Declaration of Liberated Europe.  This provided that liberated countries would be given the right to hold free elections and choose their own government.  This was an attempt to keep Stalin from annexing eastern Europe, but this attempt obviously failed.

====The Potsdam Conference====

The Potsdam Conference took place from July to August of 1945.  In attendance were President Harry S. Truman, replacing President Roosevelt as a result of Roosevelt's death, British Prime Minister Attlee of the Labour party, who represented Britain after Churchill's Conservative Party's defeat in Britain, and Joseph Stalin.  The Conference provided for German disarmament, demilitarization, and denazification.  Poland was shifted to the west to reward the Soviet Union and to punish Germany, and as a result there was a massive post-war migration.

Finally, Japan was threatened with destruction by a &quot;powerful new weapon&quot; which turned out to be the atomic bomb.

==Introduction==

As Europe enters a new era, with two world wars still residing in the collective memory, peace and prosperity seems likely to continue.  The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, resulting in a europe whose countries and borders have returned to their pre-WW2 state. Its nations, however, are faced with ageing populations and falling birthrates, making it increasingly challenging to sustain expensive programs of social services. As the twenty-first century began, the continent is redefining itself with multiculturalism, a stengthening of europe's common economic policies and the formation of a European parliament. The Europe of Nations, whose nationalistic sentiments led to two world wars during the last century, is viewing the federalism of the USA as a possible solution to forging a United Europe.

==Western Europe 1945-Present==

After World War II the countries of Europe were faced with finding ways to reconstruct their economies. Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland and Spain who had all remained neutral during the war fared slightly better. Sweden and Switzerland had provided banking and materials for the Nazi war effort and this meant that both countries had come out of the war relatively unscathed. Neutrality has its benefits but for those countries who were at the vanguard of military action the situation was far worse. Britain's industries had been almost exclusively dedicated to the war effort and coupled with the loss of economic and political influence amongst its former colonies the outlook for a quick recovery seemed unlikely. The countries that had been occupied by Germany had seen their industrial output directed to the German war effort and the influx of money and goods from occupied countries into the German economy meant that the shortages and austerity of war were not felt by the German population until the last year of the war. All over Europe the expectations was one of a return to normality and economic strength though it soon became obvious that this could only be achieved with American aid. In a speech given at Havard in 1947 by George C. Marshall, the American Secretary of State, proposed that the rebuilding of europe's economies including Germany's should in part be funded by American grants. 

&lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The truth of the matter is that Europe's requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products - principally from America - are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic, social, and political deterioration of a very grave character.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Excerpt from the Havard Speech given by George C. Marshall.


The Marshall Plan was passed into law by President Truman in April 1948 under the formal name of the &quot;European Recovery Program&quot;. The Marshall Plan was to apply to all the areas of Europe that had been ravaged by war regardless of whether the recipient had been an Ally or member of the Axis. Stalin rejected the plan therefore ensuring that East Germany, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia and other countries then under post-war Soviet occupation or influence were excluded. 

===Britain===

[[Image:Thatcher-loc.jpg|right|thumb|250px|British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]]

Britain after the war was heavily in debt. The bombing of major urban centers and exhaustion of manpower due to war casualties further added to the financial difficulties. The damage to the economy led to rationing being extended into the next decade. From 1945 until 1951, the Labour Party and Prime Minister Attlee replaced the Conservative Party. Winston Churchill was considered by the general populace to be a &quot;War Prime Minister&quot; and though having lost the first post-war election did serve a further term as Prime Minister from 1951 to 1955. In August 1947, India became independent of Britain. From 1950 to 1980 Britain, now without the full economic benefit of its colonies, embraced the free-market capitalism advanced by the USA though more emphasis was given to social programs and state ownership of major utilities. In many respects America's involvement in the war had been conditional on Britain dismantling its colonial power base with the USA viewing it as an obstacle to their own ideas of trade and free-market capitalism. This had first been proposed by Roosevelt to Churchill at the August 1941 meeting where the future of post-war europe was being discussed. America had viewed Britain's colonial trade as monopolistic and though it was Pearl Harbour and Japanese aggression that led to the USA entering the war; the agenda for colonial independence remained. America the Colony who had fought a war against the English for independence was pre-disposed culturally and economically to make this request.

Margaret Thatcher, leader of the Conservative Party, became Prime Minister from 1979 until 1990.  She was the first Western female leader of the modern era, and was faced with depression and &quot;stagflation&quot; - high unemployment and inflation resulting from high oil prices.  Thatcher was closely allied with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and employed &quot;trickle-down&quot; supply-side economics, cutting taxes on the wealthy in hopes that they would spend the additional money to hire new workers and endorsing privatization and deregulation.  Thatcher cut many other social programs including education, health care, and welfare, and sold off nationalized industries such as BritOil and British Airways.  She also broke the power of the unions in Britain.

Thatcher also deployed a taskforce to regain control of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) after the invasion of the islands by Argentina in 1982.

John Major was the Conservative Prime Minister from 1990 until 1997.
Tony Blair was the New Labour Prime Minister from 1997 until 2007. The Iraq invasion and Afghanistan conflicts.
Gordon Brown was briefly the Prime Minister.
The coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have formed the government since the general election of 2010, with a rumbling about possible Scottish independence from the UK and now possible departure form the EU.

===France===

The Vichy regime installed by the Nazis after their invasion of France during World War II was replaced in 1946 by the Fourth Republic, which lasted until 1958.  The Fourth Republic consisted of a strong Parliament with a Premier chosen by the majority party.  There was also a weak ceremonial President.  Charles De Gaulle, who led the Free French Resistance movement against the Nazis during their occupation of France in World War II, was elected but refused to participate and thus resigned.  After World War II, France decolonized Indochina, Morocco, Tunisia, and the rest of West Africa.  The Fourth Republic also allowed women's suffrage.

Violent conflict arose in Algeria, still a french colony. Bombings, terrorism, and the death of nearly one million people during anti-french actions led to this conflict taking center stage in French politics. When senior officers of the French military in Algeria rebelled in May of 1958 and fears of a coup d'état spread among the members of the government, the latter called upon Charles De Gaulle to resolve the problem. De Gaulle refused to take power unless the government would allow for a stronger Presidential position.

The people of France conceded, and in 1958 the Fifth Republic was formed with a strong authoritarian President.  However, De Gaulle's solution to the problem was to simply free Algeria.  In 1968, university students protest over their conditions, leading to a mass working-class strike.  After the failed &quot;régionalisation&quot; referendum, De Gaulle resigned in 1969. He was followed by two right wing presidents: Georges Pompidou (elected in 1969 and deceased in 1974), and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (elected in 1974). Abortion became legal under Giscard's rule.

From 1981 until 1995, François Mitterand served as President of France.  He was a Socialist, and implemented numerous social programs.  He abolished the death penalty.  He instituted nationalized banks, insurance industries, and defense industries.  Workers' wages increased during his tenure and working hours were reduced.  However, when the French economy lagged, he abandoned socialism in 1984 and the French economy revived. In 1986, the right won the parliamentary elections, leading to the first &quot;cohabitation&quot; period, where the president and prime minister were not from the same political side. Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and founder of the RPR Gullist party, was chosen as prime minister. Mitterrand was re-elected in 1988, but had to face a second &quot;cohabitation&quot; from 1993 to 1995, with Édouard Balladur as a prime minister.

In 1995, Jacques Chirac, became President. He also had to face the third &quot;cohabitation&quot;, with the socialist Lionel Jospin as prime minister from 1997 to 2002. Chirac was easily re-elected in 2002 against the extreme-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had unexpectedly reached the runoff, eliminating Lionel Jospin at the first round. Jacques Chirac then founded a new party, the UMP, uniting the majority of the right wing. Jacques Chirac was followed by Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP in 2007.

In 2012, Nicolas Sarkozy, very unpopular and having to deal with the economic crisis, was defeated by a socialist candidate, François Hollande.

===Germany===

[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|right|thumb|250px|Allied occupation zones in post-war Berlin]]

After World War II, Germany was divided into zones according to agreements reached between the ally powers. Western zones were placed under American and Western European control, while the eastern zones came under the control of the Soviet Union. Germany was to be occupied by the allies until some point in the future; how this was to be achieved itself became a source of conflict between the allies. This division of Germany also mirrored the presence of Allied troops in the now liberated countries of Europe. The Soviet army maintained a military presence in Poland, Romania and other eastern european states. American troops were still stationed in many western european states. With the war at an end the concord between the USA and Russia was now faltering and Germany and many of its neighbours were soon to become the center stage for an ideological battle between these once allies. The division of Berlin was a precursor to the Cold War; the first post-war arena for the entrenched differences between Russia and the USA and an ominous sign for the later conflicts of Vietnam and Korea.

In 1948, the Berlin Airlift took place. Berlin was in the eastern part of Germany  administered by the Soviets though the city itself was administered by France, America, Britain and the Soviets.  The western Allies had merged the three occupation zones they possessed after the end of World War II. The prelude to the blockade involved a gradual escalation of tension. At first the Soviets moved troops to borders and this itself prompted American intelligence to consider that the Soviets may be seeking further territorial expansion. The Russians then issued orders to General Dratvin (Russian command in Berlin) that all trains entering Berlin would now need to be inspected and the appropiate paperwork must be present. This was relayed to General Clay (US command in Berlin) who cabled the letter to Washington. The Washington administration came to the conclusion that imminent invasion of West Germany was highly unlikely and that the purpose of the recent Russian movement was aimed at removing the Allied powers from Berlin itself. The Russians increased the pressure with new inspection posts on roads and canals into Berlin. In March 1948 nine British registered barges were held at Buchhorst and in April British and American military trains were detained at Marienborn on the basis that the Russians had not been allowed to inspect them. The autobahns also came under pressure with the Russians insisting that Britain evacuate two Emergency Aid stations on the Belin to Helmstedt autobahn. On the 18th June 1948 the Allies issued a new currency called the Deutsche Mark which replaced the Reichsmark and on the same day Russia suspends all road and train travel to and from Berlin. On the 4th August the Allies officially started the airlift to supply Berlin. 

In 1949, the two areas were formally split into the Federal Republic in the West and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the East.  In addition, the Basic Law, Germany's constitution, came into effect in 1949.

From 1949 until 1963, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, a member of the Christian Democrat Party (CDU), came to power in West Germany and pursued a policy of integration with NATO and the US led Western alliance. Adenauer successfully resisted domestic political pressures for Germany to adopt a policy of neutrality between the Cold War blocs as a path to reunification.    Under him West Germany encountered the ''Wirtschaftswunder'', or Economic Miracle, with great recovery throughout the nation.  The country underwent denazification which involved censoring of fascist ideas and the showing of films taken at Dachau and other concentration camps to German cinema audiences. The education system in Germany was also subject to denazification with text books discarded due to their inclusion of Nazi propaganda. The Nuremberg Trials is the most visible example of denazification during this period since it involved the highest Nazi party members though thousands were tried at a local level by the Allies. One of the problems the Allies faced with denazification was that to remove all Nazis would have left a Germany struggling to reconstruct itself. In many respects Germans who had been complicit in Hitler's pogroms had escaped retribution because either they hadn't come to the attention of the Allies or they were part of the balancing act of German reconstruction.

In 1961, East German authorities, with Soviet backing, erected the Berlin Wall to stop the flood of refugees escaping to the west.  Both Adenauer and his parliamentary opponents, the Social Democrats, considered the GDR to be an occupied part of a legally unified German nation, but were not in a position to change these circumstances because of the Cold War confrontation between the US and USSR. Berlin's importance as the first arena of the Cold War is reflected in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Released classified documents about the Cuban Crisis show an American administration worried that any sign of weakness during the Cuban Crisis may lead to Soviet aggression in Berlin. The zones of 1945 had become a border by 1962 and Berlin had a wall of concrete and barbwire. This is where the Cold War started and this is where it would have to end.    

From 1963 until 1966, Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of the CDU served, followed by Kurt Georg Kiesinger.

From 1969 until 1974, Chancellor Willy Brandt, of the Social Democrats (SPD) came to power.  He enacted ''Ostpolitik'', a policy of economic friendship and trade with the eastern bloc and East Germany.  Though he supported the NATO alliance, Brandt's overtures to the east earned him suspicion in some Western circles that he might trade off the alliance for German unification.  Ironically, Brandt's government fell in a scandal over an East German spy within his office.  His successor as chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, was also from the SPD (1974-1982).

From 1982 through 1998, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the CDU served.  In 1989 he was in office when the Berlin Wall fell, as Gorbachev abandoned the Brezhnev Doctrine of Soviet protection for other communist regimes.  In 1990 the two portions of Germany reunified, but the East German economy lags far behind that of West Germany, even today.  Chancellor Kohl, styling himself a conservative in a similar mold to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, cut welfare spending and taxes, helping the economy.

From 1998 through 2006, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of the SPD served.  He is most prominently known for his adamant opposition to the US led invasion of Iraq as well as for largely abolishing unemployment insurance benefits in the so-called Hartz reforms.

After elections in 2006, Angela Merkel became Chancellor and is a member of the CDU.

==The European Union==

The Franco-Prussian War, World War I, and World War II have left an indelible mark on modern Europe. The ferocity and destruction of these wars has led to a concerted effort by european leaders to secure a lasting peace in Europe. At a political level it was agreed that the best method would be to unite the nations economically and politically. Thus began the European Union (EU).

===Members===

There are currently 27 members of the European Union.  The original six members were France, (West) Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands.  Between 1973 and 1986, Denmark, Ireland, Britain, Greece, Portugal, and [[w:Spain|Spain]] joined the EU.  The emblem of the European Union is a blue flag with twelve gold stars on it.  In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU.  Nine years later ten countries were admitted - Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus.  The number of EU members rose again in January 2007 with the addition of Romania and Bulgaria and in July 2013 when Croatia joined.  Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey are currently in talks about future possible membership of the EU.

===Background===

In 1944 the Bretton Woods agreement created the World Trade Organization (WTO) that fights to eliminate tariffs and promote free trade.  It established the World Bank, which provides loans to less-developed countries, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which loans to countries in economic crisis to prevent the collapse of their government.  The agreement also fixed exchange rates for currencies, which became floating exchange rates in 1971.

In 1945 the United Nations was established.

In 1951, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established with Belgium, West Germany, Luxembourg, France, Italy, and the Netherlands as members.

In 1957, the Treaties of Rome established the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) and the European Economic Community (EEC).  The members removed trade barriers between themselves and formed a &quot;Common Market.&quot;

In 1992, the Treaty of Maastricht provided for cooperation in law enforcement, criminal justice, civil judicial matters, and asylum and immigration.

In 2004, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Malta, and Cyprus were admitted into the EU.

In 2007, Romania and Bulgaria were admitted as members of the EU.

In 2013, Croatia was admitted as a member of the EU.

==The Soviet Union==

The Soviet Union after the war found itself in a position to secure its borders and to advance its own economic and political ideology into neighbouring states. They rejected the Marshall Plan and set up an alternative solution known as the Cominform. Russian troops had been first to enter Berlin and Stalin for all his faults was an astute politician who saw in this situation the chance to turn Russia into a world power. The Red Army was to maintain a presence in many of the countries it had liberated. The Americans who had wanted to extricate themselves from Europe's arena now found themselves drawn further into the tangled borders of Europe. The Cold War had started.  

===Nikita Khrushchev 1953-1964===
Khrushchev reversed many of Stalin's policies through a process which became known as &quot;Destalinization&quot;. This time period is known as &quot;The Thaw&quot;, since tensions between the US and the USSR became more relaxed. The theory of peaceful coexistence, which believed that the communist nations could live in peace with the democracies of the West, was spread throughout the Soviet Union by Khrushchev, who attended peace summits in Geneva and Camp David. In addition, Khrushchev attempted to modernize Russia and to give its citizens more freedom. He rid the USSR. of purges and eliminated show trials, replacing them with actual court systems.  He gave more latitude to the 6 Eastern European states, and also allowed more freedom of speech and criticism of Stalin.  At the 1956 XX Party Congress, Khrushchev announced that Stalin had indeed made many mistakes during his reign.

Khrushchev tried to reform collectivized agriculture and to shake up the Communist Party in order to remove inefficiency, so the Party forced him out in 1964.

The West regards Khrushchev as generally unpredictable, especially considering his actions in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.

===Leonid Brezhnev (1964-1982)===
After Khrushchev's removal from office, Leonid Brezhnev came to power.  He was widely seen as humorless, colorless, and unimaginative.  He brought an end to destalinization and is blamed for bringing an era of stagnation to the Soviet Union.

Brezhnev is well known for his Brezhnev Doctrine, which promised to intervene if a socialist regime was threatened.  During Brezhnev's reign, in 1968, there was revolution in Czechoslovakia.  Alexander Dubček was elected leader of the communist party, and he called for free press, democracy, and other parties.  In this sense he curbed repression, and he advocated &quot;Socialism with a Human Face&quot; in what has become known as the &quot;Prague Spring&quot; - that is, more rights, more consumer goods, and more freedom.  However, the Soviets invaded the country  and crushed this new government in August 1968.

Under Brezhnev, the United States and the Soviet Union underwent ''Détente'', which was in essence a relaxation of tensions between the two nations.  This occurred primarily because both countries recognized the concept of &lt;i&gt;Mutually Assured Destruction&lt;/i&gt;, which stems from a realisation that the proliferation of nuclear arms had ensured that each nation had enough warheads to guarantee each other's destruction. It was during this period that many countries witnessed the rise of campaigns for nuclear disarmament by the general public. These campaigns formed a defining social phenomena during the decades of the 60s and 70s, especially within the NATO countries, and in some part must have helped in the &quot;thaw&quot; of the Cold War.  

In 1975 both NATO and Warsaw Pact members signed the Helsinki Accords.  In these, the West recognized the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, and the Soviets promised to respect the civil rights of people living in the occupied territories.

Brezhnev had a great deal of trouble during his rule. In 1977 Czech dissidents, led by writer Václav Havel, signed a manifesto called the Charter 77 that demanded human rights, free expression, freedom of religion, and the right to organize.  Then, from 1980 until 1989, the Soviet Union was engaged in military action in Afghanistan in support of the communist government who were fighting a war with Muslim anti-communists. The USSR eventually withdrew their troops after a stale-mate was reached and russian casualties had mounted.     

Brezhnev presided over the USSR for longer than any other but Stalin, and there was never a plot to take his position.  He was allowed to grow old in office, and died on November 10, 1982 at the age of 75.  He was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, then Konstantin Chernenko, both of whom ruled for only around a year, and had little real impact on the Soviet Union. Both were very physically unhealthy, died soon after being in office, and Chernenko was succeeded by the reformist Mikhail Gorbachev.

===Mikhail Gorbachev (1985-1991)===

[[Image:Mikhail Gorbachev 1987.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.]]

With the Soviet Union on the verge of economic collapse, a young, vigorous, and creative General Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power.  Gorbachev created the policy of ''Glasnost'', or &quot;Openness,&quot; which allowed criticism (albeit limited) of the system, examination of past mistakes, rehabilitated victims of the purge, and changed textbooks in the nation.

He also implemented ''Perestroika'', or &quot;Economic Restructuring.&quot;  He decentralized the economy, offered incentives to managers for increased production and quality and allowed them to make more decisions, introduced elements of &quot;working place democracy&quot;, and allowed peasants to lease their own land.

However, these economic policies actually failed, and the situation became increasingly worse.  The Soviet Union encountered massive problems in the 1990s, including alcoholism, divorce, a high abortion rate, low life expectancy, and no consumer goods.

====Revolutions of 1988-1990====
In 1988 Lithuanian liberation movement - Sajudis, Latvian - Tautas fronte, Estonian - Rahvarinne were created and soon they started struggle for independence of the Baltic states.

In 1989, a number of Eastern bloc states began to revolt against Soviet authority.

The spark of it all occurred in 1989, when declining conditions in Poland forced Poland to legalize Lech Walesa's &quot;Solidarity&quot; Party.  The party won control of the government in a landslide election.  Gorbachev then told the Eastern Bloc satellite states that he cannot enforce the Brezhnev Doctrine.  As a result, other nations followed Poland's lead.  Hungary held elections, relaxed economic controls, and opened its door to the West.  The Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian communist governments collapsed without bloodshed in what has become known as the &quot;Velvet Revolution.&quot;  In East Germany, Germans flooded to Hungary and then to the West.  The Communist leader of East Germany, Honecker, was forced to step down, and the Berlin wall was torn down on November 9, 1989.  In Romania, Nicolae Ceauşescu, a brutal Stalinist dictator, was executed on December 25th 1989. Ceauşescu was the only leader to be executed during the Eastern Bloc uprising and Romania itself the only country to violently overthrow its Communist regime.

====The Break Up Of The Soviet Union====

The failure of Glasnost and Perestroika to revive the situation in the Soviet Union resulted in its demise.

In 1989, the first competitive elections since 1917 were held for the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.  Boris Yeltsin was elected and became a leader of the opposition in the U.S.S.R.  In 1990, other parties became officially tolerated, and in June 1991 Yeltsin was elected President of Russia.  On August 19 - 21, 1991, a coup of communist hard-liners occurred while Gorbachev was in the Crimea.  Yeltsin led non-violent resistance to the coup, which ultimately prevailed and saw all the coup leaders arrested or commit suicide.  On August 24, 1991, the Communist Party was banned in Russia.  December 31, 1991, the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist and was replaced with 15 independent states.

==George I (1714-1727)==
[[Image:GeorgeIGreatBritain.jpg|150px|thumb|right|George I]]
George I was born in Hanover, Germany on 28 May 1660. He was the eldest son of Ernst August, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, a German prince, and of his wife, Sophia. He was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg from 23 January 1698, and King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 1 August 1714, until his death on 11 June 1727. He was also a Prince Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. George I was the first Hanoverian monarch of Great Britain and Ireland, but was not a fluent speaker of English. He spoke his native German, and was ridiculed for this by his British subjects. During his reign, the powers of the monarchy reduced as the modern Cabinet system of government developed. During the later years of George's reign, the real power was held by Sir Robert Walpole, who is now generally thought of as being Britain's first prime minister.

===Marriage and children===

In 1682, George married his first cousin, Princess Sophia of Celle. They had two children, George and Sophia Dorothea. The couple soon split up, with George preferring to be with his mistress, with whom he had at least three illegitimate children. George's marriage to Sophia was later dissolved.

===Reign===

George I was active in directing British foreign policy during his early years. In 1717, he contributed to the creation of the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. In 1718, the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body, which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent War of the Quadruple Alliance involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht had allowed Philip, the grandson of Louis XIV, to succeed to the Spanish Throne on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French Throne. However, when Louis XIV died, Philip tried to take the Crown of France. But Philip's armies fared poorly, and the Spanish and French Thrones remained separate.

In 1719 came the South Sea Bubble. It happened when the South Sea Company proposed to convert £30,981,712 of the British national debt. At the time, government bonds were extremely difficult to trade due to unrealistic restrictions; for example, it was not permitted to redeem certain bonds unless the original debtor was still alive. Each bond represented a very large sum, and could not be divided and sold. Thus, the South Sea Company sought to convert high-interest, untradeable bonds to low-interest, easily-tradeable ones. The Company bribed ministers to help them. Company prices rose rapidly. Shares which cost £128 in January 1720 were valued at £550 when Parliament accepted the scheme in May. The price reached £1000 by August. Uncontrolled selling, however, caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many people were completely ruined.

The economic crisis, known as the South Sea Bubble, made George I and his ministers extremely unpopular. One of the responsible ministers died, and the other resigned in 1721, which allowed the rise of Sir Robert Walpole. Walpole became George's primary minister, although the title &quot;Prime Minister&quot; was not formally applied to him. Officially, he was only the First Lord of the Treasury. His management of the South Sea crisis helped avoid a dispute between the King and the House of Commons over responsibility for the affair. Walpole strengthened his influence in the House of Commons through bribery.

Walpole became extremely powerful. He, not the King, truly controlled the government. Walpole was allowed to choose and remove all ministers, and George I merely rubber-stamped his decisions. George I did not even attend meetings of the Cabinet. George I only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy.

===Death and legacy===

George, although increasingly reliant on Sir Robert Walpole, could still have removed his ministers at will. Walpole was actually afraid of being removed towards the end of George I's reign, but such fears were put to an end when George I died in Osnabrück from a stroke on 11 June 1727. George was on his sixth trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried in Chapel Schloss Herrenhausen. George I's son succeeded him, becoming George II.

George I was extremely unpopular in Great Britain, especially due to his supposed inability to speak English; recent research, however, reveals that such an inability may not have existed later in his reign.  His treatment of his wife, Sophia, was not well received. The British perceived him as too German, and despised his succession of German mistresses.

==George II (1727-1760)==
[[Image:George ii england.jpg|150px|thumb|right|George II]]
George II was born at Schloss Herrenhausen, Hanover on 10 November 1683. He was King of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 until his death on 25 October 1760. He was the second British monarch of the House of Hanover, and the last British monarch to personally lead his troops into battle (at Dettingen in 1743). He was also the last British monarch to have been born outside of Great Britain. George II was famous for his numerous conflicts with his father and afterwards with his son. His relationship with his wife was much better, despite his numerous mistresses. George II exercised little control over policy during his early reign, the government instead being controlled by Great Britain's first (unofficial) &quot;Prime Minister&quot;, Sir Robert Walpole.

===Reign===

It was widely believed that George would dismiss Sir Robert Walpole, but in the event retained him. Against Walpole's advice, George II once again entered into war with Spain in 1739 (the War of Jenkins' Ear). The entire continent of Europe was plunged into war upon the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. At dispute was the right of his daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian territories. George II's war with Spain quickly became part of the War of the Austrian Succession.

Accused of rigging an election, Walpole retired in 1742 after over twenty years in office. He was replaced by Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington. Lord Wilmington, however, was a figurehead as actual power was held by Lord Carteret. When Lord Wilmington died in 1743, Henry Pelham took his place.

George II's French opponents in the War encouraged rebellion by the Jacobites. The Jacobites were the supporters of the Roman Catholic James II, who had been deposed in 1689 and replaced not by his Catholic son, but by his Protestant daughter. James II's son, James Francis Edward Stuart (the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;) had attempted two prior rebellions. The Old Pretender's son, Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;), however, led a much stronger rebellion on his father's behalf in 1745, which almost dethroned George II.

Bonnie Prince Charlie landed in Scotland in July 1745. Many Scotsmen were loyal to his cause, and he defeated British forces in September. He then tried to enter England, where even Roman Catholics seemed hostile to the invasion. The French king, Louis XV, had promised to send twelve thousand soldiers to aid the rebellion, but did not deliver. A British army under the Duke of Cumberland, meanwhile, drove the Jacobites back into Scotland. On 16 April 1746, Bonnie Prince Charlie faced the Duke of Cumberland in the Battle of Culloden, the last battle ever fought in Great Britain. The Jacobites were beaten heavily. Bonnie Prince Charlie escaped to France, but many of his Scottish supporters were caught and executed. The War of the Austrian Succession finally ended in 1748, with Maria Theresa being recognised as Archduchess of Austria.

For the remainder of his life, George did not take any active interest in politics or war. During his last years, the Industrial Revolution began, and British dominance in India increased with the victories of Robert Clive at the Battle of Arcot and the Battle of Plassey.

===Death===

George II died on 25 October 1760 whilst using his toilet. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. George had  married Caroline of Ansbach in 1705. Their first son was Frederick, Prince of Wales who was born on 1 February 1707, but Frederick died before his father in 1751, and so it was Frederick's son George who became the next king. They also had two other sons and five daughters. He was succeeded by his grandson, who became George III.

==George III (1760-1820)==
[[Image:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|160px|thumb|right|George III]]
George III was born at Norfolk House in London on 4 June 1738. He was the son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the grandson of George II. George's mother was Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. He was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 to 1 January 1801, and then King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death on 29 January 1820. He was also the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Elector (and later King) of Hanover. George was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but the first to be born in Britain and use English as his first language.

During George III's reign, Britain lost many of its colonies in North America, which became the United States. Later in his reign George III suffered from mental illness. In 1811, this led to George's eldest son, who was also named George, taking over ruling the country as Prince Regent. Upon the king's death, he succeeded his father as George IV. George III has been nicknamed ''Farmer George'', for &quot;his plain, homely, thrifty manners and tastes&quot; and because of his passionate interest in agriculture.

===Marriage and children===

After George became king, there a search throughout Europe for a suitable wife for him. On 8 September 1761 the King married Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. A fortnight later, both were crowned at Westminster Abbey. The couple enjoyed a happy marriage and George never took a mistress. They had nine sons and six daughters. Two of their sons became Kings of the United Kingdom; another became King of Hanover; a daughter became Queen of Württemberg.

===Conflict in North America===

In 1763, the British government under George III issued a Royal Proclamation to limit the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation's goal was to force colonists to negotiate with the Native Americans for the lawful purchase of land. The idea was to reduce frontier warfare over land conflicts. The Proclamation was very unpopular with the American. The American colonists paid little tax, which made it difficult for the Crown to pay for military activity, such as defending the American colonies from being attacked by the natives. So, after George Grenville became Prime Minister, he introduced the Stamp Act 1765, which levied a stamp duty on all printed paper in the British colonies in North America. Grenville attempted to reduce George's power, so George replaced him with the 2nd Marquess of Rockingham in 1765.

Lord Rockingham got rid of Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but was replaced in 1766 by William Pitt, whom George made Earl of Chatham. Lord Chatham proved to be pro-American. George III, however, decided that the chief duty of the colonists was to submit to him and to Great Britain. Lord Chatham fell ill 1767, which led to his being replaced, and by 1770 the Tory Lord North was in government.

Lord North was chiefly concerned with the American Revolution. The Americans grew increasingly hostile to British attempts to levy taxes in the colonies. In the Boston Tea Party in 1773, a mob threw 342 crates of tea into Boston Harbour as a political protest, costing over $1 million. In response, Lord North introduced laws which shut down the Port of Boston and elections in the Colony of Massachusetts Bay were suspended.

War broke out in America in 1775. On 4 July 1776, the colonies declared their independence from the Crown. On the same day, George III wrote &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot; in his diary. In 1783, defeated, the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Paris recognizing the United States.

===George's first major episode of madness===

When North finally resigned, William Pitt took his place. During Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular. The public supported the exploratory voyages to the Pacific Ocean that he sanctioned. George also aided the Royal Academy with large grants from his private funds. The British people admired their King for remaining faithful to his wife, unlike the two previous Hanoverian monarchs. Great advances were made in fields such as in science and industry.

George III's health, however, was in a poor condition. He suffered from mental illness. The King had previously suffered a brief episode of the disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in 1788. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as Prince Regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons. But before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered from his illness and resumed full control of government.

===Napoleonic Wars===

After George recovered from his illness, his popularity greatly increased. The French Revolution, which saw the overthrow of the French monarchy, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793 and George soon represented the British resistance. George allowed Pitt to increase taxes and raise armies in the war attempt. Great Britain was well-prepared, but France was stronger. The First Coalition, which included Austria, Prussia and Spain, was defeated in 1798. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the military dictator of France.

Soon after 1800, a brief lull in fighting allowed Pitt to concentrate on Ireland, where there had been an uprising in 1798. Parliament passed the Act of Union 1800, which, on 1 January 1801, united Great Britain and Ireland into a single nation, known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1802, Pitt's successor, Henry Addington made peace with France in 1802.

In 1803, the two nations once again declared war on each other, and soon after, Pitt returned. Pitt tried to form a coalition with Austria, Russia and Sweden. The Third Coalition met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, and collapsed in 1805. It looked as though Napoleon would invade, until Vice-Admiral Nelson won his famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar. Pitt died in 1806.

===Later years and death===

In 1810, George III became dangerously ill.  By 1811, George III had become permanently insane and was locked away at Windsor Castle until his death. Sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, he claimed to talk to angels and once greeted an oak tree as King Frederick William III of Prussia. Parliament then passed the Regency Act 1811. The Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III's life.

Lord Liverpool became the leader of the government in 1812. He oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. Over the Christmas of 1819, he suffered a further bout of madness and spoke nonsense for 58 hours, then sank into a coma. On 29 January 1820, he died, blind, deaf and insane, at Windsor Castle. George III had lived for over 81 years and reigned for more than 59 years. George III was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor. George was followed by his eldest son, the Prince Regent, who became George IV.

==George IV (1820-1830)==
[[Image:George IV of the United Kingdom.jpg|150px|thumb|right|George IV]]
George IV was born in St James's Palace on 12 August 1762. George was the eldest son of George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He was king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Hanover from 29 January 1820 until his death on 26 June 1830. He had earlier served as Prince Regent when his father, George III, went insane. The Regency, which is the name given to this period, started in 1811 and ended with George III's death in 1820. It was marked by victory in the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. George was a stubborn monarch, often interfered in politics. For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool controlled the government as Prime Minister. George is often remembered largely for the extravagant lifestyle that he maintained as prince and monarch. He had a poor relationship with both his father and his wife, Caroline of Brunswick, whom he did not allow to attend his coronation. He was a patron of new forms of leisured style and taste, and was responsible for the building of the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.

===Early life===

As a child George was a talented student, quickly learning to speak not only English but also French, German and Italian. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, when he obtained a grant of £60,000 from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 from his father. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived an extravagant life.

===Marriage and children===

Soon after he reached the age of 21, the Prince of Wales fell in love with a Roman Catholic, Maria Anne Fitzherbert. A marriage between the two was banned by the Act of Settlement 1701, which says that those who marry Roman Catholics cannot become king. In addition, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 meant that the Prince of Wales could not marry without the consent of the King, which would have never been granted in this case. However, the couple did go through a marriage ceremony on 15 December 1785. Legally the union was void, as the King's assent was never requested. However, Mrs Fitzherbert believed that she was the Prince of Wales's canonical and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Mrs Fitzherbert promised not to publish any evidence relating to it.

By 1787, George was in debt because of his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to help him, amd Parliament had to bail him out. His debts continued to mount, and his father refused to help him unless he married his cousin, Caroline of Brunswick. In 1795, George and Caroline married. The marriage was a disaster though, with both hating each other. The two were formally separated after the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796. George remained attached to Mrs Fitzherbert for the rest of his life, although there were some times when they were apart. George also fathered numerous illegitimate children.

Meanwhile, the problem of George's debts, which were £660,000 in 1796, was solved (at least temporarily) by Parliament. Being unwilling to make an outright grant to relieve these debts, it provided him an additional sum of £65,000 per annum. In 1803, a further £60,000 was added, and the George's debts were finally paid.

===Regency===

As we saw earlier, in late 1810, George III became ill again, and in 1811 the Regency Act was passed, which made Prince George regent. At this time Catholic Emancipation was at the top of the political agenda. Catholic Emancipation was the project to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, who were in government, opposed it, whilst the Whigs supported it. George was expected to support the Whigs, but instead left the Tories in office. In 1812, when the Tory prime minister, Spencer Perceval, was assassinated, he appointed another Tory, Lord Liverpool to carry on the government. The Tories also sought to continue the war against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of France, Napoleon I. With the aid of Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Austria and other countries, the United Kingdom defeated Napoleon in 1814. Napoleon made a return in 1815, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the Duke of Wellington.

During this period George as Regent took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy Beau Brummell and the architect John Nash created the Regency style. In London Nash designed the Regency terraces of Regent's Park and Regent Street. George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the Brighton Pavilion developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the &quot;Indian Gothic&quot; style inspired loosely by the Taj Mahal, with extravagant &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot; interiors.

===Reign===

When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent became King George IV, with no real change in his powers. By this time he was obese and also showed some signs of the disease that had affected his father. George's wife, from whom he had separated many years before, tried to return for her husband's coronation. However, George IV refused to recognise Caroline as Queen. The King wanted a divorce, but his advisors said that the king's own adultery might also be made public if he did. George tried to get an Act of Parliament to annul the marriage, but the bill proved extremely unpopular, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey on 19 July 1821. Caroline died soon afterwards, on 7 August of the same year.

George's coronation was a magnificent and expensive affair, costing about £943,000. The coronation was a popular event. Many across the nation bought souvenirs that bore copies of the coronation portrait. In 1822 the King visited Edinburgh for &quot;one and twenty daft days&quot;. His visit to Scotland was the first by a reigning monarch since Charles II went there in 1650.

George IV spent most of his reign at Windsor Castle, but he continued to interfere in politics, particularly to try to prevent Catholic Emancipation. It was only in 1829 that the then prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, successfully passed a Catholic Relief Bill.

===Death and legacy===

George IV died in 1830 and was buried in Windsor Castle. As his daughter and his eldest brother had died before him, he was succeeded his brother, William, Duke of Clarence.

==William IV (1830-1837)==
[[Image:Prince_William,_Duke_of_Clarence_and_St_Andrews_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_13899.png|150px|thumb|right|William IV]]
William IV was born at Buckingham Palace, which was then known as Buckingham House, on 21 August 1765. He was the son of George III and Queen Charlotte. He had two elder brothers, George and Frederick, and was not expected to inherit the Crown, but he did. He was King of the United Kingdom and of Hanover from 26 June 1830 until his death on 20 June 1837. His reign was one of several reforms. The poor law was updated, municipal government was made democratic, child labour was restricted and slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire. Also the Reform Act of 1832 refashioned the British electoral system. William did not meddle in politics as much as either his brother or his father, though he did prove to be the last monarch to appoint a Prime Minister contrary to the will of Parliament, which he did in 1834. 

===Early life===

At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780. He served in New York during the American War of Independence. He became a lieutenant in 1785 and a captain the following year. In 1786, he was stationed in the West Indies. William sought to be made a Duke like his elder brothers, and to receive a similar Parliamentary grant, but his father was reluctant. To put pressure on him, William threatened to run for the House of Commons for the constituency of Totnes in Devon. Defeated, George III made him Duke of Clarence and St Andrews in 1789.

The newly created Duke ended his active service in the Royal Navy in 1790. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral upon retirement. When the United Kingdom declared war on France in 1793, he was eager to serve his country, but was not put in command of a ship, but instead he spent time in the House of Lords. There he spoke in favour of slavery (which, although it had virtually died out in the United Kingdom, still existed in the British colonies), and he used his experience in the West Indies to defend his positions.

After he left the Royal Navy, William had a long affair with an Irish actress, Dorothea Bland, better known by her stage name, Mrs Jordan. From 1791, the couple had at least ten illegitimate children. The affair would last for twenty years before ending in 1811 for political reasons. The same year, William was appointed Admiral of the Fleet. On 13 July 1818, he married Princess Adelaide, daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, a woman half his age. William only had two short-lived children by his wife.

In 1827, George IV appointed William to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, Clarence attempted to take independent control of naval affairs, although the law required him to act, under most circumstances, on the advice of at least two members of his Council. The King requested his resignation in 1828.

===The Reform Crisis===

When George IV died in 1830, William became king. He was aged 64, which makes him the oldest man ever to assume the throne. In contrast to George IV, who tended to spend most of his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton.  Until the Reform Crisis, he was very popular among the people.

At the beginning of William IV's reign, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister. During the general election of 1830, however, Wellington's Tories lost to the Whig Party under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey. When he became Prime Minister, Lord Grey immediately announced that he would try to reform an electoral system that had seen few changes since the 15th century. The existing system had many problems great. For example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members, whilst minuscule boroughs such as Old Sarum (with seven voters) elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the small boroughs, also known as rotten boroughs and pocket boroughs, were &quot;owned&quot; by great aristocrats, whose &quot;nominees&quot; would invariably be elected by the constituents.

William IV played an important role in the Reform Crisis. When the House of Commons defeated the First Reform Bill in 1831, Lord Grey wanted to call a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise the power to dissolve Parliament, but after the Opposition annoyed him, he personally went to the House of Lords and dissolved Parliament. This forced a new election for the House of Commons, which Grey won, but the House of Lords continued to oppose the Reform Bill. This led to several &quot;Reform Riots&quot;. The nation saw a political crisis greater than any since the Glorious Revolution in 1688.

Grey re-introduced the Bill. It passed easily in the House of Commons, but was once again faced with difficulties in the House of Lords. Bowing to popular pressure, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but instead changed its basic character through amendments. Grey did not like this so he suggested that the King &quot;swamp&quot; the House of Lords by creating a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. When William IV refused, as he did not want a permanently expanded Peerage, Grey and his fellow ministers resigned. The King tried to get the Duke of Wellington as prime minister again, but first heard of an official resolution of the House of Commons requesting Grey's return. After this the King agreed to reappoint Grey, and also agreed to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. With this threat in place, the House of Lords agreed to pass the Reform Act 1832. Parliament went on to make other reforms, including the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire and the restriction of child labour.

===Death===

William IV died in 1837 in Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to his eighteen-year-old niece, HRH Princess Victoria of Kent. Under what is known as Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover, so the Hanoverian Crown went to William IV's brother, HRH Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland.

==Victoria (1837-1901)==
[[Image:Queen_Victoria_1887.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Victoria]]
Victoria was born on 24 May 1819. She was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 and Empress of India from 1 January 1877 until her death on 22 January 1901. Her reign lasted more than sixty-three years, longer than that of any other British monarch. The reign of Victoria was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. The Victorian Era was at the height of the Industrial Revolution, a period of significant social, economic and technological change in the United Kingdom. In that period the United Kingdom became the largest superpower the world had ever seen. Victoria was the last monarch of the House of Hanover, as her son and successor belonged to House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

===Early life===

Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent and Strathearn, was the fourth son of King George III. The Duke of Kent and Strathearn, like many other sons of George III, did not marry during his youth. At the age of fifty the Duke of Kent and Strathearn married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Victoria, the only child of the couple, was born in Kensington Palace. Although christened Alexandrina Victoria, was called Drina within the family. 

Victoria's father died of pneumonia eight months after she was born. Her grandfather, George III, died blind and insane less than a week later. Victoria's uncle inherited the Crown, becoming King George IV. Though she occupied a high position in the line of succession, Victoria was taught only German, the first language of both her mother and her governess, during her early years. After reaching the age of three, however, she was schooled in English. She eventually learned to speak Italian, Greek, Latin and French. When Victoria was eleven years old, her uncle, King George IV, died childless, leaving the throne to his brother, who became King William IV. As the new king had no living legitimate children, the young Princess Victoria became the heir to the throne.

===Marriage and children===

Princess Victoria met her future husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, when she was sixteen years old. Prince Albert was Victoria's first cousin, his father being the brother of her mother. William IV disapproved of the match, but he did not stop the couple. The Queen married Prince Albert on 10 February 1840. Prince Albert was commonly known as the '''Prince Consort''', though he did not formally obtain the title until 1857. The first child of the royal couple, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. They had eight more children during what was a very happy marriage.

===Early Victorian politics===

In the 1840s, the prime minister, Robert Peel, faced a crisis involving the abolition of the Corn Laws, which imposed import duty on grain. Many Tories (by then known also Conservatives) were opposed to the abolition, but some Tories (the &quot;Peelites&quot;) and most Whigs supported it. Peel resigned in 1846, after the Corn Laws did get abolished. He was replaced by the Whig Lord John Russell. Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen.

In 1845, Ireland was hit by a potato blight that over four years cost the lives of over one million Irish people and saw the emigration of another million. This disaster is now known as the Irish Potato Famine. In 1851, the Great Exhibition of 1851 was held. Organised by Prince Albert, the exhibition was officially opened by the Queen on 1 May. It proved an incredible success, with its profits being used to start up the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The United Kingdom join the Crimean War in 1854, on the side of the Ottoman Empire and against Russia. It was after this war that Victoria instituted the Victoria Cross, an award for valour.

===Widowhood===

The Prince Consort died in 1861. Victoria, who was devoted to him, went into a semi-permanent state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances and rarely set foot inside London. Afterwards Victoria had a small number of male favourites. These include a Scottish manservant, John Brown. Some even suggest that she secretly married him. Victoria's isolation reduced her popularity, and even encouraged the growth of the republican movement. Although she did perform her official duties, she did not actively participate in the government, remaining secluded in her royal residences. 

Meanwhile, one of the most important pieces of legislation of the nineteenth century, the Reform Act 1867, was passed by Parliament. Lord Palmerston was opposed to electoral reform, but he died in 1865. The new prime minister was Lord Russell, and was in turn followed by Lord Derby, during whose premiership the Reform Act was passed.

===Gladstone and Disraeli===

In 1868, the Conservative Benjamin Disraeli became prime minister. In time he became Victoria's favourite prime minister. However, he was soon replaced by William Gladstone. Gladstone was famously at odds with both Victoria and Disraeli during his political career. She once remarked that she felt he addressed her as though she were a public meeting. It was during Gladstone's ministry, in the early 1870s, that the Queen began to gradually emerge from a state of perpetual mourning and isolation. With the encouragement of her family, she became more active.

In 1876 Parliament gave the Queen the additional title &quot;Empress of India&quot;. Disraeli's period as prime minister ended in 1880 when the Liberals won a general election, and Gladstone became prime minister again.

Victoria's battles with Gladstone continued during her later years. She was forced to accept his proposed electoral reforms, including the Representation of the People Act 1884, which considerably increased the electorate. Gladstone's government fell in 1885, to be replaced by the ministry of a Conservative, Lord Salisbury. Gladstone returned to power in 1886, and he introduced the Irish Home Rule Bill, which sought to create a separate Irish parliament. Victoria was opposed to the bill, which she believed would undermine the British Empire. When the bill was rejected by the House of Commons, Gladstone resigned, allowing Victoria to re-appoint Lord Salisbury as prime minister.

=== Later years ===

1887 saw Victoria's Golden Jubilee. She had a banquet, to which fifty European kings and princes were invited. The day after there was a large procession through London that was supported by many wellwishers.

Gladstone became prime minister again in 1892. After the last of his Irish Home Rule Bills was defeated, he retired in 1894, to be replaced by the Lord Rosebery. Lord Rosebery was succeeded in 1895 by Lord Salisbury, who served for the rest of Victoria's reign.

On 22 September 1896 became the longest-reigning monarch in British history. At the Queen's request, all special public celebrations of the event were delayed until 1897, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, proposed that the Jubilee be made a festival of the British Empire. Thus, the Prime Ministers of all the self-governing colonies were invited along with their families. The procession, in which the Queen participated, included troops from each British colony and dependency, together with soldiers sent by Indian Princes and Chiefs (who were subordinate to Victoria, the Empress of India). The Diamond Jubilee celebration was an occasion marked by great outpourings of affection for the Queen, who was by then confined to a wheelchair.

During Victoria's last years, the United Kingdom was involved in the Second Boer War, which received the enthusiastic support of the Queen. Her last ceremonial public function came in 1899, when she laid the foundation stone for new buildings of the South Kensington Museum, which became known as the Victoria and Albert Museum.

===Assassination attempts===

Throughout her reign, there were a number of attempts on Victoria's life. During Victoria's first pregnancy, eighteen-year old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate the Queen whilst she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert in London. Oxford fired twice, but both bullets missed. He was tried for high treason, but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. Three attempts to assassinate the Queen occurred in 1842. In 1849, an unemployed Irishman tried to alarm the Queen by firing a powder-filled pistol as her carriage passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen was injured when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-Army officer. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, she was struck by a cane, which crushed her bonnet and bruised her. In 1872, when Victoria was getting off a carriage, a seventeen-year old Irishman rushed towards her with an (unloaded) pistol in one hand and a petition to free Irish prisoners in the other. Then in 1882 a Scottish madman fired a bullet towards the Queen, who was seated in her carriage, but missed. Finally, at the time of her Golden Jubilee in 1887, there was a plan by Irish terrorists to blow up Westminster Abbey while the Queen attended a service of thanksgiving. This assassination attempt was discovered and became known as The Jubilee Plot.

===Death===

Victoria's death was to be a peaceful and natural one. Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood, Victoria spent Christmas in Osborne House (which Prince Albert had designed himself) on the Isle of Wight. She died there on 22 January 1901, aged 81, having reigned for sixty-three years, seven months and two days (more than any British monarch before or since). She was buried in the Frogmore Mausoleum beside her husband. Victoria was succeeded by her eldest son, the Prince of Wales, who reigned as King Edward VII. Victoria's death brought an end to the rule of the House of Hanover in the United Kingdom. King Edward VII, like his father Prince Albert, belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====What can QBasic do in the way of Graphics====
QBasic is not that much graphically good, however many good programs can be created with it. Commands like PSET, CIRCLE, LINE, etc., are used to draw graphics in Qbasic.
One of the good programs created using QBasic is '''SYMMETRIC ICON''' and '''SYMMETRIC FRACTALS'''.
====The PSET Command====
The PSET command lets the programmer display pixels on the screen. Before you type the command in, you must make sure that a SCREEN command is in. Look at this example:
 SCREEN 13
 PSET (80,20), 4
This command will display one red pixel at the coordinates 80, 20. The coordinates are X and Y coordinates, like any other mathematical situation. So the PSET command has to have this layout to function properly:
 PSET ([X coordinate], [Y coordinate]), [Colour of Pixel]
Remember that X coordinates are those that go left to right on the screen and Y coordinates are those that go Up to Down on the screen.
====The LINE Command====
This simple command displays a line. It can be in a command like this:
 SCREEN 13
 LINE (16, 24) - (40, 30), 1
This simple program will input a line on the screen. For an  in depth knowledge of what the numbers mean, look at this layout:
 LINE ([X 1], [Y 1]) - ([X 2], [Y 2]), [Colour Number]
 '1 Being the start of the Line
 '2 Being the End of the line
Like the PSET command you MUST put a SCREEN command.

====The CIRCLE Command====
 CIRCLE (20, 25), 5, 1
This displays a circle at the coordinates. The layout of the function is as follows:
 CIRCLE ([X Coordinate], [Y Coordinate]), [Radius], [Colour Number]
Remember to put a SCREEN command at the front.
====The PAINT command====
To use PAINT, there must be a SCREEN command declared. The command has coordinates that tells QBasic where to start. The color number specifies the color to paint with, and the bordercolor tells the PAINT command that it should not paint further when it encounters a pixel of that color. In almost all cases, you will need to use the bordercolor parameter, simply because without it, PAINT will cover the entire screen.
 PAINT ([X Coordinate],[Y Coordinate]), [Color Number], [Border Color]1,2,3,4,5,5

====Making An Image Using the DATA command====
Graphics using this command can either be made by using a Graphics Editor or by using the DATA command Manually. The DATA command is a way of inputting information into QBasic and being read by the READ command. Remember that the DATA command cannot be used in subroutines or functions. Look at this example:
 SCREEN 7
 FOR y = 1 TO 10
 FOR x = 1 TO 10
 READ z
 PSET (x, y), z
 NEXT
 NEXT
 DATA 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 04
 DATA 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04, 04
The FOR commands declare the amount of pixels there are to be read. On this particular program, there are pixels of 10 by 10 (100) so we put:
 FOR x = 1 TO 10
 FOR y = 1 TO 10
We have now declared the x and y planes. You can change these values if you want a smaller or bigger picture Bitmap.
The READ command reads the DATA commands and declares the information gathered as z.
 READ z
The PSET reads the planes and the DATA read and a bitmap.
 PSET (x, y), z
It works like the first example on this page, except it is reading more than one pixels

      <text xml:space="preserve">Create a new xslt extension like umbraco.library in C#.

Sometimes you need more functionality in your xslt, and most of the time umbraco.Library is enough. But what do you do if that isn’t enough?

There are 2 ways to create your own functions 

1. Inline code.
2. xslt extension

My opinions.

'''Inline code.'''&lt;br&gt;
Inline code get my xslt look messy, and are difficult to reuse, but works fine if you only need a single function. More info about inline code can be found [http://umbraco.org/frontpage/documentation/articles/sampleofthemonth.aspx here]

'''xslt extension.'''&lt;br&gt;
xslt extension on the other hand looks much cleaner, and is easy to re/use again.

Step by Step
Ill go through it step by step

1. Create a class library, in my case “ronnie.library”.&lt;br&gt;
2. Create your class/es that you need. In my case “dateMethods.cs”&lt;br&gt;
3. Create the methods you need (remember the methods have to be public and static)
&lt;nowiki&gt;e.g.&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
   public static int ugeNummer(DateTime dato)
   {
   string res;
   res = Microsoft.VisualBasic.DateAndTime.DatePart(Microsoft.VisualBasic.DateInterval.WeekOfYear, dato,       
   Microsoft.VisualBasic.FirstDayOfWeek.Monday, Microsoft.VisualBasic.FirstWeekOfYear.System).ToString(); 
   return Int32.Parse(res); 
   }
&lt;br&gt;
4. When you are done creating the methods, build and copy the dll in my case “ronnie.library.dll” into the bin folder.

5. Now you just have to register your xslt extension, and this is done in xsltExtensions.xml (placed in the config folder). 

6. Open the file and add the following line. Note that starting with Umbraco 4.5, /bin/ is not needed anymore!

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;ext assembly=&quot;/bin/ronnie.library&quot; type=&quot;ronnie.dateMethods&quot; alias=&quot;CoolDateMethods&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

;Assembly : here you type where you have placed your dll file, (without the .dll extension)
;type : &quot;.NET_namespace.ClassName” Here you have to write the namespace  followed by a dot and the class you want to use.
;alias : This is your xmlns like umbraco.Library, call it what you like. In my case CoolDateMethods


7. Last but not least you have to remember to add the xmlns in your xslt document; this is done like this:
 xmlns:CoolDateMethods =&quot;urn:CoolDateMethods&quot;
 exclude-result-prefixes=&quot;msxml umbraco.library CoolDateMethods


Now you should be ready to use your new xslt extension.
Hope this quick’n dirty article was informative for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is an e-Portfolio:
An e-portfolio is a web – based information management system that uses electronic media and services. Through the e-portfolio the learner builds and maintains a digital repository of artefacts, which they can use to demonstrate competence and reflect on their learning.
In other words it is an electronic format for learners to record their work, their achievements and their goals and to reflect on their learning. It enables learners to take the information with them as they move between institutions and can enable a greater understanding of their individual growth, career planning and CV building.
It is important for learners to take ownership of their learning, and to continually reflect on their current learning, their past learning and achievements and future aims and learning needs. The concept of e-portfolios is not new, and they are currently already being used in informal ways. Many students already produce portfolios for various uses, such as reflection, communication with instructors, or presenting examples of outstanding work and credentials to potential employers.

Types of e-Portfolio
e-Portfolios can be categorised in to three main types although these may be mixed to achieve different learning, personal or work-related outcomes. They can be Developmental, as a record of things that the learner has done over a period of time, Reflective, and include personal reflection on the content and what it means for the learners development or Representational and show the learners achievements in relation to particular work or developmental goals and therefore, can be selective.
E-portfolios offer many benefits for learners but also there can be a number of drawbacks and issues.

Benefits
Helping learners take control of their learning and their lives, by reflecting on their activities and planning future directions is considered a significant benefit. Also providing a learner-centred view of learning is important. The e-Portfolio is effective in providing views of achievement and learners work for appropriate people, for example, the learner, teachers, mentors, careers advisers, potential employers, educational institutions to whom the learner is applying. The e-Portfolio can also facilitate a wider variety and more authentic forms of assessment and accreditation.

Issues
E-portfolios can include a wide range of information from personal information, education history, assessments and certificates to future plan and targets and personal and leisure interests, however, there are a number of concerns which, in addition to ownership issues and institutions developing neutral portfolios, include some significant legal issues such as data protection, intellectual property rights and access and inclusion issues.

From [http://www.rtk-cv.dk/projects/umbraco-cms.aspx http://www.rtk-cv.dk/projects/umbraco-cms.aspx] you can download a foldout menu

The readme

1. Copy tree.js into your root dir

2. Copy minus.gif and plus.gif into /images/

3. Go to Umbraco developer section and create a macro and xslt node.

4. Paste in the Menu.xslt code into your new xslt node

5. Insert the macro in your template and it should work

end of readme

Note. Inside the xslt You need to change 1045 to your the topnode id? The node id is where the Menu should start. You can find the ID, by holding the mouse over the node in umbraco, and looking in your browsers status-line. You should see javascript:openContent(1045), where 1045 is the node-id. You can also look it up in your database, in the table cmsDocument

Also to inlcude the tree.js file to your &lt;header&gt;. 
and at last add a doc.gif file to images

      <text xml:space="preserve">according to a British Historian of India

----

&quot;We have been told through Indian as well as foreign literary sources that in ancient times, commodities like sugar, palm oil, coconut oil, cotton cloth, clarified butter, cast iron, tin sheets, copper vessels, dyes and pigments like cinnabar (ochre), indigo and lac, perfumes like sandalwood oil, musk tamarind, costus, macir, camphor, and even crude glass crockery were being exported from India.&quot;(The Periplus of the Erythrean Sea - Travels and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant in the First Century, Translated from the Greek and Annoted by Wilfred H. Schoff, Longmans Green and Co. New York, 1912)

These items are not gifts of nature, their manufacture involves processing to effect chemical changes in their properties notably in the case of sugar, glass, metals and perfumes. Thus some kind of chemical engineering must have existed in India in those times i.e. about 2000 to 2500 years ago. Along with this chemical processing, some physical apparatus would have been used. This presumes the existence of at least a rudimentary knowledge that in today's terminology would be called 'mechanical engineering'.

The earliest recorded use of copperware in India was around 3000 B.C.  The findings at Mohen-jo-daro and Harappa bear this out.  The earliest documented observation of smelting of metals in India is by Greek Historians in the 4th Century B.C.  No doubt, the chemical and mechanical engineering would have been very rudimentary by today's standards but nevertheless it would have been chemical and mechanical engineering of some standard as is evident from the following references about the quality of Indian products in foreign literature of those times. 

When referring to India, the author of the Greek text Periplus, which is dated around the 1st century A.D. has said, &quot;There is a river near it called the Ganges&quot; .... &quot;On its bank is a market town which has the same name as the river, Ganges. Through this place are brought malabathrum and Gangetic spikenard and pearls and muslins of the finest sorts, which are called Gangetic. It is said that there are gold mines near these places, and there is a gold coin which is called caltis. And just opposite this river there is an island in the ocean, the last part of the inhabited world towards the east, under the rising sun itself, it is called Chryse; and it has the best tortoise-shell of all the places on the Erythrean Sea&quot;2 

The Periplus further states that &quot;Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea about five hundred stadia, and is of another kingdom, the Pandian. This place also is situated on a river, about one hundred and twenty stadia from the sea.&quot; ... &quot;They send large ships to these market towns on account of the great quantity and bulk of pepper and malabathrum. There are imported here, in the first place, a great quantity of coin; topaz, thin clothing,&quot; &quot;fine linen, antimony, coral, crude glass, copper,tin, lead; wine, not much, but as much as at Barygaza; realgar and orpiment; and wheat enough for sailors,&quot; &quot;There is exported pepper which is produced in quantity only in one region near these markets, a district called Cottonara. 

Besides this there are exported great quantities of fine pearls, ivory, silk cloth, spikenard from the Ganges, malabathrum from the places in the interior,transparent stones of all kinds, diamonds and sapphires&quot;3 

This mirrorwork dates back to to the12th Century A.D. But smelting of metals and derivation of alloys was done since 3000 B.C. in ancient India 

About other commodities the Periplus says, &quot;The voyage to all these far-side market towns is made from Egypt about the month of July, that is Epiphi. And ships are also customarily fitted out from the places across the sea, from Ariaca and Barygaza, bringing to these far-side market-towns the products&quot; &quot;wheat, rice, clarified butter, sesame oil, cotton cloth (the monache and the sagmatogene), and gridles, and honey from the reed called Sacchari.&quot; 4 

Thus we see that in a rambling manner, the Periplus refers to the &quot;muslins of the finest sorts,&quot; &quot;fine pearls, ivory, silk cloth&quot; &quot;crude glass&quot;, &quot;coins&quot;, etc.'., apart from many other commodities that were exported from India. Other western historians, and traveller-adventurers like Megasthanes, Strabo, Ptolemy, Fa Hien, Huen Tsang, Pliny, Marco Polo, Al Beruni, Ibn Batuta, etc., have also enumerated the various commodities that were produced and exported by India. 

The following is a list of various commodities that were exported from India in ancient times. The present day English names of most of these commodities have originated from Sanskrit. This list has been compiled from references to India made by Western, Chinese and Arab historians in ancient and medieval ages. (LIst to be included shortly) 

We shall now have a detailed look at some of these products which were imported from ancient India. We will begin with Perfumes. 

'''THE DISTILLATION OF PERFUMES''' 

The distillation of scents, perfumes and fragrant liquids and ointments was one area where the knowledge of chemistry was applied in India since ancient times. In fact the very word 'scent' which is of unexplained origin according to the Oxford Dictionary, is possibly derived from the Sanskrit term Sugandha which literally means 'good or aromatic paste'. This word could have been transmitted to European languages through the Greek langua which has borrowed (and lent) many wor from Sanskrit. Other instances of such transmission are the English words li 'cotton' which is derived from the Sanskrit Karpasa or the word 'sugar' derived frc the Sanskrit Sharkara, etc. Many present day perfumes had existed 

India since ancient times and perhaps had originated here. In ancient times perfumes and fragrant ointments were of two typ viz., Teertha (liquids) and Gandha (slurries or ointments). During the coronation Kings or durlng any auspicious occasion person was sprinkled with aromatic oils. Fragrant ointments based on sandalwood were applied during ceremonial bathing. Even today during some festivals like Diwali aromatic slurries and pastes are prepared out of a powder called Sugandhi. Utne and are used during the ceremonial bath which is taken during that festival. Even in other religious rites, Sandalwood, Ochre and Camphor are traditionally used by Hindus. 

'''SANDALWOOD''': Since very early times Sandalwood and Sandalwood oil were items of export. The Greek text of the 1st century A.D., Periplus mentions sandalwood as one of the items being imported from India. The word Sandal (wood) is derived from the Latin terms Santalum Album or Santalacae. These terms used by the Romans to describe sandalwood were, according to the Oxford Dictionary, derived from the Sanskrit term Chandana, for sandalwood. 

The Sandalwood tree is native to India and is found mainly in South-western India in t he state of Karnataka. Sandalwood has been a known item of export from India since ancient times. Authors of Sanskrit texts on botany which in Sanskrit is called Vanaspati-Shastra had classified Sandalwood into three types viz. white sandalwood Shrikanda (which perhaps is an abbreviation of the term Shewta-Chandana ), the second is yellow sandalwood or Pitta-Chandana and the last is red sandalwood or RaktaChandana 

The reference to Sandalwood in the Periplus is perhaps the earliest available western reference to Sandalwood. It has been mentioned in later times by Comas Indiwpleustes in the 6th century A.D. as Tzandana and thereafter it is frequently referred to by Arab traders. Oil was also extracted from Sandalwood. This oil which was a thick but refined liquid was extracted in specially constructed oil mills called Teyl-Peshani and Teylena-Lip. The oil extracted from these mills was a thick, dark yellow liquid. Along with Sandalwood, the Sandalwood oil was also an item of export from India during ancient times. Sandalwood oil was mainly bought by the Romans between the 1st and 3rd centuries A.D. 

'''MUSK''': Musk is also a fragrant substance which is secreted in the gland by a male musk-deer. Musk is redish-brown in colour and is used as a base for perfumes and also as an ingredient for soaps to give it a musky smell. In Sanskrit, Musk is known as Muska which means the scortum i.e. the pouch of skin containing the testicles of the deer. The English term Musk originates from the Sanskrit term Muska according to the Oxford Dictionary. 

The Sanskrit word Muska is perhaps derived from the words Maunsa or Masa which means 'flesh'. In Sanskrit, other words used for musk are Kasturi, Kastutrika and Mruga-Nabhi. The last term literally means 'a deer's navel'. 

'''TAMARIND:''' Tamarind is a fruit whose acid pulp is used in the making of cooling or medicinal drinks. The English word Tamarind is derived from the Latin term 'Tamarindus Indica' which is derived from the Arabic term Tamr-Hindi which means 'Dates from India'. The Arabs were familiar with only one form of fruit i.e. Dates, which grow in the desert. Thus when they came across another fruit which they could use in the making of cool refreshing drinks they named it 'Dates from India' Tamr-Hindi; after the country from where they had obtained the fruit. In Sanskrit, Tamarind is called Chincha and Amlica. The latter term is derived from the word Amlica which means acidic. This name is given to Tamarind due to the acidic odour and juice that it has. This fruit was an item of export from India since ancient times. The fact that it originated in India is evident from the name Tamr-Hindi which the Arabs gave it. 

'''CAMPHOR''': Camphor is a whitish translucent crystalline volatile substance with aromatic smell and bitter taste. It is also used in pharmacy as a medicinal drug. The word camphor is derived from the Latin word 'Camphora' which comes from the Arabic term Kafur, which ultimately originated from the Sanskrit term Karpuram, according to the Oxford Dictionary. 

The Sanskrit words for Camphor, apart from Karpuram are Hima-Valuka which literally means 'Snow-sand' and Chandraka which means 'like a moon' perhaps because it is whitish and translucent. Camphor was also an item exported from India since ancient times. The Camphor that was exported was not in its natural form but it was refined and cut into strips and square pieces before being loaded for export. That it was mainly obtained from India is established by the fact that the name chosen for this commodity was the corrupted version of the original Sanskrit term. Even today Camphor is used by devout Hindus as an incense during prayer. 

'''SPIKENARD:''' Spikenard was a costly aromatic ointment extracted since ancient times from an Indian plant known in Sanskrit as Nardostachys Jatamansi which perhaps means 'the braid of hair (Jataa) of (Narada). The English word Spikenard is derived from the Greek term Nardostakhus and the Latin term Spica Nardi; both the terms are derived from the Sanskrit term Nardostachys Jatamansi. This plant has purplish-yellow flower heads and is very rarely found. Its smell is quite pleasing and hence it had been in great demand since ancient times. 

In Sanskrit, other terms used to refer to this plant are, Jatila which means 'difficult', Tapasvini which literally means 'concentration and devotion'. These words used to describe Spikenard indicate that it was very difficult to obtain and cultivate this plant. In India this herb was available only in the Himalayas. Spikenard, which is aromatic and bitter, yields on distillation a pleasant smelling oil. 

In India, it had been used since ancient times as an aromatic adjunct in the preparation of medicinal oils and was popularly believed to increase th growth and blackness of hair. The Roman historian Pliny observes the Spikenard was considered very precious i Rome and it was stored in alabaster boxes by persons of eminence. 

Another aromatic herb exported from ar cient India was the Nard. It is a root of th ginger-grass found in western Punjab an Baluchistan. The Nard is found in semi-aril areas and it seems to have been found by Alexander in Gedrosia (Baluchistan) when hi army unknowingly trampled the plant whil on march and this resulted in a sweet pel fume which we are told &quot;was diffused fa and wide over the land by the trampling&quot;. The Nard is known in Latin as Cymbopogon Jwarancusa the word Cusa is perhaps de rived from the Sanskrit word Kusha fo grass. The use of the word grass to refer tz Nard is perhaps because of its being confused by the Romans with other aromatic grasses like lemon grass, gingergrass, citronella, etc., which also yield aromatic oils. 

'''COSTUS:''' Costus is the root of the plans Saussurea Lappa, a tall perennial plant growing on the open slopes of the vale or Kashmir and other high valleys of that region. The plant is found at elevations ol 8000 to 13000 feet. It was used by the Romans as a culinary spice as also as a perfume. 

This root was dug up and cut into small pieces and shipped to Rome and China. The root is generally of the size of a finger wit' a yellowish woody part and a whitish barl It is said that Seleucus Callinicus had ot tained Costus from India and sent it as gift to the Milesians.6 The Romans also re ferred to costus as radix, the root as distirguished from Nard which was called folio the leaf. The price of Costus in Rome is stated by Pliny to have been 5 denarii per pound. 

India still exports Costus and today the collection of Costus is a state monopoly. In Kashmir the product is used by shawl merchants to protect their fabrics from moths. The Indian origin of Costus is evident from the fact that the word is derived from the Sanskrit term Kustha which means 'that which stands in the earth'. This word was perhaps used as Costus was a root. 

'''MACIR:''' 

Macir is mentioned by Dioscorides as an aromatic bark. Pliny says that it was brought from India. He describes it as a red bark growing upon a large root, which bears the name Macir from the tree that produced it. He prescribed a mixture of this bark with honey as a cure for dysentery. The word Macir is today neither found in the English nor the Sanskrit Dictionaries but it has been mentioned in the Periplus on pages 80 and 81. 

-The word Macir has been said to have been derived from the Sanskrit word Makara which in India was said to have been used in ancient times as a traditional Ayurvedic remedy for dysentery. Macir seems to have been the root-bark of the tree Holarrhena Antidysentrica which according to the notes appended to the Periplus was found throughout India and Burma in the lower Himalayas up to 3500 feet. 

Both the bark and seed of this tree were among the most important medicines in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. According to the notes to the Periplus. &quot;This tree found by the Portuguese was called 'Herba malabarica owing to its great merit in the treatment of dysentery they having found it on the Malabar coast. The preparation, generally in the form of a solid or liquid extract, or of a decoction, is astringent, anti-dysenteric an anthelmintic. The seeds yield a fixed oil, and the wood ash is used in dyeing.'' Thus this commodity which was exported from India in early times had multiple uses.

      <comment>/* User-defined types */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Built-in Types ==
QBasic has five built-in types: INTEGER (%), LONG(&amp;) integer, SINGLE(!) float, DOUBLE(#) float and STRING($).

Implicit declaration is by adding the type character to the end of the variable name (%, &amp;, !, #, $). See '''QBasic/Basic math''' for more.

Explict declaration is by using the DIM statement before first use:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 DIM name AS STRING
&lt;/source&gt;
If you do not use either implicit or explicit declaration, QBASIC interpreter assumes INTEGER type.

==User-defined type==

{{TODO|Make this example more suitable for textbook usage.}}
A user defined type allows you to create your own data structures.                               Please note that custom types are similiar to arrays.

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 TYPE playertype
  name AS STRING
  score AS INTEGER
 END TYPE
&lt;/source&gt;

You can then declare variables under this type, and access them:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
DIM playername AS playertype
playername.name = &quot;Bob&quot;
playername.score = 92
&lt;/source&gt;

This above example shows how a custom type can be used for maintaining data, say on a player who plays a game.

==Array==

An array is a collection of values stored in a single variable.  Unless you DIM them, they are limited to 10 elements on each dimension.

By default, arrays in QBasic are static in size and cannot be changed later in the program. Code that will set up this type of array is as follows:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
DIM myArray(10) as TYPE
&lt;/source&gt; 

TYPE can be any of the built in QBasic or user-defined type.  If this is not specified, the array takes the default type for the variable. 

By issuing the Meta Command '$DYNAMIC at the beginning of your program you can cause your arrays to be dynamic:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 ' $DYNAMIC
 DIM myDynamicArray(5) as INTEGER
 REDIM myDynamicArray(10) as INTEGER
&lt;/source&gt;

This is now perfectly legal code.

To free up space occupied by an array, use the ERASE statement.

== Multidimensional array==

An array isn't restricted to one dimension - it's possible to declare an array to accept two parameters in order to represent a grid of values.

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 DIM housenames(25,25) as STRING
&lt;/source&gt;

You cannot use the REDIM statement to change the number of dimensions on the array, even with dynamic allocation.

== Non-zero base ==
In most languages, arrays start at the value 0, and count up.  In basic, it's possible to index arrays so that they start at any value, and finish at any other value. 

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parser is implemented manually in file '''c_parser.c'''. Compared to earlier releases of GCC, the new parser generates a
lower level AST. There were special tree codes for loops,
for example ''FOR_STMT'' denoted a for() loop. In this release the
loops are represented as conditional statements and gotos, that is
trees of codes ''COND_EXPR'', ''LABEL_EXPR'', and ''GOTO_EXPR''. This probably
means that it is impossible to raise AST representation to original
source code.&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gcc_repr.jpg|center|Additional representations of GCC 4.1.]]

[[:Image:Gcc_repr.jpg|Figure 2]] shows additional representations of GCC 4.1.

Because of the differences in languages, the format of the generated ASTs is slightly different for each language. The next step after AST generation is the unification step in which the AST tree is converted into a unified form called generic. After this, the middle end part of the compiler takes control. First, the tree is converted into another representation called ''GIMPLE''. In this form, each expression contains no more than three operands, all control flow constructs are represented as combinations of conditional statements and goto operators, arguments of a function call can only be variables, etc. [[:Image:gccinternals-img2.png|Figure 2]] illustrates the differences between a tree in generic form and a tree in GIMPLE form. GIMPLE is a convenient representations for optimizing the source code.


After GIMPLE, the source code is converted into the ''static single assignment (SSA)'' representation. The central idea of this form is the fact that each variable is assigned to only once, but can be used at the right hand side of an expression many times. Every time the same variable of a tree in the GIMPLE form is reassigned, the compiler creates a new version of that variable and stores the new value into it. When the same variable is assigned to in both branches of a conditional expression, one needs to merge the two possible values of the variable into a single variable. This operation is denoted as PHI function in the SSA form.


The SSA form is also used for optimizations. GCC performs more than 20 different optimizations on SSA trees. After the SSA optimization pass, the tree is converted back to the GIMPLE form.&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

==Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:Close-up of a centrifuge with vials.jpg]]==
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Close-up of a centrifuge with vials.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:Close-up of a centrifuge with vials.jpg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence
#[[w:public domain|Public Domain]]

*The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an [[w:open content|open content]] license like the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] licence.  If you have the '''express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence''', use the image copyright tag: {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}.  The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government .  Non-free licence governments are listed [[w:Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses|here]]. 

For any other sources of for more information see [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]].  Please remember that if you don't tag your images, they will be deleted.

::''P.S.  If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them.  Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.''

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again. [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wise Children]] ==

Hello. I noticed that you are creating a study guide for ''[[Wise Children]]'', but you are creating more than one copy of the guide.

Because this is a wiki, other users will be editing and improving your guide, or so everyone hopes. Thus, I deleted the extra copies, leaving one copy at  '''[[Wise Children]]'''. Please use that copy instead of creating more copies of it on this wiki.

Note that the '''[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]''' requires all modules of you study guide to begin with &quot;Wise Children/&quot;, for example [[Wise Children/Allusions to Shakespeare]]. This is to separate the modules of each Wikibook from each other Wikibook. That is why I moved the modules, and you cannot find them under names such as &quot;List of Allusions to Shakespeare&quot;. (As an aside, if you [[Special:Userlogin|register an account]], then you will also get a &quot;move&quot; button to move pages.)

If you have more questions, you could ask me at [[User talk:Kernigh]], or post on the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. Thanks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:45, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Quotations by theme==
Because you are not allowed to take the book into the exam, it is important that you learn some key quotes. Here are some of the most important ones.

===Shakespeare===
*&quot;Shakespeare was a kind of god for him&quot;
*&quot;Birnam wood is creeping up on Dunsinane&quot;
*&quot;Perhaps Shakespeare had eaten such a soup!&quot;
*&quot;Here she is in drag as, famously, Hamlet&quot;
*&quot;Off with it! You only lent it to me! Nothing was mine, not ever!&quot;
*&quot;Replicas of Anne Hathaway’s cottage&quot;
*&quot;Shakespeare, to whom our family owed so much&quot;
*&quot;Cry God for England, Harry and St George&quot;
*&quot;Shakespeare, on the note, said, “Have a heart”&quot;
*&quot;What You Will&quot; - subtitle for the Twelfth Night
*&quot;Rivers of tears. Tempests of applause&quot;
*&quot;Water, water everywhere did he think it was the bloody tempest!&quot;

===Youth and age===
*&quot;So well connected. So legitimate. Oh sod it all. So young&quot;
*&quot;Pungent smell of old ladies&quot;
*&quot;Our father had aged more evidently than his brother&quot;
*&quot;Our old age, the fourth guest at the table&quot;
*&quot;Deceptions of memory&quot;
*&quot;Legs, the last thing to go&quot;
*&quot;Old Melchior did something pathetic, he tried to wave the cameras away&quot;
*&quot;I knew in my water…&quot;
*&quot;Boy and girl, a new thing in our family&quot;
*&quot;Old age was creeping up behind him&quot; (Melchior)
*&quot;...geriatric chorine...&quot;

===Paternity/Absent Fathers===
* &quot;My lovely daughters, all four of you&quot;
*&quot;Father is a hypothesis but mother is a fact&quot;
*&quot;It is a characteristic of human beings that if they haven’t got a family of their own, they will invent one&quot;
*&quot;It is a wise child that knows it's own father&quot;
*&quot;Were both of us mothers and both of us fathers…they’ll be wise children alright.&quot;
*“That man is….your father!” her revelation didn’t have the force it might have had.
*The jury is still out on the question of her boy’s paternity (lady M)
*&quot;A father is a movable feast&quot;

===Illegitimacy===
*&quot;We never felt quite so illegitimate in all our lives&quot;
*&quot;Welcome to the wrong side of the tracks&quot;
*&quot;His eyes skidded over us&quot;
*&quot;And the unrighteous prospered&quot;
*&quot;So well connected. So legitimate. Oh sod it all. So young.&quot;
*&quot;It is a characteristic of human beings that if they haven’t got a family of their own, they will invent one.&quot;
*&quot;Which mother? Pretty kitty? Grandma?&quot;
*&quot;Us. Unkissed, unwelcome, worse than unacknowledged&quot;
*&quot;The jury is still out on the question of her boy’s paternity (lady M)
*&quot;outside the magic circle of our desire&quot;
*&quot;It's a wise child that knows its own father... But wiser yet the father who knows his own child.&quot;
*&quot;e's not your father&quot;
*&quot;there was sod all romantic about our illegitimacy&quot;
*&quot;By blows&quot;
*&quot;...children on the wrong side of the blanket...&quot;
*&quot;...left hand children...&quot;

===Fate===
*&quot;Fate continued to deal kindly with Melchior
*&quot;The destination of Melchior had been prepared for him since birth
*&quot;He was doomed to wear the pasteboard crown
*&quot;We were doomed to dance and sing
*&quot;The bastard side of Old Father Thames (Page 1)

===Fantasy/Carnivalesque===
*&quot;The carnival’s got to stop sometime
*&quot;Less of a man, more of a travelling carnival
*&quot;What a joy it is to dance and sing!&quot;

===Magic realism===
*&quot;As if inhabited by hands&quot;
*&quot;It made a noise in his belly like barrels rolling around in a cellar&quot;
*&quot;French knickers doing the can-can with the frilly petticoats&quot;
*&quot;Perhaps he slipped us one in each pocket of his jacket&quot;
*&quot;And then hup! He did a backflip out of the window, saving us.&quot;
*&quot;The naked pillows huddled like a corpse&quot;
*&quot;The bulb flickered on and off&quot;
*&quot;They let the wind in when they opened the door&quot;
*&quot;Stopped short at ten years old, never to go again, like grandfathers clock&quot;
*&quot;And this time got it right, straight on the nosey!&quot;
*&quot;In on the wind that came with Perry blew dozens and dozens of butterflies...&quot;
*&quot;Not bad for a centenarian at all, at all.&quot;

==Quotations by character==
===Nora/Dora===
&quot;Hello let me introduce myself I'm Dora Chance&quot;. 
*&quot;But if I told you that, I’d be lying&quot;
*&quot;What a joy it is to dance and sing&quot;
*&quot;Nora was soon in love again&quot;
*&quot;As soon as they started to call me Nora, I found that I could kiss the boys&quot;
*&quot;I've got a tale and a half to tell&quot;
*&quot;We were going exclusively for Lady’s A’s sake&quot;
*&quot;It is a characteristic of human beings that if they haven’t got a family of their own, they will invent one&quot;
*&quot;All of a sudden, I was feeling chipper&quot;
*&quot;Searching for the lost limb…Nora…the best part of me&quot;
*&quot;She used Shalimar, me, Mitsouko&quot;
*&quot;Identical we may be, but symmetrical, never&quot;
*&quot;Our careers went down the toilet with the profession itself&quot;
*&quot;He loved us both but I was the one he talked to.&quot;
*&quot;Vulgar as hell&quot;
*&quot;It was all too literal for me&quot;
*&quot;Drunk in charge of a narrative&quot;
*&quot;You never forget the first time. Ill never forget the last time either&quot;
*&quot;Drunk in charge of a baby carriage&quot;
*&quot;Lo how the mighty have fallen&quot;
*&quot;Couple of batty old tarts with their eyes glued on their own ghosts.&quot;
*&quot;Treacherous, lecherous chorus girl.&quot;

===Perry===
*&quot;The carnival’s got to stop sometime&quot;
*&quot;Less of a man, more of a travelling carnival&quot;
*&quot;Not bad for a centenarian&quot;
*&quot;One doesn’t marry a man like that&quot;
*&quot;He deflated&quot;
*&quot;He’d brought me on a pilgrimage&quot;
*&quot;It made a noise in his belly like barrels rolling around in a cellar&quot;
*&quot;Bigger than ever and brown as a berry from the Brazilian sun&quot;
*&quot;Where he loved, he never altered, nor saw any alteration&quot;
*&quot;Magician, producer, explorer, seducer, rich man, poor man, but never beggar man or thief&quot;
*&quot;Birnam wood is creeping up on Dunsinane&quot;
*&quot;He was the size of a warehouse, no bigger, the size of a tower block&quot;
*&quot;It was his name on the cheques&quot;
*&quot;Oooh, wasn’t he a handsome young man&quot;
*&quot;Size of a polar bear&quot;
*&quot;Huge but dapper&quot;
*&quot;Peregrine swept us up into his arms&quot;
*&quot;He looked as big as the burning house&quot;
*&quot;Another fad. Like movies. Like oil. Like espionage&quot;
*&quot;He was not the love of my life, but all the loves of my life at once&quot;
*&quot;Did I see the soul of the one I loved when I saw Perry, not his body?&quot;
*&quot;He doubled up as sugar daddy&quot;
&quot;Nora fluxy me constipated&quot;

===Melchior===
*&quot;Knicker-shifting, undo your brassiere from the back of the gallery eyes &quot;
*&quot;His eyes skidded over us&quot;
*&quot;Fate continued to deal kindly with Melchior&quot;
*&quot;Offed with the old and onned with the new&quot;
*&quot;And the unrighteous prospered&quot;
*&quot;What shall I do without my crown? Othello’s occupation, gone!&quot;
*&quot;Our father had aged more evidently than his brother&quot;
*&quot;Old Melchior did something pathetic, he tried to wave the cameras away&quot;
*&quot;I sometimes wonder if we haven’t been making him up all along&quot;
*&quot;Dark and brooding&quot;
*&quot;Then Melchior did something wonderful. Who'd have thought the old man had it in him?&quot;
*&quot;Our greatest living Shakespearian&quot;
*&quot;Bent on making an exhibition of himself to the very end&quot;
*&quot;As dark and sexy as the inside of a London cab in wartime&quot;
*&quot;Melchior dreamt up his own father&quot;
*&quot;Prince of players&quot;
*&quot;in his voice like Hershey's syrup&quot;
===Lady A===
*&quot;One doesn’t marry a man like that&quot;
*&quot;Cackling away in her genteel fashion&quot;
*&quot;Even when they robbed their mother of her home and money&quot;
*&quot;We were going exclusively for Lady’s A’s sake&quot;
*&quot;Don’t go before you’ve had coffee…&quot;
*&quot;She twinkled&quot;
*&quot;Lady Atalanta Hazard, the most beautiful woman of her time&quot;
*&quot;I’d even hoped that she and Perry might make a go of it&quot;
*&quot;Our geriatric little girl&quot;
*&quot;I live mostly in the past these days, I find it’s better&quot;
*&quot;Have you got anything in the shape of a cucumber, my good fellow?&quot;

===Daisy===
*&quot;Enter Daisy&quot;
*&quot;White that matched the cat that matched the telephone&quot;
*&quot;I could tell at a glance that she was tight as a tick&quot;
*&quot;She overshot the drive and screeched to a halt&quot;
* &quot;She was a trouper and a half alright, she'd got legs, guts, leather lungs, tits out to here, chutzpah, sass, star quality. But class - no&quot;

===Lady Margarine===
*&quot;To butter or not to butter?&quot;
*&quot;She reached middle age quicker than any woman I knew&quot;
*&quot;The jury is still out on the question of her boy’s paternity&quot;

===Saskia===
*&quot;She later admitted she’d put something in the cake, but whether it would have made Melchior ill, very ill or finished him off altogether we never found out&quot;
*&quot;So well connected. So legitimate. Oh sod it all. So young&quot;
*&quot;Saskia gave me a dirty look&quot;
*&quot;Her hair redder than ever&quot;
*&quot;I felt that odd familiar shudder of distress when I saw Saskia&quot;
*&quot;You never loved us!&quot;
*&quot;Being unique amongst mammals a cold blooded cow&quot;
*&quot;mercenary bitch&quot;

===Imogen===
*&quot;Developed a unique line as a goldfish&quot;
*&quot;She’d got a fishbowl on her head with a fish in it&quot;

===Tiffany===
*&quot;Oh my little sister Lily is a whore in Piccadilly and my mother is another in the Strand&quot;
* &quot;Her hands were full of flowers&quot;
*&quot;not on your life, you bastard&quot;
*&quot;marry your auntie instead&quot;
*&quot;Pull yourself together and be a man, or try to&quot;
*&quot;There's more to fathering than fucking&quot;
*&quot;Never a sweeter or more innocent girl than our Tiffany, even though she didn't know enough not to flash her tits all over the papers&quot;
*&quot;The sweetest girl in London, but naïve&quot;

===Gareth===
*A celibate one – a non-combatant, as it were.
*&quot;To add to the hypothetical,disputed, absent father that was such a feature of our history, now you could add a holy father, too. Put it down to liberation theology.&quot;
*&quot;The priest and the game show host, not so different, really.&quot;

===Grandma Chance===
*&quot;Memory lane is a dead end&quot;
*&quot;What the fuck d’you mean?&quot;
*&quot;Hope for the best, expect the worst&quot;
*&quot;Toot sweet&quot;
*&quot;Made ‘mountaynes’ out of ‘molehills’&quot;
*&quot;She took to children like a duck to water&quot;
*&quot;The boarding house clung to respectability by the skin of it’s teeth ...you could have said the same of her&quot;
*&quot;She didn't so much talk as elocute&quot;
*&quot;She wasn't going to let Hitler inconvenience her drinking habits&quot;
*&quot;Grandma invented this family. She put it together out of whatever came to hand... she created it by sheer force of personality&quot;
*&quot;She was a mystery&quot;
*&quot;When I saw you two, the penny dropped&quot;
*&quot;She was a naturist, she was a vegetarian, she was a pacifist&quot;
*&quot;When the bombardments began, she’d go outside and shake her fist at the old men in the sky&quot;
*&quot;She was our air raid shelter, she was our entertainment, she was our breast&quot;

===Gorgeous George===
*&quot;Clown Number One to the British Empire&quot;
*&quot;He didn't travel. The moment he stepped off his native soil, he stopped being funny. In California, he was not bawdy, he was lewd&quot;
*&quot;Gorgeous George, having stayed himself with a flagon, was trying out a chorus of 'Rose of England' in a defiant and self-conscious manner&quot;

===Genghis Khan===
*&quot;He was like a bloody dictator in that studio&quot;
*&quot;He pressed a button on his desk and Nora's chair collapsed..and she went sprawling, legs in the air&quot;
*&quot;An orchid had never bit him back before&quot;
*&quot;Genghis Kahn was staking his all on art&quot;

===Ross 'Irish' O'Flaherty===
*It's only a writer...Ross O'Flaherty RIP&quot;
*&quot;A great future behind him, already&quot;
*&quot;The last flame of a burned out case&quot;
*&quot;'God, you're lovely', he said...I wouldn't be able to return the compliment, alas&quot;
*&quot;old soul&quot;

===Puck===
*&quot;Puck looked like a little man but wasn't; he was an aged child&quot;
*&quot;Puck was all fingers, goose you as soon as look at you, unmentionable habits&quot;
*&quot;You might find that Puck in your laundry basket, when you least expected it, curled up inhaling your soiled lingerie&quot;
*&quot;Puck passed by and goosed me&quot;
*&quot;if a questing hand reached up from under the tablecloth, you knew it was Pucks night out, too&quot;
*&quot;He drilled holes in the walls of the ladies' toilets and liked to take a peep and I don't know what else&quot;
*&quot;old ladies loved him&quot;
*&quot;he had the high tenor of an angel&quot;

      <comment>/* Bayesian? */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Better Explanation==
&quot;The opposite of &quot;Bayesian&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;Classical Statistics&quot;

I think this ought to be better explained.

==What?==

It would be nice if we explained WHY we're doing the things we're doing in this section.  Where did that formula come from?  Thin air?  I saw a lot of this is the standard deviation article also.

== Bayesian? ==

Well, this example uses Bayes' theorem but it isn't really Bayesian. In Bayesian analysis one typically considers an unknown parameter, say &amp;theta;, as being a random variable characterised by a continuous distribution. The prior distribution p(&amp;theta;) is often chosen to be quite flat, but it can be peaked to reflect a priori information. The posterior distribution p(&amp;theta; | x), where x is the data, is more sharply peaked. If there's sufficient data to overwhelm the prior, the posterior is mainly dependent on the data, not the prior.

Bayes' theorem in this context is &lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid x) \propto p(x \mid \theta) \, p(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. The normalising factor (to bring the total probability mass to 1) can be found by integration (marginalisation), so Bayes' theorem in full is:

&lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid x) = \frac{p(x \mid \theta) \, p(\theta)} {\int p(x \mid \theta) \, p(\theta) \, d\theta }&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken over all possible values of &amp;theta;.

For instance, if you were trying to determine whether a coin is fair, &amp;theta; would be the parameter of the binomial distribution. But things can get a lot more complicated than this, with multiple parameters and hierarchical models.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am wondering if this is the person who keeps inserting blatant crap into the wikibooks articles, because if it is, you are no funnier than a cotton ball. Tampering with informational documents is not funny, but highly annoying to those around you. You are a disgrace to this website and I hope you are ashamed of yourself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==C# is a fully object-oriented language?==
I think that Lisp, Scheme, Javascript programmers, and others might disagree with the claim that 'C# is a fully object-oriented language'.  Functions in C# are not objects.  It is not possible to create a new function at run time (delegates don't do it and neither would the trick of currying an existing function by creating an anonymous class at compile time precisely because they happen at compile time).  It might be more accurate to say 'C# is a class based language'.  See [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/ViewReply.asp?id=1438424].  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:01, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
:I'm not aware of any universally accepted definition of &quot;fully object-oriented&quot;, but if your only issues with the claim are that C# 1.0's functions cannot be objects and that C# 1.0 cannot create new functions at runtime, note that C# 2.0's anonymous methods overcome those deficiencies. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 22:45, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
::Anonymous methods are compiled just like any other method; the method is not created at run time.  All that is manipulated at run time is a pointer to the delegate object that implements the anonymous method.  However, that isn't really central to my point.  I was simply pointing out that the use of the word 'fully' in the phrase 'fully object oriented' implies that there is some such definition and that C# complies with it.  As the definition wasn't given it is up to the imagination of the reader to construct one and C# failed to comply with the one my imagination constructed.  If we want to make strong claims, and 'fully' anything is surely a strong claim, we should  be able to back them up.  If we cannot then such statements are vacuous and misleading.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 18:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

== Code example ==

Hi. I have two problems with the code in the example. Why is &quot;'''System'''&quot; in the class when the &quot;'''using System'''&quot; is already there? Another thing, why is &quot;'''Console.ReadLine();'''&quot; included in the example? Of course &quot;'''string[] args'''&quot; isn't necessary either in a basic example. --[[User:S.Örvarr.S|Stefán Örvarr Sigmundsson]] 07:37, 18 August 2007 (UTC)
&lt;pre&gt;
using System;

namespace MyConsoleApplication
{
        class MyFirstClass
        {
                static void Main(string[] args)
                {
                        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello,&quot;);
                        Console.WriteLine(&quot;World!&quot;);

                        Console.ReadLine();
                }
        }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Never mind. I noticed that this is explained in the text. --[[User:S.Örvarr.S|Stefán Örvarr Sigmundsson]] 07:42, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>not extending the notion of function</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''complex function''' is one that takes complex values and maps them onto complex numbers, which we write as &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Unless explicitly stated, whenever the term ''function'' appears, we will mean a complex function. A function can also be '''multi-valued''' - for example, &lt;math&gt;z^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; has two roots for every number. This notion will be explained in more detail in later chapters.

[[Image:Complex Function Z Squared Plot.png|thumb|A plot of Abs(''z''²) as ''z'' ranges over the complex plane.]]

A complex function &lt;math&gt;f(z):\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; will sometimes be written in the form &lt;math&gt;f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''u'' and ''v'' are real-valued functions of two real variables. We can convert between this form and one expressed strictly in terms of ''z'' through the use of the following identities:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{z+\bar z}{2}, y=\frac{1}{i} \frac{z-\bar z}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

While [[w:real function|real functions]] can be [[w:graph|graphed]] on the x-y plane, complex functions map from a two-dimensional to a two-dimensional space, so visualizing it would require four dimensions. Since this is impossible we will often use the three-dimensional plots of &lt;math&gt;\Re z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Im z&lt;/math&gt;, and |''z''| to gain an understanding of what the function &quot;looks&quot; like.

For an example of this, take the function &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2=(x^2-y^2)+i(2xy)&lt;/math&gt;. The plot of the surface &lt;math&gt;|z^2|=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt; is shown to the right.

Another common way to visualize a complex function is to graph input-output regions.  For instance, consider the same function &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^2 &lt;/math&gt; and the input region being the &quot;quarter disc&quot; &lt;math&gt;Q \cap \Bbb{D} &lt;/math&gt; obtained by taking the region 

&lt;math&gt;Q = \{x + iy : x,y \ge 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the first quadrant) 

and intersecting this with the disc &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{D}&lt;/math&gt; of radius 1 : 

&lt;math&gt;\Bbb{D} = \{z : |z| \le 1\} &lt;/math&gt; .

If we imagine inputting every point of &lt;math&gt;Q \cap \Bbb{D} &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, marking the output point, and then graphing the set &lt;math&gt; f( Q \cap \Bbb{D} ) &lt;/math&gt; of output points, the output region would be &lt;math&gt;UHP \cap \Bbb{D} &lt;/math&gt; where 

&lt;math&gt;UHP = \{x + iy : y \ge 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;UHP&lt;/math&gt; is called the upper half plane).  

So, the squaring function &quot;rotationally stretches&quot; the input region to produce the output region.  This can be seen using the polar-coordinate representation of &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; z = r cis(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;.  For example, if we consider points on the unit circle &lt;math&gt;S^1 = \{z : |z|=1\}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the set &quot;&lt;math&gt; r = 1 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;) with &lt;math&gt; \theta \le \pi/2 &lt;/math&gt; then the squaring function acts as follows:

&lt;math&gt; f(z) = [ 1 cis(\theta) ]^2 = cis( 2 \theta ) &lt;/math&gt;

(here we have used &lt;math&gt; cis( \theta ) cis( \phi ) = cis(\theta+\phi) &lt;/math&gt; ).  We see that a point having angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to the point having angle &lt;math&gt;2 \theta &lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is small, meaning that the point is close to &lt;math&gt;z=1&lt;/math&gt;, then this means the point doesn't move very far.  As &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; becomes larger, the difference between &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 2 \theta &lt;/math&gt; becomes larger, meaning that the squaring function moves the point further.  If &lt;math&gt; \theta = \pi/2 &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;z = i&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt; 2 \theta = \pi &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt; z^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;).

      <comment>/* Exercises */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We now introduce the fundamental concepts of '''[[w:limit (mathematics)|limits]]''' and the '''[[w:continuous function|continuity]]''' of functions.

Let f(''z'') be a complex-valued function defined on a subset &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{G}&lt;/math&gt; of the complex plane. We then say that the '''[[w:limit (mathematics)|limit]]''' of f(''z'') as z tends to an accumulation point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{G}&lt;/math&gt; exists and equals the complex number ''L'' if, for any real number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can find a real number &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathfrak{G}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy &lt;math&gt; 0&lt;|z-z_0|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and we write this limit as 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\rightarrow z_0} f(z)=L&lt;/math&gt;.
An alternate but equivalent definition can be made using open sets: we say that the limit exists and equals the complex number ''L'' if, for any real number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can find a neighborhood ''O'' of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in \mathfrak{G}\cap (O\setminus\{z_0\})&lt;/math&gt;. Since the first definition is easier to work with, we will often use that one.

A function &lt;math&gt;w=f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''[[w:continuous function|continuous]]''' at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; is defined and &lt;math&gt;f(z_0)=\lim_{z\rightarrow z_0} f(z)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If a function is continuous at every point in a set, we say it is continuous throughout that set. Also, we will simply say that a function is continuous if it is continuous everywhere.

==Exercises==
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac{(\Re z + \Im z)^2}{|z|^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Show that &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Hint: Consider the limit along different lines thorough the origin in the complex plane.

      <comment>/* Best/ Worst Team Moves */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball League''' is an ongoing competition between ten baseball fans in the greater '''Boston Massachusetts''' area. There have been many controversies in the league since its creation three years ago.  Yet it still survives on the strong dedication of its members. The reason for interest in this league is that it represents a '''microcosm of the teen world''', with stress, unquestioned heirarchy, and a need for independece.

== League Rules ==
The rules (mainly the stat categories) have been disputed many times over the course of the league history.
The league rules include, but are not limited to:

Max Teams: 10 

Scoring Type: Head-to-Head 

Player Universe: All baseball 

Max Moves: No maximum 

Max Trades: No maximum 

Trade Reject Time: 0 

Trade End Date: No trade deadline

Waiver Time: 2 days

Can't Cut List Provider: Yahoo! Sports

Trade Review: League Votes Post

Draft Players: Follow Waiver Rules 

Min Innings Pitched: 18 

Weekly Deadline: Daily - Tomorrow 

Start Scoring on: Week 1 

Roster Positions:

C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, OF, OF, OF, Util, Util, SP, SP, SP, RP, RP, RP, P, P, P, BN, BN, BN, BN, BN, BN, BN, DL 

Stat Categories: R, HR, RBI, SB, TB, AVG, OPS, W, L, SV, K, HLD, ERA, WHIP

'''Rule Changes'''
Currently, there has been only one major rule change in the league.  This includes the abolishment of the ability for GM's in the league to '''veto trades'''.  This means that if a trade is agreed upon by two members of the league, it will go through no matter what.  Because of controversy, after year one, there are no reviews of trades.

== Current Teams ==

Currently, there are ten teams in the league. These teams include:

1. da Fibonaccistein 

2. Cuddely Corn Dogs** - CURRENT COMMISIONER

3. Bread ans Butter

4. Micheal Scott

5. Busy Bumble Bees

6. pork fried rice

7. Nine-Minute Monday

8. The Godfather

9. Maffiosa

10. Dwight K. Schrute

==Start of the League==

'''The Boston Boys''' started during the year of 2004, when several baseball fans and fantasy baseball addicts gathered around a lunch table to discuss creating a fantasy baseball league. The league was decided to contain ten teams with a league entry fee of five dollars (which has recently been raised to seven). Draft order was decided using slips of paper randomly selected from a gray lunch bag.

First Round Draft Selections through the years:

2004: 1B '''Albert Pujols''', St. Louis Cardinals

2005: RP '''Joe Nathan''', Minnesota Twins

2006: OF '''Hideki Matsui''', New York Yankees

The Boston Boys is a keeper league, meaning that each team gets to choose eight of its players to keep from year to year. The annual '''Selection of the Keepers''' is an event that creates stress among the members of the league, but marks the return of the baseball season.

== Trials and Tribulations of the Boston Boys League ==

Over the past three seasons, there have been several league disputes over who should and who should not be in the league. The first season saw '''&quot;Yankee Fan&quot;''' as a member of the league. However, after much dispute, it was decided that Yankee Fan be asked to leave the league. Reasons include, but are not limited to: No interest in team or the league in general, &quot;dumping&quot; players off to other teams, and also becoming angry when approached about the subject of Fantasy Baseball. '''Pork fried rice''' was invited to the league during the second season, when it was decided that '''Micheal Scott''' be asked to leave the league. At this point in time, Yankee fan was still in the league. However, after half way through the second season, Yankee Fan was asked to leave and Micheal Scott was invited back in. Although Michael Scott is presently in the league, he is sometimes a point of controversy over whether he cares enough about the league. However, lately, he has been an accepted and well liked member of the league.

'''The Lockdown and the Yarmouth Sprint'''

Each summer in The Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball league, the league commisioner packs up and travels to '''Cape Cod''' with his family for the summer. Being without a computer, he is forced to turn the league over to Assistant Commisioner, da Fibonaccistein. During the summer of 2004, the first year of the Boston Boys League, da Fibonaccistein was acting commissioner when catastrophe broke out.  Chaos and cries of revolution could be heard throughout the league in the form of dozens of arguments and shouts of mutany. Overwhelmed with power, da Fiboniccistein could do nothing to stop it. League members were going mad, adding and dropping players like there was no tomorrow and causing more trouble than was wanted by anyone. One member went so far as to say they had given up and that he would accept any trade offered to him during a certain time frame. The replacement commisioner, da Fibonaccistein, had to act fast and decided to shut down the members ability to trade. The Godfather felt it was necessary that Cuddely Corn Dogs be notified of the chaos in the league. He called him, and left a '''Princess Laea'''-esque message on his machine.  The Godfather actually recorded himself and sent a hologram message to '''Yarmouth''', using his trusty robot R2D2.  The message is thought to go something like this:

The Godfather: Josh...we need your h;elp...da Fibonaccistein is d;estroying the league...he is overwhelmed by his new pow;ers...you are our last hope...you need to save the league now. According to my radar, the nearest computer that has internet capabailities is located at the '''Yarmouth Library'''. *end transmission*

Once the real commisioner heard the news, he immeadiately sprinted to his bike,and got to the Yarmouth library as fast as possible in order to restore order to the league. It has been rumored that he actually reached terminal velocity on his bike, but it was never proven by scientific means. It is only a legend. The league was in total shock when they heard that nobody was allowed to add, drop, trade, or post messages on the message board. This '''lockdown''' went on for over two weeks. Once order was restored, the league returned to what was important.

'''The Jonny Gomes Fiasco'''

The Jonny Gomes Fiasco is one of the more recent controversies in the Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball League. Here is a brief overview of what happened: Before the draft started, '''Jonny Gomes''' was going to be a major sleeper for many teams. However, when one team tried to draft him (The Godfather) the League Commisioner told The Godfather that Jonny Gomes would not be playing at all this year, and he would be warming the bench for the Devil Rays. The Godfather then drafted someone else. Next up, the Bread-and-Butter took a risk on him anyways, since it was late in the draft. It turned out that there was no risk. Jonny Gomes was up on the Devil Rays' depth chart the whole time! The &quot;risk&quot; payed off for the Bread-and-Butter. Jonny Gomes currently has 11 HR through only one month.

'''The Jorge Sosa Incident'''

In the dog days of August, with competition still raging throughout the league, and the playoff race well underway, something smelled awry.  pork fried rice (pfr) left for a 10 day vacation, leaving the commisioner in charge of his roster for the trip.  pfr left instructions as to adding and dropping players, with one main requirment: DO NOT DROP '''JORGE SOSA'''.  Two days in to the vacation, Jorge Sosa was dropped, due to a loss in playing time, according to the league office.  There was much outrage from this incident throughout the league, becuase a direct order of a fellow owner was violated.  In the end, nobody picked up Jorge Sosa, and no actions were taken by pfr.  Though no big short term damage occured, this left a sour taste in the mouths of the league's members, and would build into controversy, and help lead to the '''Near Complete Coup d'Etat'''.

'''What to do with Rookies'''

A problem throughout the years has been about minor league prospects. This became an issue when Mafiossa had drafted prospect Delmon Young. Because he was not in the yahoo database, Mafiossa was forced to have an open roster spot until that player was availible. Without any warning, Cuddely Corn Dogs picked up said player. He was then dropped, but claimed off of waivers by Micheal Scott. Once Mafiossa realized it was very unlikely that Young would be starting at any time this year for Tampa Bay, he decided to drop all charges.
However, the first incident of drafting minor league players occured during the draft of year two.  Cuddely Corn Dogs decided to draft '''Huston Street''', prospect for the Oakland Athletics.  Nobody in the league was aware of said player.  Many members in the league were angered by the pick.  Also, Cuddely Corn Dogs had an imaginary spot on his roster until Street was called up.  This also angered other members.  Huston Street went on to win '''Rookie of the Year'''.
Several teams in the league are now scouting players in the Little League World Series, in hopes of creating a good crop of ultimate-minor league players. Dwight K. Schrute was the first manager to recruit a LLWS star, claiming Dante Bichette Jr. in the 18th round of this years draft. History Buffs from the Catchphrase institute (a center for the study of Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball) spectualte this could lead into the Dante Bichette Jr. Debacle, later down the road.

== The Politics of the League ==

'''Nine-Minute Monday: Why do we need the politics of the league, anyways?'''

''Current Style of Government: Controlled Dictatorship''

''Previous Style of Government (Years 1 &amp; 2): Oppressive Dictatorship''*

*Note: During The Summer of da Fibonaccistein, the Government was of a '''Laissez Faire style'''.

'''''The Near Complete Coup d'Etat''''' 

During the winter after completion the second season, the members of The League felt that a change in commisioner was essential to keep order in the league. All but two members believed this. The members felt they were being supressed by an unfair dictatorship, and wanted a more fair democratic league. Other complaints included the changing of stat categories to remove losses as a stat. However, this revolution was not completed because the current commisioner said &quot;And I'm getting pretty sick of you guys complaining. If you all hate me and my rules and ideas so much, then I'll just quit.&quot; Nobody wanted him to quit, so the revolution never went through.

'''''We Want Democracy!! AKA Give Me Liberty, or Give Me Death!! AKA FREEDDOOMMMM!'''''

Most of the members in the league were for a league where they got a say in every single decison that is made (for the people, by the people...) , rather than an autocratic style of government.  The league members made a compromise over what type of Political system they would follow.  The Commish still has absolute power, but the members of the league can have a say in what goes on all the time.

== The Impersionation Era ==

'''When the Other GM's Were Left in the Dark'''

The '''Near Complete Coup d'Etat''' was a result of the comissioner abusing his powers in a series of incidents including the '''Jorge Sosa Incedent''', during what is now called '''The Impersonation Era'''. The commisioner took over control of the team Micheal Scott, without the consent of the owner.  This led to trading players in deals not ratified by the owner of Micheal Scott.  This outraged the league, because the comisioner was abusing his powers.  This madness was eventually stopped, due to pushiong from the league, and the breaking of the communication barrier between Micheal Scott and the rest of the league.  This subject of the commisioner's powers and how they were to be used, and had been used was finally put to rest that winter following the '''Wildwood Accords'''.

== The Wildwood Accords ==

Following the league's outrage during the '''Impersionation Era''', and events like the '''Jorge Sosa Incedent''', and the '''Dante Bichette Jr. Debacle''', the league resorted to a rebellious and chaotic state in the off-season between the 2nd and 3rd seasons, '''The Near Complete Coup d'Etat'''.  The '''Northern Alliance''', led by Bread-and-Butter, The Godfather, Dwight K. Schrute, da Fibonaccienstien, and pork fried rice, held a meeting at a scenic, private, and undisclosed location on Wildwood Drive.  The Northern Alliance was opposed by the '''Loyalists''', consisting of Cuddely Corn Dogs and Nine-Minute Monday.  Like Switzerland in World War II, Mafiossa, Busy Bumble Bees and Micheal Scott were all neutral during this time of heightened tension.  The Northern Alliance set up negotiating terms for the Loyalists about stat categories, and administrative powers.  The two parties communicated and established the '''Wildwood Accords''', which stated that the Commissioner not do anything stupid, and the Northern Alliance would shut up.  The style of government would forever change from an Oppressive Dictatorship to a Controlled Dictatorship.  The Northern Alliance then proceeded to watch season one of The Office.

== The Most Controversial Kid in the League ==

Since day one, over 3 years ago, '''The Godfather''' has been the most controversial kid in the league. Because of him, many long and stressful arguments occurred. He in many ways was the real reason why the league was locked down for those two longand frustrating weeks. He believed that da Fibonaccistein (acting commissioner while The Cuddely Corn Dogs was on vacation) was acting like a dictator, and was using his “powers” way over the limit. The Godfather believed that the only way to stop this madness was to call the real Commissioner. The Commissioner then locked down the whole league because of how poorly da Fibonaccistein ran the league.
The whole league believes he will never shut up. He always has to have his way. In year two, Mafiossa and The Godfather were always at each other’s necks. Every time Mafiossa posted something, the Godfather would always fight back. These fights would last for days on end. However these two teams have fixed things up, yet small disagreements occur every once in a while.
Probably the biggest reason why he is very controversial is because he always vetoed trades that he accepted already. During year one, he always accepted trades, then realized he made a mistake. He always got help from his cousin that guided him on every decision. He also got a lot of help from an outside source. Since year one, vetoing trades have not been allowed because of this kid. He not only vetoed his own trades, he vetoed other kids trades. If the person he wanted very badly was traded to someone else’s team, he would veto the trade because he was upset that he could get the player(s) he wanted.
Many People also do not like how he won’t trade '''Manny Ramirez''' and '''Vladimir Guerrero'''. He has had both of them since year two, and will not trade them. People have offered a lot, but he feels that they are his “'''Franchise Players'''”. Will he ever trade any of them? Only time will tell. However there have been reports that he was thinking of trading Vlad earlier this year, but has yet to trade him.

'''Illegal projectiles and Member Property'''

After the completion of the draft of Year 2, the members of the league decided to play a good game of [[taps]] on Mafiossa's ultra-expensive basketball hoop.  His hoops sounded great the whole game, until the incident occured.  The Godfather was playing very intensely throughout the whole game.  Finally, it was The Godfather's turn at the foul line.  The game was getting close, and The Godfather would have done anything to win.  The other members of the league were softly tossing the ball against the backboard.  However, The Godfather actually took a crow hop and threw the basketball as hard as humanly possible at it.  It is rumored that the ball actually traveled faster than the speed of sound.  This is noted because some members of the league report seeing the ball hit the backboard before they heard it.  However, this was never proven by scientific means.  After that, the backboard began to make weird noises.  The Godfather denied any foul play in throwing the ball, but the members of the league continued to tease him about it.  Finally, the Godfather got so steamed that he snapped.  At first, The Godfather walked away and was about to go home.  However, he turned around mysteriously.  The members said, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;  The Godfather singled out Busy Bumble Bees, saying &quot;I'm gonna kill Busy Bumble Bees!!!!&quot;  However, he never fought BBB, because the other members broke up the conflict.  The Godfather and Busy Bumble Bees had heated arguments soon after the conflict, but they now are back to having a good friendship.  

This infamous event would start an on going conflict between The Godfather and Mafiossa the whole year.  Mafiossa says that the board is broken, but the Godfather disagrees.  The current state of the backboard is still disputed today.

== The Open Mic Night Catastrophe ==

On a Friday night in the winter before the 3rd season, many members of the League were spending some time at the open mic night that their school was putting on. Most of the problems were put behind members this night. In the middle of the show, The Godfather had recieved a text message from the commissioner saying that he had to create a new league because of a rule about a trade dedline.  
Here is the actual phone conversation that took place during the open-mic night:

''The Godfather:'' Hello?

''Bread-and-Butter:'' Ya, Whats up?

''The Godfather:'' B &amp; B, you need to get back to your house now!  Cuddely Corn Dogs is going crazy! He is trying to start a new league or something, I;m tr;ying to fight it but no one will listen to me.  So far Nine-Minute Monday is the only one to join!  Get back here, now!! I need backup!

''Bread-and-Butter:'' I'm on it!

Bread-and-Butter felt it was pivotal that he go home to try and see what was happening.  He left the school and returned home in a record setting 1 minute and 32 seconds.  He signed on immediately and gave The Godfather the backup he needed.  Unfortunatley, he was too late.  The old league was destroyed in favor of a new league.  The reason for this decision is still disclosed to this date.  Many people speculate that this was &quot;'''the straw the broke the camel's back'''&quot;, in that the revolution was at its peak during this point.  There was much tension during this time, and the coup d'etat was incredibly close to happening.  The Northern Alliance and the Loyalists went on to sign the '''Wildwood Accords'''.  (For more information, see The Wildwood Accords.)
The decison to destroy the old league page upsetted many members of the league because they had signed up early enough to get a very nice and low '''league number'''. Many members felt that this was not crucial for the league.  Unfortunately, nothing could be done to save the old yahoo league.

== Best/ Worst Team Moves ==

2004: Cuddely Corn Dogs takes '''Carl Crawford''' in the 13th round, '''Mike Young''' in the 16th, and '''Johan Santana''' in the 17th

2004: Cuddely Corn Dogs trades '''Johan Santana''' for '''Randy Wolf'''

2005: The Godfather trades his entire pitching staff for '''Randy Johnson'''. 

2005: The Godfather agrees to a trade with Bread-and-Butter in which he receives '''Bobby Abreu''', making him his new franchise player.  The next day, da Fibonaccistein used his hypnotic powers to persuade the Godfather to trade Bobby Abreu for '''Wily Mo Pena''' and the injured '''Curt Schilling'''.  After breaking out of the hypnotic spell and accepting the trade, The Godfather's first words were: Who is Wily Mo Pena?

2005: pork fried rice trades '''Jake Peavy''' and '''Johnny Estrada''' for '''Jason Bay''' and '''Luis Ayala'''; He then proceeds to drop Bay. 

2005: pork fried rice drops '''Dontrelle Willis'''

2006: Dwight K. Schrute drops '''Willy Taveras'''; 11 days later Taveras begins a 30 game hit streak

2006: Dwight K. Schrute never kept '''Jermaine Dye''', one of his players he traded his number one pick for. Dye ends up going .315/44/120

2006: In early season action, Dwight K. Schrute drops '''Justin Morneau''' who ends up going .321/34/130 and is in contention for the American League Most Valuable Player

== Hall of Champions ==
'''2004:''' 1st Place: Dwight K. Schrute

2nd Plece: Cuddely Corn Dogs

3rd Place: Mafiossa

'''2005:''' 1st Place: Cuddely Corn Dogs*
      
2nd Place: Nine-Minute Monday*
      
3rd Place: da Fibonaccistein
      
*Cuddely Corn Dogs and Nine-Minute Monday tied in the league championship game. However, due 
to the yahoo default tie-breaker, team ERA, Cuddely Corn Dogs was awarded the victory. The true winner of 2005's league is still in debate today.

'''2006:''' 1st Place: da Fibonaccistein

2nd Place: Nine-Minute Monday

3rd Place: Cuddely Corn Dogs

Once again, Nine-Minute Monday reached the championship game, yet came up just short of his goal.

== On-Going Jokes ==
The Godfather: Isn;t Cory patterson play sports?

The Godfather: Stop making fun of my stupided!

The Godfather: Now he is going on the because not!

The Godfather: I believe we should not start over from scrath

When The Godfather believed we should not start over from scrath, his &quot;C&quot; key was broken due to spillage of Coca-Cola.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With the concept of the limit of a complex function now established, we can now introduce the differentiability of a complex function.

'''2.3.1.: Derivatives'''

''Definition'':
Let f be a complex valued function defined in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the '''derivative''' of f at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dz}(z_0)\equiv f'(z_0) := \lim_{\Delta z\rightarrow 0} \frac {f(z_0+ \Delta z) - f(z_0)}{\Delta z}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number.

Provided that this limit exists, f is said to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; is any complex number, so it may approach zero in a number of different directions.  However, for this limit to exist, it must reach a unique limit f'(&lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;) independent of how &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero.  For this reason, the complex conjugation &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto \bar z&lt;/math&gt; is nowhere differentiable.
To see this consider the limit

&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{w \to 0} \frac{ \overline{z + w}- \overline{z}}{w}
= \lim_{w \to 0} \frac{ \overline{w}}{w}
= \lim_{x, y \to 0} \frac{{x -y i}}{x + y i}  \, . &lt;/math&gt;

For
&lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; this limit is &lt;math&gt; -1&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; this limit is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, so there does not exist a unique complex limit.

Yerushalmi kugel is named after the city of Jerusalem. Legend has it that it originated in Jerusalem with the followers of the Vilna Gaon in the 18th century.

==Ingredients==
*8 oz (200g) noodles ([[Cookbook:Egg noodles|egg noodles]] are preferred, but others work fine as well)
*2/3 cup (160g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] ([[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]] is helpful because it's more obvious when it begins to brown)
*4 Tbsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*handful of raisins
*1-2 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]

==Procedure==
#Boil noodles according to the instructions and drain.
#Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, and add 1/3 cup (80g) of sugar.
#Stir continuously until the sugar begins to brown. Remove from heat.
#The sugar will continue to brown for a few more minutes, creating a thick caramel.
#Add the caramel to the noodles.
#Add the sugar, eggs, cinnamon, pepper, and raisins. Stir.
#Bake in a pan at 350 (180c) until the top begins to brown (about 40 minutes).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Roads and Streets==
These two simple transportation thoroughfares are arguably the most important in any city. Streets are mainly quiet residential streets, and roads are usually city-centre trunk routes. These are the purposes which roads and streets are given in the &quot;definitions&quot; below.

[[Image:streetdiagram.png|200px|left]]
'''Streets''' (to the left) are the small, usually residential routes which are never too congested. They often come in the form of cul-de-sacs (streets with a dead end). They are almost always unmarked and are commonly separated from the pavement by a narrow strip of grass or trees. Another notable feature about streets is that, at junctions, the corners are much more curved than roads, making turning much easier for vehicles.  Often, they are four car-widths wide: two widths for opposing traffic and two more for cars to park on either side against the curb.

[[Image:roaddiagram.png|200px|right]]
'''Roads''' (to the right) are typically wider and busier than streets.  They often contain multiple lanes of traffic in either direction.  Where streets have stop signs to control traffic, roads have signals using a system of lights to alert drivers when to cross an intersection.  These lights are used to increase efficiency of traffic flow.

Some syllabi have intergration in C1, others have it in C2.

== re: [[A-level Mathematics]] Completing the square form. ==

Our class learnt the form &lt;math&gt;a(x+d)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt; for completing the square, and that's also the form used in the (OCR endorsed) textbook. Hope that helps. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 15:09, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

== Vandalism ==

Hey, thanks for telling us about the vandal on [[WB:VIP]]. I am almost done reverting and deleting all his/her work. In the future, do not blank a page a vandal created because then it's a little bit harder to catch his/her edits in one swoop. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:25, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== Tagging merged pages for deletion... ==

Hi,

When you merge 2 pages that have multiple contributors, it's really better to have the edit history merged as well. I'm not sure how many you did, so far I only saw [[A-level_Mathematics/C3/Natural_Logarithms_and_Graphs]]. If you could let me know what page that was merged to, I'll be happy to merge the histories for you (only admins can do it, but it only takes a few seconds, and we're really supposed to do that in compliance with the GFDL). If there are other pages you merged, let me know about them too (you ''should'' merge the content first via copy-paste, just don't put them up for deletion, but rather request a history merger).  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

:Huh... had to make a template: use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{now merged|&lt;destination page name&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to mark pages for this. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:12, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== S1 help? ==

I was wondering if you would like some help on the S1 / S2 sections in the A-level OCR textbook collection. I've just finished those (along with C1,C2, FP1 and D1, if any assistance is desired). I've added a little to S1 already, about combinations and Permutations, and would like to be able to continue to help.

== Acted on you merge request ==
Content of Complex Analysis Handbook is now merged on the [[Complex Analysis]] book. Take a look to see if something can be improved.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:30, 11 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Summary of the Act==
“The Coastal Management Act provides enabling authority for the State to prepare and administer a coastal management program. The Act does not establish new regulations or laws; it is designed to establish procedural requirements for the Department of Natural Resources to develop and implement a program for the sustainable development and protection of coastal resources. It establishes the Department of Natural Resources as the State agency to receive and disburse federal grant monies. It establishes the Governor as the approving authority of the program and as the person that must submit the program to the federal government for approval under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act. It requires other State agencies to cooperate with the Coastal Resources Division when exercising their activities within the coastal area.”  [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf Department of Natural Resources, Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, Appendix G]

==Summary of the Act==
“This legislation created the Coastal Marshlands Protection Committee which grants, denies, revokes, and amends all permits provided for by the Act and details the process to handle grievances of a party in relation to any rules or regulations adopted by the Board of Natural Resources. The Act outlines the powers and duties of the DNR and the Board of Natural Resources as to coastal marshlands. Marshlands may not be filled, drained, dredged, or otherwise altered without a permit from the committee. The Act indicates the process for obtaining a permit and explains the points reviewed by the committee prior to issuing or denying a permit. It authorizes the inspection of marshlands by officers and conservation rangers of the DNR to verify compliance with the rules, regulations, and permits, and enforcement in the case of noncompliance.” [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf Department of Natural Resources, Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, Appendix G]

==Summary of the Act==
“Passed by the Georgia legislature in 2005, this law promotes land conservation by providing funds to state and local governments and encouraging partnerships with the private sector. The law also establishes the Georgia Land Conservation Revolving Loan Fund that will be managed by the Georgia Environmental Facility Authority (GEFA), which will provide a variety of funding options by which conservation easements or fee simple interest can be purchased. Operations of the fund and the authority are overseen
by the Georgia Land Conservation Council, which is responsible for reviewing all project proposals and making recommendations for the distribution of funds. The act directs Georgia DNR to establish a land conservation program consistent with these purposes, to work with local governments to identify and review land conservation projects, and to maintain a geographic information system designed to serve as a comprehensive database of land protection activities. It also directs the Department to work with the Georgia Forestry Commission, State Soil and Water Conservation Commission, University System of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service and others to provide information and technical support to facilitate land conservation projects. Nongovernmental organizations are also encouraged to provide education to public and private sectors and to partner with counties, cities, and the Department on land conservation projects.” [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf Department of Natural Resources, Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, Appendix G]

==General Description== 
&quot;Groundwater withdrawals of greater than 100,000 gallons per day require a permit from the Environmental Protection Division.  Permit applications that request an increase in water usage must also submit a water conservation plan approved by the Director of Environmental Protection Division (O.C.G.A. 12-5-96). The Environmental Protection Division has prepared a comprehensive groundwater management plan for coastal Georgia that addresses water conservation measures, protection from saltwater encroachment, reasonable uses, preservation for future development and economic development issues. The Memorandum of Agreement with the Environmental Protection Division ensures that permits issued under the Groundwater Use Act must be consistent with the Coastal Management Program.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf Department of Natural Resources, Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, Appendix G]

==History of the Act==


==Specific provisions of the Act==
;Reasonable Use: Before issuing a permit, EPD will evaluate the reasonableness of the use by applying the criteria listed in the statute, including the number of persons using the water source; the nature, severity, or duration of any impairment adversely affecting availability for other users; any injury to public health, safety or welfare; the kinds of activities proposed; the importance and necessity of the uses and the extent of any injury caused to other water uses; diversion from or reduction in flows in other watercourses or aquifers; prior investment in land; and other relevant factors.  § 12-5-31(e).

;Duration: Municipal and industrial permits are issued for a term of 10 to 50 years, after which they must be renewed.  Farm permits are issued for an unlimited term.

;Quantity: Municipal and industrial permits are issued for a specific quantity determined by reasonable use.  Farm permits issued after 1991 also have defined quantities.  Farm permits issued before 1991 are based on pump capacity as of July 1, 1988.

;Revocation and Modification: Municipal and industrial permits can be revoked by EPD for extended periods of nonuse.  Farm permits cannot be revoked after an initial use, though farm permits can be revoked if water was never withdrawn.

;Transfers: Water permits are not transferable, except that farm permits may be transferred along with the accompanying land.

==General Purpose==
Large water withdrawals are regulated by Georgia EPD through a water permit system based on the concept of reasonable use.  Any user withdrawing or diverting more than 100,000 gallons-per-day is required to obtain a permit from EPD.

==Reasonable Use==
Before issuing a permit, EPD will evaluate the reasonableness of the use by applying the criteria listed in the statute, including the number of persons using the water source; the nature, severity, or duration of any impairment adversely affecting availability for other users; any injury to public health, safety or welfare; the kinds of activities proposed; the importance and necessity of the uses and the extent of any injury caused to other water uses; diversion from or reduction in flows in other watercourses or aquifers; prior investment in land; and other relevant factors.  § 12-5-31(e).

==Specific provisions of the Act==

;Duration: Municipal and industrial permits are issued for a term of 10 to 50 years, after which they must be renewed.  Farm use permits are issued for an unlimited term, except in the Flint River Basin in which farm use permits issued after March 2006 have a term limit of 25 years .

;Quantity: Municipal and industrial permits are issued for a specific quantity determined by reasonable use.  All Farm use permits are based on pump capacity as of July 1, 1988.

;Revocation and Modification:  Municipal and industrial permits can be revoked by EPD for extended periods of nonuse.  Farm permits cannot be revoked after an initial use, though farm permits can be revoked if water was never withdrawn.

;Transfers: Water permits are not transferable, except that farm permits may be transferred along with the accompanying land.

==Summary of the Act==
The purpose of this Act is to maintain in-stream flow in times of drought by providing incentives for farmers to take acres out of irrigation.  It allows EPD to pay farmers to stop irrigating.  After a drought is declared, EPD can hold a voluntary seller’s auction, allowing farmers to offer prices per acre at which they are willing to stop irrigating.  If the target is not achieved, EPD has authority to make further reductions on a “non-voluntary” basis.

==History of the Act==
A 2001 auction eliminated irrigation from surface water on 33,101 acres at an average price of $135 per acre and a total cost of $4.5 million.  The funding came from Georgia’s share of the tobacco settlement money.

==Summary of the Act==

===General Summary===
This Act asks EPD to develop and propose a comprehensive statewide water management plan.  This Act doesn’t change any water laws or policies; instead, it merely asks EPD to develop a state plan, which will then be considered by the legislature in 2008.  Any proposed changes to water laws or policies will be considered in the planning process.

===Policy===
The policy behind the Act states, “Georgia manages water resources in a sustainable manner to support the state’s economy, to protect public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life of all citizens.”  The EPD plan should be consistent with this statement.

==History of the Act==


==Specific provisions of the Act==

;The Water Council: The Water Council, created by this Act, consists of various legislative members and appointments and the heads of state departments with water related responsibilities.  The Water Council is responsible for providing input in the planning process, coordinating input from various state departments, and ultimately approving the version of the plan that will be submitted to the legislature for final approval.  EPD must present a draft plan to the water council by July 1, 2007.

;Public Participation: EPD must solicit input from stakeholders and the public in the development of the water plan.  Relevant stakeholders include businesses, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and others.

;Process for Plan Adoption and Approval: The water plan will be presented for approval by the General Assembly by the 2008 legislative session.  There are four possible ways for the water plan to go into effect:
:#The General Assembly approves the proposed plan
:#If the General Assembly rejects the first proposed plan, the Water Council may submit alternative plans through the 20th day of the session
:#The General Assembly can enact its own version of a plan, or
:#If no plan is approved or enacted by the legislature, then the initial version of the first plan presented to the General Assembly will automatically take effect.

==Summary of the Act==
This Act requires the State to prepare an environmental effects report for any state funded construction project that may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  This requirement applies to “land disturbing activities,” which includes scraping, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, or building a dam.  It applies to government projects, projects funded by government grants, or municipal projects receiving more than $250,000 or more than 50% government funding, but it does not apply to agriculture or private developments.

==History of the Act==


==Specific provisions of the Act==

;Environmental Effects Reports: If the project will have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental effects report must be prepared.  The report should explain any environmental impacts, including effect on water quality and quantity, and also environmental effects that cannot be avoided, possible alternatives, and proposed mitigation.
;Openness to the Public: The government agency must make the environmental effects report available to the public, and notify the public about the project.  If at least 100 people request a public hearing, then the state must hold a hearing a take public comments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Minumum Counter Example==

Is it really appropriate for the &quot;amateur&quot; to consider the mininum counter-example approach as a 
format for proving the 4CT?  How can we compete with the experience and sophisticated computing 
power of the professionals? 

[[User:Jillbones|Jillbones]] 18:52, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

Simple math tells us that the fully triangulated planar graph for which Grinberg's graph
is the dual would have only 24 vertices.  Does such a graph exist? 

[[User:Jillbones|Jillbones]] 01:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

  &quot;The dual of a fully-triangulated planar graph is a cubic planar graph. 
Cubic means that every vertex has 3 edges. However, not every cubic planar graph has a Hamiltonian cycle -- if it did it would prove the Four Color Theorem.&quot; 

Can anyone explain why this is true?  In your explanation, kindly state
how each graph was created and which feature of the graph is being 
colored; ie (face, edge or vertex).  For instance, in the map, it is the faces that are being colored.  If, in the graph equivalent, the colorability of the faces is also being considered, describe how such a graph equivalent
is achieved.  If, in the graph equivalent; the colorability of the vertices
is being considered; describe how that graph equivalent was generated.

[[User:Jillbones|Jillbones]] 22:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:Ok. We have a fully-triangulated planar graph G, and are trying to four-colour its vertices. This is equivalent to trying to four-colour the faces of the dual graph, which is cubic. A standard trick involving the Klein four group means that four-colouring the faces of a cubic planar graph is equivalent to three-colouring the edges. But if any cubic graph had a hamiltonian cycle, then we could easily three-colour the edges: just alternate red, blue along the hamiltonian cycle, and colour the remaining edges green. [[User:131.111.8.96|131.111.8.96]] 10:47, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

This works iff the faces of the dual have a one-to-one correspondence with the vertics of G.
Fortunately, this is always true whenever G is fully triangulated.  By design, G itself is
the dual of a map or graph.  The generating map is 3-regular and the generating graph is \
a cubic planar graph.  If M is the generating original map or graph, then G is the dual of M 
and M is the dual of G.

This means that if M is a 3-regular map or a cubic planar graph and M is 3 edge colorable.
then M is 4 face colorable and the 4CT is true.  You do not need the &quot;triangulation&quot;!

Of course, not all cubics have a &quot;triangulation&quot; for a dual!</text>

== Enumerations ==

One special case of the &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; declaration is the ''enumeration'' — a data type where none of the constructor functions have any arguments:

 data Month = January | February | March | April | May | June | July
              | August | September | October | November | December

You can mix constructors that do and do not have arguments, but then the result is not called an enumeration. The following example is ''not'' an enumeration because the last constructor takes three arguments:

 data Colour = Black | Red | Green | Blue | Cyan
             | Yellow | Magenta | White | RGB Int Int Int

As you will see further on when we discuss classes and derivation, there are practical reasons to distinguish between what is and isn't an enumeration.

Incidentally, the &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt; datatype is an enumeration:

 data Bool = False | True
     deriving (Eq, Ord, Enum, Read, Show, Bounded)

== Named Fields (Record Syntax) ==

Consider a datatype whose purpose is to hold configuration settings.
Usually, when you extract members from this type, you really only care
about one or two of the many settings.  Moreover, if many of
the settings have the same type, you might often find yourself
wondering &quot;wait, was this the fourth or ''fifth'' element?&quot;  One
way to clarify is to write accessor functions.  Consider the
following made-up configuration type for a terminal program:

&lt;pre&gt;
data Configuration =
    Configuration String          -- user name
                  String          -- local host
                  String          -- remote host
                  Bool            -- is guest?
                  Bool            -- is super user?
                  String          -- current directory
                  String          -- home directory
                  Integer         -- time connected
              deriving (Eq, Show)
&lt;/pre&gt;
You could then write accessor functions, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;
getUserName (Configuration un _ _ _ _ _ _ _) = un
getLocalHost (Configuration _ lh _ _ _ _ _ _) = lh
getRemoteHost (Configuration _ _ rh _ _ _ _ _) = rh
getIsGuest (Configuration _ _ _ ig _ _ _ _) = ig
-- and so on...
&lt;/pre&gt;
You could also write update functions to update a single element.  Of
course, if you add or remove an element in the configuration later,
all of these functions now have to take a different number of
arguments.  This is quite annoying and is an easy place for bugs to
slip in.  Thankfully, there's a solution: we simply give names to the
fields in the datatype declaration, as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
data Configuration =
    Configuration { username      :: String,
                    localhost     :: String,
                    remotehost    :: String,
                    isguest       :: Bool,
                    issuperuser   :: Bool,
                    currentdir    :: String,
                    homedir       :: String,
                    timeconnected :: Integer
                  }
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will automatically generate the following accessor functions for
us:

&lt;pre&gt;
username :: Configuration -&gt; String
localhost :: Configuration -&gt; String
-- etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;
This also gives us a convenient update method. Here is a short
example for a &quot;post working directory&quot; and &quot;change directory&quot;
functions that work on &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt;s:

&lt;pre&gt;
changeDir :: Configuration -&gt; String -&gt; Configuration
changeDir cfg newDir =
    if directoryExists newDir -- make sure the directory exists
      then cfg{currentdir = newDir} -- change our current directory
      else error &quot;directory does not exist&quot;

postWorkingDir :: Configuration -&gt; String
postWorkingDir cfg = currentdir cfg -- retrieve our current directory
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, in general, to update the field &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in a datatype &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;, you write &lt;code&gt;y{x=z}&lt;/code&gt;. You can change more than one; each
should be separated by commas, for instance, &lt;code&gt;y{x=z, a=b, c=d}&lt;/code&gt;.

{{body note|1=

Those of you familiar with object-oriented languages might be tempted, after all of this talk about &quot;accessor functions&quot; and &quot;update methods&quot;, to think of the &lt;code&gt;y{x=z}&lt;/code&gt; construct as a setter method, which modifies the value of x in a pre-existing y. It is '''not''' like that – remember that in Haskell [[Haskell/Variables and functions#Variables in imperative languages|variables are immutable]]. Therefore, using the example above, if you do something like 
&lt;code&gt;conf2 = changeDir conf1 &quot;/opt/foo/bar&quot;&lt;/code&gt; 
conf2 will be defined as a Configuration which is just like conf1 except for having &quot;/opt/foo/bar&quot; as its currentdir, but conf1 will remain unchanged.
}}

=== It's only sugar ===

You can, of course, continue to pattern match against
&lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt;s as you did before.  The named fields are simply
syntactic sugar; you can still write something like:

&lt;pre&gt;
getUserName (Configuration un _ _ _ _ _ _ _) = un
&lt;/pre&gt;
But there is no need to do this.

Finally, you can pattern match against named fields as in:

&lt;pre&gt;
getHostData (Configuration {localhost=lh,remotehost=rh})
  = (lh,rh)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This matches the variable &lt;code&gt;lh&lt;/code&gt; against the &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; field in
the &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt; and the variable &lt;code&gt;rh&lt;/code&gt; against the
&lt;code&gt;remotehost&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt;. These matches will succeed,
of course.  You could also constrain the matches by putting
values instead of variable names in these positions, as you would for
standard datatypes.

You can create values of &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt; in the old way as shown in
the first definition below, or in the named-field's type, as shown in
the second definition:
&lt;pre&gt;

         currentdir=&quot;/&quot;,
         homedir=&quot;/&quot;,
         timeconnected=0 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
The first way is much shorter, but the second is much clearer.

== Parameterized Types ==

Parameterized types are similar to &quot;generic&quot; or &quot;template&quot; types in other languages.  A parameterized type takes one or more type parameters.  For example, the Standard Prelude type &lt;tt&gt;Maybe&lt;/tt&gt; is defined as follows:

 data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

This says that the type &lt;tt&gt;Maybe&lt;/tt&gt; takes a type parameter &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;.  You can use this to declare, for example:

 lookupBirthday :: [Anniversary] -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe Anniversary

The &lt;tt&gt;lookupBirthday&lt;/tt&gt; function takes a list of birthday records and a string and returns a &lt;code&gt;Maybe Anniversary&lt;/code&gt;.  Typically, our interpretation is that if it finds the name then it will return &lt;tt&gt;Just&lt;/tt&gt; the corresponding record, and otherwise, it will return &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;.

You can parameterize &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;newtype&lt;/tt&gt; declarations in exactly the same way.  Furthermore you can combine parameterized types in arbitrary ways to construct new types.

=== More than one type parameter ===

We can also have more than one type parameter. An example of this is the &lt;tt&gt;Either&lt;/tt&gt; type:

 data Either a b = Left a | Right b

For example:

 pairOff :: Int -&gt; Either Int String
 pairOff people
   | people &lt; 0 = Right &quot;Can't pair off negative number of people.&quot;
   | people &gt; 30 = Right &quot;Too many people for this activity.&quot;
   | even people = Left (people `div` 2)
   | otherwise = Right &quot;Can't pair off an odd number of people.&quot;
 
 groupPeople :: Int -&gt; String
 groupPeople people = case pairOff people of
                        Left groups -&gt; &quot;We have &quot; ++ show groups ++ &quot; group(s).&quot;
                        Right problem -&gt; &quot;Problem! &quot; ++ problem

In this example &lt;tt&gt;pairOff&lt;/tt&gt; indicates how many groups you would have if you paired off a certain number of people for your activity. It can also let you know if you have too many people for your activity or if somebody will be left out. So &lt;tt&gt;pairOff&lt;/tt&gt; will return either an Int representing the number of groups you will have, or a String describing the reason why you can't create your groups.

=== Kind Errors ===

The flexibility of Haskell parameterized types can lead to errors in type declarations that are somewhat like type errors, except that they occur in the type declarations rather than in the program proper.  Errors in these &quot;types of types&quot; are known as &quot;kind&quot; errors.  You don't program with kinds: the compiler infers them for itself.  But if you get parameterized types wrong then the compiler will report a kind error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Elizabethan, and Jacobean ==

In Every Man and His Humor (1599), Ben Jonson offers a definition of comedy: I would fain here one of these ''autumne''-judgements define once, ''Quid sit comoedia?'' if he cannot, let him content himself with Cicero's definition (till he have strength to propose himself a better) who would have a ''Comedie'' to be ''Imitatio vitae'', ''Speculum consuetudinis'', ''Imago veritatis''; a thing throughout pleasant, and ridiculous, and accommodated to the correction of manners.

The Cambridge footlights are a college comedy group from Cambridge University. Several well known actors stared out as FootLights

== Sketch Comedy ==

== The Office ==
The Office was a trigger for the creation of popular situation comedies. Where more classical sitcoms are based on laughter-tracks, catchphrases and clownish behaviour, The Office derived comedy from the observation of modern life. It found humour in the mannerisms, the longing silences and embarrassment that are faced by modern British society and rewrote the rules on what popular television comedy should be. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant showed that popular entertainment could resonate an underlying moral message through humour and shaped a format that many future comedies would successfully emulate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An alternative: 
My experience of traditional Filipino Adobo has been that it does not contain either potato, apple cider vinegar or blackbean paste. 
Agreed, any meat (whether chicken or pork or a combination of both) for Adobo should always contain bones, but authentic Tagalog adobo is prepared with Datu Puti (a form of white rice-wine vinegar) - the flavour is softer than regular vinegar - (use 1 cup Datu Puti and 1 cup water), add a splash of soy (for colour) and the same amount of fish sauce, several cloves of garlic, bay leaves and black pepper corns. No need to brown meat first. Just put all in a saucepan, cover and simmer gently until the liquid is reduced by half. Remove the meat and garlic (save the liquid) and fry gently until it's brown and crispy on the outside. Pour juices over the meat and serve with steamed rice.

I totally agree that traditional Philippine adobo does not contain either potatoes or blackbean paste -- I wonder what region in the Philippines the author came from. I grew up in Manila eating adobo, and my Mom is a fantastic cook, and have never ever eaten (or cooked) adobo with potatoes and black bean sauce! I find apple cider vinegar too strong, so I normally use a lighter variety - if you can't find Datu Puti, you may dilute the apple cider vinegar with a bit of water. I also like to add a teaspoon or so of a good white wine, for added flavor. To comment on using 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup water: that sounds like too much -- you might end up have adobo soup, unless you're using tons of meat. Also, some people prefer dry adobo, which is achieved by frying the meat in a little oil after it has been tenderized by simmering and not adding back the simmer sauce; or a wetter version, when you add back some or all of the simmer sauce after frying the meat. Serve with plenty of steaming white rice. Yum! [ChefMom]

 Adobo in the Philippines is surely masarap(delicious)[[User:Morphine54|Morphine54]] ([[User talk:Morphine54|talk]]) 03:58, 2 December 2010 (UTC)


&quot;Datu Puti&quot; is not a type of vinegar, but a brand name of vinegars (they make several types) commonly available in the Philippines. Generally, household vinegars are 5% acidity (4% for Japanese rice vinegar), and in my family, we have always used a 50/50 mix of 5% vinegar to Kikkoman koikuchi shoyu. Patis has always been optional in my house, but always Rufina from Malabon, Metro Manila, when we use it. These days, I use Datu Puti Premium Cane Vinegar, since it is easily available now in the US, or sometimes I like to use Datu Puti's Sukang Iloco for an interesting flavor. Try different vinegars for different flavors! There is more than one suka (vinegar) in the world!

There are as many styles of adobo as there are Filipino cooks! Some prefer adobong puti (white adobo, made with salt instead of soy sauce or patis), some prefer it made with patis, some prefer it made with soy sauce. Some like it dry, some like it soupy (the tradition in my house, which I am told is common to the Manila region), some like it browned, some don't. Some like it &quot;sa gata&quot; (with coconut milk), and some don't. Some like it with a touch of sugar or fruit added, some like it with a bit of siling (hot pepper), or an onion in the pot. Personally, I make it different ways on different days, depending on my mood or the mood of my family. 

I must say, though, that the recipe page as it stands right now calls for a very small amount of garlic, only four cloves, and I have always used an entire head (about 12 cloves) for that much chicken. 6-8 pieces is a whole chicken. Otherwise the current recipe has good proportions: 1/3 c. vinegar to 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1-2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp. peppercorns. That's a good recipe, although in my family, we'd just simmer it until the chicken falls off the bone, and eat it just like that, with lots of sauce to pour over our rice. I must have missed the potatoes and black bean sauce version. LOL

Romy Dorotan, chef of Cendrillon and Purple Yam in New York City, recommends apple cider vinegar for pork adobo, and I very much agree that this works very well. All I know is, my father used to tell everyone I made the best adobo ever. Kind of embarrassing in front of the Filipino family, but everyone likes my cooking, so maybe he's right. I've never met a person that disliked my adobo. In fact, invariably, people rave about it. I like to serve it with roasted pineapple and steamed long grain white rice. [Gemma Seymour-Amper]</text>

Word for word ??? You clearly can't read as there is not one single sentence which is the same in my recipes as in the one you highlight

Oh, and while we are on the subject, you also cant spell. Plagiarism.

You come over all &quot;johnny foreigner&quot; when it comes to length measurements, and yet you use centigrade rather than fahrenheit. A true Englishman - merrily confused! Anyway, I'm about to try this.

Hi, this is a great recipe, and the writing makes for a bit of character... but it doesn't sound done. After I put it in the roast, do I just leave it and go to church, and then come back and it would be done? If this is so, it should say so in the article, or at least a ballpark estimate of how long it'll take. Thanks for the recipe; I'll try this soon. --[[User:Mathwizard44|Mathwizard44]] ([[User talk:Mathwizard44|talk]]) 08:23, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've added proper headings to this cookbook and removed some of the more casual language.  Also when you add comments to this talk page please sign them with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; so we know who wrote what.  I've also removed some terms like &quot;2.5cm to Johnny Foreigner&quot;.  This term is not polite and certainly not true considering that only 2 countries out of 196 countries in the world still use imperial measurements.

''Why are the Wikipedia self-appointed Gestapo always so agressive? Correct and comment on articles to get them to conform to the Wikipedia ideal, by all means, but can't it be done politely !!'' &quot;This is awful&quot;.....Who says ? &quot;Not polite&quot;.. It is perfectly polite. &quot;Name dropping&quot;... absoloute rubbish. And who on earth wrote that bit about not putting Fahrenheit temperatures? No one uses Fahrenheit in cooking, and if they do, they should get a life !!

Given this is meant to be a cookbook and not a work of gravitas I wrote this recipe in a manner that might provide some amusement to those that read and subsequently tried it. The feedback has been amazing... but I also phrased it thus to prove or disprove the notion that Wikipedia is run ''by'' the pedantic and self righteous ''for'' the pedantic and self righteous. I hoped it wasn't.. but was wrong.  
Name dropping ? For goodness sake... all I am doing is giving recognition that that particular improvement to the recipe was someone else's idea !! I don't actually KNOW Heston Blumenthal ! 

And lastly why don't you go and slag off my recipe for Roast Lamb as well, if you have nothing else to do.... here it is... http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Roast_Lamb... but do yourself a favour, and try it first !   [[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 23:02, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Peter. It seems to me that you are the one being aggressive here. Please have a cup of tea and calm down, then look at the following.

:Firstly, it's better if you are logged on when you make edits, and especially when you add comments on talk pages. This provides a clear trail of who made the edits, and allows you to easily sign your comments: just add the following at the end of your comments on talk pages and we'll know who you are: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:Secondly, It was I, not the Irishman, who put the {{tl|cookwork}} tag on this recipe. I did that because I thought it was poorly formatted and sounded like a glory piece, rather than a recipe. It also appeared to have been copied and pasted from a Microsoft Word document, complete with unnecessary line spacing and inappropriate ellipses (which I cleaned up). I left the tag there because there was (still is) more work to be done to make this recipe look like it is a part of the Cookbook. However, I was probably being a little too harsh, and have amended the tag text.

:It is true that this is not Wikipedia, and there is much greater flexibility on what can be written here. However, there are still some guidelines that apply &amp;ndash; I suggest that you take a few moments to read them: [[WB:PAG#Guidelines]], [[Cookbook:Policy]]

:Finally, please don't take offence if someone sees fault in something you put up on Wikibooks. Remember that Wikibooks is here for everyone, not just as a publishing point for you. Please join us in making Wikibooks more complete. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 23:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

My point is the frustration at having had quite a few comments from people who have both tried the recipe, and been amused by it's structure and have contacted me to say so - as I use my own, full name and do not hide behind a pseudonym, they were able to trace me through Google - seems to me to have fulfilled the purpose of a food recipe, even if it does not adhere  stricly to the Wikipedia ideal. I have no idea how to set this out.

It has not been copied from anywhere and every last word and detail has been written and invented by me. I laid it out in a way I considered made it clear and easy to follow. The way it is laid out now makes it harder to follow... one does tend to print out recipes found on the net, rather than have a computer on one's worksurface... 

I have no idea what a glory piece is, but assume it suggests that for some reason I wrote the recipe for my own gratification. What an absurd notion. The reference to Peter is purely to differentiate it from other recipes for the same thing people may put up and also to take a degree of reponsability for its content.

But at least you had the decency to explain your comments. I am afraid my own, and my friends' experiences with other Wiki editors have been quite shocking given their apparent air of graceless superiority, and makes us feel we never want to have anything to do with it again.

Your last paragraph seems to me to be a contradiction. You say Wikipedia is not here as a publishing point for its contributors, and in the next sentence encourage me to make Wikibooks more complete.

COuld it be that Wikicookbook needs to be a little less dogmatic in what it demands of its contributors? It appears I am not the only renegade on the team, but basically our intentions are good... cookery is art, and you know what a pain artists can be !!

[[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 22:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Peter. I can quite understand your frustration, as I have had problems myself. In particular, there can be a sort of policy tunnel vision, both here and on Wikipedia, where the spirit of the policy is forgotten but the letter of the policy is upheld &amp;ndash; sometimes to the detriment of the respective projects. Fortunately, that is less the case here than on Wikipedia.

:Please don't read into what I wrote, that I am accusing you of copying someone else's recipe. What I said was that it appeared to have been copied and pasted from a Microsoft document, thus requiring some additional cleanup. This is nearly always the case, because Microsoft editors nearly always make a mess when text is copied from them. That isn't to say ''don't use them'' &amp;ndash; merely that you need to check what was brought across, and cleanup the mess as you go.

:As to the notion of a glory piece being absurd, you'd be surprised what people get up to on the Internet. I see nothing wrong in taking pride from publishing one's favourite personal recipe, by the way, but there are some books on this site... anyway, let's put that one to the side!

:I see no contradiction in my last paragraph. Wikibooks is here for all of us, not for each of us to get on our soap boxes &amp;ndash; that is all that I meant when I said ''not just as a publishing point for you''. When contributing to Wikibooks, one has to bear in mind the readers, and also the accompanying books. The guidelines help to maintain some sense to what is published here. They are not set in stone, but it does help to follow them at least a little. Recipes that look like recipes are easier to scan when looking for what ingredients need to be bought, for example - and that was one reason that I tagged your recipe with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

once I have learned how to work all the templates etc. 
:As for cookery being art, and artists being a pain, well ... I dare say that I resemble that remark :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 00:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)


:No, sorry, YOU didn't accuse me of plagiarism, that fellow Wright did at the top of the discussion page, and I was only amused how on earth he might have reached such a conclusion when comparing my recipe with the one he makes reference to. Anyway, I am sure you have better things to do than pander to my rants, so I shall slowly Wikify my recipes, but need to learn how to utilse the templates etc first. You see ? I even learned where the ~ is on my keyboard and how to indent a line...

:What is interesting though is that your attitude to my hot-headedness (not really, but I do enjoy being a little cantankerous on occasions!! Must be my age) has brought results, as opposed to the really quite virulent and condescending (and at times frankly bloody rude) attitude of many of the Wikipedia editors some of whom I have made a point of studying over the past few days.It seems ones based in the US are the absolute worst.

:Is there a code of practise when dealing with with contributions that offend the Wiki code of presentation, as, contributors of more serious topics than roast beef, who may be genuine experts in their learned fields, who are then slated for their efforts by WIki staff because the presentation (as opposed to the content) does not fulfill the WIki ideal, must at times feel there is little point in contributing further, which, at least in my opinion, would seem to potentially erode the stature of WIkipedia as a whole. Btw.. Are you an Aussie?[[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 12:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

::Conversation shifted to your [[User_talk:Peterkirchem|talk page]] (in a minute...) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 22:42, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

I have made quite a few minor changes in some of this wonderful recipe, just to improve clarity really. I have tried to collect the ingredients a bit more systematically in one section, so that people know what to get before they start cooking on a Sunday. Nothing worse than trying to find goose fat on a Sunday! I have tried to use metric and imperial measures and temperatures consistently throughout. I hope I haven't detracted from the spirit of this charming writing which has inspired me to make the recipe very soon! Some wonderful tips my mother never taught me! Should I include the traditional Yorkshire Pudding recipe in another page? [[User:SuW|SuW]] ([[User talk:SuW|talk]]) 06:35, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

A delightful edit ! Thank you so much ! It is so nice to see some editing which does not totally trash to original text, and is done so with such good grace. I personally cant stand Yorkshire Pudding (Despite a Grandfather who was Bishop of Bradford!) but, of course it should be included..!! Lol. There are loads of other recipes I have put it. Maybe we can start a partnership and come up with some really good ones. You never know, we could even write a cookbook together !

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
By default, both Xcode and Eclipse/WOLips will configure your application to use Direct Connect.  When your WebObjects application launches, it listens on a particular port (assigned by the WOPort configuration option).  Under a full-blown deployment scenario, this port is used by the mod_WebObjects adaptor or the WebObjects cgi-bin adaptor to communicate between Apache and your application.  However, it's also possible to run in development completely on the Direct Connect port (i.e. without a webserver).  In this configuration, one noteable difference is that all resources are served by the Direct Connect server as opposed to the Apache scenario where resources are served by Apache directly and your WebObjects application only handles application requests.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''Warning'''&lt;/font&gt; - wotaskd relies on direct connect being enabled so that the adaptor can communicate with it. Do not globally disable direct connect on your servers. For example, if you disable direct connect from the WebObjects.properties file in the application server's home directory, you will prevent wotaskd from responding to requests on its assigned port.

=== Turning Off Direct Connect ===
* Configure your Apache to use mod_WebObjects or the cgi-bin adaptor
* Ensure wotaskd is running
* Set WODirectConnectEnabled to false
* Setup your WebServerResources folder so that it is reachable by Apache
* Profit

==== Logan Allred ====
I've heard all the comments
about Direct Connect being evil, and I've been bit many times by its
quirks, but I'd like to know from those that eschew Direct Connect what
their workflow is and how they benefit (especially if they use
Eclipse/WOLips).
  
I still use Direct Connect, mostly because I'm used to the workflow and
have figured out most of the things that can go wrong by now. I like the
fact that all of my development resources are all in one project and it
seems I get some niceties in WOBuilder when using Direct Connect.

Maybe it's because most my projects focus mostly on data and not
presentation (I have only a few graphics and an occasional
stylesheet--though I'm beginning to use stylesheets more), and that I go
back and forth between developing on Windows and Mac (so scripting can
become a pain). My apps have not yet suffered because of the speed of
loading graphics (far more the speed of database access).

It's not that I fear web servers, I'm just lazy :) and not used to a
workflow where I have &quot;split development&quot; instead of &quot;split deployment&quot;.
How do you version and manage your web resources being in a completely
different location than your development resources (do you use resource
folders in Eclipse, or separate projects? or some other nice Eclipse
feature I haven't learned about? manual copying?). How do you handle
deployment across development/staging/production? How much do you have to
customize or modify your projects?

I can definitely see on sites with heavy presentation or dedicated graphic
designers where using the web server would be a real plus, but I'm usually
on a small team of 2-4 developers with minimal presentation.  

I'm sure there's a better workflow than I'm using, I'm curious what
everyone else considers to be development and deployment best practices for
WO. What am I missing out on?

==== Chuck Hill ====
First off, it is not just about images.  It is about having the power of a real webserver and about avoiding problems that only appear when you move to running the app through a real web server.  Think of things like:

* caching, mod_expires is NOT your friend
* HTTPS
* SSI
* Rewrite rules
* headers only present when going through a web server

I'm sure you can think of more differences.  I'd rather develop with all the services I will get in deployment and also find the problems that crop up _before_ the app has been in production for half a day!  I prefer my pain to be at leisure, not in panic.  And, at least on OSX, it is dead easy to get Apache going.

As for work flow, what work flow?  Our &quot;projects&quot;, as seen from the source repository, are a hierarchy of folders.  One is for code and that is where the WO projects go.  Another is DocumentRoot and that is where, well, the document root stuff goes.  Other folders are for docs, design, tests, etc.  It is easy enough to check each one out where it goes.   If your images are mostly static, so much less to do.  If they change a lot, then the designers etc. can check in and out what they need in a way very familiar to them without needing to puzzle over arcane things like an Eclipse project.  Image updates to your local doc root happen the same way that code updates to your workspace does.

For deployment, we have scripts that do command line Ant builds of all the code,tar up all the various resources (doc root included), and just generally make an install package.  Another script on the target server takes that package, untars it, and copies the bits where they need to go.  I don't understand how having to do split installs makes this any easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== WebObjects Wikibooks considered deprecated ===

Look at http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WO/Web+Applications-Development-WO+Component-Binding+Synchronization instead.

=== Overview ===
When you create a subclass of WOComponent, the default configuration is to have all of your bindings automatically synchronized.  Binding synchronization is the process of getting and setting parent and children .wod file bindings during the request-response loop.  While binding synchronization is very convenient, the one downside is that your binding get and set methods can be called multiple times (as many as six) during the request-response loop.  As a result, you should be careful about potential performance problems inside of get and set methods.  If you would rather avoid the potential performance issues, it is possible to disable automatic binding synchronization in your component by simply overriding the synchronizesVariablesWithBindings method to return false as in the below example:

    public boolean synchronizesVariablesWithBindings() {
      return false;
    }

If synchronizesVariablesWithBindings is false, you will use the valueForBinding(bindingName) and setValueForBinding(value, bindingName) methods to get and set the binding value manually.

=== WOComponentContent ===
Because of the way WOComponentContent works, binding is often &quot;backwards&quot; from your intution (often it ends up that your wrapper pushes its title value into your page instead of the other way around).  One way to make your template wrapper component behave the way you expect is to turn off automatic binding synchronization:

  public boolean synchronizesVariablesWithBindings() {
    return false;
  }

  public String pageTitle() {
    return (String)valueForBinding(&quot;pageTitle&quot;);
  }

==== Kieran Kelleher ====
Have a look at WOComponent API valueForBinding and setValueForBinding methods. In your subcomponent, you can define the API (jigsaw icon in WOBuilder. Use lazy initialization to pull bindings on demand. Subcomponents in general pull from parent and push into parent through bindings. Here is an example of a simple manual pull and push of a 'customer' binding:

  public CTCustomer customer()
  {
    if (customer == null) {
      customer = (CTCustomer)valueForBinding(&quot;customer&quot;);
    }
    return customer;
  }
  
  public void setCustomer(CTCustomer newCustomer)
  {
    customer = newCustomer;
    setValueForBinding(customer,&quot;customer&quot;);
  }

Also look at synchronizeVariablesWithBindings to turn on manual binding synchronization (recommended to synchronize on demand rather than 6 times or so through the R-R loop)

==== wojingo ====
If you use lazy initialization in your binding accessor methods as described above, you should also make the component stateless. If you do not make the component stateless you will find that your component may display incorrect values when used in a WORepetition. This situation occurs when the WORepetition's list is changed via a component action and null is returned.  The existing nested component will be reused and the values in the original list will be displayed.

Make the component stateless and override its reset method, setting all instance variables to null. This will make the component behave as expected.

== Overview ==

'''''Furnunculus''''' apparently causes whoever it hits to erupt in boils.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This is one of the classic duelling spells. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] used it first in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 18|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]; he had been goaded into duelling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. The spell hit Draco's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Densaugeo|Densaugeo]] jinx and ricocheted, hitting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. 

== Analysis ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 37|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]] we learn that combining jinxes can have unexpected effects – apparently, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s Furnunculus curse combines with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Jelly legs|Jelly legs]] curse to afflict [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] with little tentacles all over his face. We can't be certain that the boils that afflicted Goyle in the earlier episode were the intended effect; the spell may well have been modified by hitting the Densaugeo spell.

      <comment>[[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Memory Management]] moved to [[WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Memory Management]]: per [[WB:NP]] and Programming isn't a namespace</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
Memory Management in Java is a bit of a black art.  When combined with EOF, there are certain issues that you need to be aware of.  In WebObjects 5.2, there was a major change to the memory management system in EOF that provided support for WeakReferences to EO snapshots rather than only relying on the previous system of reference counting.  This provides for vastly superior memory performance under the same conditions with the same app in 5.2 and above, because there are many cases where references will be released by Java's memory system rather than be held onto by your EOEditingContext.

There is a large overlap between the content about [[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Caching and Freshness|Caching and Freshness]] and that of Memory Management.  Both should be read to fully understand how caching and memory management should play a part in your application design.

=== General Issues ===
One important issue to consider prior to taking any drastic measures is whether or not your application really just requires more memory than you are giving it.  By default, a Java Virtual Machine gives a Java application 64M of memory.  This is not that much memory for an enterprise web application.  You can adjust this by setting the &quot;mx&quot; flag on your VM at launch time (-Xmx256M would give you VM 256M of heap to work with instead of the default 64M).  Other than just hunting aimlessly in your code, profiling your application is the only way to truly determine your application's memory situation.

The following profiling tools have been verified to work with WebObjects:
* JProfiler ( http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html ) has explicit support for WebObjects.  It can automatically update your WebObjects Application launch script to insert itself at runtime to allow you to remotely attach to the application and profile it.

==== Raw Rows ====
The use of [[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Raw Rows|Raw Rows]] can dramatically decrease your memory usage (and increase your application's performance) at the cost of convenience.  This uses less memory than normal EO's, allows better support for fetch limits, and you can still promote them to full-blown EO's when need be.  Check out the [[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Raw Rows|Raw Rows]] topic for more information.

==== Qualify your Fetches ====
If you are not careful when you fetch, you may bring in huge datasets.  When you use an EOFetchSpecification, be mindful to specify the most restrictive EOQualifier that still returns the data you need.  Otherwise, you will be potentially faulting in much more data than your application will use, and you decrease your overall application performance because of the data that must be transferred from your database.

==== Relationships from Enumerated Types to other EO's ====
It is very common to have EO's that represent &quot;Enumerated Types&quot;.  For instance, you might have a bug tracking system that has a Severity entity (with individual instances of &quot;Crasher&quot;, &quot;Minor&quot;, etc) that are referenced by all bugs in the system.  It is tempting to always create relationship back-references (i.e. Bug=&gt;Severity, Severity=&gt;&gt;Bug).  However, be aware that if you create the reference from Severity back to Bug, any time a Bug is added and you properly use the addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey method, EOF will fault in the ENTIRE &quot;bugs&quot; relationship on Severity prior to adding your new bug to the end of the list.  The consequences of this can be crippling to your application.  As the number of bugs increases, it will take longer and longer to add a new bug.  The recommended best practice for this is to only create Bug=&gt;Severity and NOT create the reverse relationship.  In the event that you need to perform that fetch, you can manually construct the EOFetchSpecification rather than use the automatic approach.

Note that this is a filed bug against EOF.  One approach that EOF could use is to only add the object to Severity's bugs relationship if the bugs relationship has already been faulted into memory.  If the array has not yet been faulted, then causing the fault on insert is potentially very expensive.  The reasoning for the current behavior is to maintain the ability to access the newly committed Bug via the Severity bugs relationship prior to committing your transaction (i.e. faulting the relationship from the database wouldn't yet return the newly inserted Bug).  This is very important to maintaining object graph consistency pre-saveChanges, but does come at a high performance cost.

==== Dispose()ing your EOEditingContext ====
Calling dispose() on your EOEditingContext is not strictly required.  When the EOEditingContext is no longer referenced, it will be automatically disposed.  However, the question is how long it takes the GC to get to your object.  If you call dispose() manually, you won't hurt anything, and you immediately decrement the snapshot reference counts.  If your EC is falling out of scope or you set it to null, then it's probably a tossup as to who gets to it first -- GC finalizing your EC or you manually calling dispose().  It is recommended that you dispose() your EOEditingContext when you are in a long running process in a single method where the EOEditingContext will not go out-of-scope until the end of the method.

==== Calling System.gc() ====
Calling System.gc() is usually a bad idea and can cause performance problems in your application.  Additionally, System.gc() is not an order, it is a request, so if your application is relying on this command to execute, you should re-evaluate your application's design, because you may run into problems with this.

==== Anecdotes on editingContext.invalidateAllObjects() ====
It can be tempting to resolve memory problems by calling editingContext.invalidateObject(..) or editingContext.invalidateAllObjects().  Avoid this.  You will only hurt yourself in the long run.  Invalidating is very aggressive and WILL cause exceptions to be thrown if someone in another EOEditingContext is modifying an EO that you invalidate in your EOEditingContext (the shared snapshost will be destroyed, resulting in an exception on .saveChanges in the other context).  It should only be used under very controlled situations where you understand the implications of the method.

===== Chuck Hill =====
As for invalidating objects, this is something to be avoided.  I admit that I have been driven to desperation a couple of times and used this, but only with regrets and reservations.

===== Art Isbell =====
I just have a bias against using invalidateAllObjects() because, for me, it's caused more problems than it's solved.

===== Mike Schrag =====
The couple of times I resorted to this, I regretted it later, because it ended up screwing me.  The biggest thing is you toss snapshots that people might be in the middle of editing, and that's going to cause really funky problems.  It's a really heavy-handed way to go.

==== NSUndoManager ====
One of the most common memory problems people run into with WebObjects is the NSUndoManager.  WebObjects has a particularly cool feature in that it supports an undo stack for EO transactions.  Each time you saveChanges, you push an undoable set of changes onto the stack.  The downside of this behavior is that you end up with strong references to old EO states, which can be deadly in a large EOF operation.

There are several fixes for this.  One is to simply disable the NSUndoManager on your editing context by calling:

  editingContext.setUndoManager(null); 

It has been referenced that setting the undo manager to null may cause issues with deletes under certain circumstances.  In testing this with WebObjects 5.3, the situation could not be reproduced, but if you use WebObjects 5.2 or lower, you should be aware that you might run into problems.

The recommended alternative in this case is to disable the registration of undo events by calling:

  editingContext.undoManager().disableUndoRegistration();

Note that setting the undo levels to 0 using setLevelsOfUndo() does '''not''' work, as 0 means no limit!

Prior to 5.2, the NSUndoManager had effectively infinite undo levels by default.  The javadoc of WO '''5.3''' still mentions the following:

''EOEditingContext's undo support is arbitrarily deep; you can undo an object repeatedly until you restore it to the state it was in when it was first created or fetched into its editing context. Even after saving, you can undo a change. To support this feature, the NSUndoManager can keep a lot of data in memory.''

However, as of 5.2, if you are using the session defaultEditingContext, WOSession sets the default undo stack size to 10 if there is no default size specified with the WODEFAULTUNDOSTACKLIMIT parameter.

Lastly you can manually clear your NSUndoManager when you are done with an operation by calling:

  editingContext.undoManager().removeAllActions();

If you use an NSUndoManager, it is recommended that you call this after performing very large saveChanges that involved large amounts of data.

=== WebObjects 5.2+ ===
This is a description of the current behavior in 5.3 that one might be able to gather if one were to, say, decompile and review the entire process -- not that i would ever do this or condone it, of course -- but if you DID, you would probably gather exactly this info, which is pretty well documented (and seems to behave to-spec) in the 5.2 release notes:

As of 5.2, the way it works is: The snapshots in EODatabase have a reference count.  Each editing context that fetches an EO increments the reference count.  The EC holds onto that EO via a WeakReference.  When the WeakReference is reclaimed, the snapshot reference count can decrease (note CAN, not IMMEDIATELY WILL -- the editing context keeps reference queue which is only processed periodically).  When the count gets to zero, the database forgets the snapshot.  If you have entity caching enabled, then EODatabase ignore reference count (or keeps it at &quot;1&quot; as a minimum) and it will not go away in a read-only scenario.  If you modify any entity of that type and saveChanges in your EditingContext, a cached entity's cache will be entirely flushed.  (NB: Keep this in mind, because if you are caching a large amount of data that is writable, it will NOT be very smart about updating that cache -- It's blown away with every update and then it immediately reloads the entire set of objects for that entity at the next access)

If you have retainsAllRegisteredObjects enabled on your editing context, it will NOT use WeakReferences.  Under this circumstance, the EO reference count is only decreased when 1) you dispose the editingcontext or 2) you forget or invalidate the object.

When you modify an object in an editing context, the editingcontext keeps a strong reference to the objects until you saveChanges (or revert, reset, etc), at which point the strong references are cleared and the only remaining reference is the weakreference like before.

If you have an undo manager enabled, it will keep a strong reference to the affected EO's as long as the undo is around.

I do wonder if EC's should be using SoftReferences instead of WeakReferences ... Would seem to be more friendly to the users of those EO's.

If you are using WO pre 5.2, then none of the WeakReference stuff applies, and everything is purely done with snapshot reference counting -- it should behave like retainsAllRegisteredObjects = true in 5.2.

=== WebObjects Pre 5.2 ===
Prior to 5.2, all snapshots were simply reference counted by EOEditingContext.  If an EO was faulted into your EOEditingContext, it would not go away until the EOEditingContext itself was disposed.  As a result, if you have an application deployed on a pre-5.2 WebObjects, you will need to adopt a strategy of periodically disposing your EOEditingContext and creating a new one.

==== Chuck Hill ====
In our experience, EOF is not too good at bulk operations like this.  If we have a lot to do, and don't need logic from the EO, we wander down to the EOAccess level, and whip up some batch insert statements.  You might even want to consider straight JDBC.

OK that said,
* save periodically
* don't retain references to objects you have inserted
* if that does not work, try creating a new EC periodically
* a bit heavy handed, but ec.invalidateAllObjects() should dump out all the snapshots as well.

A couple of useful comments:
http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2004/Sep/msg00225.html
http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2004/Sep/msg00228.html

It is always interesting to read the EOF docs, the JavaDocs are for API only while the EOF docs contain much valuable information.
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Enterprise_Objects/index.html

&quot;EOEditingContexts use weak references to the EOEnterpriseObjects registered with them. ... EOEditingContexts hold all inserted, deleted, or updated objects by strong references. These strong references are cleared by the EOEditingContext methods saveChanges ...&quot;  -- http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Enterprise_Objects/Managing/chapter_7_section_9.html

==== Alan Ward ====
Re: creating a new EC periodically
I'd jump straight to this option (based on my experience).  I have done a couple of similar tasks and
found that the best way to ensure that your app doesn't balloon up is to periodically ditch the EC
and create a new one.  Seems like it shouldn't be necessary.... but it works.

==== Ken Anderson ====
My guess is the memory increase is due to snapshots, which, as I understand it, will never go away, and wouldn't be considered a bug (to me anyway).

For dealing with a forever-import problem I had, where I didn't want the strong handed 'new EC' plan, I wrote this method, which keeps the snapshots down:

  public static void forgetObjectsAndKeypaths(EOEditingContext ec, NSArray eos, NSArray keypaths) {
    Enumeration eoEnum = eos.objectEnumerator();
    while (eoEnum.hasMoreElements()) {
      EOGenericRecord eo = (EOGenericRecord) eoEnum.nextElement();
      Enumeration keypathEnum = keypaths.objectEnumerator();
      while (keypathEnum.hasMoreElements()) {
        String keypath = (String) keypathEnum.nextElement();
        EOFaulting faulting = (EOFaulting) eo.valueForKeyPath(keypath);
        if (faulting != null &amp;&amp; !faulting.isFault()) {
          if (eo.isToManyKey(keypath)) {
            NSArray relEos = (NSArray) eo.valueForKeyPath(keypath);
            EOHelper.forgetObjects(ec, relEos);
          } else {
            ec.forgetObject((EOCustomObject) eo.valueForKeyPath(keypath));
          }
        }
      }
      ec.forgetObject(eo);
    }
  }

You can use it like this:

  EOHelper.forgetObjectsAndKeypaths(ec, arrayOfEOsToForget, new NSArray(new String[]{&quot;rel1&quot;, &quot;rel2&quot;});

Of course, all the EOs in the array need to be the same entity for keypaths to work!

If you set it per instance using JavaMonitor, it goes in Instance Settings, Additional Arguments, with all the other command line arguments.

In the project (Xcode 2.2), inspect the Executable for your app, and use the Arguments tab.  Like the example Jacky Gagnon used:

-Xms64m -Xmx300m

==== Robert Walker ====
There is one additional option that can be used to ensure/override the memory setting for all instances (even if they are not included in the arguments in JavaMonitor).

On the aggregate target there is a JVM_OPTIONS key in Expert View.  Entering the memory settings here will include them in the launch arguments of every instance.

Example:
java -XX:NewSize=2m -Xmx64m -Xms32m -DWORootDirectory=&quot;/System&quot; -DWOLocalRootDirectory=&quot;&quot; -DWOUserDirectory=&quot;/Users/robertwalker/Source/MyWOApp/build&quot; -DWOEnvClassPath=&quot;&quot; -DWOApplicationClass=Application -DWOPlatform=MacOS -Dcom.webobjects.pid=4128 -Xmx256m -classpath WOBootstrap.jar com.webobjects._bootstrap.WOBootstrap -WOPort 55555

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Download the SuperWaba SDK==

You can download it from here:
http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/downloads.asp

If it requires you to log in, either create an account (free) or use an account from [http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.superwaba.com.br BugMeNot.com].

===Unpacking the SDK===

If you're running Linux, you can rename the .exe to .rar and use ''unrar'' to unpack the SDK.
 unrar x GPL_SuperWabaSDK.rar

==Setting Up Eclipse==

Create a new Java Project in Eclipse &quot;from existing source&quot;, with the directory: $SUPERWABA/src/java/

Add an External Archive to the Build Path: $SUPERWABA/lib/SuperWaba.jar.

After some fiddling, my .classpath ended up like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;classpath&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;con&quot; path=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry excluding=&quot;waba/|superwaba/bin/&quot; kind=&quot;src&quot; path=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;lib&quot; path=&quot;/home/user/SuperWaba/lib/SuperWaba.jar&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;lib&quot; path=&quot;/home/user/SuperWaba/lib/vm/applet/Waba_only.jar&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;output&quot; path=&quot;superwaba/bin/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/classpath&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Running the Samples===

Run:Run... Java Application
* Main class: waba.applet.Applet
* Arguments: superwaba.samples.ui.gadgets.UIGadgets

==Our First Program==

&lt;pre&gt;
package superwaba.samples.helloworld;

import waba.ui.Label;
import waba.ui.MainWindow;

public class HelloWorld extends MainWindow {
	public HelloWorld() {
		super(&quot;HelloWorld!&quot;, TAB_ONLY_BORDER);
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		add(new Label(&quot;My Hello World Program&quot;), CENTER, CENTER);
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run this program the same way you would one of the sample applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Scheduled Restart Fails ===
==== Chuck Hill ====
Let's take a look at what happens in a little more depth.  When the appointed time comes, wotaskd sends the application a message to start refusing new sessions.  The application will start redirecting all subsequent requests without a session to an instance that is not refusing new sessions.  Of course, in your case eventually all are refusing and the woadaptor throws up its hands in dismay and declares &quot;No Instance Available&quot;.

But the part of interest to us happens before that.  After being told to refuse new sessions, the app quietly works away serving the users who already had sessions, waiting for them to terminate.  As each terminates it checks to see if the number of remaining sessions is below the threshold (1 by default).  If so it calls terminate() and shuts down the run loop.  At this point, if all is well, there are only daemon threads running and the JVM stops them and exits.  wotaskd notices that the app is not running and restarts it.  That is if all is well.

Now, what can go wrong?  The two most common problems that I have seen are (1) immortal sessions - the session count never drops to zero and (2) stuck threads that are not daemon threads.  The first situation prevents the app from calling terminate() and beginning the exit process.  The second situation prevents the JVM from terminating after the main app threads stop.

Immortal sessions are caused by an exception being raised from  your code that prevents the session from being checked into the session store.  The number one cause of this is exceptions being raised in the sleep() method of session.  If you use this method, wrap it  in a try...catch for throwable.  Do not let this method throw under any circumstances.  Immortal sessions can also be caused by exceptions being thrown from awake() and terminate() and I have no doubt there are other ways as well.

Stuck threads usually result from some sort of thread deadlock and can often result from immortal sessions when a request is made for a session that was never checked in from another thread.  A similar situation can occur if your are creating threads in your application that are not marked as daemon threads and not shut down when the application terminates.

OK, all that is well and good but what do you do about this?  The first thing you want is to wait for this to happen and get a thread dump of the application.  There are some instructions here:
http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2003/Sep/msg00362.html
Note that the file you need to edit is in /System/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/Contents/Resources.  Make sure that the appserver user has write permissions on the directory/file you point it to.

The next thing you want to do is to add some better logging to your application.  At a minimum, I would suggest:
* Log ID when session is created
* Log ID when session's terminate() is called.
* Log the application's remaining activeSessionsCount() when session's terminate() is called
* Log start and stop of RR look in dispatchRequest() in application
* Log when session are refused and activeSessionsCount() in refuseNewSessions(boolean)
* Log when application's terminate() is called

=== Sending Notifications on Failed Restart ===
==== Chuck Hill ====
My first choice would be to fix your code.  Second, it you have a long session time out and users are still working, then it could take quite a while for the app to restart (as long as the users keep working plus the session timeout).  Third, if the JVM is waiting on a stuck thread there is not much you can do as any daemon thread to send the text page would have been killed already (hmmm, I think so at least).  OK, so ignoring all that, start a timer as a daemon thread in refuseNewSessions(boolean) when true is passed.  When the timer fires, send the text message.  Or, if you like to sleep as much as I do, just call System.runtime().exit(1).  If refuseNewSessions(boolean) is later called with false, kill the timer.  That is just in case someone is clicking around in JavaMonitor.

James Seigel and I have written an article that might be of interest to this group. We describe a simple method for encoding structural changes to a database as objects. These objects can be used by applications to automatically bring their databases up-to-date on startup. We include example source code for WebObjects, usage patterns, and the lessons we have learned.

* wocontext.request().uri() = the URL currently being requested

There are several different URL's associated with your application, all of which can be retrieved from various methods on WOApplication. Here is a quick cheat sheet of them:
* WOApplication.application().baseURL() = /WebObjects
* WOApplication.application().applicationBaseURL() = /WebObjects
* WOApplication.application().cgiAdaptorURL() = http://hostname/cgi-bin/WebObjects
* WOApplication.application().directConnectURL() = http://hostname:port/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApplication.woa
* WOApplication.application().frameworksBaseURL() = /WebObjects/Frameworks
* WOApplication.application().servletConnectURL() = http://hostname/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApplication.woa
* WOApplication.application().webserverConnectURL() = http://hostname/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApplication.woa/-port

=== Browser IP ===
  /** Returns the IP address of the client.
     * This should return accurate information whether in direct connect or webserver deployment mode.
     * If performance caching is turned on on OS X server, this method will correctly use pc-remote-addr
     * @return The IP address as a string.
     */
    public static String clientIP(WORequest request) {
        Object ipAddress = request.headerForKey(&quot;pc-remote-addr&quot;);
        if (ipAddress == null) {
                ipAddress = request.headerForKey(&quot;remote_addr&quot;);
                if( ipAddress == null ) {
                    ipAddress = request.headerForKey(&quot;remote_host&quot;);
                    if( ipAddress == null ) {
                        ipAddress = request._remoteAddress();
                        if( ipAddress == null ) {
                            ipAddress = request._originatingAddress();
                            if( ipAddress != null ) ipAddress = ((InetAddress)ipAddress).getHostAddress();

        }
        return ipAddress == null ? &quot;&lt;address unknown&gt;&quot; : ipAddress.toString();

=== NSArray ===
It's in the docs, but NSArray's implementation of KeyValueCoding is not really what I was expecting. To get an object at a specific numeric index of an NSArray, you'd use the

 objectAtIndex() 

method. So what does

 NSArray.valueForKey(String key) 

return?

Well, first read the docs: file:///OSX/Developer/Documentation/WebObjects/Reference/com/webobjects/foundation/NSArray.html#valueForKey(java.lang.String)

It turns out that calling valueForKey on an array is the same as calling valueForKey for each element of that array. So if you have an NSArray of Users, calling valueForKey(&quot;email&quot;); will return an NSArray of email addresses. calling valueForKey(&quot;documents&quot;); will return an NSArray of NSArrays containing document objects. In hindsight (and from looking at the way WOBuilder handles key paths for arrays) this is kind of obvious. But I think the real lesson here is that it is easy to ignore the docs towards the end of an alphabetical page...

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
There is a large overlap between the content about [[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Memory Management|Memory Management]] and that of Caching and Freshness.  Both should be read to fully understand how caching and memory management should play a part in your application design.

=== Freshness ===
One of the most frequently asked, and hard to figure out, questions related to WebObjects is: &quot;My application keeps using old values from the database. How do I ensure it gets fresh data?&quot;

==== Caveats and Warnings ====
Until someone else wants to write a chapter on exactly what's going on, and what the Enterprise Objects Framework is doing, that will remain unsaid on this site. But do understand that EOF is attempting to be efficient and not go to the database more often than neccesary --- since a db transaction is relatively expensive. Every choice you make in this area is really a trade off between efficiency of your app and 'freshness' of your db values. Depending on the requirements of your app, different choices may be called for.

Some of these methods may also affect 'optimistic locking' behavior, depending on what optimistic locking behavior is neccesary. A chapter on OptimisticLockingTechniques in WO/EOF would be welcome, because effectively using optimistic locking (taking account both of values changed by other app instance, and other sessions in the same instance) can be trickier than one would think.

Note: Some people have suggested that using EOFetchSpecification.setRefreshesRefetchedObjects and EOEditingContext.setDefaultFetchTimestampLag together will result in &quot;unable to decrement snapshot&quot; exceptions. Unfortunately, we really don't know anything more about this at this time.

But here are some ways to ensure 'freshness' of database values:

==== Recommended ====
* In your Application constructor, call:
  EOEditingContext.setDefaultFetchTimestampLag(2);

This means that every EOEditingContext, when created, will insist on getting data fresh from the database that's no more than two seconds older than the EOEditingContext itself. If the EOEditingContext was created at 1:23:00, and there are snapshots on record from BEFORE 1:22:58, those snapshots won't be used, instead a new fetch to the db will be done.

The argument '2' up there is the number of seconds prior to the creation of the EOEditingContext, that that EOEditingContext is willing to accept data from. You can use whatever value you want. Thinking about it, you'll realize that setting it to '0' as you might initially want to, your app will potentially make very many more db transactions when under very heavy load, without gaining much in 'freshness' of data, so a non-zero value is probably preferable.

[Oops, depending on which documentation you believe for which version, the argument may be in milliseconds instead of seconds. Beware].

[in WO5.2.3 the default is 3600000 so obviously is milliseconds]

[From the WO 5.3 documentation: 
public static void setDefaultFetchTimestampLag(long lag)

Sets the default timestamp lag for newly instantiated editing contexts to lag. The default lag is 3,600,000 milliseconds (one hour).
When a new editing context is initialized, it is assigned a fetch timestamp equal to the current time less the default timestamp lag. Setting the lag to a large number might cause every new editing context to accept very old cached data. Setting the lag to too low a value might degrade performance due to excessive fetching. A negative lag value is treated as 0.]

Just to make this clear: the lag constitutes a fixed time, not a rolling time window. So it ONLY makes sure that any data in your newly created EC is not older than the time of creation minus the lag. 

* For some (or all!) EOFetchSpecifications, call setRefreshesRefetchedObjects(true) on it. This will mean that when you actually execute this fetch spec, and it goes and makes a transaction with the db, the values returned by the db will actually be used! Counter-intuitively, with the default value of refreshesRefetchedObjects==false, WO/EOF will sometimes ignore new values returned from the db in favor of older values in cached snapshots.

Note that combining both methods (setDefaultFetchTimestampLag and setRefreshesRefetchedObjects) is buggy. It is NOT RECOMMENDED. You will see decrementSnapshotCountForGlobalID errors if you do.

Note that if you use setPrefetchingRelationshipKeyPaths on the EOFetchSpecification, the relationships mentioned will be followed and their destinations fetched with this EOFetchSpecification as well, and the setRefreshesRefetchedObjects directive will apply to those destination objects too.

==== Not Sure Whether to Recommend ====
* Some people use various methods to invalidate and/or refault their Enterprise Objects to ensure that the next access of those objects will result in fresh data. I am somewhat cautious of these methods, as the documentation is confusing and in some cases actually recommends against using them. Nonetheless, some people say they use them to good effect. I would recommend using other methods if you can. Maybe someone else wants to contribute more information?

==== Not Recommended ====
* I would NOT recommend trying to use the databaseContextShouldUpdateCurrentSnapshot EODatabaseContext delegate method. The documentation implies you can implement this delegate method such that you will always get fresh data---sort of the effect of setRefreshesRefetchecObjects(true) on every single fetch spec without needing to do that on every single fetch spec. But in my own experience, attempting to do this caused various problems for EOF and various cryptic exceptions would occur. So I don't recommend it.

==== What Various Developers Actually Do ====

===== Jonathan Rochkind =====
In my own highly interactive and collaborative applications, I place a high value on freshness of data, over efficiency of my app. Implementing the setDefaultTimestampLag with a very low value, and calling setRefreshesRefetchedObjects(true) on the majority of fetches has resulted in acceptable and reasonably fresh data in my applications. I do not really think that the efficiency has suffered much either, but I haven't investigated it fully and I am not concerned with maximizing the number of requests-per-time-period that can be dispatched.

===== Michael Johnston =====
When an eo absolutely has to be fresh (example 1, choosing an hourly winner in a game that had &gt; 500,000 games played per day at it's peak; example two an asynchronous event processor that receives events both over the wire and from internal threads) I use two step fetch-save with a lock column, with a polling loop with a random, increasing sleep time. This is multi-instance, multi-app-server safe but doesn't ever lock up a thread for more than .8 of a second running against oracle. So far. I tried using database locking, but it resulted in several-second lockups.

===== Jesse Barnum =====
I use this code on the detail view of my enterprise objects when I want to make sure that they are up-to-date. I'm not explicitly doing a fetch, I just invalidate the particular object plus it's related objects, and they will automatically be refaulted and fetched when the page is displayed. As shown in the code sample, you must explicitly invalidate related objects. If you can count on your users knowing when information is stale, then a nifty technique is to trigger this code if a user hits reload in their browser.

  EOEditingContext ec = object.editingContext();
  NSMutableArray ids = new NSMutableArray();
  
  // Invalidate the object
  ids.addObject(ec.globalIDForObject(object));
  // Invalidate a to-one related item
  ids.addObject(ec.globalIDForObject((EOEnterpriseObject)object.valueForKey(&quot;adreq&quot;))); 
  // Invalidate a to-many relationship
  Enumeration en = ((NSArray)object.valueForKey(&quot;correspondences&quot;)).objectEnumerator();
  while(en.hasMoreElements()) 
    ids.addObject(ec.globalIDForObject((EOEnterpriseObject)en.nextElement()));
  ec.invalidateObjectsWithGlobalIDs(ids);

=== Refreshing Many-to-Many Relationships ===
==== Chuck Hill ====
The freshness methods described above are limited in that they only refresh the attributes and the to-one relationships (in other words, the data directly in the row). They do not refresh to-many relationships to show changes in which objects are in the relationship. This means that if objects are added to the relationship by another process (or in another Object Store) your code will not see them as being related. Conversely, if objects are removed from the relationship in another object store they will still appear in the relationship. I don't know why this is, perhaps it is simply a shortcoming of EOF. Refreshing to-many relationships is unfortunately expensive and laborious. 

One solution is to invalidate the objects that you need to refresh to-many relationships for. While this works, it can be expensive in terms of processing and have unintended side effects if the invalidated objects had unsaved changes. 

There is another option that I've used but which I'm still not 100% convinced has no bad side effects when edits are in progress. This method of refreshing to-many relationships works by setting the snapshot for the to-many relationship to null. It only works for one object and one relationship at a time so refreshing many objects can be a little annoying. The implementation is slightly convoluted as we need to get down to the EODatabase level. 

Here is gist of the code which refreshes relationshipName on sourceObject:

  sourceEditingContext = sourceObject.editingContext();
  EOEntity sourceObjectEntity = EOUtilities.entityForObject(sourceEditingContext, sourceObject);
  EOModel sourceObjectModel = sourceObjectEntity.model();
  EOGlobalID sourceGlobalID = sourceEditingContext.globalIDForObject(sourceObject);
  EODatabaseContext dbContext = EODatabaseContext.registeredDatabaseContextForModel(sourceObjectModel, sourceEditingContext);
  EODatabase database = dbContext.database();
  database.recordSnapshotForSourceGlobalID(null, sourceGlobalID, relationshipName);

==== Anjo Krank ====
While the method above will get fresh data the next time an EO is created you will have to perform an additional step to see the new data in an existing object:

  Object o = eo.storedValueForKey(relationshipName);
  if(o instanceof EOFaulting) {
    EOFaulting toManyArray = (EOFaulting)o;
    if (!toManyArray.isFault()) {
        EOFaulting tmpToManyArray = (EOFaulting)((EOObjectStoreCoordinator)ec.rootObjectStore()).arrayFaultWithSourceGlobalID(gid, relationshipName, ec);
        toManyArray.turnIntoFault(tmpToManyArray.faultHandler());
    }
  } else {
        // we should check if the existing object is an array, too
        EOFaulting tmpToManyArray = (EOFaulting)((EOObjectStoreCoordinator)ec.rootObjectStore())
              .arrayFaultWithSourceGlobalID(gid, relationshipName, ec);
        eo.takeStoredValueForKey(tmpToManyArray, relationshipName);
  }

==== Pierre Bernard ====

It is my understanding that when pre-fetching relationships using a fetch specification set to refresh objects the relationship ought to be refreshed to. Unfortunately that is not what WebObjects 5.1 and 5.2 do. I have not yet tested later versions. In order to fix this, you will need to add the following to a subclass of EODatabaseContext:

  /**
   * Internal method that handles prefetching of to-many relationships.&lt;BR&gt;
   *  // TBD This is a workaround to what looks like a bug in WO 5.1 &amp; WO 5.2.
   * Remove as soon as it's no longer needed
   *
   * The problem is that even refreshing fetches don't refresh the to-many
   * relationships they prefetch.
   */
  public void _followToManyRelationshipWithFetchSpecification(EORelationship relationship,
      EOFetchSpecification fetchspecification, NSArray objects,
      EOEditingContext editingcontext)
  {
    int count = objects.count();
  
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
      EOEnterpriseObject object = (EOEnterpriseObject) objects.objectAtIndex(i);
      EOGlobalID sourceGlobalID = editingcontext.globalIDForObject(object);
      String relationshipName = relationship.name();
  
      if (!object.isFault()) {
        EOFaulting toManyArray = (EOFaulting) object.storedValueForKey(relationshipName);
  
        if (!toManyArray.isFault()) {
          EOFaulting tmpToManyArray = (EOFaulting) arrayFaultWithSourceGlobalID(
              sourceGlobalID, relationshipName, editingcontext);
  
          // Turn the existing array back into a fault by assigning it
          // the fault handler of the newly created fault
          toManyArray.turnIntoFault(tmpToManyArray.faultHandler());
        }
      }
    }
  
    super._followToManyRelationshipWithFetchSpecification(relationship, fetchspecification,
        objects, editingcontext);
  }

=== EOEntity's Cache-In-Memory Setting ===
When you set Cache In Memory to true for an EOEntity, it tells EOF that you want it to try to always use an in-memory cache to store all instances of this entity.  The first time that you fetch an object of the entity marked Cache In Memory, ALL instances of that entity will be fetched into memory.  This is very useful for relatively static data (like enumerated type EO's, or other similar types of data that are infrequently modified in your application).  Note that this is completely independent of EOF's normal snapshot caching, which will be in use regardless of the value of this setting.  This setting is only used to determine if the ENTIRE dataset of your entity should be cached AT ALL TIMES.  There are some very important implementation details that you should be aware of when you use this setting.

All behaviors described below MAY change from WO release to WO release and are not intrinsic requirements of the Cache In Memory feature, but are important considerations for anyone using the feature.  All of these were verified to be true as of WebObjects 5.3:

The first is that Cache in Memory bypasses snapshot reference counting.  Cache In Memory objects WILL NOT be released by EOF.  In the end, this should not matter much, because you should not be using this flag on entities that have very large numbers of objects anyway.

On the performance front, be aware that Cache In Memory objects are indexed ONLY by EOGlobalID (primary key).  If you are using an EOQualifier to find your objects (as opposed to traversing a to-one or to-many relationship that CONTAINS the object, which uses a primary key lookup), you will be doing a &quot;full table scan&quot; of your objects in memory.  This is further reason to only use cache in memory on small cardinality entities.  If you cache your 2 million row entity, it may likely be SLOWER to fetch EO's with an EOQualifier than if you just let the database take care of its business if the first place.

Another major performance detail of Cache In Memory is that if you make a change to ANY EO of the cached entity's type, ALL EO's of that type will be flushed from the cache and reloaded on the next access.  This further supports the best practice of not using Cache In Memory for mutable EO's.  If you have a Person EO set to cache-in-memory and you change the name of one Person, your entire cache will be dumped.  The next time you fetch any person, the entire Person table will be reloaded.  This can be catastrophic on a large series of changes (you can end up trashing the cache -- you save one EO, cache flushes, it then reloads the entire cache, you save the next one, the cache flushes, etc etc).

Lastly, there is a quirk of Cache In Memory EO's where the cache will not be used unless your EOFetchSpecification has setDeep(true) on it.  If isDeep is false on your fetch specification, a normal database fetch will occur (negating the usefulness of your cache).  This is also true of EOUtilities methods that use EOFetchSpecifications internally.  Project Wonder provides alternative implementations of several of the common EOUtilities fetch methods that setDeep(true).

=== invalidateAllObjects BAD! ===
First, and most importantly, the concept of invalidation in EOF is about cache coherency with the database, NOT memory management.

Now, invalidation does have some side effects which can have positive influences on Java memory usage, but using it for this purpose is akin to using a 50# sledge hammer to drive those miniature picture hanging nails into the wall.

I strongly recommend you only use invalidation when you as the application programmer have external information which is inaccessible to EOF regarding changes in the state of the database. i.e. You just executed an arbitrary stored procedure which had side effects all over your table. Or you got an RMI message from another process saying it updated a row. Or it's Monday, 3am, and on Monday, 2am, your DBA's cron job always deletes everything in a &quot;temp&quot; table. Or you've found a bug in EOF (alas, it happens), and this is the only workaround.

As others have noted, invalidation forcefully nukes the snapshot in the EODatabase cache. This increases the cache miss rate, reducing the performance of your application. Depending on your pattern of firing faults, 10,000 rows which took only 1 fetch to retrieve initially might take 10,000 fetches to restore into the cache. BAD. Prefetching and batch faulting can ameliorate this a little bit. They're a lot better than naive faulting, actually, but nothing can replace doing the right fetch the first time. Nothing by several orders of magnitude.

Nuking the snapshot has a number of other deleterious consequences. This cache is a shared resource used by all the ECs in your application. When one EC annihilates the resource all the other ECs are depending on ... So, EOF posts notifications about invalidation. Whenever something is invalidated, all the ECs in the application are affected, and must process the notification. In a large web application with many concurrent sessions, this can be a lot of unnecessary chatter. Invalidation and its ensuing notifications are very stressful on concurrently operating threads. Invalidations are propagated throughout the entire application, even if they were initiated from a nested EC.

[More technically precise: throughout the entire EOF stack centered around the EOObjectStoreCoordinator. In 5.1, it is theoretically possible to have several of these stacks, each with their own cache and EOObjectStoreCoordinator. Most EOF notifications are not passed between ECs using different OSCs. In practice, for 5.1, this is the entire application.]

Refaulting is much kinder and gentler. It only affects the EC it is invoked upon, so it won't interfere with ECs for other users. It will decrement the reference count on the snapshot (which may or may not release the snapshot). It will break outbound references within that EC. And if the current snapshot in the cache is &quot;fresh enough&quot; as defined by that EC's fetchTimestamp, firing the fault will use the cache instead of generating another fetch. Refaulting does not post notifications (although if the snapshot is not fresh, firing the fault will cause a fetch which will post)

Okay, so all of that had to do with databases. This thread is really about memory management with EOF in Java, so back to the point.

=== What does ec.dispose() do? ===
EOEditingContext does a lot of work. It has relationships to a number of other objects (including registering itself to receive notifications) and it is primarily responsible for maintaining a very large cyclic graph of objects (EOs). dispose() tells the EC that it will never be used again, and it should perform as much clean up work as possible. This decrements snapshot reference counts, unregisters for various things, and breaks references. Depending on your JVM, this may or may not help the GC reclaim memory faster. If you don't invoke dispose(), the EC's finalizer will. Most applications do not need to directly invoke dispose(), but your mileage may vary.

dispose() does not invoke any invalidate method.

For batch style EOF operations, the undo functionality is frequently overlooked as a source of problems (strong references). By default, EOF uses an unlimited undo/redo stack. If you are not going to use undo/redo, then you should seriously consider either setting the EC's undo manager to null, or performing removeAllActions on the EC's undo manager at logical checkpoints (like after saveChanges). The only downside to setting the EC's undo manager to null is that you will not be able to recover from validation exceptions. Depending on your batch operations, that may not be an issue. For a robust application, I would leave the undo manager, but use setLevelsOfUndo() to keep the stack small, and invoke removeAllActions() regularly.

For applications using EOF outside of an WebObjects application, some processing is left until the end of the current event. You may need to manually invoke eventEnded() on the NSDelayedCallbackCenter. Inside a WebObjects application, this is done for you at the end of a request.

In WO 5.1, EOEditingContexts have strong references to all their registered EOs, and EOs have NO reference to their editing context. The implications for GC should be fairly obvious.

invalidate does not clear away the EO objects themselves. It will force the memory for the database cache to go away, but the EOs will still be in memory and retained by their EC ...

=== Avoiding unnecessary trips to the Database - some tips ===

When optimising for performance, we usually turn on EOAdaptorDebugEnabled (or it's NSLog equivalent).  One of the things that comes up quite often, is how do you reduce / eliminate redundant database fetches?

EOF has a snapshot which stores dictionaries that represent objects that you request from the database. This is basically a application-wide cache.  When you first fetch an object into an EOEditingContext, a dictionary is stored in the snapshot (with a timestamp lag used for expiring the dictionary).  The editingcontext increments the reference count for that snapshot entry. When you dispose that editingcontext, the reference count in the snapshot for that entry is decremented. When the snapshot count for that dictionary falls to 0, at some point it is removed from the snapshot.  So the next time you request that object again, it has to make a trip to the db to fetch it, even if it was quite fresh...

If you are using the session's defaultEditingContext (not recommended - but sometimes possible in legacy applications), be aware, that when the session terminates, it disposes its editingcontext.  This means if you only have fetched a object into that editingcontext, it will likely be released from the snapshot.  If you make a repeat fetch from another editingcontext for the same object, it will have to make a return trip to the db.  I once came across a app that uses the session defaulteditingcontext via direct actions.  When the directaction had finished creating its page, it terminated the session. Repeat calls for the same content, resulted in repeat trips to the db for the same data.

One way to get around this is to fetch EOs into an EOEditingcontext that has a longer life (one for example that survives across sessions), and use EOUtilities to create a localinstance of that object for any temporary editingcontext uses.

A second common problem faced by developers is the query by key value. For example, consider this fetch:

EOQualifier qualifier = EOQualifier.qualifierWithQualifierFormat (&quot;lastName = 'Smith'&quot;, null);
EOFetchSpecification fetchspec = new EOFetchSpecification(&quot;Person&quot;, qualifier, null);
editingContext.objectsWithFetchSpecification(fetchSpec,editingContext);

This results in a request to the DB every time, even if it is the same objects always returned.  The reason, is that it is not possible for EOF to know if the number of objects matching the query has changed.

If you are in a situation where you are querying on the primary key, or know that the objects returned aren't changing often, consider implementing a cache.  Your cache should just store the EOGlobalID of the objects returned.  That way, when you make this fetch in the future, you can check the key against your cache, and just return the EOGlobalIDs matching that key *without* a fetch to the DB.

=== Raw Rows ===
Raw Row results are never cached. If your application is using raw rows for its batch operations and is still having memory problems, then you need to evaluate your code. OptimizeIt or JProbe is definitely worth having. That's true even if you aren't doing raw row work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the ''Part of speech'' column there will be a letter indicating ow the word is to be used. Here is a key, listing the abbreviations and explaining what these stand for:

adj = adjective - describes an object (e.g. The key was '''green''', The idea is '''disturbing'''.)

adv = adverb - describes how a verb is done (e.g. I ran ''quickly'', She ''easily'' passed the test.)

conj = conjunction - connects two words, clauses or phrase together (e.g. life ''or'' death, I would vote for my gerbil ''but'' I'm sane.)

exp = expression

int = interjection - used to convey emotion, not related to any other part of speech (e.g. '''Ow'''!, '''Hooray'''!)

n = noun - an object (e.g. dog, chair.)

num = number (e.g. Four, One.)

prep = preposition - the location of the object, relative to something else (e.g. Smoke ''over'' water, the ball is ''on'' the table.)

pron = pronoun - One of: I, You, She, He, They, We, It or One.

v = verb - an action, one which can be used both transitively and intransitively(e.g. We '''celebrated''', we '''celebrated''' the party.)

vi = intransitive verb - verbs which can only be done without objects (e.g. Trees ''rustled'', he ''died''.)

vt - transitive verb - verbs which must be applied to an object (e.g. I ''killed'' him, I ''am'' a hamster.)

=== Ŭ ===

In modern Esperanto, use of the letter ''Ŭ'' as a standalone consonant has fallen out of favour.
It used to be common to use it for loanwords and foreign names like {{lang eo|Ŭaŝingtono}} (for &quot;Washington&quot;), but the modern preference is {{lang eo|Vaŝingtono}}.

The only modern use for ''Ŭ'' is in [[Esperanto/Appendix/Alphabet_and_pronunciation|diphthongs]].

{{esperanto/eo-en start}}
&lt;!-- This is here just to have SOMETHING in Ŭ --&gt;
&lt;!-- If you can think of a more useful ŭ word, take ŭato out --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
If you've ever used EOModeler's Java source code generator, you know how much of a pain it can be when you make changes to your model objects and have to merge changes in later.  One solution for this is to use [http://www.rubicode.com/Software/EOGenerator/ EOGenerator], an application developed by Rubicode Software, which uses the Generation Gap pattern to create your Java files from your EOModels.  EOGenerator produces TWO java files for each Entity rather than one.  Take the example of a Person entity.  The first java file is _Person.java, which contains all of the autogenerated methods.  The second java file is Person.java, and Person extends _Person.  The second file is where you place all of your customizations.  Any time your model changes, only your _Xxx.java files are updated, and your customizations are left untouched.  Additionally, EOGenerator allows for the creation of extensive custom templates for your files, which provides the ability to place convenience methods in your _Xxx.java files.

=== Advantages ===
There are several advantages to using EOGenerator over EOModeler's default Java file generation and merging with FileMerge.

* EOGenerator uses the Generation Gap pattern, which provides a much cleaner separation of autogenerated vs customized code with no need to deal with merging at all.  There are border cases with FileMerge that can cause you to deal with annoying conflicts.
* EOGenerator uses the MiscMerge language for its templates.  This allows you to extend the core templates with extensive customizations (see the EOGenerator Mods section below), better supporting your own custom development process and workflow.
* As David LaBer put it, &quot;all the cool kids use it - and we all know looking cool is the *most* important criteria&quot;.

=== How To Use It ===
Kieran Kelleher has writtten an [http://web.archive.org/20070113034802/homepage.mac.com/kelleherk/iblog/C1837526061/E1908382110/index.html Introduction to EOGenerator] on his blog.

It's actually very simple to use.  The quick start is:

* Download and untar EOGenerator from the Rubicode site
* Run the following command:

  eogenerator -model /path/to/model/YourModel.eomodeld -destination /path/to/source/folder -subclassDestination /path/to/source/folder -templatedir /path/to/EOGenerator/templates -java -packagedirs

Voila.  EOGenerator will spit out your Java files for you.  Let's break down the commands you can pass in:

* -define-EOGenericRecord &lt;class&gt;, allows you to specify the _Person class's superclass.  For instance, if you use Project Wonder, you would specify -define-EOGenericRecord er.extensions.ERXGenericRecord
* -destination &lt;path&gt;, the folder that _Person.java-style java files will be produced in (the non-editable files)
* -java, produce java files
* -javaTemplate &lt;filename&gt;, the name of the Java template to use inside of the template dir (_Person)
* -model &lt;path&gt;, Passes in the path of a .eomodeld you would like to generate Java files for.  You can actually include multiple -model commands on the commandline
* -packagedirs, produce package directory for any package statements defined in your Java files (not necessary if you don't specify package names on your entities.  By the way, you should specify packages on your entities :) )
* -refmodel &lt;path&gt;, Passes in the path of an .eomodeld that is required for generating Java files, but that won't actually have Java files generated for it. For instance, you should -refmodel any prototypes, or any models in other frameworks that you depend on
* -subclassDestination &lt;path&gt;, the folder that Person.java-style java files will be produced in (the editable files)
* -subclassJavaTemplate &lt;filename&gt;, the name of the Java subclass template to use inside of the template dir (Person)
* -templatedir &lt;path&gt;, the path to the folder that contains EOGenerator templates
* -verbose, turn on verbose output

=== Custom EOGenerator Mods ===
==== Zak Burke ====
Allow setting nulls on a to-one relationship (and turn it into a remove).  Note, this is also included in Jonathan Rentzsch's templates.

  public void save&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;(&lt;$ToOneRelationship.destinationEntity.referenceJavaClassName$&gt; value)
  {
    if (value == null)
    {
      &lt;$ToOneRelationship.destinationEntity.referenceJavaClassName$&gt; object = &lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;();
      if (object != null)
        removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey(object, &quot;&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;&quot;);
    }
    else
    {
      addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey(value, &quot;&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;&quot;);
    }
  }

==== Chuck Hill ====
Return the list of changes between the current EO and the last committed version of the EO:

  public NSDictionary changedProperties() {
    NSDictionary commitedValues = editingContext().committedSnapshotForObject(this);
    return changesFromSnapshot(commitedValues);
  }

==== Jonathan Rentzsch ====
Jonathan Rentzsch has provided his base EOGenerator templates, which are a must-have:

http://rentzsch.com/share/eogenerator52templates.zip

==== Markus Ruggiero ====
Constants for all attributes and relationships. This allows compile time error checking in situations like
addObjecttoBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey(myObject, Person.TO_MANY_Children)

  &lt;$foreach attribute classAttributes.@reversedArray do$&gt;
    public static final String ATTRIBUTE_&lt;$attribute.name$&gt; = &quot;&lt;$attribute.name$&gt;&quot;;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;

  &lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship classToOneRelationships.@reversedArray do$&gt;
    public static final String TO_ONE_&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt; = &quot;&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;&quot;;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;

  &lt;$foreach ToManyRelationship classToManyRelationships.@reversedArray do$&gt;
    public static final String TO_MANY_&lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt; = &quot;&lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;&quot;;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;

We also make heavy use of the user info dictionary on entity and attribute level. Allows to generate customized methods and what not. One example is booleans that are stored in the DB as strings with values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

  &lt;$if attribute.userInfo.usage == booleanFlag $&gt;    // boolean accessors
    public void &lt;$attribute.userInfo.setterName$&gt;(boolean newBoolean) {
      set&lt;$attribute.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;(newBoolean ? &quot;true&quot; : &quot;false&quot;);
    }
   
    public boolean &lt;$attribute.userInfo.getterName$&gt;() {
      return &quot;true&quot;.equals(&lt;$attribute.name$&gt;()) ? true : false;
    }
       
    // validation
    public String validate&lt;$attribute.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;(String newValue) {
      if ( newValue == null ) {
        return &quot;false&quot;;
      } else if ( !newValue.equals(&quot;true&quot;) &amp;&amp; !newValue.equals(&quot;false&quot;) ) {
        String errorMessage = MessageHandler.format(&quot;INVALID_BOOLEAN_FLAG &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.&lt;$attribute.name$&gt;&quot;, null);
        throw new NSValidation.ValidationException(errorMessage);
      }
      return newValue;
    }
  &lt;$endif$&gt;

==== Mike Schrag ====
Add a constant that represents the name of the entity so that you can refer to Person.ENTITY_NAME in fetches rather than the String (allows refactoring support in Eclipse):

  public static final String ENTITY_NAME = &quot;&lt;$name$&gt;&quot;;

Add a static factory method to your EO's ( Person createPerson(...) ) that shows you what required attributes and relationships are configured for you entity (attempts to provide a replacement &quot;constructor&quot; since EO constructors are empty):

  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; create&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext&lt;$foreach Attribute classAttributes.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if !Attribute.allowsNull$&gt;, &lt;$Attribute.javaValueClassName$&gt; _&lt;$Attribute.name$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship classToOneRelationships.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if ToOneRelationship.isMandatory$&gt;, &lt;$ToOneRelationship.destinationEntity.referenceJavaClassName$&gt; _&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;) {
    &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; eoObject = (&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;)EOUtilities.createAndInsertInstance(_editingContext, &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.ENTITY_NAME);&lt;$foreach Attribute classAttributes.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if !Attribute.allowsNull$&gt;
    eoObject.set&lt;$Attribute.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;(_&lt;$Attribute.name$&gt;);&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship classToOneRelationships.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if ToOneRelationship.isMandatory$&gt;
    eoObject.set&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;Relationship(_&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;);&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;
    return eoObject;
  }

Here's a little bitty fancier (read: nastier) version that also handles superclass mandatory attributes and fields (one level).  It skips any attribute that is referenced in the restricting qualifier of your subclass (since you are probably going to set that in your awakeFromInsertion):

  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; create&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext editingContext&lt;$foreach Attribute classAttributes.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if !Attribute.allowsNull$&gt;, &lt;$Attribute.javaValueClassName$&gt; &lt;$Attribute.name$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach Attribute parentEntity.classAttributes.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if !Attribute.allowsNull$&gt;&lt;$set RestrictingQualifierKey = false$&gt;&lt;$foreach QualifierKey restrictingQualifier.allQualifierKeys do$&gt;&lt;$if Attribute.name = QualifierKey$&gt;&lt;$set RestrictingQualifierKey = true$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$if RestrictingQualifierKey = false$&gt;, &lt;$Attribute.javaValueClassName$&gt; &lt;$Attribute.name$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship classToOneRelationships.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if ToOneRelationship.isMandatory$&gt;, &lt;$ToOneRelationship.destinationEntity.referenceJavaClassName$&gt; &lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship parentEntity.classToOneRelationships.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if ToOneRelationship.isMandatory$&gt;, &lt;$ToOneRelationship.destinationEntity.referenceJavaClassName$&gt; &lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;) {
    &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; eoObject = (&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;)EOUtilities.createAndInsertInstance(editingContext, &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.ENTITY_NAME);&lt;$foreach Attribute classAttributes.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if !Attribute.allowsNull$&gt;
    eoObject.set&lt;$Attribute.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;(&lt;$Attribute.name$&gt;);&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship classToOneRelationships.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if ToOneRelationship.isMandatory$&gt;
    eoObject.set&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;Relationship(&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;);&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach Attribute parentEntity.classAttributes.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if !Attribute.allowsNull$&gt;&lt;$set RestrictingQualifierKey = false$&gt;&lt;$foreach QualifierKey restrictingQualifier.allQualifierKeys do$&gt;&lt;$if Attribute.name = QualifierKey$&gt;&lt;$set RestrictingQualifierKey = true$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$if RestrictingQualifierKey = false$&gt;
    eoObject.set&lt;$Attribute.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;(&lt;$Attribute.name$&gt;);&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;&lt;$foreach ToOneRelationship parentEntity.classToOneRelationships.@sortedNameArray do$&gt;&lt;$if ToOneRelationship.isMandatory$&gt;
    eoObject.set&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name.initialCapitalString$&gt;Relationship(&lt;$ToOneRelationship.name$&gt;);&lt;$endif$&gt;&lt;$endforeach do$&gt;
    return eoObject;
  }

Add a bunch of convience fetch methods (fetchAllPersons, fetchRequiredPerson, and other variants).  It's not smart about pluralization, so it's just going to put an &quot;s&quot; on the end of the entity name:

  public static NSArray fetchAll&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;s(EOEditingContext _editingContext) {
    return &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.fetchAll&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;s(_editingContext, null);
  }

  public static NSArray fetchAll&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;s(EOEditingContext _editingContext, NSArray _sortOrderings) {
    return &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;s(_editingContext, null, _sortOrderings);
  }

  public static NSArray fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;s(EOEditingContext _editingContext, EOQualifier _qualifier, NSArray _sortOrderings) {
    EOFetchSpecification fetchSpec = new EOFetchSpecification(&lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.ENTITY_NAME, _qualifier, _sortOrderings);
    fetchSpec.setIsDeep(true);
    NSArray eoObjects = _editingContext.objectsWithFetchSpecification(fetchSpec);
    return eoObjects;
  }

  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext, String _keyName, Object _value) {
    return &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(_editingContext, new EOKeyValueQualifier(_keyName, EOQualifier.QualifierOperatorEqual, _value));
  }

  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext, EOQualifier _qualifier) {
    NSArray eoObjects = &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;s(_editingContext, _qualifier, null);
    &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; eoObject;
    int count = eoObjects.count();
    if (count == 0) {
      eoObject = null;
    }
    else if (count == 1) {
      eoObject = (&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;)eoObjects.objectAtIndex(0);
    }
    else {
      throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;There was more than one &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; that matched the qualifier '&quot; + _qualifier + &quot;'.&quot;);
    }
    return eoObject;
  }
        
  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; fetchRequired&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext, String _keyName, Object _value) {
    return &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.fetchRequired&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(_editingContext, new EOKeyValueQualifier(_keyName, EOQualifier.QualifierOperatorEqual, _value));
  }

  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; fetchRequired&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext, EOQualifier _qualifier) {
    &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; eoObject = &lt;$GEN_PREFIX$&gt;&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;.fetch&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(_editingContext, _qualifier);
    if (eoObject == null) {
      throw new NoSuchElementException(&quot;There was no &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; that matched the qualifier '&quot; + _qualifier + &quot;'.&quot;);
    }
    return eoObject;
  }

Add methods for getting local instances of EO's.  The static one is handy if you have a reference to an EO that might be null (it does a null check first):

  public &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; localInstanceOf&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext) {
    return (&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;)EOUtilities.localInstanceOfObject(_editingContext, this);
  }

  public static &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; localInstanceOf&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;(EOEditingContext _editingContext, &lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt; _eo) {
    return (_eo == null) ? null : (&lt;$classNameWithoutPackage$&gt;)EOUtilities.localInstanceOfObject(_editingContext, _eo);
  }

If you've ever wanted to be able to qualify a toMany relationship on your EO's, but sometimes you want to fetch them w/ a fetch spec, and sometimes you want to filter in-memory, you can use the following:

  &lt;$if !ToManyRelationship.inverseRelationship$&gt;
  	public NSArray &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(EOQualifier qualifier) {
  		return &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(qualifier, null);
  	}
  &lt;$endif$&gt;
  &lt;$if ToManyRelationship.inverseRelationship$&gt;
  	public NSArray &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(EOQualifier qualifier) {
  		return &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(qualifier, null, false);
  	}
  
  	public NSArray &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(EOQualifier qualifier, boolean fetch) { 
  		return &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(qualifier, null, fetch);
  	}
  &lt;$endif$&gt;
  
  	public NSArray &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;(EOQualifier qualifier, NSArray sortOrderings&lt;$if ToManyRelationship.inverseRelationship$&gt;, boolean fetch&lt;$endif$&gt;) {
  		NSArray results;
  &lt;$if ToManyRelationship.inverseRelationship$&gt;
  		if (fetch) {
  			EOQualifier fullQualifier;
  			EOQualifier inverseQualifier = new EOKeyValueQualifier(&lt;$ToManyRelationship.destination.className$&gt;.&lt;$ToManyRelationship.inverseRelationship.name.uppercaseUnderbarString$&gt;_KEY, EOQualifier.QualifierOperatorEqual, this);
  			if (qualifier == null) {
  				fullQualifier = inverseQualifier;
  			}
  			else {
  				NSMutableArray qualifiers = new NSMutableArray();
  				qualifiers.addObject(qualifier);
  				qualifiers.addObject(inverseQualifier);
  				fullQualifier = new EOAndQualifier(qualifiers);
  			}
  			results = &lt;$ToManyRelationship.destination.className$&gt;.fetch&lt;$ToManyRelationship.destination.name$&gt;s(editingContext(), fullQualifier, sortOrderings);
  		}
  		else {
  &lt;$endif$&gt;
  			results = &lt;$ToManyRelationship.name$&gt;();
  			if (qualifier != null) {
  				results = EOQualifier.filteredArrayWithQualifier(results, qualifier);
  			}
  			if (sortOrderings != null) {
  				results = EOSortOrdering.sortedArrayUsingKeyOrderArray(results, sortOrderings);
  			}
  &lt;$if ToManyRelationship.inverseRelationship$&gt;
  		}
  &lt;$endif$&gt;
  		return results;
  	}

==== John Huss ====
I wanted to share a wonderful bit of knowledge I learned today.  If you're using Java 1.5 you can add @SuppressWarnings(&quot;all&quot;) to the template for your _EO base classes and eliminate annoying compiler messages (usually uneeded import statements).

  @SuppressWarnings(&quot;all&quot;)
  public class _Invoice extends ERXGenericRecord {
  }

==== Guido Neitzer ====
Create awakeFromInsertion() and awakeFromFetch() in your EOGenerator template as a method stub that only calls super() and has a comment for &quot;initialize your object here ...&quot;. You only have to put in the code at that place and can't possibly forget to call super(). Here is an example:

    /** 
     * Initialization of the instance while inserting it into an editing context
     */
     public void awakeFromInsertion (EOEditingContext editingContext) {
         super.awakeFromInsertion (editingContext);
         // initialize your object here
     }

This is from my JavaSubclassSourceTemplate.eotemplate

==== Jerry W. Walker ====
WO and EOF have an incredible array of validation mechanisms. Here are some notes you might find helpful:

* User interface:
** prevent/discourage user from entering inappropriate data
* Formatters:
** formatting
*** Only accepts data with valid format
** type coercion
*** bad type raises exception
** simple validation
*** raises exception and ignores value
*** must be different from current value or not assigned
*** WOComponent's validationFailedWithException(Throwable t, Object value, String keyPath)
**** Called when an Enterprise Object or formatter failed validation  during an assignment.
**** The default implementation ignores the error.
**** Subclassers can override to resolve the error.
* Model
** attribute constraints
*** checks for:
**** allows null
**** string length
**** numeric precision
**** relationship integrity
*** checks these before going to DB
** relationship integrity constraints
*** optionality
**** for both to-one &amp; to-many
*** delete rule
**** if source deleted, then what
*** ownership, owned object is:
**** deleted if relationship broken
**** created if relationship added
*** delete rules (if user tries to delete relationship source):
**** cascade - delete all destination objects too
**** nullify - nullify back references
**** deny - prohibit delete if there are destination objects
**** nothing - delete and ignore destination objects
* EO
** property-level (or key-level) validation
*** called when a value changes
*** default methods in superclass check model based constraints
*** can be overridden for custom validation
*** called BEFORE EO's properties have changed
*** validation methods throw exception on failure
**** validateValueForKey(&quot;weight&quot;) triggers: public &lt;type&gt; validateWeight(Object newWeight) throws NSValidation.ValidationException {
** object-level validation
*** called when saving insert/delete/update changes

=== Changing an EO after Validation ===
Question: I would like to make a change to an EO after it has validated but before it has saved to the graph/DB.  Is this possible?

==== Chuck Hill ====
You don't want to do this, you should not want to do this, and the frameworks will fight you tooth and nail if you try.  validateForSave is the gatekeeper for the object store.  Its job is to ensure that nothing gets saved unless it has validated it.  Modifying the object graph after validateForSave() finished would violate its very reason for existence.

As I see it, you have three options:
# Do it in the component
# Do it in the EO
# Do it in another object

I agree that the component might not be the place to do this and I also don't like to have my EOs call saveChanges().  You might want to think of the third option, having some sort of ShiftManager object that is responsible for overseeing the closing and opening of shifts.  It can provide information to the page on what is valid and what options there are and it can handle the two phase save.

Before I did that, I would consider some other options.  Here are some ideas that might spark some of your own:

* Defer reseting the cash box balance until the _start_ of the next shift.  The last time I was a cashier (thankfully long ago) that is how it worked.  You handed in your cash tray and discrepancy notes, the boss shook his head and muttered.  He then recorded all that information.  For the next worker, he then restocked the cash drawer.  Often that did not happen until the next morning.

* Add a method to Shift like this:

  public void close() throws ValidationException {
    validateForSave();
    cashBox().resetBalance();
  }

and in your component

  try {
    shift().close();
    ec().saveChanges();
  }
  catch (ValidationException v) {
    // do the right thing
  }
  catch (EOGeneralAdaptorException e) {
    // do the right thing
  }

* I had another one, but it has slipped my mind.  :-)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Using ThreadLocals for Accessing Multiple EOObjectStoreCoordinators ===
==== Brendan Duddridge ====
We're trying to fix some of our editing context issues we've been having and we're thinking of creating an architecture like the following:

Note first... we have WOAllowsConcurrentRequestHandling = true

* Create a ThreadLocal to lazily instantiate an EOEditingContext with it's own new EOObjectStoreCoordinator
* When a direct action request comes in, ask the ThreadLocal for it's editing context in performActionNamed.
* Lock the ThreadLocal's editingContext in a try block.
* Process the request and call generateResponse().
* unlock the ThreadLocal's editing context in the finally block.
* Return the response.

So what we'll end up with is a separate connection to the database for each worker thread. So we could potentially have many connections to the database. As worker threads are finalized, we'll close the connection to the database. We may end up using the JavaPoolingJDBCAdaptor to limit the connections to the database. But this would provide for good multi-threaded concurrent access to our application.

Does anyone foresee any undesired issues with this approach? I've never seen this approach postulated in the WO dev archives. One of my developers suggested this approach and I thought it sounded good, so I'd see what others thought first before implementing it. We'd be happy to share our findings and code if it works out well.

==== David LaBer ====
I've worked on an application architected this way, and was not happy. Just so you know where I'm coming from :-)

A couple of thoughts:

* You will have multiple snapshots - one for each of your EOObjectStoreCoordinators. They will not be synchronized. So, you will loose optimistic locking and will have to either implement some kind of inter-stack notification or ensure fresh data by fetching often (sacrificing caching).
* You will complicate your Application architecture making it harder to maintain, harder to understand, and harder to hand off to other WebObjects developers.
* Do you really require multiple concurrent connections to your database for all of your queries? I can understand doing this for queries that profiling has identified as being bottlenecks. However, I'd probably look at other optimizations if possible (ie: shifting as much load as possible to SQL server).
* Multiple instances (although more costly in hardware) will be more cleaner and more maintainable (even *with* implementing a change notification architecture).

As always these opinions are my own, and are open to discussion :-)

==== Chuck Hill ====
Locking-wise, I think that will be fine.  Memory usage is the most likely issue that you will run into. The extra EOF stacks will consume more memory than a single stack implementation.  I'm assuming that this is OK for your purposes, that the requests will not be fetching in a lot of data.  If they do fetch a lot of data, or you do end up with many worker threads, you may find that you apps runs out of memory rather quickly.  You might want to consider some sort of round robin usage  of a set of stacks stored at the app level.  This will at least somewhat limit memory usage.  You may also get more optimistic locking failures at the database like this.  If  you are running multiple instances (which I recall is the case) you have to handle these anyway so that becomes a non-issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
Note that this section covers the locking strategy EOF uses at the databases layer as opposed to EOEditingContext locking which happens much higher in the stack.  For information on EOEditingContext locking, please see [[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Using EOF/Context and Database Locking|Context and Database Locking]].

There are two primary styles of locking that can be used with a database API: pessimistic and optimisic.  Pessimistic locking actively prevents two participants from updating the same row by explicitly locking access to it when the first participant begins to make a change (effectively locking others out until the change is complete).  Optimistic locking allows participants to make changes to the resources without an explicit lock, assuming success, and fails only if the changes actually cause a conflict.  EOF takes the optimistic approach when locking data.

As an example of how optimistic locking in EOF works, assume you have a Person EO with the PersonID 123, first name &quot;Bob&quot;, and last name &quot;Roberts&quot;.  If you change the first name to &quot;Robert&quot; and saveChanges() on your editing context, you would see the following SQL sent to your database:

  update Person set FirstName = 'Robert' where PersonID = 123 and FirstName = 'Bob' and LastName = 'Roberts'

The key to optimistic locking is the where clause on the update.  If you were the only one to change this EO, this update command would return that 1 row was updated, which EOF expected as a successful result.  However, assume another user was editing at the same time and changed Bob's last name to 'Wilson'.  Rerun the above query, and you'd find that ZERO rows would be updated, because the LastName = 'Roberts' clause in the qualifier would not match (the last name in the database is now 'Wilson').  The result of this situation in EOF would be an optimistic locking exception thrown from saveChanges().

When you run EOModeler, you may have noticed the column in the Attributes view with the lock icon in its heading.  This column defines which attributes of your entity will be used for optimistic locking.  All attributes that are checked will appear in the 'where' clause of an update to your object.  Note that all locked columns are checked on an update, not just the columns of the attributes that were modified.

A common problem people run into with EOF is the use of &quot;imprecise&quot; types as locking columns.  By imprecise types, I am referring to types whose precision may change during the lifetime of an EO even when it has not been modified by a user.  The most notorious data types for this problem are dates and floating point types.  It is very common that the precision of Java for floating point types does not match the precision of your database.  The result of this is that when EOF brings the float out of the database, puts it in a Float, and places it in your snapshost, the very act of loading it into a Float changes its value.  This can often cause very strange problems with locking where you will end up with optimistic locking failures even when there was no concurrent update.  The recommendation for this case is to uncheck the Lock column on attributes with date and floating point types if your database is causing problems.  The obvious downside of this is that these fields will not be elligible for detection of optimistic locking failures (that is, &quot;last write wins&quot; for that column and your program won't be notified of a collision of updates).

mmalcolm gave a presentation at O'Reilly's 2002 Mac OS X conference titled &quot;A Lack of Conflicts in EOF, or 'Hey Mom, Someone Overwrote My Data!'&quot; and the slides are available at http://conferences.oreillynet.com/presentations/macosx02/crawford_eoconflicts.pdf

=== Optimistic Locking and Performance ===
There have been several threads of discussion about the additional database server load with optimistic locking (as the database must verify all of the locked column values prior to an update). 

In January 2006, a benchmark was run on WebObjects 5.3 with the following scenario:

This was run on the latest version of FrontBase as of Jan 2006 on an Intel iMac with WO 5.3:

Two identical entities were created which have 3 ints, 3 booleans, 3 strings, and 3 dates as properties, but one locks all attrs and one locks none.  10,000 instances of each were inserted into the db, followed by an update of the same attribute for each with the same change in value.

For the entity with all columns locked, it took 25753ms to complete the run.  For the entity with no columns locked, it took 7111ms to complete the run. It was 3.6x faster to not lock any columns in this example, with this database, on this hardware.

Modifying the scenario to lock on one date column results in the entity with the lock taking 25574ms to complete the run, while the unlocked entity took 14125ms to complete, for a speed difference of 1.81x.

It really depends on the type of application you have. If you're doing 100,000 updates, you probably care that it takes an extra 190 seconds (or whatever the time differential might be) to perform the update.  But if you're just periodically updating &quot;normal&quot; datasets, it may not matter that it takes an extra few milliseconds.  The trade-off, obviously, is data integrity.

Database benchmarks are never simple, and often don't apply across databases of different vendors, so take these results with a grain of salt.  Always profile your application before you make large sacrifices in functionality.

=== Seeing it Occur ===
==== Kieran Kelleher ====
Here is the easiest way to trigger it.

# Pull an object into an edit page in WO.
# Now go in the back door to the database using command line or some other tool independent of WebObjects and directly edit some attributes (that have the little lock ON in EOModel) of the databases record that represents the object.
# Now submit your object editing page
# An optimistic locking exception will now get thrown because the original snapshot that was read in from the database before you edited the object is different to the values in the database now.

Let's say we have a table with a primary key 'oid' and one optimistically locked attribute named 'field1'.
Now we fetch the object with primary key 273 and its DB value is &quot;original&quot;.

Now let's say you change the field1 to be &quot;new&quot; in WO in a form and BEFORE you submit, let's say you changed the DB field1 value directly to &quot;changed&quot;, then when you submit, EOF generates SQL something like:
UPDATE table T1 set field1 = &quot;new&quot; where oid = 273 and field1 = &quot;original&quot;;

.... and this update will FAIL because there is NO record having oid = 273 and field1 = &quot;original&quot;. There IS a record with oid = 273 and field1 = &quot;changed&quot;, but WO does not know that because some other application has changed it.

If you log out the SQL while changing you will see that optimistic locking effects the WHERE part of all the UPDATE statements that are generated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
By default, when you use an EOFetchSpecification, it will fetch all of the EOs that match its EOQualifier.  However, often the user interface you will be using is paginated, and there are large performance wins by instead loading your results in pages.

=== Core WO ===
EOFetchSpecification provides a setFetchLimit(int) method, but it does not directly support pagination, rather it will simply stop returning results after the number specified.  This is useful for a cut-and-run approach to querying, but if you need to provide multiple pages of results, you will likely need to look elsewhere.

=== Project Wonder ===
Project Wonder provides several faciliities for addressing this problem:

* ERXEOControlUtilities.objectsInRange(ec, fs, start, end) for Postgres, MySQL, and Frontbase
* ERXBatchingDisplayGroup
* ERXRecursiveBatchFetching

the &quot;popular&quot; form actually called &quot;Zorn's Lemma&quot;, and

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is a guide to the 6502 Assembly language. This book will teach the different memory addressing modes and instructions of the 8-bit 6502 processor.

You might want to learn 6502 assembly language programming if you want to do Atari 8 Bit Programming, Commodore 64 Programming, [[NES Programming]]
or [[Super NES Programming]].

== Memory Addressing Modes ==

These are the thirteen memory addressing modes for the 6502 processor including some examples.

===Accumulator: A===

The Accumulator is implied as the operand, so no address needs to be specified.

''' Example '''

Using the ASL (Arithmetic Shift Left) instruction with no operands, the Accumulator is always the value being shifted left.

 ASL

===Implied: i===

The operand is implied, so it does not need to be specified.

''' Example '''

The operands being implied here are X, the source of the transfer, and A, the destination of the transfer.

 TXA

===Immediate: #===

The operand is used directly to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value $22 is loaded into the Accumulator.

 LDA #$22

===Absolute: a===

A full 16-bit address is specified and the byte at that address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value at address $D010 is loaded into the X register.

 LDX $D010

===Zero Page: zp===

A single byte specifies an address in the first page of memory ($00xx), also known as the zero page, and the byte at that address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value at address $0002 is loaded into the Y register.

 LDY $02

===Relative: r===

The offset specified is added to the current address stored in the Program Counter (PC).  Offsets can range from -128 to +127.

''' Example '''

The offset $2D is added to the address in the Program Counter (say $C100).  The destination of the branch (if taken) will be $C12D.

 BPL $2D

===Absolute Indexed with X: a,x===

The value in X is added to the specified address for a sum address. The value at the sum address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value $02 in X is added to $C001 for a sum of $C003. The value $5A at address $C003 is used to perform the ''add with carry'' (''ADC'') operation.

 ADC $C001,X

===Absolute Indexed with Y: a,y===

The value in Y is added to the specified address for a sum address. The value at the sum address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value $03 in Y is added to $F001 for a sum of $F004. The value $EF at address $F004 is incremented (''INC'') and $F0 is written back to $F004.

 INC $F001,Y

===Zero Page Indexed with X: zp,x===

The value in X is added to the specified zero page address for a sum address. The value at the sum address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value $02 in X is added to $01 for a sum of $03. The value $A5 at address $0003 is loaded into the Accumulator.

 LDA $01,X

===Zero Page Indexed with Y: zp,y===

The value in Y is added to the specified zero page address for a sum address. The value at the sum address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value $03 in Y is added to $01 for a sum of $04. The value $E3 at address $0004 is loaded into the Accumulator.

 LDA $01,Y

===Zero Page Indexed Indirect: (zp,x)===

The value in X is added to the specified zero page address for a sum address. The little-endian address stored at the two-byte pair of sum address (LSB) and sum address plus one (MSB) is loaded and the value at that address is used to perform the computation.

''' Example '''

The value $02 in X is added to $15 for a sum of $17. The address $D010 at addresses $0017 and $0018 will be where the value $0F in the accumulator is stored.

 STA ($15,X)

===Zero Page Indirect Indexed with Y: (zp),y===

The value in Y is added to the address at the little-endian address stored at the two-byte pair of the specified address (LSB) and the specified address plus one (MSB). The value at the sum address is used to perform the computation. Indeed addressing mode actually repeats exactly the accumulator register's digits.

''' Example '''

The value $03 in Y is added to the address $C235 at addresses $002A and $002B for a sum of $C238. The value $2F at $C238 is shifted right (yielding $17) and written back to $C238.

 LSR ($2A),Y

== Instructions ==

These are the instructions for the 6502 processor including an ASCII visual, a list of affected flags, and a table of opcodes for acceptable addressing modes.

A '''soufflé''' is a light, fluffy baked dish made with [[Cookbook:egg|egg yolk]]s and beaten [[Cookbook:egg|egg white]]s combined with various other ingredients and served as a main dish or sweetened as a [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]]. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb ''souffler'' which means &quot;to blow up&quot; or more loosely &quot;puff up&quot; - an apt description of what happens to this combination of [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]] and egg whites. 

Every soufflé is made from 2 basic components; a base of flavored cream sauce or purée and beaten egg whites. The base provides the flavor and the whites provide the &quot;lift&quot;. Common varieties include [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], and [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]] (the last two made as desserts, with a good deal of [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]).

Soufflé is considered a great delicacy.  When it comes out of the oven, a soufflé is generally very large and fluffy, and will 'fall' after 20 or 30 minutes (as risen dough does). For best results, soufflé should be eaten quickly, while hot and before it falls.

Soufflé can be made in containers of all shapes and sizes, but the best are tall cylindrical containers which conduct heat well. It is traditional to make soufflé in &quot;soufflé cups&quot; or ramekins.

Since a soufflé has a delicate structure, making one requires cleanliness and precision. The bowl and beaters should be perfectly clean, and the egg whites should be at room temperature before beating. The whites should be beaten until they are smooth, shiny and hold a soft peak; if the whites appear grainy or clump together, another egg white can be added and the mixture should be beaten again. Always cook soufflés on the bottom rack of the oven or the resulting soufflé may have a leathery top crust.

&lt;b&gt;RECIPE:&lt;/b&gt;
The most commonly used recipe for soufflé is to use 1 quart of heavy cream per 11 eggs.
after pouring the mixture into a heavy baking dish, sprinkle croûtons, shredded cheese, and salt and pepper into the mixture.
bake in an over at 325F for one hour or until you can toothpick the center until dry.

{{Warning|It may be difficult or impossible to cook a soufflé long enough to ensure that any  bacteria in the eggs have been killed.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Attaching EO's to a Form ===
==== Pierre Bernard ====
I do create the EO and insert it into an editing context dedicated to the task of creating and eventually saving that EO. That editing context is peer to the default editing context. Actually all my edits happen in dedicated peer contexts. The session default is used for reads only. This eliminates the risk of having a pending change hang around.

Doing so I get the default values set in awakeFromInsertion() in my initail form.

I however do not bind the EO directly to the form. I transform the EO into a dictionary of strings. Using key-value coding I first extract a set of values I want in the form. Then again using key-value coding as well as formatters I derive a string representation for each value. The form is bound to a _clone_ that dictionary of values.

After the form is submitted I compare the modified clone to the original dictionary. Only for the changed values I do a reverse transformation from String to object or EO value. This is done by first parsing the string using a formatter and the possibly calling a fetch specification.

This has the following advantages:
* I can map to-one relationships to a plain form
* I only set actually modifed values on the EO
* I do not lose precision on a value which internally had a higher precision than what the form shows
* I handle parsing exceptions in code. For one this allows keeping the unparsable value in the form

==== Ondra Cada ====
Depends on the application.

But most often, I am eating my cake and still having it by creating the EO first, but saving it into EC only when properly set up. That way, it can be wired up directly, and still, if the user abandons it, it just vanishes when the GC decides so :)

==== Geoff Hopson ====
I find it much cleaner to have a formValues NSMutableDictionary and have the key names the same as my EO attribute names. In my WOD file I can bind text field values etc. to 'formValues.myAttribute. It also allows me to preset some defaults, hide any hidden fields I may need, stuff like that. I can then easily blat the dictionary into an inserted EO once I am pretty happy with the data that has been collected.

==== Mike Schrag ====
Do most of you create the EO up-front and attach the form fields directly to the attributes of the EO, or do you clone the fields into the WOComponent and attach to those, then move them into a new EO in the &quot;save&quot; action?  The problem with the first route is that if someone navigates away, you've got an empty EO inserted into the EC and the user doesn't realize that it's still sitting in their session, but it's obviously nicer because you can just wire up directly to the EO attributes and you don't have to keep the Component and the EO fields in-sync

==== Jean-François Veillette ====
I use a new EO, in a 'peer' editingContext used for insertion/edition.  That way, If changes are made to the eo, but not saved, and user change page, or even use the browser back button, I do not care, he doesn't screw-up the 'main' editingContext.

I forgot to mention another option that I used in some special situation :
Instead of binding to an EO, bind to a NSMutableDictionary, then when you're ready to save, you can create your eo and apply the dictionary values to it (there is a method for that).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
A WOSession provides the encapsulation of all the state that is associated with a user's use of your application.  Each WebObjects application has its own subclass of WOSession, which is a significant difference between session tracking in WebObjects and J2EE.  In J2EE, HttpSession is not subclassed, and all state is stored as attributes in HttpSession's Map.  In WebObjects, sessions are much richer, providing the ability to take advantage of all the benefits of being a full-blown class (typed fields, methods, etc).  WOSessions have a timeout time, which by default is configured in the WOApplication configuration.  This timeout time determines how long the server will keep the session alive without any active requests.  When the session times out, it will be garbage collected.

=== Accessing the Session ===
  Session session = (Session)session();

Note that this works only in WOComponent or WODirectAction subclasses. If you want to access the session from elsewhere, pick an answer from this list:
* Your design is wrong; don't access the session from that class.
* Create and maintain an index of which thread is dealing with which session, then you can always find the current session from anywhere.
* Run single-threaded only, and maintain a store of which session is current.
* Pass the session in from the calling component or direct action. But, see the first item.

'''Just one more word of caution do not set the session as a class variable of WOComponent or WODirectAction, this would create a loop and prevent the garbage collection of old sessions.'''

''Is the above really true? In a WO5 pure-Java application, circular references like this might create more work for the garbage collector, but shouldn't prevent anything from getting garbage collected. The Java garbage collector is supposed to handle circular references just fine. -- JonathanRochkind''

If you like to simplify your code just insert the following method in your component (this will save you some typing):

  public Session Session() {
    return (Session)this.session();
  }

We always begin our projects with a WOComponent subclass that we use as a superclass for all the rest of our components. We include this method as well as a few other useful utility methods.  -- JoshuaMarker

As I recall the warnings about storing references to Session were specific to inner classes of Session. Storing references to Session inside another component is perfectly ok, although an accessor method is better. -- BrianMarquis

''I still think even this is not a problem in WO5, although it probably is in WO4.5. JRE 1.3.1 is supposed to garbage collect circular references just fine, whether involving an inner class or not. But maybe the JRE doesn't do what it's supposed to? -- JonathanRochkind''

=== Session Tracking ===
The first time a session is requested for a request, WebObjects ensures that all subsequent requests from the same user will use the same WOSession instance.  WebObjects achieves this session tracking with one of three techniques: URL rewriting, cookies, or query strings.

With URL rewriting, once the session is initialized, generated URLs will include the session's ID in the URL path.  For instance, if you use a WOHyperlink, the generated URL will look something like &quot;http://hostname.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/AppName.woa/1/wo/EMVnGH1g8VLOW2TRMm3Ptg/6.0.19.15.1.3.1&quot;.  The &quot;EMVnGH1g8VLOW2TRMm3Ptg&quot; in this example is the uniquely generated session ID.  All requests that come in with this session ID in the URL will be attached to the same WOSession instance.

Cookies work in a similar fashion, except that instead of rewriting URLs to pass the session ID, the session ID is passed in a cookie called &quot;wosid&quot;.

Lastly, you can pass a query string attribute named &quot;wosid&quot; that contains the session ID.  This is often used when calling DirectActions that need access to the user's session.

=== Performance Implications ===
Session creation and persistence must be carefully monitored in large deployments due to the memory usage required to keep the session alive.  It is generally recommended to minimize session creation whenever possible.  When using &quot;normal&quot; WebObjects techniques, this can be difficult.  The default behavior of WOHyperlink, for instance, when calling an action on your WOComponents is to cause sessions to be generated.  The typical method for avoiding session creation is to implement your application using DirectActions.  DirectActions do not require a page cache to be created for page state preservation, and thus can be used in a completely stateless way.  The downside of using only DirectActions is that you lose the benefits of a more stateful approach.  For instance, when using DirectActions only, you will find that you have to manually wire up your state objects by interpreting query string variables.

You can check for the existence of a session in a DirectAction by calling the existingSession() method.  If a session exists, it will be returned.  If a session has not yet been created, then this method will return null.

Adjusting your session timeout can have a large impact on performance.  The longer a session timeout is, the longer the session will consume memory.  Under heavy load, &quot;dead&quot; sessions can build up, so the timeout time should be tuned to be as low as possible without negatively affecting your user's experience with your application.

=== Hanging Sessions ===
There are certain cases in WebObjects where thrown exceptions can cause a session to not be checked back into the WOSessionStore, which will deadlock the session.  One of the more common causes of this is an exception thrown from a DirectAction that uses a session.  If you use Project Wonder's ERXApplication, ERXSession, etc, it provides a prevention mechanism for this problem.  However, if you are using a default WebObjects installation without Project Wonder, you will need to deal with this problem yourself.  You should not let your DirectActions throw an exception in this case.

=== Checking for Existing Session ===
If you are in a DirectAction method when trying to do this, check the following WOAction method (WOAction is WODirectAction's superclass):

  public WOSession existingSession()
Restores the session based on the request. If the request did not have a session ID or the session ID referred to a non-existent session, then this method returns null. To determine if a session failed to restore, check the request's session ID to see if it non-null and if so, call this method to check its result.

Returns:
a WOSession object which represents periods during which access to a WebObjects application and its resources is granted to a particular client

If you're not in a DirectAction method, look at WOContext's method:

  public boolean hasSession()
Returns true if a session exists for the receiving context, false otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===

==== Anjo Krank ====
This is what the ERXObjectStoreCoordinatorPool does. You need to create each EC via the ERXEC factory to use it. Basically it assigns each session an OSC from a pool (more info is in the docs and the code). This does not help you when you have long-running statements going on, as there still sessions blocked - albeit not so many.

If you have long-running stuff, then you should create an OSC especially for them and use a long-running page.

=== Synchronizing Multiple EOF Stacks ===
The problem is synchronzing multiple EOF stacks is essentially the same as synchronizing multiple instances of your WebObjects application.  Typically the same tricks apply to both.

==== WireHose ====
* [http://www.wirehose.com/download/ Wirehose Change Notification]
* [[Programming:WebObjects/Project_WONDER/Organization#ERChangeNotificationJMS|ERChangeNotificationJMS]]
* [[Programming:WebObjects/Project_WONDER/Organization#EO_Stuff | ERXObjectStoreCoordinatorSynchronizer]]

==== Christian Pekeler ====
I prefer architectures where the database is the private store of one application (or a set of related applications built using the same technology - WO/EOF in our case). So if you need a different kind of application to change data, let it go trough the application that own the DB instead of giving it direct access to the DB.

Just recently I was involved in a project that heavily relied on DB triggers. We created a new WO application called CheckInProcessor. It listened on a port for new data (using a proprietary protocol). The external app that used to write new data directly to the DB was changed to send the data to the CheckInProcessor. The CheckInProcessor writes that new data to the DB, performs tasks equivalent to the old triggers, and notified the other WO apps of any changes (using WONDER's EOUpdateNotification framework).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===

=== Using UTF-8 encoding ===

Place the following code in your WOApplication's dispatchRequest

  worequest.setContentEncoding(_NSUtilities.UTF8StringEncoding);
  worequest.setHeader(&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8; encoding=UTF-8&quot;, &quot;content-type&quot;);

This will make every page use UTF8 encoding when sending content back to the browser.

==== Santi ====
To use UTF-8 encoding you need four steps:

* You must ensure that your database is using UTF-8 as a storing format. It is the default for FrontBase but you need a bit of tweaking for Oracle. If I remember correctly you need to add these to your connection dictionary in EOModeler:
        NLS_DATE_FORMAT = &quot;YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS&quot;; 
        NLS_LANG = AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8; 
        databaseEncoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;; 

* With PostgreSQL, to enable UTF-8 support you have to compile it with the
   --enable-multibyte 
flag, so you can create a new database specifying the encoding with:
   createdb -U postgres -E UNICODE 

* Encode your page in UTF-8. Set it as the default in WO builder and check the encoding by examinig the *.woo file inside the *.wo folder.
  {&quot;WebObjects Release&quot; = &quot;WebObjects 5.0&quot;; encoding = NSUTF8StringEncoding; }

If they are not yet encoded in UTF-8 you can copy-paste the above line into your .woo file. Then you can change the encoding of the .wod and .html files (in pbx) by going to the &quot;Format&quot; menu and choosing &quot;file Encodings&quot;.

The reason for doing this step is to minimize conversion at run time. If all your component are UTF-8 encoded then WO does not need to do any conversion during the page generation process. I have never actually tested the performance so it may be unwarranted.
* Add the following META to your headers

  &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt; 

* You also need to overwrite Session.appendToResponse and set the encoding to &quot;UTF8&quot;; before calling super, the same applies to takeValuesFromRequest . You may also want to add a meta in the header giving the encoding (I am not sure this is necessary with modern browsers). 

    public void appendToResponse(WOResponse aResponse, WOContext aContext) {
        // set the encoding before anything is garbled
        aResponse.setContentEncoding( _NSUtilities.UTF8StringEncoding );
        super.appendToResponse(aResponse, aContext);
    }

    public void takeValuesFromRequest(WORequest aRequest, WOContext  aContext) {
        aRequest.setDefaultFormValueEncoding( _NSUtilities.UTF8StringEncoding );
        super.takeValuesFromRequest(aRequest, aContext);
    }

Beware of the two spelling when setting the encoding in a WOMessage the name is &quot;UTF8&quot;; or use the private function _NSUtilities.UTF8StringEncoding. Everywhere else it is &quot;UTF-8&quot;

''Is this really necessary? Is not enough to add WOMessage.setDefaultEncoding(&quot;UTF8&quot;) in the application constructor?''

''And by the way, I don't understand well the difference between WOMessage.defaultEncoding and WORequest.defaultFormValueEncoding''

''One is about the URL an the other about the data within the form? I'm a bit confused.''

==== David Paules ====
The first step in modifying the EOModel's connection dictionary was unnecesary for me. I used OpenBase as my backend database. OpenBase allows you to create a database with one of n different encodings (UTF8 is one of them). The EO Framework was capable of storing and retrieving UTF8 character data from OpenBase without any customization of the connection dictionary (ie, the connection dictionary only had the jdbc driver and database URL and user/password).

Since you must modify the session's appendToResponse method, you can simplify the process of adding the META tags to all your pages by doing it in code once. Simply add

  aResponse.setHeader(&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8; encoding=UTF-8&quot;, &quot;content-type&quot;); 

before calling

  super.appendToResponse(aResponse, aContext); 

Another person adds: Note, this is NOT the same as adding a meta tag to all your pages at once. It's adding a header to all your responses. But that should be just as good, or better. The META tag is really just meant to simulate the header. 

For WebObjects 4.x using ObjectiveC you will need to following code in the WOComponent class:

  -(void) appendToResponse: (WOResponse *) r inContext: (WOContext *) c
  {
    [r setHeader:@&quot;text/html; charsetUTF-8; encoding=UTF8&quot;; forKey:@&quot;Content-type&quot;];
    [r setContentEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    [super appendToResponse:r inContext:c];
  }

  -(void) takeValuesFromRequest: (WORequest *) r inContext: (WOContext *) c
  {
    [r setFormValueEncodingDetectionEnabled:NO];
    [r setDefaultFormValueEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    [super takeValuesFromRequest:r inContext:c];
  }

You also need to disable the encoding detection... at least I had to do it in my case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The British Broadcasting Corporation, otherwise known as the BBC brings it to our attention that Education is at the heart of many of children’s programmes aired on TV.  For example from Bite-size revision for GCSE students and schools TV to learning through play programmes the BBC argues that it makes learning more enjoyable and relevant to children of all ages (BBC Website 2006)

CBeebies is a good example and has a number of stimulating programmes built around the national pre-school curriculum. It helps pre-school children to play along and learn through watching their favourite characters on screen. Tikkabilla is one good example of this as it encourages children to join in singing, dancing and make-and-do activities grouped around early learning topics such as “where I live” and telling the time. Big Cook Little Cook is another excellent example and is the first pre-school cookery show that teaches children how to make healthy and fun food. 

The National Literacy Trust commissioned a study into how educational children’s programmes can benefit a child’s literacy development.  The review found that television can enhance many aspects of children's language, particularly for children between the ages of two and five, depending on quality and age-appropriateness of the content, and parent/carer interactions during and after viewing. Educational television, such as Sesame Street, has been found to enhance vocabulary, comprehension and expressive language development in pre-schoolers. It has been suggested in American research that pre-schoolers are not exposed to enough educational television, which can prepare them for school. (Literacy Trust website 2006)

For older children, there are programmes on the CBBC Channel that encourage 6–12 year olds to find things out for fun, exploring their existing interests or even developing new ones. Children are given the chance to explore new hobbies and build on their talents, such as cookery with Planet Cook or art with Smart. 

Children with learning difficulties can take advantage of a programme called Something Special.  This is designed to offer new and exciting ways to communicate for children with learning difficulties. It uses Makaton and a character called Mr Tumble teaches young children and their parents and carers to sign along to stories, songs and activities, and encourages children of all abilities to play together. 

Other programmes such as Grange Hill have helped children understand social issues and the storylines have tackled drugs, rape and teenage pregnancy.

==Edward VII (1901-1910)==
[[Image:Edward vii england.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Edward VII]]
Edward VII was born at Buckingham Palace on 9 November 1841. His parents were Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Edward VII was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King of the Commonwealth Realms and the Emperor of India from 22 January 1901 to his death on 6 May 1910. He was the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Despite taking the name &quot;King Edward&quot;, he was known to his family as &quot;Bertie&quot; as his first name was Albert.

===Early life===

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert wanted their eldest son to have an education that would prepare him to be a model constitutional monarch. Aged seven, Bertie started a rigorous educational programme devised by the Prince Consort. However, he was not a good student, with his main talents being his tact and charm. Edward hoped to have a career in the British Army, but this was denied him because he was heir to the throne, although he did serve briefly in the Grenadier Guards in 1861. As a young man, he gained a reputation as a playboy.

===Marriage===

Once widowed, Queen Victoria withdrew from public life, but she did arrange for her son to marry Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the beautiful elder daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. The couple married on 10 March 1863. However, Edward kept mistresses throughout his married life.

===Heir apparent===

During Victoria's widowhood, Edward represented her at public gatherings, but Victoria did not allow him to have an active role in the running of the country. Several incidents, including a court appearance in a notorious divorce case, brought him bad press and caused him to be regarded as unsuitable material for a future monarch. He was known for his love of gambling and country sports. But Edward was also a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the Royal College of Music.

===Reign===

When Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, Bertie, then aged 59, became king. Edward VII and Queen Alexandra were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902. His coronation was going to be on 26 June, but two days before on 24 June, Edward developed appendicitis. He needed what may have been a life-saving operation. Two weeks later it was announced that the King was out of danger.

As king, Edward's main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he made a number of visits abroad. One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in spring 1903 as the guest of President Émile Loubet. This visit helped build the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale, which was an informal agreement setting out what territories were British and French colonies in North Africa, with the aim of preventing future wars between the two countries.

Edward VII, mainly through his mother and his father-in-law, was related to nearly every other European monarch and came to be known as the Uncle of Europe. The German Emperor Wilhelm II, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, King Alphonso XIII of Spain and Carl Eduard, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were Edward's nephews. King Haakon VII of Norway was his son-in-law and nephew by marriage. King George I of the Hellenes and King Frederick VIII of Denmark were his brothers-in-law. King Albert I of the Belgians, King Manuel II of Portugal, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Prince Ernst August, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, were his cousins.

In the last year of his life, Edward was involved in a constitutional crisis when the Conservative majority in the House of Lords refused to pass the &quot;People's Budget&quot; proposed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith. The King died before the Liberal victory in the 1910 general election resolved the situation, but he told Asquith that he would, if necessary, appoint new peers to allow the Budget to pass through the House of Lords.

===Death===

Edward died from a heart attack brought on by bronchitis on 6 May 1910. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, who became George V.

==George V (1910-1936)==
[[File:George V - BANQ.png|right|thumb|150px|George V]]
George V was born at Marlborough House on 3 June 1865. His parents were Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. He was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King of the Commonwealth Realms and Emperor of India from 6 May 1910 until his death on 20 January 1936.

===Early life===

As a younger son of the Prince of Wales (as Edward VII then was), he was not expected to become king. However, as George was born only fifteen months after his brother Prince Albert Victor, it was decided to educate both royal princes together. Given the importance of Prince Albert Victor's expected future role as king, both brothers were given a strict programme of study, although neither did well at their studies.

Later the royal brothers served as Naval cadets on HMS ''Bacchante''. They toured the British Empire, visiting the colonies in Australia and the Far East, and also getting tattooed in Japan. When they returned to the UK, the brothers were parted with George joining the Royal Navy and Albert Victor attending Trinity College, Cambridge. George served in the navy until 1891. He travelled the world and visited many areas of the British Empire. He also got many more tattoos, and a parrot that he took home to England with him.

===Marriage===

In 1891, Prince Albert Victor became engaged to his second cousin once removed, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (always called &quot;May&quot;), the only daughter of Prince Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge. However, Albert Victor died of pneumonia six weeks later, leaving George second in line to the throne and likely to succeed after his father. Queen Victoria still favoured Princess May as a suitable bride for a future King, so she persuaded George to propose to May and May accepted. Despite its being an arranged marriage, George and May's marriage was largely successful, and unlike his father, George is not believed to have had a mistress. They married on 6 July 1893, and they had six children in total. David and Bertie were the first two. Then came Mary, Henry, George and John. The first two were later to become King Edward VIII and King George VI respectively.

===Time before becoming king===

In 1892 Queen Victoria made George the Duke of York. As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May carried out a wide variety of public duties. In 1900, they toured the British Empire, visiting Australia, where the Duke opened the first session of the Australian Parliament on the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia. 

In 1901, Queen Victoria died and George became next in line to the throne. His father, Edward VII, made him Prince of Wales later that year. In contrast with Queen Victoria, who excluded Edward from state affairs, George was given wide access to state documents and papers. He often read over the papers with his wife, Princess May, who was cleverer than him. May also helped write speeches for her husband.

===Reign===
 
On 6 May 1910, King Edward VII died and George became George V. Princess May became Queen Mary. On 11 December 1911, the King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar, where they were presented to Indian dignitaries and princes as the Emperor and Empress of India. George wore the newly-created Imperial Crown of India at the ceremony. Later, the Emperor and Empress travelled throughout India visiting their new subjects.

As King and Queen, George and Mary saw Britain through World War I. This war was fought against Germany, amongst others, which made it a difficult time for the Royal Family, as they had many German relatives. On 17 July 1917 he changed the name of the British Royal House from the German-sounding House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor. He also renounced all use of German titles and styles for his British relatives.

===Death===

World War I took its toll on George's health, which rapidly worsened. He had always had a weak chest, which was not helped by his smoking. An illness saw him go to the seaside, by Bognor Regis in Sussex, where Queen Mary helped nurse him back to health (however, reputedly the King's last words, upon being told that he would soon be well enough to revisit Bognor Regis were &quot;... bugger Bognor!&quot;)  He did live to see the Silver Jubilee of his reign, in 1935, by which time he had become a well-loved king.

George died on 20 January 1936 at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. It is said his death was hastened by his doctor giving him a lethal injection of cocaine and morphine, both to end the King's suffering and to make sure he died by midnight so that his death could be announced in the morning newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Possibly moving the module ==

Hi!

While this is a really neat tutorial on creating a cute little penguin, this module doesn't introduce any new functions or tools of blender. Translation, rotation, scaling, extrusion, merging etc. are all tools from previous modules. Maybe this tutorial could be moved to the 'Miscellaneous Tutorials' section?

( I actually get this feeling from a lot of this books modules - that it's just a collection of miscellaneous tutorials. When learning about a new program shouldn't the main focus be on explaining the tools? Of course a little bit of repetition never hurt anyone, and to learn new tools, old tools will have to be used in the process of explaining what the new ones do. Sure now we know how to make a hat, a person and a penguin, but what about a toaster, a parrot, a moon, or the greek god Zeus when he's in a bad mood - are there going to be tutorials about these things too? )

Oh, and another thing! The term &quot;noob notes&quot; seems a bit weird here. Why not just &quot;Observe&quot; or &quot;Hint&quot; or something like that. I mean, aren't we all noobs reading this?

== Coloring ==

I colored the rest of this little guy using the Multiple Mesh technique. Here's what he looks like: http://img324.imageshack.us/img324/291/penguin1wn.png I'll probably add a section on how to do so, if nobody minds.
::Sorry for making all of you guys wait, other things have come up. I've got to register with Wikipedia to upload the pics, which will slow down any work I'm going to do. If I can't do it for some reason I'll let you guys know.

----------
Hi, My Name is Craig, i havnt got a clue how to colour my penguin, i have made him to how the tut says to, but im a bit puzzeled about how to colour him, could somone please add something onto this tut about colouring.

Thanks

'''EDIT:

i have now coloured him and i dont need any help but it still may be a good idea to post how to colour it for other people.

i used the same technique from the dice tut.'''

== Fixed the Limit selection to visible picture ==

It was pointing to the wrong button before, so I replaced it with a picture of my own.
-Cleobod

== just a little correction ==

=== Step 1 ===

to put cursor in middle from the box it says, selection-cursor, but it is cursor-selection instead

=== Step 3 – the head ===

Shouldn't limit selection to visable be turned on here?

=== Step 4 - The Wings ===

At the end of this step, you have to select the two backmost vertices, but I couldn't find the ones so it is the same as on the picture

=== Step 5 ===

Says: Now select the bottom most vertices in the same fashion, and press SHIFT + FKEY to Fill the hollow bottom of the poor bottomless penguin.

Shouldnt it just be FKEY for new face?

: Nope, it would work if there were only 3 or 4 vertices, but FKEY for new face can't cope with so many at once. It makes at most a single new face, and blender's faces cannot have more than 4 vertices. Shift-FKEY tries to work out a way to connect all the vertices using as many faces as it needs. &lt;br&gt; -- [[User:Darloth|Darloth]] &lt;i&gt;is terrible at explanations, but hopefully that helped.&lt;/i&gt;

==Making the Neck==
Could someone explain this in a little more detail I'm having trouble forming the neck?

Me too. I get up to the part that says &quot; repeat (selection, etc.)&quot; but what part do i repeat do I unselect and do the same thing over or continue on with the top 3 already selected.
Instead of repeating I ended up extruding the middle then rotating it a little: 

I did this by:

From the picture directly right of Rotating the neck:

1. Extrude the top 3 rings up (just less than double the size)
2. Rotate them 45 Counter-Clockwise
3. Extrude the top 2 rings (double their size)
4. Rotate the extruded part 50 Counter-CLockwise

I ended up with this: http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/8686/penguinfv0.jpg (sorry can't upload images to wiki for 4 days)

Start:   http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/7466/penguin1kp7.jpg
Stage 1: http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/1289/penguin2dh6.jpg
Stage 2: http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/3517/penguin3zf2.jpg
Stage 3: http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/8977/penguin4vy2.jpg


In the final step where you move neck to the left, if you follow the Noob Note, there is a keypress missing and the neck skews along the X-axis.  You need to press G, Y, -0.4.  The &quot;Y&quot; constrains the movement along the Y-axis and you end up with what is in the picture. --[[User:Blonewolfs|Blonewolfs]] ([[User talk:Blonewolfs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blonewolfs|contribs]]) 15:36, 20 April 2013 (UTC)

== neck pointing in oppisite direction to the photos ==
when I made the neck from the side view in 2.49b up .3 on the Z hittig the blue arrow worked fine, but rotating by typing 30, made my neck point in the oppisite direction to the pictures.. lol [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 22:06, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

Instead of typing &quot;30&quot;, you need to type &quot;-30&quot; to rotate counter-clockwise. --[[User:Blonewolfs|Blonewolfs]] ([[User talk:Blonewolfs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blonewolfs|contribs]]) 15:23, 20 April 2013 (UTC)


evidently the even though I made it in side view, i had to AKEY twice, then NUM7, then Space -&gt; Transform -&gt; Rotate -180 to get mine to look like the photos [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 22:17, 9 July 2010 (UTC)


but now I've learned I could have pressed ctrl + num 3 and saw it from the other side! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 15:23, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

== Extruding the wings ==
User comment: I really need to do this by hand? Is there no way to tell Blender to do the same on the other side?

reply:You can select '''CTRL+SPACE'''-&gt;''scale'' and while in front view, use the red square. Just make sure the cursor is between the wings. After you select the faces to extrude, just '''SHIFT+SKEY'''-&gt;''Cursor-&gt;Selection''.

User reply: Modifiers-&gt; Add Modifier -&gt; Mirror. Use the X-axis. Click &quot;apply&quot; when done with the symetrical stuff. 

User response: adding a mirror modifier resulted in the surface of the penguin looking corrupt (response to self - because the penguin body was being mirrored on top of itself, but even when half of the penguin vertices are removed an unsightly seem is left).

Final user response: You can fix the 'corruption' by pressing Ctrl+W and choosing &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; after mirroring. 

Appendix to Final user response: &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; will only get rid of the distortion if you select half of the faces in Front view ('''NUM1'''), hit ('''XKEY''') and select &quot;Faces&quot; in the delete menu on the side to be mirrored, then the mirror modifier won't leave a seam, or distortion due to overlap.

Another User reply: Or you can select the bottom faces on both sides, and only then extrude.

Last User comment: Switch to Edit Mode. Select all penguin vertex by pressing AKEY twice. In &quot;Mesh tools&quot; tab click in &quot;Rem Doubl&quot; button.

Another Last User Comment: If you select both faces and hit '''EKEY'''&gt;''Individual Faces'' and then use &quot;1.4&quot; it works just fine.

====Creating the beak====
I prefer to set the MMB to pan the view instead of rotate it, but until just recently I didn't know how to center the camera again, and I'm posting this to help other Blender newbies who prefer this. I found that if  you press &quot;C&quot; you can easily move the view to the center of the scene. 

[For those who use versions earlier than 2.49b {the version I use as well as the only one I've ever used}, I don't know if this will work; still, try it and see if it works]. This made things ''immensely'' easier for me, since I now have better control over the camera. [In case this wasn't covered earlier, you don't need the MMB to rotate. With NUM lock on, NUM pad 4 rotates {the scene, not the view} left, NUM pad 2 rotates down, NUM pad 6 rotates right, and NUM pad 8 rotates up. These keys rotate the view right, up, left, and down, respectively.]

==Smoothing the wings==
(User comment on grid snapping: If you hold CTRL+SHIFT while doing a manipulation, it allows you to use smaller fractions as grid snap than with CTRL. With translation this is 1 for just CTRL, and 0.1 for CTRL+SHIFT)

(User comment on using the arrows: I mentioned earlier that the grid snap seemed inconsistent. It now seems that when I’ve got the 3d manipulators enabled (the arrows), the grid size is 1.0 units. When I have them turned off, the grid size is 0.1 unit. I don’t know why, and I haven’t found where to change this. The previous picture shows where to turn the 3D manipulators on/off, and which arrow to drag (using '''LMB''') to achieve Z-axis movement.)

(User comment: if you spin the view it becomes 1.0 snapping, go back by pressing '''NUM1''' and you should get 0.1 if not make sure '''View &amp;rarr; Orthographic''' is checked and not Perspective this can also be done with '''NUM5''')

(User comment: I've had trouble with the three axis arrows. When I click on the 'hand' icon, the three lines come up but with little blocks instead of arrows at the ends, which I believe means that they will scale instead of move. So, I have had to use GKEY for 'grab' and then ZKEY or YKEY or whatever to move along an axis.)

(Note from another user: Next to the hand click the triangle to go to Moving Mode).

(Reply to previous comment: You can change the size of the 3d manipulator arrows in the preferences area so that they are easier to click.)

==Culling the underside==
'''Note 1:''' Instead of using '''SHIFT+FKEY''' to make a zigzag surface, you could extrude the circle of edges ('''EKEY'''), constrain the extrusion to the Z-axis ('''ZKEY''') and enter 0 ('''0KEY''' + '''ENTER''') as the distance. This effectively duplicates the circle. Then do a merge ('''ALT+MKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''At Center'') to create a nice surface. 

'''Note 2:''' Press '''CONTROL+NUM7''' to view the penguin from the bottom. Now, without deleting anything, select four vertices, top, bottom, left, and right in the second ring out from the center vertex.  Then snap your cursor to the selection. '''SHIFT+SKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Cursor -&gt; Selection'' This places the cursor at the center of those vertices. Finally, select the center vertex, expand the selection to include the first ring ('''CONTROL+NUM+''') then merge as above ('''ALT+MKEY''') but at cursor rather than at center. This achieves the same result but without having to delete or extrude anything. 

'''Alternative Method - Extrude &amp; Scale:''''' From a side view. Box select ('''BKEY''') the bottom vertex &amp; the 2 bottom most rings, then delete ('''DELETEKEY''' or '''XKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Vertices''). Now box select ('''BKEY''') the remaining bottom most ring. Initiate an Extrude ('''EKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Region'') command, and escape terminate ('''ESCAPEKEY''') said command. It will appear as if nothing has happened, but you have created a new (overlapping) bottom ring and is currently selected. Change the view to Orbit Down ('''NUM2KEY'''). Now Scale ('''SKEY''') the selection, press the number '''0''' to close, then press the '''Enter''' key to commit. The bottom should have closed with a number of triangles, all pointing to a common center vertex. As a good practice, you should now remove doubles' ('''WKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Remove Doubles'').

==Extruding a tail==
* '''''Note 1:''' I found it easier to select the center most, lowest vertex, and move it along the Y axis only. This creates a crude but very effective tail (that doesn't look all that bad when subsurfed).''
* '''''Note 2:''' to do this correctly (if I've properly understood the previous user) you can also select the two faces in the bottom row ('''CTRL+TAB'''→Faces), which are connected to the three middle vertices and their projection on the bottom line, then split them into triangles ('''SPACE'''→Edit→Faces→Convert To Triangles or using '''CTRL+TKEY'''), then select the right two of them (it was the right quad face before) and flip the triangles' orientation ('''SPACE'''→Edit→Faces→Flip Triangles Edges or using '''CTRL+FKEY'''). So, there will be the five edges connected to the middle point in the second row from the bottom and only three to the vertex, mentioned by previous user. Then just move this lowest, center most, vertex by Y on 0.4''
* '''''Note 3:''' don't do that extruding of the tail with only the edges or you will get an so called 'non-manifold mesh', cause you will have an edge with outgoing three faces, so blender can't recalculate the surface and you can't use the decimate modifier. this can be very nasty if you're modeling more complex things later. better select the whole two faces at the back end and extrude that and then shrink it along the z-axis.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Adding the feet==
'''''User note:''' I merged the three vertices at the bottom one,and at the folding point I merged the middle and top vertices at the middle one, and then I used the red arrow to translate the newly merged vertex about 0.04 BU's toward the inner part of the penguin, and the green arrow to translate it about 0.1 backwards.''

== Normals not pointing the right way ==

Even after recalculating them, a patch of mesh along all the back of the penguin gets the normals wrong, on the opposite side of the rest of the mesh.

I had to flip them manually so that all of them would point in the same direction, but if I recalculate them again they go the wrong way again. I'm not sure what am I doing wrong or why this is happening.

A carnival character with bright red hair, Peregrine is full of laughter and life. A man with a low boredom threshold Peregrine does not have the patience to pursue an interest for long. He performs magic tricks, spends time in the secret service and collects butterflies in his later life.
Peregrine means Roving or wandering and the name is derived from the word pilgrim. This this is exactly what Peregrine does moving from interest to interest. Although Peregrine is not Dora and Nora's father he passes for their father as he acknowledges the girls when Melchior repudiates them.

==Dora and Nora==

Dora and Nora are described as being &quot;like as two peas&quot;, the only way in which the girls could be distinguished from each other was the perfumes they used. Unlike their father and his brother Dora and Nora are similar. As Dora describes: &quot;identical we may be, but symmetrical -- never. For the body itself isn't symmetrical. One of your feet is bound to be bigger than the other, one ear will leak more wax. Nora is fluxy; me, constipated&quot;

However there are some differences between the girls. While Nora is impulsive and emotive Dora is cautious, thoughtful and reserved: &quot;She said: 'Yes!' to life and I said, 'Maybe...' &quot;. Nora is described as throwing her heart away like a used bus ticket&quot; whereas Dora states that &quot;The more I saw of love the less I liked the look of it&quot;

==Saskia and Imogen==

'''“Being unique amongst mammals, a cold blooded cow”'''
'''“So rich, so connected, so legitimate”'''

These twins could be seen to be the opposite of the lucky Chances, if Dora and Nora grew up on the illegitimate wrong side of the tracks then Saskia and Imogen are the legitimate &quot;darling buds of may&quot;. Their mother Lady Atalanta Hazard is a lady herself. 

Throughout the novel Dora shows contempt for Saskia. She says that Saskia made “a career out of piggery” when commenting her cookery programme. Their dislike of Saskia and Imogen is also evident when they are taken to a show in which Dora and Nora star. Nora is unwilling to walk about, when she does Saskia “howls like a banshee” clearly enjoying mocking Dora and Nora’s performance. 

Saskia and Imogen storm out of their twenty-first birthday party after receiving gifts they dislike from Peregrine and hearing that Melchior is marrying ‘Lady Margarine’. Saskia’s best friend. It is suggested that Saskia makes Lady A sign her house away and that she is responsible for Lady A’s fall down the stairs.   

Although Peregrine is their father Saskia especially adopts many of the characteristics of Melchior. It is evident that Dora is jealous if the legitimacy that Saskia enjoys - “So rich, so connected, so legitimate”. Even the red hair that Saskia and Tristram have only when the legitimate side of the family. 

==Tristram and Gareth Hazard==

'''&quot;Both, in their different ways, carrying on the great tradition of the Hazard family -- the willing suspension of disbelief. Both of them promise you a free gift if you play the game&quot;'''

Tristram and Gareth are children from Melchior's third marriage to 'My Lady Margarine'. These brothers appear complete opposites. Tristram is the host of game show called 'Lashings of Lolly' whereas Gareth becomes a missionary. Tristram is expelled from Beadles for smoking pot. He is a much more radical character than Gareth. Dora says that he discovered sex at the same time that Gareth discovered God. However, Tristram is not quite the man his father was; although he continues the Hazard tradition of celebrity on his game show he is a flashy character and the low-brow game show is in contrast to Melchior’s high-brow Shakespeare. However both Tristram and Melchior share their inability or unwillingness to father their own children. Tristram states, “I’m not ready to be a father”, a remark which could be described as typical for a Hazard male.       
Although Tristram shows concern for the well being of Tiffany after it is believed that she is dead. This is coupled with the news that she is pregnant because of Tristram and that he is having an incestuous affair with Saskia. In this part of the novel Dora and Nora’s contempt for Tristram matches that of Saskia. 

Tristram and Gareth may seem opposites but as Dora reflects on them:  &quot;Both of them in show business”, &quot;Both, in their different ways, carrying on the great tradition of the Hazard family -- the willing suspension of disbelief. Both of them promise you a free gift if you play the game&quot;. Tristram refers to Dora and Nora as his aunties although they are half-sisters. This is because Peregrine allowed everyone to believe that Dora and Nora were his illegitimate children rather than Melchiors. 

Both Tristram and Gareth father illegitimate children. However the mother of Gareth’s child is never described as Dora refuses to give this information to the reader. As a Catholic missionary Gareth shouldn’t have been having sex let alone fathering an illegitimate child. Dora says “put it down to liberation theology”, she also admits that Gareth fathering a child sounds somewhat farfetched in the line “hard to swallow, huh?”

==Grandma Chance==

'''“The boarding house clung to respectability by the skin of its teeth…you could have said the same of her”'''

Grandma Chance is an eccentric character.  Despite her eccentricities she gives Dora and Nora stability after the death of their mother Pretty Kitty.  Grandma Chance’s love is the constant and everyday whereas Peregrine, although showing care for the girls financially, does have a tendency to come and go throughout Dora and Nora’s childhood. Grandma Chance has extreme views and she is extremely loving. 

Grandma Chance’s views include:

*A belief that war is caused by old men who want to rid the world of all the young men.
*A belief that plants scream when they are cut
*A strong belief in animal rights well before this was a mainstream movement
*Nudism – she is responsible for Dora and Nora’s nudity as children

Grandma Chance raised Dora and Nora “out of pure love”, however her origins are a mystery, this is another one of her eccentricities, and she refuses to talk about her past to Dora and Nora. As Dora says:  “we never found who put her up at Bard Road”.

Dora and Nora show their appreciation to Grandma in the line “we owe her everything”.  To Dora and Nora she was their mother figure as well - “She was our air raid shelter; she was our entertainment; she was our breast”.  Of course Grandma Chance was the name she used of respect of the dead Kitty. She was not biologically related to the girls. However Dora states “Grandma invented the family through sheer force of personality”. This is shown in the way that she takes in ‘Our Cyn’ when she turns up at the house in Bard Road. This further shows her capacity to love.

It is Grandma Chance who is responsible in part for Dora and Nora’s love of the theatre. She decides to take them to a theatre show on their seventh birthday called ‘Lady Be Good’. This is where the theatre captivates Dora and Nora, it is also where Grandma Chance announces, “that man is you father”, she is responsible for the girls longing for their father Melchior Hazard.      

Throughout ‘Wise Children Peregrine and Grandma Chance get on well together. Both are larger than life characters.  Later in the novel there is tension between the girls and Grandma. Dora laughs at her nudity and Grandma disapproves of a fur coat Dora is given. However, she continues to show her capacity to love by keeping a scrapbook of the girl’s theatre performances right from their first performance in ‘Babes in the Wood’ to the day that she dies. 

Grandma Chance comes to Hollywood when Dora and Nora are to marry. Her greeting “Who the fuck are you” is in stark contrast to the artifice of the Hollywood episode.     

Grandma Chance died during World War II buying alcohol; she is defiant against Hitler interfering with her drinking habits in the same way that her beliefs are defiant against the rest of society. Later when her funeral is described in greater detail Dora admits that Grandma Chance’s death meant a link with the past was lost. Throughout chapter four of the novel the girls feel lonely without Grandma Chance living with them. However, her ghost returns to tell Dora and Nora that “memory lane is a dead end”.  This section is one of the novel’s many manifestations of magical realism.

==Lady Atalanta Hazard nee Lynde==
'''“I live mainly in the past,  these days. I find it’s better”''' 

Lady Atalanta Hazard is the first Hazard wife of three. Even after the end of their relationship Lady still loves Melchior, this is evident as a large portrait of Melchior hangs in her Sussex home. Even in old age Lady A or Wheelchair is obsessed with Melchior. This is shown in the way that she takes an interest in Melchior’s appearance on the game show ‘Lashings of Lolly’- “She perked right up”.

Although she has long ceased to have the wealth of aristocracy she still retains the manner of a lady. This can be seen in the way that she informs Brenda of Tiffany’s ‘death’. 

Lady A is most unlike the two daughters Saskia and Imogen. When she took her girls to see a theatre show which Dora and Nora happened to be appearing in, Lady A sends the girls forget-me-nots whereas Saskia howls like a banshee and Imogen falls asleep. Lady A is also mortified by Saskia’s sarcasm in quoting the line from ‘A Winter’s Tale’ “Which some call nature’s bastards”.  Lady A even manages to maintain calm after the news that Daisy Duck, Melchior’s second wife is pregnant, although this news later turns out to be false. 

Lady A descends from great wealth to poverty. She at one time lives like aristocracy but after being abandoned she ends up living in the basement of the house in Bard Road.   Lady A refuses to talk about the accident that left her in a wheelchair. “Did she fall or was she pushed?” is the question that Dora asks herself. However it is implied that the accident was the fault of Saskia and Imogen who also make Lady A sign her house away leaving her poor in Brixton. 

At the end of the novel Lady A gives a dramatic speech in which she accuses Melchior of leaving her “womb empty” because he was too busy perusing his acting career to concentrate on family life.  As Dora puts it “she got it all of her chest in one go”. However she still manages not to lose self-control during this outburst.

==Delia Delaney nee Daisy Duck==

'''“The classic thirties blonde”''' 

Daisy is unlike Lady A in that she gains wealth by marrying Melchior. Although she has a somewhat extreme character, typical of Hollywood she still retains some moral standards. She unwilling to tell Genghis Khan that the baby she is carrying is his as she knows that it is Melchiors. However it is later revealed that she is not pregnant. 

She is unsympathetic to the unnamed first wife of Genghis Khan telling her to “drop dead&quot; when she calls. Peregrine is much more sympathetic uttering “poor cow” when he picks up her call. However she is a somewhat brash character.

In fact the role of  ‘The Dream’ is that it is a vehicle to showcase Daisy’s talents. Despite playing Titania it is evident she is not appropriate for playing Shakespeare. She lacks class. The first pages of her descriptions informs the reader than she has heart-shaped pubic hair. Her first line in the novel is “Where does the orgy begin?” 

In the Dream episode full of artifice, money is the only reality. Daisy asks Genghis Khan for $1,000,000 dollars. Genghis gives this money but takes it back the next day. This cruel trick is what causes Daisy to gain revenge in a relationship with Melchior.   

Daisy falls in love with Melchior. They are described as together as skin wrapped around sausage – they are that close. However the marriage is short lived and they divorce after only a few days of marriage.

Daisy later appears at Melchior’s 100th birthday party. She is described as looking like “$1,000,000, dollars. Even if in well used notes”. This is the second time this figure of money and Daisy have been mentioned together. 

Her entrance to Melchior’s party in which guests stand on chairs shows that she still has something of the Hollywood glamour in her, even in old age. At the party she manages to reconcile with Melchior who she had last seen at the filming of ‘The Dream’.

==My Lady Margarine==
'''“I’m going to marry my Cordelia”'''

Comparatively little is said about ‘My Lady Margarine’ in comparison with the other Hazard wives.  She takes her name from advertisements that she appears in advertising margarine. Dora mocks this in the line “To butter or not to butter”. 

She is first mentioned when Melchior announces that he is to marry “my Cordelia”, as Lady Margarine played Cordelia to his Lear. This parallels Ranulph and Estella hazard earlier in the novel. Saskia and Imogen react badly to this news as it effectively disinherits them from their father’s wealth. Saskia is also angry, as ‘Lady Margarine’ was her best friend before this news.   

Her only other mentions are at Melchior’s 100th birthday party where she is described as wearing “a smile so fixed”. She isn’t happy throughout this chapter as she is looking for her son Tristram – the party occurs on the day the Tiffany is reported dead but Tristram still attends the party.  

At the end of the novel Lady Margarine donates a pram to Dora and Nora so they can look after Gareth’s babies.

==George V (1910-1936)==

The first monarch of the House of Windsor was George V. However, he started out as being of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and so he can be read about in the previous chapter.

==Edward VIII (1936)==

Edward VIII was born at White Lodge, Richmond upon Thames on 23 June 1894. Edward was the eldest son of George V and Queen Mary. He was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, and Emperor of India from  20 January 1936 until his abdication on 11 December 1936, after which he was Prince Edward and then Duke of Windsor until his death on 28 May 1972. During World War II he was the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bahamas after spending a great deal of time in Bermuda. He was known to his family and close friends, by his last Christian name, David.

===Prince of Wales===

In 1910, George V made Edward Prince of Wales. When the First World War broke out in 1914 Edward joined the army, serving with the Grenadier Guards. Although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, the British government refused to allow it, because of the harm that the capture of the heir to the throne would cause. However, Edward did witness at first hand the horror of trench warfare, and visited the front line as often as he could. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.

Throughout the 1920s the Prince of Wales represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions. He took a special interest in visiting the poorest areas of the country. Abroad the Prince of Wales toured the British Empire, undertaking 13 tours between 1919 and 1935.

In 1928, King George V gave Edward a home, Fort Belvedere, near Sunningdale in Berkshire. There Edward had relationships with a series of married women, including the American Wallis Simpson. Simpson had divorced her first husband in 1927 and later married Ernest Simpson. Edward's relationship with Wallis Simpson further weakened his poor relationship with his father, King George V. The King and Queen refused to receive Mrs Simpson at court, and his brother, Prince Albert, urged Edward to seek a more suitable wife. Edward, however, had now fallen in love with Wallis and the couple grew ever closer.

===Reign===

King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward became King Edward VIII. The next day he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his own accession to the throne from a window of St James's Palace in the company of the still-married Mrs Simpson. It was also at this time that Edward VIII became the first British monarch to fly in an aeroplane, when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.

It was now becoming clear that the new King wished to marry Mrs Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between Mr and Mrs Simpson were brought at Ipswich Crown Court. Powerful figures in the British government deemed marriage to Mrs Simpson impossible for Edward, even if Wallis obtained her second divorce, because he had become the Supreme Governor of the Church of England which prohibited remarriage after divorce.

On 16 July 1936, an attempt was made on the King's life.  Jerome Bannigan produced a loaded revolver as the King rode on horseback at Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace. Police spotted the gun and pounced on him, and he was quickly arrested. At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that &quot;a foreign power&quot; had paid him £150 to kill Edward, a claim the court rejected.

On 16 November 1936, Edward met with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin at Fort Belvedere and expressed his desire to marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to do so. The Prime Minister responded by presenting the King with three choices: he could give up the idea of marriage; marry Wallis against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Wallis. By marrying against the advice of his ministers, it was likely that he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. The Prime Ministers of the British dominions had also made clear their opposition to the King marrying a divorcée; only the Irish Free State was not opposed to the idea of marriage. Faced with this opposition, Edward chose to abdicate. Edward duly signed an instrument of abdication at Fort Belvedere on 10 December 1936. The next day, he performed his last act as King when he gave Royal Assent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 which applied to the United Kingdom and all the dominions except the Irish Free State. The Free State passed the equivalent External Relations Act, which included the abdication in its schedule, the next day.

On the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title of The Prince Edward, made a broadcast to the nation and the Empire, explaining his decision to abdicate. He famously said, &quot;I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.&quot;

After the broadcast, Edward left the United Kingdom for France, though he was unable to join Wallis until her divorce became absolute, several months later. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York succeeded to the throne as King George VI. George VI made Edward the Duke of Windsor. The Duke of Windsor married Mrs Simpson, who had changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937 at Chateau de Candé, Monts, France. None of the British royal family attended.

===World War II===

In 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany as personal guests of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, a visit much publicised by the German media. The couple then settled in France. When the Germans invaded the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to Biarritz, then in June to Spain. In July the pair moved to Lisbon. In August a British warship took them to the Bahamas, where the Duke of Windsor was made Governor. He held the post until the end of World War II in 1945.

===Death===

After the war, the couple returned once again to France in Neuilly near Paris, where they spent much of the remainder of their lives in retirement. The Royal Family never accepted the Duchess and would not receive her formally, although the former King sometimes met his mother and a brother after his abdication. The Duke died of throat cancer in 1972 in Paris, and his body was returned to Britain for burial at Frogmore near Windsor Castle. The Duchess travelled to England to attend his funeral, staying at Buckingham Palace during her visit. The Duchess, on her death a decade and a half later, was buried alongside her husband in Frogmore simply as &quot;Wallis, his wife&quot;. The Duke and Duchess had no children.

==George VI (1936-1952)==
[[Image:Georg VI England.jpg|thumb|right|150px|George VI]]
George VI was born at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on 14 December 1895. He was the second son of George V and Queen Mary. He was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the British dominions beyond the seas from 11 December 1936 until his death on 6 February 1952. George VI was also the Emperor of India (until 1947) and King of Ireland (until 1949). George VI came the throne after the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII. He was king during the Second World War. He was known as Bertie, after his first name, Albert, to his family.

===Early life===

As a child, George often suffered from ill health and he was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;. Albert developed a severe stammer that lasted for many years as well as chronic stomach problems. He also suffered from knock knees, and to correct this he had to wear splints, which were extremely painful.  He was also forced to write with his right hand although he was a natural left-hander.  

In 1909, Bertie joined the Royal Navy and served as a naval cadet. Despite coming in at the bottom of the class, Albert moved to Dartmouth and served as a midshipman. He was still in the Navy when Edward VII died on 6 May 1910. Albert was now second in line for the throne. Albert served during World War I. He saw action aboard HMS ''Collingwood'' in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. In 1917 Albert joined the Royal Air Force but did not see any further action in the war. After the war, Albert studied history, economics and civics for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, from October 1919. In 1920, he began to take on royal duties, representing his father, King George V.

===Marriage and children===

Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing his wife. In 1920 he met Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and set his sights on marrying her. She rejected his proposal twice before she said yes. They were married on 26 April 1923. They had two children: Elizabeth, born in 1926, and Margaret, born in 1930. 

===Reign===

The Duke and Duchess lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 Piccadilly. When Edward VIII he abdicated on 11 December 1936, however, Albert became King George VI.

The growing likelihood of war in Europe would dominate the reign of King George VI. Initially the King and Queen took an appeasement stance against the German dictator Adolf Hitler, and supported the policy of Neville Chamberlain. In 1939, the King and Queen visited Canada from where they made a shorter visit to the United States of America. George was the first reigning British monarch to visit either of these countries. The aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for Britain in any upcoming war. The King and Queen were extremely enthusiastically received by the Canadian public. They were also warmly received by the American people, visiting the 1939 New York World's Fair and staying at the White House with President Roosevelt. When war broke out in 1939, George VI with his wife chose to stay in London and not flee to Canada, as had been suggested. The King and Queen officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they often escaped to Windsor Castle to avoid bombing raids. George VI and Queen Elizabeth narrowly avoided death when a lone German bomber despatched to bomb Buckingham Palace attacked. The bomb exploded in the courtyard, shattering windows in the palace. 

Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the UK, visiting bomb sites and munition factories. On Victory in Europe (VE) Day, the Royal Family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to celebrate the end of the war in Europe. After the war, George VI's reign saw the start of the break up of the British Empire, in particular when India became an independent dominion, with George VI giving up the title of Emperor of India.

===Death===

The war had taken its toll on the King's health. This was made worse by his heavy smoking and he got lung cancer. Increasingly his daughter Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the throne, would take on more of the royal duties as her father's health got worse. On 6 February 1952, George VI died aged 56 in his sleep at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He was buried in St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. In 2002, the body of his wife Elizabeth and the ashes of his daughter Princess Margaret were interred in a tomb alongside him.

==Elizabeth II (1952 onwards)==
[[Image:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007.jpg|right|thumb]]

Elizabeth II was born at 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair, London on 21 April 1926. She is the eldest daughter of George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth II is the current Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of many other independent nations too. She became Queen on 6 February 1952. She is currently the second-longest-serving head of state in the world, after King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.

===Early life===

Elizabeth was thirteen years old when World War II broke out. She and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, were evacuated to Windsor Castle, Berkshire. There was some suggestion that the princesses be sent to Canada, but their mother refused to consider this, famously saying, &quot;The children could not possibly go without me, I wouldn't leave without the King, and the King will never leave&quot;. In 1940 Princess Elizabeth made her first broadcast, addressing other children who had been evacuated.

In 1945 Princess Elizabeth joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service. She was the first and so far only female member of the royal family actually to serve in the military. Elizabeth made her first official visit overseas in 1947, when she went with her parents to South Africa. On her 21st birthday she made a broadcast to the British Commonwealth and Empire pledging to devote her life to the service of the people of the Commonwealth and Empire.

===Marriage and motherhood===

Elizabeth married The Duke of Edinburgh on 20 November 1947. The Duke is Queen Elizabeth's second cousin once removed, they are both descended from Christian IX of Denmark. The couple are also third cousins. After their wedding Philip and Elizabeth took up residence at Clarence House, London. But at various times between 1946 and 1953, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. Philip and Elizabeth lived in Malta for a period between 1949 and 1951. On 14 November 1948 Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, Charles. They later had three other children: Anne, Andrew and Edward.

===Reign===

King George's health declined during 1951 and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. She visited Greece, Italy and Malta (where Philip was then stationed) during the year. In October she toured Canada and visited President Truman in Washington, DC. In January 1952 Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand. They had reached Kenya when word arrived of the death of her father on 6 February 1952. At the moment she became aware she was now queen, she was in the Treetops Hotel.

After the Coronation, Elizabeth and Philip moved to Buckingham Palace in central London. It is believed, however, that like many of her predecessors she dislikes the Palace as a residence and considers Windsor Castle, west of London, to be her home. She also spends time at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at Sandringham House in Norfolk.

At the time of Elizabeth's accession there was much talk of a &quot;new Elizabethan age&quot;. As nations have developed economically and in literacy, Queen Elizabeth has witnessed over the past 50 years a gradual transformation of the British Empire into its modern successor, the Commonwealth. She has worked hard to maintain links with former British possessions, and in some cases, such as South Africa, she has played an important role in retaining or restoring good relations. Queen Elizabeth has become the most widely travelled head of state in history and has visited many Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries. 

In 2002 she celebrated her Golden Jubilee, marking the 50th anniversary of her accession to the Throne. The year saw a large tour of the Commonwealth Realms, including numerous parades and official concerts. Then in 2012 she celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, marking the 60th anniversary of her accession to the Throne.

__TOC__

This is the place for learning or remembering all the conventions we are using for writing the [[Subject:Ada programming language|Ada]] wikibooks:
* [[Ada Programming]] [[file:Cscr-featured.svg|15px]] ([[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured wikibook]])
* [[Ada Style Guide]]
* [[CORBA Programming]]

Hint: Keep this page open for cut/copy/paste.

== Attribution ==

Consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account]] in Wikibooks, it's easy and convenient. You are only requested for a user name and a password. After logging in your contributions are assigned to a name instead of your IP address. It has other benefits see the page [[w:Wikipedia:Why create an account?|Why create an account?]] from Wikipedia.

== Demo Sources ==

Unlike most other books from the [[Programming]] series we aim to provide not only code snippets but also and foremost fully working demos. 

In order to ease handling of the demonstration programs a connected [http://sourceforge.net SourceForge] project called [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikibook-ada wikibook-ada] has been registered.

As a contributer you can take advantage of the [[Wikipedia:Apache Subversion|svn]] [https://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=124904 repository] to store your sources. You can also create links from Programming:Ada to your [http://wikibook-ada.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/wikibook-ada/ sources] using [http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/ viewscvs]. You can use the [[Template:Ada/Sourceforge]] to create the links

SourceForge also allows us to offer [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=124904 downloads of all demo sources].

Last but not least, SourceForge provides us [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=124904 download statistics], so we can see if our offer is accepted.

== Heading ==

All pages should have a heading like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;
 {{Ada/Navigation}}
 __TOC__
 &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Formerly there were &quot;Ada/Navigation 1&quot; to &quot;Ada/Navigation 3&quot; (for one to tree level deep navigation), but they are obsolete now, since the navigation inside the book is provided by the subpage features.

== Links ==

An online documentation like [[Ada Programming]] lives from &quot;clickable&quot; text - a click and you get more detail on anything you are interested. So do make links!

=== Keywords et al. ===

Language features like Keywords, Pragmas etc. should be written like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 Keywords:         {{Ada/kw|abort}} or {{Ada/keyword|new}}
 Operators:        {{Ada/op|&amp;}} or {{Ada/operator|+}}
                   {{Ada/op|1 = &lt;=}} or {{Ada/op|1 = =}}
 Delimiters:       {{Ada/dl|:}} or {{Ada/delimiter|:}}
                   {{Ada/dl|1 = :=}} or {{Ada/dl|1 = =&gt;}}
 Types:            '''[[Ada Programming/Types/range|range]]'''
 Attributes:       X'{{Ada/at|Access}} or X'{{Ada/attribute|Access}}
 Pragmas:          {{Ada/pragma|No_Return}} or {{Ada/pragma name|No_Return}}
 Packages:         {{Ada/package|Standard}}
 Child Packages:   {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}, {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Vectors}}, ...
 Restrictions:     {{Ada/restriction|No_Obsolescent_Features}} or {{Ada/restriction name|No_Obsolescent_Features}}
 Comments:         {{Ada/--|This is a comment}} or {{Ada/comment|This is a comment}}
 Sourceforge link: {{Ada/Sourceforge|numeric_1.adb}}
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

which will then look like:

 Keywords:         {{Ada/kw|abort}} or {{Ada/keyword|new}}
 Operators:        {{Ada/op|&amp;}} or {{Ada/operator|+}}
                   {{Ada/op|1 = &lt;=}} or {{Ada/op|1 = =}}
 Delimiters:       {{Ada/dl|:}} or {{Ada/delimiter|:}}
                   {{Ada/dl|1 = :=}} or {{Ada/dl|1 = =&gt;}}
 Types:            '''[[Ada Programming/Types/range|range]]'''
 Attributes:       X'{{Ada/at|Access}} or X'{{Ada/attribute|Access}}
 Pragmas:          {{Ada/pragma|No_Return}} or {{Ada/pragma name|No_Return}}
 Packages:         {{Ada/package|Standard}}
 Child Packages:   {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}, {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Vectors}}, ...
 Restrictions:     {{Ada/restriction|No_Obsolescent_Features}} or {{Ada/restriction name|No_Obsolescent_Features}}
 Comments:         {{Ada/--|This is a comment}} or {{Ada/comment|This is a comment}}
 Sourceforge link: {{Ada/Sourceforge|numeric_1.adb}}

; Note for Operators : All operators are either a keyword or a delimiter. Hence all operator pages are only redirects to the appropriate keyword or delimiter. However, in demo sources the rendering of operators, keyword and special character are different.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

; Wikibook : Always add a link to the Ada Programming main page.
; Ada Reference Manual : Look up relevant pages in the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TOC.html index of the RM].
; Ada Quality and Style Guide : Look up relevant guidelines in the [http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/cover.html index of this guide].
; Category : All pages should be added to the &quot;Ada Programming&quot; Category. The category text given should be the last part of the page name (after the last colon).

== Normalized sections ==

The wikibook readability is enhanced if we follow some conventions, like a standard number of sections.

=== Attributes and pragmas ===

Sections for pages describing each [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] (see for example the pages about {{Ada/pragma|Atomic}} and the '{{Ada/attribute|Bit_Order}} attribute.):

* '''syntax''' summary
* '''description''', specifying the pragma/attribute category (representation, configuration...) and if it is obsolescent or implementation defined.
* illustrative '''example'''
* '''portability''':
** between Ada versions
** between compilers
** between platforms (architecture, operating system, embedded/self-hosted, uniprocessor/multiprocessor...)
*equivalent feature in other languages for '''interfacing''' (for pragmas)

== Coding rules ==

== Software ==

Emacs users might find this
[http://home.arcor.de/bauhaus/Ada/ada-to-wiki.el Emacs Lisp file] helpful
when editing Ada programs for inclusion in Wiki pages.
[http://home.arcor.de/bauhaus/Ada/ada-to-wiki.el ada-to-wiki.el]

A similar pure Ada program, [http://home.arcor.de/bauhaus/Tools/ASnip/ ASnip],
will do the same using standard input/output. Useful with vi and other editors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I will soon have a large amount of free time and would like to expand the book on number theory, as it is my passion, and I wish there to be an accesible way for people to learn it.

I would like to follow a plan along the lines of:

Divisibility,
Unique Factorization,
Multiplicative Functions,
Congruences,
Congruence Equations,
Reduced Residue Systems,
Totient Function,
Polynomial Congruences,
Diophantine Equations,
Rational Irrational and Transcendental numbers,
Continued Fractions,
Quadratic Fields, and a
Collection of Theorems with proof sketches

Each area would be divided into several sub chapters and each subchapter would have examples. I would hopefully highlight many theorems and their proofs, at the same time covering many basic methods of proof, with questions at the end of each section.


The Collection of Theorems at the end would contain many theorems with proof sketches, and it can be left as an excercise to the student to fill them in.

After this is complete I would be interested in expanding it to include more advanced topics, however I believe this would be a good start.

I would like to assume minimal knowledge of Calculus in the first part. [[User:Robert Carr|Robert Carr]] 00:17, 8 May 2006 (UTC)



Hi, I'm not sure if anybody has been planning anything for this book, but I would like to help any construction going on. I think I will add some sections about Gaussian Integers to the template, and maybe start to fill in some of the unwritten and partially written chapters during my freetime.

Hmm.. I think that some discussion of axioms would be a good idea.

Hopefully we'll see more people tack onto this book soon, because Number Theory is truly a marvelous subject. [[User:Someperson01|mac]] ([[User talk:Someperson01|talk]]) 19:31, 28 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

This book covers an elementary introduction to Number Theory, with an emphasis on presenting and proving a large number of theorems. No attempts will be made to derive number theory from set theory and no knowledge of Calculus will be assumed.  It is important to convince yourself of the truth of each proof as you work through the book, and make sure you have a complete understanding. For those who wish to use this as a reference book, an index of theorems will be given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Elementary Properties of Divisibility=

Divisibility is a key concept in number theory.  We say that an integer ''a'' is divisible by a nonzero integer ''b'' if there exists an integer ''c'' such that ''a=bc''.

For example, the integer 123456 is divisible by 643 since there exists a nonzero integer, namely 192, 
such that 
&lt;math&gt;123456=643\cdot192\,&lt;/math&gt;.

We denote divisibility using a vertical bar: &lt;math&gt;a|b&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;a divides b&quot;.
For example, we can write &lt;math&gt;643|123456 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

The following theorems illustrate a number of important properties of divisibility. 

==Prime numbers==

A natural number ''p'' is called a '''prime number''' if it has exactly two distinct natural number divisors, itself and 1. The first eleven such numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. There are an infinite number of primes, however, as will be proven below. Note that the number 1 is generally not considered a prime number even though it has no divisors other than itself. The reason for this will be discussed later.

==Theorem 1== 

Suppose &lt;math&gt; a,b,d,r,\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s\,&lt;/math&gt; are integers and &lt;math&gt;d|a,d|b \,&lt;/math&gt;. Then
&lt;math&gt;d|(ra+sb) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''

There exists &lt;math&gt;e \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a=de \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b=df \,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus

&lt;math&gt;ra+sb=rde+sdf =d (re+sf) .\,&lt;/math&gt;

We know that &lt;math&gt;re + sf \,&lt;/math&gt; is also an integer, hence &lt;math&gt;d|(ra+sb) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Corollary===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;a,b,d\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r \,&lt;/math&gt; are integers and &lt;math&gt;d|a,d|b\,&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;d|(a+b), d|(a-b), \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d|ra \,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
Letting &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt; in Theorem 1 yields 
&lt;math&gt;d | (a+b) \,&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, letting &lt;math&gt;r=1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=-1 &lt;/math&gt;
yields &lt;math&gt;d | (a-b) \,&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, setting s=0, yields &lt;math&gt;d|ra \,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem 2==

If &lt;math&gt;a, b, c  \,&lt;/math&gt; are integers and &lt;math&gt;a|b, b|c \,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a|c \,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''

Let us write b as 
&lt;math&gt;b=ad \,&lt;/math&gt; and c as &lt;math&gt;c=be \,&lt;/math&gt; for some integers &lt;math&gt;d\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e\,&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that

&lt;math&gt;c=ade=a\left(de\right) \, &lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;a|c \, &lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem 3==

If &lt;math&gt;a,b,c \,&lt;/math&gt; are integers and &lt;math&gt; c \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; a|b \, &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;ac|bc \,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

&lt;math&gt;a|b \,&lt;/math&gt; implies that there exists an integer d such that

&lt;math&gt; b=ad \,&lt;/math&gt; 

So it follows that

&lt;math&gt; bc=\left(ac\right)d &lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt; ac|bc \,&lt;/math&gt;.

For the reverse direction, we note that &lt;math&gt; ac|bc \,&lt;/math&gt; implies there exists an integer &lt;math&gt; d \,&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;bc=\left(ac\right)d&lt;/math&gt;.

We know that c is non-zero, hence

&lt;math&gt;b=ad \,&lt;/math&gt;.

This proves the theorem.

==Theorem 4==
'''Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic(FTA)'''

Every positive integer ''n'' is a product of prime numbers.  Moreover, these products are unique up to the order of the factors.

'''Proof:'''

We prove this theorem by contradiction.

Let ''N'' be the smallest positive integer that is not a product of prime numbers. Since ''N'' has to be composite, it can be written as ''N'' = ''a'' ''b'' with ''a'', ''b'' &gt; 1. It is

&lt;math&gt;1&lt;a, b&lt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

We conclude that the theorem is true for ''a'' and ''b'' because ''N'' was the smallest counterexample. Hence there are primes &lt;math&gt;p_1,p_2,\dots ,p_k&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;a=p_1p_2\cdots p_k&lt;/math&gt;

and primes &lt;math&gt;q_1,q_2,\dots,q_l&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;b=q_1q_2\cdots q_l&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence

&lt;math&gt;N = ab = p_1p_2\cdots p_kq_1q_2\cdots q_l&lt;/math&gt;,

which is a contradiction.


'''Alternative Proof:'''

This is an inductive proof.

The statement is true for &lt;math&gt;N = 2&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the statement is true for all &lt;math&gt;k \le N &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N+1&lt;/math&gt; is either composite or prime.
If &lt;math&gt;N+1&lt;/math&gt; is prime, then the statement is true for &lt;math&gt;k = N+1&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;N+1&lt;/math&gt; is composite, then &lt;math&gt;N+1&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by some prime, &lt;math&gt;p &lt; N+1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;k = N+1&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a product of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and some number &lt;math&gt; &lt; N + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence &lt;math&gt;N+1&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a product of primes.

It follows that the statement is true for all &lt;math&gt;k \le N+1&lt;/math&gt; and hence by induction  for all &lt;math&gt; \N &lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem 5==

There are infinitely many primes.

'''Proof:'''

Suppose that there are only &lt;math&gt;k \, &lt;/math&gt; primes.

Let these primes be: &lt;math&gt; p_1,p_2,...,p_k \,&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt; n=p_1p_2...p_k+1. \, &lt;/math&gt; 
Then either &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is prime, or it is a product of primes.
If is is a product of primes, it must be divisible by a prime &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
However,
&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{p_i} = \frac{p_1p_2...p_k+1}{p_i} = p_1p_2...p_{i-1}p_{i+1}...p_k + \frac{1}{p_i}&lt;/math&gt;
which is clearly not an integer: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.  
Hence, &lt;math&gt;n \,&lt;/math&gt; is not a product of primes.

This is a contradiction, as by Theorem 4, all numbers can be expressed as a product of primes.

Therefore, either &lt;math&gt;n \,&lt;/math&gt; is prime or it is divisible by some prime greater than &lt;math&gt; p_k \, &lt;/math&gt;.

We conclude that the assumption that there are only &lt;math&gt;k \,&lt;/math&gt; primes is false.

Thus there are ''not'' a finite number of primes, i.e., there are infinitely many primes.

==Theorem 6== 
'''Division with smallest nonnegative remainder'''

Let ''a'' and ''b'' be integers where &lt;math&gt;b&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exist uniquely determined integers ''q'' and ''r'' such that

&lt;math&gt;a = bq + r&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;0\leq r &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''

We define the set

&lt;math&gt;M = \{x\in \Z \mid x \leq \frac{a}{b} \}&lt;/math&gt;

which is nonempty and bounded from above. Hence it has a maximal element which we denote by ''q''.

We set &lt;math&gt; r = a - bq&lt;/math&gt;. It is &lt;math&gt;r = a - bq \geq a - b \frac{a}{b} = a-a = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;, because otherwise

&lt;math&gt;b \leq r = a-bq&lt;/math&gt;.

This implies

&lt;math&gt;q+1 \leq \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

which contradicts to the maximality of ''q'' in ''M''.

We now prove the uniqueness of ''q'' and ''r'':

Let &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt; be two integers which satisfy &lt;math&gt;a=bq'+r'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\leq r'&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;. It is

&lt;math&gt; | b (q-q') | = | r' - r | &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;

and thus &lt;math&gt;|q-q'| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;q=q'&lt;/math&gt;. This also shows &lt;math&gt;r=r'&lt;/math&gt; and we are done.

      <comment>/* The Euclidean Algorithm */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Euclidean Algorithm=
Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure.

The algorithm is based on the following two observations:

   1. If b|a then gcd(a, b) = b.

This is indeed so because no number (b, in particular) may have a divisor greater than the number itself (I am talking here of non-negative integers.)

   2. If a = bt + r, for integers t and r, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r).

Indeed, every common divisor of a and b also divides r. Thus gcd(a, b) divides r. But, of course, gcd(a, b)|b. Therefore, gcd(a, b) is a common divisor of b and r and hence gcd(a, b)=gcd(b, r). The reverse is also true because every divisor of b and r also divides a.

'''Example'''
&lt;pre&gt;
Let a = 2322, b = 654.

2322 = 654*3 + 360              gcd(2322, 654) = gcd(654, 360)

654 = 360*1 + 294	        gcd(654, 360) = gcd(360, 294)

360 = 294*1 + 66	  	gcd(360, 294) = gcd(294, 66)

294 = 66*4 + 30	  	        gcd(294, 66) = gcd(66, 30)

66 = 30*2 + 6	  	        gcd(66, 30) = gcd(30, 6)

30 = 6*5	                gcd(30, 6) = 6

Therefore, gcd(2322,654) = 6.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For any pair a and b, the algorithm is bound to terminate since every new step generates a similar problem (that of finding gcd) for a pair of smaller integers. Let Eulen(a,b) denote the length of the Euclidean algorithm for a pair a,b. Eulen(2322, 654) = 6, Eulen(30, 6) = 1. I'll use this notation in the proof of the following very important consequence of the algorithm:
Corollary
For every pair of whole numbers a and b there exist two integers s and t such that as + bt = gcd(a, b).
Example

2322×20 + 654×(-71) = 6.
Proof

Let a &gt; b. The proof is by induction on Eulen(a, b). If Eulen(a, b) = 1, i.e., if b|a, then a = bu for an integer u. Hence, a + (1 - u)b = b = gcd(a, b). We can take s = 1 and t = 1 - u.

Assume the Corollary has been established for all pairs of numbers for which Eulen is less than n. Let Eulen(a, b) = n. Apply one step of the algorithm: a = bu + r. Eulen(b, r) = n - 1. By the inductive assumption, there exist x and y such that bx + ry = gcd(b,r) = gcd(a,b). Express r as r = a - bu. Hence, ry = ay - buy; bx + (ay - buy) = gcd(a, b). Finally, b(x - uy) + ay = gcd(a, b) and we can take s = x - uy and t = y.

There is also a simple proof that employs the Pigeonhole Principle.
Remark

Note that any linear combination as + bt is divisible by any common factor of a and b. In particular, any common factor of a and b also divides gcd(a, b). In a &quot;reverse&quot; application, any linear combination as + bt is divisible by gcd(a, b). From here it follows that gcd(a, b) is the least positive integer representable in the form as + bt. All the rest are multiples of gcd(a, b). The generalization of the Corollary to an arbitrary field is known as Bézout's identity or Bézout's Lemma after the French mathematician Éttiene Bézout (1730-1783), so it often happens that the result stated in the Corollary is also often referred to as Bézout's identity or Bézout's Lemma.

For coprime numbers we get existence of s and t such that as + bt = 1. This Corollary is a powerful tool. It appeared in the 3 Glass and Hour Glass problems. For example, let's prove the Euclid's Proposition VII.30
If two numbers, multiplied by one another make some number, and any prime number measures the product, then it also measures one of the original numbers.

Let a prime p divide the product ab. Assume pa. Then gcd(a, p) = 1. By Corollary, ax + py = 1 for some x and y. Multiply by b: abx + pby = b. Now, p|ab and p|pb. Hence, p|b.

Actually, this proves a generalization of the Proposition VII.30 I used several times on these pages:
Let m|ab and gcd(a, m) = 1. Then m|b.

Proposition VII.30 immediately implies the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic although Euclid has never stated it explicitly. The first time it was formulated in 1801 by Gauss in his Disquisitiones arithmeticae.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Any integer N can be represented as a product of primes. Such a representation is unique up to the order of prime factors.

Since, by definition, a number is composite if it has factors other than 1 and itself, and these factors are bound to be smaller than the number, we can keep extracting the factors until only prime factors remain. This shows existence of the representation: N = pqr..., where all p, q, r,... are prime. To prove uniqueness, assume there are two representations: N = pqr... = uvw... We see that p divides uvw... By Corollary, it divides one of the factors u,v,w,... Cancel them out. We can go on chipping away on the factors left and right until no factors remain.

Representation of a number as the product of primes is called prime number decomposition. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic asserts that each integer has a unique prime number decomposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Notation and introduction=

We will call two integers ''a'' and ''b'' congruent modulo a positive integer ''m'', if ''a'' and ''b'' have the same (smallest nonnegative) remainder when dividing by ''m''. The formal definition is as follows.

==Definition==

Let ''a'', ''b'' and ''m'' be integers where &lt;math&gt;m&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are '''congruent modulo ''m''''', in symbols &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;, if ''m'' divides the difference &lt;math&gt;a-b&lt;/math&gt;.

===Lemma===

We have &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' have the same smallest nonnegative remainder when dividing by ''m''.

'''Proof:'''
&lt;!-- the \, here forces PNG instead of HTML so the font sizes will be consistent. --&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an integer ''c'' such that &lt;math&gt;cm = a-b\,&lt;/math&gt;. Let now &lt;math&gt;q,q',r,r'\,&lt;/math&gt; be those integers with

&lt;math&gt;a=qm+r,\quad   0\leq r&lt;m&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;b=q'm+r',\quad 0\leq r'&lt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that

&lt;math&gt;cm = a-b = m(q-q') + (r-r')\,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields &lt;math&gt;m|(r-r')\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m\ \mbox{divides} \ (r-r')\,&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;r=r'\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose now that &lt;math&gt;r=r'\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;a-b = m(q-q')\,&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that &lt;math&gt;m|(a-b)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=Fundamental Properties=

First, if &lt;math&gt;a\equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c\equiv d \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;ac\equiv bd \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a+c\equiv b+d \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

As a result, if &lt;math&gt;a\equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; a^p\equiv b^p \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

The theory of Diophantine equations is an ancient subject that typically involves solving (a system of) polynomial equation in integers.  Perhaps the most famous diophantine equation is Fermat's, who stated in the 17th century that the equation &lt;math&gt; x^n+y^n=z^n &lt;/math&gt; has no solution in integers if &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to 3 (this is called Fermat's last theorem).  Fermat never published his solution to this problem (that he actually had a valid solution is highly debated)and it took mathematicians the next 350 years to finally solve this problem.

A quadratic field F is an extension of degree 2 of the rational number field Q. The solution of the quadratic equation shows that it is generated over Q by the square root of a rational number. Multiplying (or dividing) this rational number by the square of a suitable integer, we may assume that it is a “square free” integer m, that is, an integer m without square factors. Let F = Q(s) where s.s = m. Any element x of F is of the form x = a + bs with a  and  b in Q. The mapping a + bs --&gt;  a – bs is an automorphism of F over Q. Thus F is a normal extension of Q (with a cyclic group of order 2 as Galois group).

|-
| 3
| Dust
|-
| 4
| Stoned
|}
If luck_helps is 1, the character’s luck can save it. If 0, there is no escape.

===short my_ap()=== This can only be called in a creature script and only has effect in combat. Returns the character’s current number of action points.

===short my_number()=== Can only be called in a creature script or terrain script. Returns this creature’s number (0 - 119) if in a creature script or the terrain script’s number (0 - 99) in a terrain script.

===short party_can_see_loc(short loc_x,short loc_y)=== This call only works correctly inside a town. Returns 1 if a party member can see location {loc_x,loc_y}, 0 otherwise.

===short party_has_trait(short which_trait)=== Returns 1 if some party member has trait which_trait, 0 if it doesn’t. Traits are listed in the appendices.

===short party_size()=== Returns the number of living, present characters in the party.

===void print_named_str(short which_char,char print_text)=== Prints in the text area the name of character which_char, immediately followed by print_text.

	print_named_str(17,” fires ray of doom.”); 

puts the text “Cute Puppy fires ray of doom.” in the text area.

===short random_party_member()=== Returns the number of a random character in the party (will be a number from 0 to 5).

===void revive_party()=== Completely heals the party’s damage and restores all spell energy.

===void set_attitude(short which_char_or_group,short which_attitude)===  Sets the attitude of the character/group:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5

| Friendly to party
|-
| 4
| Neutral
|-
| 10
| Hostile A
|-
| 11
| Hostile B
|}

===void set_char_alert(short which_char_or_group,short alert_level)=== Sets the alert level of the Creature/Group which_char_or_group to value alert_level. If alert_level is 1, the characters are alerted and will, if hostile to the party, hunt the party down. If 0, they will no longer be alerted.

===short set_char_script_mode(short which_char_or_group,short what_setting)=== Adjusts when the scripts for the Creature/Group will be run by the game when the party is not nearby. (By default, the game does not call all the scripts all the time, to keep the game from slowing down.) Values for what_setting are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| call every 8 moves, but not if party is far away
|-
| 1
| Call every 8 moves, even if party is far away
|-
| 2
| Call every move, but not if party is far away

==void set_char_trait(short which_char,short which_trait,short set_to)==
:Changes whether the character ''which_char'', has the trait ''which_trait'.

Values for ''set_to'' are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0 &amp;ndash;
| Removes from the character ''which_char'' the trait ''which_trait''.
|-
| 1 &amp;ndash;
| Gives to the character ''which_char'' the trait ''which_trait''.
|}

Values for ''which_trait'' can be found: [[../Common/Traits/|here]]


'''Notes''':
*You should probably only use this ability to teach the character Ritual of Sanctification (trait 22). You really shouldn't mess with a character's other traits. This call only has a real effect on party members.

==''void'' set_creature_memory_cell(''short'' which_char_or_group,''short'' which_cell,''short'' new_value)==
:Sets the memory cell ''which_cell'' of the creature or group ''which_char_or_group'' to the value ''new_value''.

==''void'' set_level(short which_char_or_group,short what_level)==
:Changes the level of the creature or group ''which_char_or_group'' to level ''what_level''. The character or character's health and statistics are Automatically adjusted to reflect their new level.

'''Notes''':
*You shouldn’t use this call on party members.
*This call also completely heals and restores the character (or characters), so it should probably only be called when the party enters the area.(i.e. in the town script’s state '''[[../Constants#INIT_STATE/|INIT_STATE]]''').

==''void'' set_mobility(''short'' which_char_or_group,''short'' mobile)==
:Sets whether the creature or group ''which_char_or_group'' can move or not.

Values for ''mobile'' are:
{|
|0 ndash;

|Creature '''can''' move.
|}

==''void'' set_name(''short'' which_char_or_group,''char'' new_name)==
:Sets the name of the creature or group ''which_char_or_group'' to name ''new_name''.

'''Notes''':
*Maximum name length is 19 characters.

==''void'' set_special_ability(''short'' which_char_or_group,''short'' what_ability)==
:Changes the special ability of the creature of group ''which_char_or_group'' to special ability ''what_ability''. The different special abilities are listed in the section on scripting creature types. If ''what_ability is 0'', the creature gets no special ability.

==''void'' set_summon_level(''short'' which_char_or_group,''short'' new_level)==
:Sets the summoning level of creature or group ''which_char_or_group'' to ''new_level''. Summoned creatures and illusions do not give experience or treasure when killed.

Values for ''new_level'' are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|0&amp;ndash; 
| The creature is not summoned. (Real creature.)
|-
|1&amp;ndash; 
|The creature '''is''' summoned, but will '''not''' disappear over time.
|-
|100&amp;ndash;199 &amp;ndash;
|The creature is summoned. Subtract 100 from amount to get number of turns until it disappears.
|-
|200&amp;ndash;299 &amp;ndash;
|The creature is an illusion. Subtract 200 from amount to get number of turns until it disappears.
|}

==''short'' species_in_party(''short'' which_species)==

|0 &amp;ndash;
|Human
|-
|2 &amp;ndash;
|Nephilim
|-
|3 &amp;ndash;
|Slithzerikai.

'''Note''':
*This call does check any extra characters that are traveling with the party, so any species beyond those listed here will always return 0.

== Procedure Calls ==

I was wondering why &quot;This standard deprecates the use of the Call keyword.&quot;? What then should be the best approach for multiple arguments procedures? I think &quot;Call MyFunction(arg1, arg2)&quot; looks more like a function call than &quot;MyFunction arg1, arg2&quot;, due to the parenthesizes.</text>

This chapter is a simple introduction to drawing simple graphics in Visual Basic Classic.  It is possible to do very sophisticated graphics programming in VB but here we will concentrate of the basics.

There are two ways of creating simple two dimensional graphics in VB: 

* draw lines, boxes, circles, and ellipses at run time by executing statements or

* add shape objects to the form at design time.

If you know in advance exactly what to draw, then it might be simpler to use the second method, as you can then see exactly what you will get as you drag and drop shapes to the form.  However if the picture is to be generated based on, say, some statistics, you might be better off using the drawing methods of a ''Form'' or ''PictureBox''.

==Shape and Line controls==
There are two built-in controls in Visual Basic that can be used to create simple two-dimensional drawings:

*Shape
*Line

Here is a simple example showing some of the shapes that can be created simply by dropping Shape controls on a Form:
[[image:VBClassicSimpleGraphicsExample.png]]

Note that you can modify the properties of Shape and Line controls at run time just as you can any other control.  You can also create them at run time, either by using ''Control Arrays'' or by using the ''CreateObject'' function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using Master Templates ==

=== Introduction ===

A master template in Umbraco can be included by child templates in order to ensure that a set of pages have common elements (typically header and footer).

You will need to understand how to create Umbraco documents and template types before reading this article.

=== Example of a master template ===

In this very simple example we are going to create a master template that will create the opening HTML and HEAD tags, open the BODY tag, insert the child template and then close the HTML tag.

In Umbraco, create a template called 'Master' (can be called anything) with the following code.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;
			&lt;?UMBRACO_GETITEM field=&quot;pageName&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;?UMBRACO_TEMPLATE_LOAD_CHILD/&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Important!&lt;/b&gt; a bug was reported in Umbraco 2.1 where whitespace in &lt;?UMBRACO_TEMPLATE_LOAD_CHILD/&gt; could cause the master/child template functionality to fail. Please copy and paste exactly as is.

=== Notes on the example master template ===

The above template should be fairly familiar HTML. There are two Umbraco tags that need your attention:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?UMBRACO_GETITEM field=&quot;pageName&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The pageName attribute is a common element across all nodes in the Umbraco content XML. The code above simply inserts this name into the html title tag.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?UMBRACO_TEMPLATE_LOAD_CHILD/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above code tells Umbraco that this is the place in the markup where a child template should be inserted. We will learn how to do this in the next step.

=== Creating the child template ===

In Umbraco, create a template called 'Child' or whatever you want.

In the left hand menu click on the template you just created.

The source of the template can be anything you want, but for this very simple example let's use the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am output from the child template&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Before you save the template, change the select box labelled 'Master Template' so the value is set to the master template you created in the first step of this tutorial.

=== Testing your work ===

Choose a document type from the settings menu, or create a new blank document type. 

Add the child template you created in the second step of this tutorial to the Allowed templates for your document type.

Goto the content section of Umbraco and create a node of the document type. 

Now preview the node with the Temlate type set to the child template you created in the second step of this tutorial.

View the source of the preview and the results should show your master template has been included around the child template as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;
			Node Title

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The texts here will help you to understand Finnish.  The texts are provided by teachers and are used to develop the learners' understanding of Finnish. 

The material is sourced from an original Finnish-text article. Each Finnish-text article has a discussion page entirely in Finnish.  These pages are subscribed to by people whose mother tongue is Finnish and can answer questions about the text. Please do not ask questions in English here!!  

Each article can also have a number of parallel pages in the language of the learners.  There pages are created and maintained entirely by the learners themselves. They record their understanding of the material and editors of these pages will often refer to the original Finnish discussion page to find answers to their questions.  If they cannot find an answer to their question, they can try raising a question in the English translation article's discussion page in English, or can pose the question in Finnish on the Finnish article's Finnish discussion page.

==Editing and correcting pages==

Translation pages will, by their very nature, be incomplete until completed by the students!  If you do some work on a translation article (for example by translating sections not yet translated) please publish your translation by updating the page of the book for the benefit of others!!  DO NOT WORRY THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG!!! Others with a better understanding than you will soon discover your error and change it. If you find an error anywhere in any page, please change it immediately.  If you are not certain about a change you would like to see, raise the matter in the article's discussion page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Finnish Language in Use}}


This is the English version of the Finnish Book Suomen Kieli käyttöön (Finnish Language in Use).

The title and all chapters names parallel the original book to make it easy to navigate from the English and Finnish Books.  This is done merely by changing the address from en.wikibooks.org/ etc....  to fi.wikibooks.org/ etc....  

Also in development is a translation in Russian and soon other languages. 

Finnish Language in Use (this book) has a companion reference book [[Suomen_kieli_ulkomaalaisille|Finnish Language for Foreigners]] which provides information about the rules of grammar and pronunciation in the Finnish language.


==Introduction==
===Who is developing this book?===
This book began life as a project run at [http://www.timali.fi Timali] the adult education centre in [[w:Raisio|Raisio]], near [[w:Turku|Turku]], in Western Finland.  The Timali school teaches Finnish to more than one hundred foreign students learning the Finnish language every year.

We hope that other people in [[w:Finland|Finland]] and around the world will join us in this project to make this book the best possible place to learn Finnish on the World Wide Web.

=== Why is this book being developed?===
'''Grammar:'''  Learning Finnish requires the student to develop many levels of understanding of the language.  It is not enough to arm oneself with a book on Finnish grammar and an English-Finnish dictionary to become a competent user of the language. Certainly, a Finnish grammar is essential, but it is not sufficient. There are many idiomatic forms and usages that do not fit a &quot;rule book&quot;, which is essentially what a grammar is. So one has to learn the exceptions and special cases as well as the general rules.

Similarly with '''vocabulary'''. Most dictionaries are a compromise between what the user needs to know and the limitations forced on dictionary compilers by the physical size of the dictionary.  For instance, a small dictionary might tell you (as mine did) that the translation for &quot;goodbye&quot; is &quot;hyvästi&quot;.  But it is quite wrong to use &quot;hyvästi&quot; in most circumstances! It actually means &quot;goodbye&quot; when you are likely never to see the person again!  &quot;Näkemiin&quot; (till we see again) or &quot;Hei Hei&quot; (Bye-bye) or &quot;Nähdään&quot; (see ya) are much more common everyday ways of saying goodbye.  Some basic books teaching Finnish to foreigners do have these details, but they suffer from the same restriction on size that dictionary compilers have.  

An on-line book such as this has no such restriction. Physical size is not really a problem. 

'''Linguistic constructions:''' Some things in Finnish are rather similar to English (for example past tense constructions), but there are many instances that are different. The participle constructions can seem quite strange and there are many instances of verb/noun constructions that the foreigner just has to learn.  So for instance a person in Finland will &quot;EAT his medicine&quot; (not &quot;TAKE his medicine&quot; as in English), and will check in the paper to see what is &quot;COMING FROM TV TONIGHT&quot; (not to see what is &quot;ON TV TONIGHT&quot;). No dictionary or simple grammar book will tell you these things. We hope that this book will.  In this respect this translation of &quot;Suomen kieli käyttöön&quot; will differ from the original Finnish book under development and from other translations such as that in Russian.

This book aims to close the gap between dictionaries and grammar books by providing a book with lots of examples of the language in everyday use. From newspaper and magazine articles, letters and e-mails, to spoken interview and chat room dialogues. The latter especially tend to contain lots of contractions and dialectical forms extensively found in the spoken language.  

The ultimate aim is to provide people who are learning the Finnish language an understanding of how sentences are constructed, and how to determine the right case for a noun (not always easy for a person not used to using a language that has 15 different noun cases!), and how to understand and correctly use the various passive, active, infinitive and participle forms of verbs. On top of that, students will also be able to identify and learn the various forms of &quot;rektio&quot; (case form governance directed by a verb). These are undoubtedly the biggest problems faced by foreign learners of Finnish.

===How is this achieved?===

This book has been created on the Finnish Wikibooks site at [[:fi:Suomen kieli käyttöön|Suomen kieli käyttöön]]. It has parallel translations on other Wikibooks sites. It contains real life Finnish texts and some audio material.  These translation pages are created by students who are expected to cross-check each other's work, and we hope that students wherever in the world they are, will add new texts here (as well as on the Finnish Wikibook version, being careful of course not to breach anyone's copyright!) and that they will encourage their friends who speak Finnish fluently to help out and correct any mistakes, or highlight any matter that he or she may think is of interest to students developing this book. Of course there is no guarantee that these translations are error free at any given time but hopefully, as with other WIKI type projects, any errors will soon be ironed out by those who understand things better. Its a good idea therefore to create a log-in ID and put pages you have read to your watch-list so that you can see the changes as they are being made.

We hope students will place links from the Finnish pages to the versions they have translated. 

Texts are graded for complexity. Thus it makes sense if you are complete beginner to start with texts at Level 1 and work your way through the levels.  This grading is done by taking an overall look at the complexity of the texts and assigning a complexity level.  Because the texts are mostly from real life, some complex language may occasionally be seen in lower graded texts. 

Formal analysis of texts is encouraged to point out grammatical features and highlight the special usages of words in particular contexts. Students will raise questions about the texts on the discussion pages. They can communicate with each other through the use of the discussion pages and help each other to improve the translations and the analysis. If the students collectively cannot resolve the issue, the discussion may move to the equivalent page on the Finnish pages where questions can be asked in Finnish about the material. Finnish pages will be verified by Finnish speakers who hopefully can answer the questions raised.  Readers of this book are therefore encouraged to log in and add pages they have read to their watchlists.

As readers get to understand how the language works, there will not always be the need to provide low level analysis of higher graded texts. Only the more complex elements will be analysed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While researching for the wikipedia article [[w:Australia at the Winter Olympics|Australia at the Winter Olympics]], a variety of sources were used.

Some of the sources disagreed with each other. Differences included placings, precise spellings of names, and the total number of competitors (ie the size of the field). Sometimes people who were disqualified have not been mentioned in various sources. 

No definite conclusions have been made yet as to which source is right or wrong when they disagree.

Errata have been associated with books rather than web documents for technical reasons, not because web documents are assumed to be more reliable.

==Charles, Prince of Wales==
[[Image:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales]]
Prince Charles, who was born at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948, is the eldest son of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is the heir to the throne of the United Kingdom. The Prince of Wales is well known for his extensive charity work, particularly for the Prince's Trust. He also carries out a full schedule of royal duties, and increasingly is taking on more royal roles from his aging mother. The Prince is also well known for his high profile marriages to the late Lady Diana Spencer and subsequently to Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall.

===Early life===

In 1952, his mother assumed the throne, becoming Queen Elizabeth II. Prince Charles immediately became Duke of Cornwall. He also became the Duke of Rothesay, the title by which he is known in Scotland. 

He went to Hill House School in West London, and later the Cheam preparatory school in Berkshire, which the Duke of Edinburgh also went to. The Prince finished his education at Gordonstoun, a private boarding school in the north east of Scotland. His father, the Duke of Edinburgh, had previously attended Gordonstoun, becoming head boy. It is often reported that the Prince hated his time at the school, where he was a frequent target for bullies. In 1966 Charles spent two terms at Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia during which time he also visited Papua New Guinea. On his return to Gordonstoun he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming head boy. In 1967 he left Gordonstoun with two A levels, in history and French.

Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school. However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, earning a 2:2 (a lower second class degree). Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree. He also went to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth to learn the Welsh language, making him the first English-born Prince of Wales ever to make a serious attempt to do so.

He was created The Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in 1958, though his actual investiture did not take place until 1 July 1969. This was a major ceremony, held at Caernarfon Castle in north Wales, a place traditionally associated with the creation of the title in the 13th century. The Welsh borough of Swansea was granted city status to mark the occasion.
He served on HMS Norfolk as Sub Luietenant Prince of Wales in the early seventies.

===First marriage===

On 29 July 1981, The Prince of Wales married Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral before 3,500 invited guests and an estimated 750 million people around the world. Almost immediately, the Princess of Wales became a star attraction, chased by the press, her every move (including every change in hairstyle) closely followed by millions. However, the marriage soon became troubled. Within five years of the wedding the marriage was already on the brink of collapse, and though they remained publicly a couple, they had effectively separated by the mid 1990s, he living in Highgrove, she in Kensington Palace. They divorced on 28 August 1996. They had had two sons, Prince William of Wales and Prince Henry of Wales, who is known by the name &quot;Harry&quot;. Diana, Princess of Wales was killed in a car accident in Paris, France in 1997.

===Second marriage===

After his divorce from Diana, Princess of Wales, The Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles eventually became openly acknowledged, with her becoming his unofficial consort. Over time, opinion shifted to a point where a civil marriage would be acceptable. They married on 9 April 2005. It was announced that, after the marriage, as the wife of The Prince of Wales, Camilla would be styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and that upon the Prince's accession to the throne, she would not be known as Queen Camilla but as Her Royal Highness The Princess Consort.

===Personal interests===

The Prince of Wales is a keen horseman and huntsman. He served in the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976, commanding HMS ''Bronington'', a minehunter, from February 1976 until December 1976. He is also a watercolour artist and a published writer. He has exhibited and sold a number of paintings. The Prince's Trust, which he founded, is a charity that works mainly with young people, offering loans to groups, businesses and people (often in deprived areas) who had difficulty receiving outside support. Fundraising concerts are regularly held for the Prince's Trust, with leading pop, rock and classical musicians taking part

To put his ideas on architecture and town planning into practice, the Prince of Wales is developing the village of Poundbury in Dorset. Prior to commencing work on Poundbury he had published a book and produced a documentary called ''A Vision for Britain''. In 1992 he also established The Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture and began the publication of a magazine dealing with architecture, but the latter has since ceased independent operation after being merged with another charity to create The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment in 2001. The Prince is also keen on growing and promoting organic food, although he drew some ridicule when he joked about sometimes talking to his houseplants. The Prince of Wales is President of 16 charities, and raised over £100 million for charity in 2004.

==Prince William of Wales==
[[Image:2007 WSJ Prince William.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Prince William of Wales]]
Prince William of Wales was born at St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington on 21 June 1982. His parents are Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. He is second in the line of succession to the British throne.

On 1 March 1991 (St. David's Day), Prince William made his first official public appearance during a visit to Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. After arriving by plane, the eight-year-old prince was taken by his parents to Llandaff Cathedral. After a tour of the cathedral, he signed its visitors book, which showed that he was left-handed. Prince William went to the Mrs Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-prep Wetherby School both in West London, and later attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire.  After passing an entrance exam he went on to attend Eton College in Berkshire. Whilst there he studied geography, biology and history of art at A-level.

Like a growing number of British teenagers, Prince William chose to take a gap year after finishing Eton College. He took part in British Army training in Belize. He spent the final stage of his gap year in southern Chile as a volunteer with Raleigh International. Pictures of the prince cleaning a toilet were broadcast around the world. After his gap year, Prince William attended the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland from 2001 until he was graduated in 2005. He started doing a degree course in Arts History, although he later changed his main subject to Geography and gained a Scottish Master of Arts degree with upper-second class honours. In January 2006, the prince began his cadet course at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to train as an Army Officer. William joined his brother who had been there since May 2005.

In July 2005, William carried out his first official engagements representing Elizabeth II, as Queen of New Zealand, at World War II commemorations in New Zealand. In September of the same year, it was announced that William will become president of The Football Association in May 2006 and patron to the UK charity Centrepoint, which works with homeless young people. In April 2011, he married Kate Middleton.

Soap with mime attachments was indeed the way to go.

Remark: this only works with java 1.4.2_09 (I did not get it working with java 1.5.x)

For those who are interested I included some sample code on how to exchange large binary data between a java client and and webobjects server without taking all data in memory.
You also need the java mail and java activation framework from sun.

== Exercises in setting up Lagrange functions and deriving the equations of motion ==

I recommend going through every exercise below (unless you know at once how to solve each of them). These exercises are not difficult but will give you experience in dealing with Lagrange functions. You do not really understand the Lagrangian formalism unless you can solve these standard problems without much effort.

Each of the following exercises poses the same questions: a) Introduce generalized coordinates and write down a Lagrange function for the system described below. b) Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. (It is not necessary to solve them!) Every situation is set up in the gravitational field near the Earth. All the mentioned sticks are massless and completely rigid. All the mentioned springs are massless and perfectly elastic (without friction) and have spring constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The lengths of springs at rest are given in the exercises.

1. A point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; hangs from the ceiling on a stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. It can move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane.

2. Two point masses &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; hang from the ceiling (far from each other) on two sticks of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; each. They can both move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane.  

3. Two point masses &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; hang from the ceiling on two sticks of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; each. They can both move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane. In addition, there is a spring with rest length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; connecting the two point masses. The points where the sticks are attached to the ceiling are at a distance &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; from each other.
(You may find [[:Image:Coupled.svg|this illustration]] useful.)

4. A point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; hangs from the ceiling on a stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Another point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is attached to the first one with a stick of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Both masses can move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane.

5. A point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; hangs from the ceiling on a stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Another point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is attached to the first one with a spring of rest length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Both masses can move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane.

6. Two point masses &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are attached to the two ends of a stick of length &lt;math&gt;2l&lt;/math&gt;. The midpoint of the stick is attached to the ceiling by a stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The entire arrangement can move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane.

7. A point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is attached to the ceiling by a stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The point mass can move in all directions.

8. A point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is attached to the ceiling by a spring of rest length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The point mass can move in all directions.

9. Two identical carts of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; can roll without friction on a rail along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. They are connected by a spring of rest length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

10. A cart of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;  can roll without friction on a rail along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. A pendulum, consisting of a stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and a point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, is mounted rigidly on the cart and can move freely within the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; vertical plane.

== A brief primer on differential equations ==

You may skip this primer and go to the [[Classical Mechanics/Lagrangian|next page]] if you can easily solve the following differential equations:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=4x+8t, \quad x(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + 15 x(t) = 10, \quad x(0)=1, \quad \dot x(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=3t\sqrt x, \quad x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



== Integration ==

Integration is the operation which is inverse to differentiation. This operation is very important for theoretical physics, and you should become familiar with computing integrals.

Definite integrals are written as follows: &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;. (There is really no separate concept of an &quot;indefinite integral.&quot; The notation &lt;math&gt;\int f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; is merely the shorthand for &lt;math&gt;\int_{x_0}^{x}f(x')dx'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is not used in later calculations and/or is chosen for convenience in some natural way.)

Some basic integrals:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int f(ax)dx  =\frac{1}{a}\int f(x)dx;\quad\int t^{n}dt=\frac{t^{n+1}}{n+1};\quad\int e^{x}dx=e^{x};\quad\int\cos xdx=\sin x
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{x}  =\ln x;\quad\int\frac{dx}{1+x^{2}}=\arctan x;\quad\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}=\arcsin x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Substitution of variable: introduce &lt;math&gt;x=g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a function:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int f(x)dx=\int f(g(z))\frac{dg(z)}{dz}dz.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Examples:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int\frac{dx}{1+x}  =\ln\left(1+x\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}}\sin\frac{1}{x}  =\cos\frac{1}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Integration by parts:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)g'(x)dx=\left.f(x)g(x)\right|_{a}^{b}-\int_{a}^{b}f'(x)g(x)dx.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For example (here we do not write the limits of integration):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int(\ln x)dx=\int(x)'(\ln x)dx=x\ln x-\int x(\ln x)'dx=x\ln x-x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Note: trigonometric functions are sometimes more conveniently written in terms of complex exponentials (using the Euler formula):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\cos x=\frac{1}{2}\left(e^{ix}+e^{-ix}\right);\quad\sin x=\frac{1}{2i}\left(e^{ix}-e^{-ix}\right);\quad e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



'''Exercise: '''

Compute the following indefinite integrals.
* &lt;math&gt;\int e^{2x}\sin x\, dx  =&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int t^{2}\sin t\, dt  =&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int\sin^{2}xdx  =&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x+1}}  =&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int x\sqrt{3x+1}dx  =&lt;/math&gt;
Test yourself!!!!!!
* &lt;math&gt;\int \sqrt{\tan{x}}dx  =&lt;/math&gt;

== General solutions and particular solutions ==

In this section, differential equations are written for unknown function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Derivatives are denoted by overdots: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}\equiv\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}\equiv\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

The '''general solution''' of a differential equation is a function that solves the equation and contains arbitrary constants. For equations with first derivatives ('''first-order equations''') there is only one constant; for second-order equations there are two constants, etc. 


'''Examples:'''

* Find the general solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary constant.
* Find the general solution of &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=2&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A+2t&lt;/math&gt;.
* Find the general solution of &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=4t+\cos2t&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A+2t^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sin2t&lt;/math&gt;.
* Find the general solution of &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Find the general solution of the second-order equation &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A+Bt&lt;/math&gt;.
* Find the general solution of &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+7x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A\cos(t\sqrt{7})+B\sin(t\sqrt{7})&lt;/math&gt;.
* Find the general solution of &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}-7x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Answer: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{t\sqrt{7}}+Be^{-t\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Find the general solution of &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+5\dot{x}+4x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Solution: we look for &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; must be such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{2}+5\lambda+4=0&lt;/math&gt;.
This has two solutions, &lt;math&gt;\lambda=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda=-4&lt;/math&gt;. So the general solution is &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{-t}+Be^{-4t}&lt;/math&gt;. 


'''Exercises:'''

Find the general solution of the following equations.
* &lt;math&gt;\dot x =2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}  =3t+e^{-t}
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}  =\dot{x}
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}  =-10x
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}  =-2006\dot{x}+2006x&lt;/math&gt;


'''Particular solutions''' are selected from general solutions by conditions, such as the initial conditions: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\ddot{x}=1,\quad x(0)=1,\quad\dot{x}(0)=2.\quad(1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The general solution of &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A+Bt+\frac{1}{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The conditions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(0)=2&lt;/math&gt; are satisfied only if &lt;math&gt;A=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B=2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the particular solution of equation (1) is &lt;math&gt;x(t)=1+2t+\frac{1}{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

To find particular solutions, we first find the general solution with arbitrary constants and then determine the values of these constants using the initial conditions.

'''Exercises:'''

Solve the following equations with initial conditions. Plot the resulting functions &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+3x=0, \quad  x(0)=2
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}-x=0, \quad  x(2)=1
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}-4x=0, \quad  x(0)=1,\quad\dot{x}(0)=1
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}-4t=0, \quad  x(0)=1,\quad\dot{x}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;


'''Boundary-value problems''' are differential equations with conditions at different points. Note: There are usually infinitely many functions that solve a differential equation. The ''general solution'' represents all these functions by means of a formula with arbitrary constants. A ''particular solution'' is selected by conditions, and one needs as many conditions as unknown constants. So, e.g. for a second-order differential equation, there are two arbitrary constants, and one needs two conditions to specify a unique solution. Instead of specifying  two conditions conditions at the same time, such as &lt;math&gt;x(0)=\dot x(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, one can specify two conditions at different times, e.g. &lt;math&gt;x(0)=1, x(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;. Such conditions are called '''boundary conditions'''.

'''Exercises:'''

Solve the following boundary-value problems.
* &lt;math&gt;
3\ddot{x}+4x=0, \quad  x(0)=0,\quad x(2)=5
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=4e^{-t}, \quad  x(0)=1,\quad x(1)=0
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+4x=0, \quad  x(0)=0,\quad x(\pi)=\pi
&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+x=0, \quad   x(0)=2\pi,\quad x(2\pi)=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
''Hint:'' The last two equations have tricky boundary conditions!

=== Some simple inhomogeneous equations ===

Equations of the form &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=Bx&lt;/math&gt; have the general solution &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{Bt}&lt;/math&gt;.
What about &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=Bx+10&lt;/math&gt;? The general solution is &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{Bx}+\frac{10}{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
How to guess? Write &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{Bt}+C&lt;/math&gt; and substitute; then find the correct
value of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Exercises:'''

Solve the following equations.

* &lt;math&gt;\dot x +3x=2, \quad x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+5\dot x+4x=8, \quad x(0)=2,\quad\dot x(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2\ddot{x}+18x=-1, \quad x(1)=1,\quad\dot x(1)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+9\dot x=-2, \quad x(0)=0,\quad\dot x(0)=3&lt;/math&gt;

''Hint:'' In the last equation, replace &lt;math&gt;\dot x (t)&lt;/math&gt; by an unknown function
&lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+\omega^{2}x=0&lt;/math&gt; have the general solution &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A_{1}\cos\omega t+A_{2}\sin\omega t&lt;/math&gt;.
What about &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+\omega^{2}x=A+Bt&lt;/math&gt;? Write &lt;math&gt;x(t)=C_{1}+C_{2}t&lt;/math&gt; and find
the correct values of &lt;math&gt;C_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then add the general solution.
The result is &lt;math&gt;x(t)=(A+Bt)\omega^{-2}+A_{1}\cos\omega t+A_{2}\sin\omega t&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that in every case the general solution of the equation without the right-hand
side (the '''homogeneous equation''') is added to a guessed solution of the
equation with the right-hand side (the '''inhomogeneous equation'''). This
is the general principle when dealing with such equations.


'''Exercises:'''

Solve the following equations:

* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+2x=3t-1, \quad x(0)=\dot{x}(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}-4x=t^{2}-4t, \quad x(0)=\dot{x}(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+\dot{x}+x=t^{3}+t^{2}+t, \quad x(0)=\dot{x}(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

== Method of &quot;variation of constants&quot; ==

What about &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=Bx+f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some more complicated function?
These are solved with the method of '''variation of constants.''' The solution
is found as &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A(t)e^{Bt}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an unknown function. Substituting
into &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=Bx+f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we have&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\dot{A}e^{Bt}+BAe^{Bt}=BAe^{Bt}+f(t),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
therefore the function &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;\dot{A}=e^{-Bt}f(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Its general solution is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A(t)=\int_{t_{0}}^{t}e^{-Bt_{1}}f(t_{1})dt_{1},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary constant. Therefore, the general solution for
&lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x(t)=e^{Bt}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}e^{-Bt_{1}}f(t_{1})dt_{1}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This can be also rewritten as&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x(t)=Ae^{Bt}+e^{Bt}\int_{0}^{t}e^{-Bt_{1}}f(t_{1})dt_{1}=Ae^{Bt}+\int_{0}^{t}e^{B(t-t_{1})}f(t_{1})dt_{1},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where now &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary constant.


'''Example: '''

Solve &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+x=t&lt;/math&gt;. Solution: &lt;math&gt;x(t)=A(t)e^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;; the function &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; is
found from &lt;math&gt;\dot{A}=te^{t}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;A(t)=\int te^{t}dt=te^{t}-e^{t}+C&lt;/math&gt;. So the
general solution is &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{-t}=t-1+Ce^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;. We could guess this solution
by substituting &lt;math&gt;x(t)=C_{1}t+C_{2}+Ae^{-t}&lt;/math&gt; and finding the correct values
&lt;math&gt;C_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Exercises:'''

Solve the following equations with initial or boundary conditions.

* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}-2x=3t^{2}-2t, \quad  x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+2x=e^{-t} \quad x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+x=e^{-t} \quad x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;


More general equations:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}-f(t)x=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad x=Ae^{\int f(t)dt}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For example: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+2tx=0&lt;/math&gt; has the general solution &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Ae^{-t^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Exercises:'''

Find the general solution of the following equations.
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+t^{2}x=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+e^{t}x=e^{t}&lt;/math&gt;


Another general formula is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}-f(t)x=g(t)\quad\Rightarrow\quad x=Ae^{\int_{0}^{t}f(t_{1})dt_{1}}\int_{0}^{t}g(t_{1})e^{-\int_{0}^{t_{1}}f(t_{2})dt_{2}}dt_{1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This can be obtained by &quot;variation of constant&quot; in the solution &lt;math&gt;Ae^{\int f(t)dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Method of &quot;separation of variables&quot; ==

Another useful method applies to differential equations of the form&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x)g(t).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For example, the differential equations &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=x^{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}\dot{x}=\cos t&lt;/math&gt;
are of this form. To solve these equations, we use the trick called &quot;separation
of variables.&quot; We look for the solution of the form &lt;math&gt;F(x)=G(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are some functions. If the solution were in this form, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}F(x)=\frac{d}{dt}G(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
which is the same as &lt;math&gt;(dF/dx)\dot{x}=dG/dt&lt;/math&gt;. This should be equivalent to the
original differential equation &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)g(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dF(x)}{dx}=\frac{1}{f(x)},\quad\frac{dG(t)}{dt}=g(t).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
These equations are easy to solve:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F(x)=\int\frac{1}{f(x)}dx,\quad G(t)=\int g(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can compute these functions and find the general solution of the original
equation in the following '''implicit form''':&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int_{x_{0}}^{x}\frac{1}{f(x)}dx=\int_{t_{0}}^{t}g(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants of integration. This solution
satisfies the initial condition &lt;math&gt;x(t_{0})=x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example:'''

Consider the equation &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=x^{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. We write
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{x^{2}}\dot{x}  =t^{2}\;\Rightarrow
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}}  =\int t^{2}dt\;\Rightarrow
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{1}{x}+C  =\frac{t^{3}}{3}\quad\Rightarrow x(t)=\frac{1}{C-\frac{1}{3}t^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that only one constant of integration is necessary, despite the presence of two &quot;indefinite integrals&quot;.


'''Exercises:'''

Find the general solution of the following equations.
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} =\frac{x}{t}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy(x)}{dx} =\frac{1+y}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x(t)\frac{dx(t)}{dt}}  =\frac{1}{5t}&lt;/math&gt;

== Miscellaneous cases when solutions are guessed ==

One case is second-order equations with &quot;source&quot; (i.e. with nonzero function in the right hand side). We need to guess a solution of the inhomogeneous
equation. We guess the solution by writing an ansatz with unknown coefficients. Here are some examples:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+x=\cos(2t)  \Rightarrow  x(t)=C_{1}\cos(2t),\quad\textrm{then~find~}C_{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\ddot{x}+4\dot{x}+3x=\sin t \Rightarrow  x(t)=C_{1}\sin t+C_{2}\cos t,\quad\textrm{then~find~}C_{1,2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\ddot{x}+x=\sin t  \Rightarrow  x(t)=C_{1}t\cos t,\quad\textrm{then~find~}C_{1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note: in the last example, we need a term &lt;math&gt;t\cos t&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;\sin t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos t&lt;/math&gt; are already solutions of the homogeneous equation!

Another example:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\ddot{x}+2\dot{x}+x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We look for solutions in the form &lt;math&gt;x(t)=e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{2}+2\lambda+1=0&lt;/math&gt; and only one root &lt;math&gt;\lambda=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Then we use a special trick: the general solution is not &lt;math&gt;Ce^{-t}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;x(t)=C_{1}e^{-t}+C_{2}te^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Exercises:'''

Solve the following equations.
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+4x=\sin t+1, \quad x(0)=\dot{x}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+4x=\sin(2t)+1, \quad x(0)=\dot{x}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}-4\dot{x}+4x=2, \quad x(0)=\dot{x}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;


Systems of differential equations: for example,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=y, \quad \dot{y}=2x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
may be solved either by differentiation: &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=2x&lt;/math&gt;, or by guessing the solution in the form &lt;math&gt;x(t)=C_{1}e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y(t)=C_{2}e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: Since these equations are linear, you should add all the possible pieces of the general solution with different values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise:'''

By guessing the solution in the form &lt;math&gt;x(t)=C_{1}e^{\lambda t},y(t)=C_{2}e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, find the general solution of the system
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+x=-y, \quad \ddot{y}+y=3x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Green Sauce is a dish that originates from the Frankfurt/Main (Hesse, Germany) region.

== Ingredients (four servings) ==
* 3 to 4 cups (200g/7oz each) of sour cream
* milk
* 1 tbsp. sunflower oil (or other oil of neutral taste)
* 2 tsp. lemon juice
* 4 hard-boiled eggs
* 10 to 15 large potatoes
* one to one and a half empty sour cream cups filled with dill
* one to one and a half empty sour cream cups filled with other mixed herbs: chives, parsley, onion leaves, lemon balm, burnet, a small amount of sorrel if available

''(the amounts of herbs could need more precise measurements; this is all I have)''

== Procedure ==
Mix sour cream, oil and lemon juice and add milk until the mixture takes the consistency of a thick sauce. Chop herbs to very fine bits and mix them into the sauce. Cut hard-boiled eggs to small pieces and add them to the sauce along with some salt and pepper. Leave the sauce in the fridge for about one to one and a half hours.

Boil potatoes and serve hot with the cold sauce. More hard-boiled eggs can also be served along with this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Greek boats had two or three sails depending on the size of the craft. These boats were made out of large pieces of hard wood; these boats were large for the time but only could carry 100 – 150 kg of stone used to make statues. The usual items carried on the boats were construction supplies to build houses, war supplies such as iron, bronze, etc. the Greeks also carried lots of food, the most items they would trade were almonds,. Other objects they would carry were fish, olives, barley and other substances they would carry the substances over water by putting them in urns and putting a wax seal over top.

There was a special road called the “Diolkos” it was a special road because it connected two seas so people would be able to travel to the other seas without getting a different boat, the length of this road was 175 km an anonymous writer said that after it was built it started to turn green because of the seaweed and barnacles laying on it because no one would clean it. This road started at one sea and ended at the other. What would happen was they would put this boat on a trailer pulled by three oxen they would then pull it across to the other sea.

To transport objects and themselves on land they would use wooden carts to pull themselves around the city or even their village. Now to pull the carts they would use animals, it was much easier to use pack animals because they would only have to control one for the others to follow. These animals could pull up to 100 kg. With the larger animals like oxen and cattle they could carry up to 500 kg. To build roads, not that they usually did because they thought it would be easier for their enemies to invade the area they would use stone or dirt to pave the area, the city would only do this if the area was based on trade. The fact was the poor people walked while the rich people used carts.

Transportation was a very important thing in ancient Greece. The people based their whole civilization on boat transportation.

{{branch unstable}}
'''Administrators''', or &quot;sysops&quot;, are Wikibookians who are generally well-known and trusted in the community, and who have had certain restrictions lifted at wikibooks.  Administrators have the added abilities of being able to delete pages and block users for a specified period of time.  Administrators are not granted any extra authority; they must follow all policies. They may grant the [[Wikibooks:Uploaders|uploader]], [[Wikibooks:Importers|importer]] and [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewer]] flags. 

'''Bureaucrats''' are administrators with extra tools.  They are able to change usernames, create new administrators, and switch the [[WB:BOT|bot]] flag.

== Becoming an Administrator ==
Administrators will only be created after a discussion at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] that results in a consensus to grant the permission. Members of the community may either request permissions themselves, or be nominated by another Wikibookian. If a user is nominated to become an administrator, that user must accept the nomination explicitly, either on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] or on their user talk page before the discussion begins.

Discussion about the creation of a new administrator should follow the rules found at [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]. Creating an administrator is a &quot;high-impact&quot; situation.

Only a '''bureaucrat''' has the privileges to create a new administrator, and they will use their judgment as to whether a consensus on the matter has been reached. If they do not believe a strong consensus has been reached, they will not create the administrator. Once an administrator has been created, they may not have the rights removed, even if the privileges have been granted in error, unless there has been a further discussion with consensus to remove the rights. If no bureaucrat is available to create an administrator, but consensus has been reached on the matter, users may post a request at [[meta:Requests for permissions]], where a steward may grant the permissions. Users are not allowed to ask the stewards for permissions if consensus has not been reached at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]].

While there are no specific requirements to becoming an administrator, they should be &quot;well-known and trusted&quot; members of the community, and expected to know the Wikibooks policy, especially the deletion policy. Also, because administrators are able to block users, they are expected to be familiar with the process of blocking a user.

== Becoming a Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|WB:CRAT}}
Bureaucrats are created in the same manner as administrators. Prospective bureaucrats can either request the permissions, or they can be nominated (and must explicitly accept the nomination). Creating a new bureaucrat is a more weighty discussion than the creation of an admin, and therefore users should take it more seriously. An election for a new bureaucrat ''must'' be advertised in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|reading room]], and possibly on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Bulletin Board|bulletin board]] as well. Bureaucrats can be created by other bureaucrats, or the stewards at meta. It is not permissible to request bureaucrat permissions on meta if consensus has not been reached at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]].

Candidates for Bureaucrats must currently be Administrators. There are no other specific requirements on creating new bureaucrats, although candidates are generally expected to be active Wikibookians, and well-respected admins.

== Becoming a CheckUser ==
CheckUser rights provide an Administrator with additional tools for fighting vandalism. These tools allow an Administrator to see a Wikibookian IP address, in order to identify and combat disruption of the wiki.

Candidates for CheckUser must currently be Administrators, they can be nominated or request the rights, on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. There is no explicit requirement on the number of contributions, or activity here at Wikibooks, but it is expected that the candidate will be a noted active vandalism fighter. As with any request for permission, if the candidate is nominated, there must be an explicit acceptance for the vote to continue.

CheckUser rights can only be granted by [[m:Special:ListUsers/steward|stewards]]. Stewards may not be contacted to grant these rights unless consensus has been reached at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. The stewards may impose additional restrictions on the creation of CheckUsers, over which Wikibooks policy has no say.

== Removing an Administrator/Bureaucrat ==
Administrative tools can be removed in the same manner in which they are granted: a nomination for removal, or &quot;de-adminship&quot;, at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] and a consensus discussion to remove administrative powers from the offending admin. Sysops who do not meet '''any''' activity expectations (detailed below), or those who break policy, or those who abuse their powers, can be nominated for de-adminship at the [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] page. Broken expectations, policy violations, or abuses should be noted in the nomination, so that all users can examine the evidence and make a decision on the matter.

As helpful members of the community, Wikibooks administrators are expected to provide the community with timely assistance when needed or requested and maintain a general understanding of current Wikibooks environment and policies. Sysops who are especially inactive, specifically for at least one year or longer, can be removed without a consensus discussion. Users who are inactive for a year must still be nominated for de-adminship on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]], and the time of their absence must be clearly noted. De-adminship in cases of absence for one year or more will take place at least one month after nomination on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. The inactive sysop will be contacted both on his/her talk page and e-mail address (if available) to contest the nomination.

Sysops requesting de-adminship themselves will have that request granted immediately, not being subject to community approval. Should a sysop have his/her privileges removed, the user may re-apply for adminship at a later date without prejudice.

== Expectations ==
Administrators (and bureaucrats) have certain expectations on them. If an administrator doesn't live up to these expectations, they can be nominated for de-adminship. Admins who do not meet these expectations are not automatically removed: They must be nominated on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]], and the discussion must reach consensus on the matter to remove the admin.

#Administrators are expected to be active (see [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/adminstats.php?wiki=enwikibooks_p&amp;tlimit=31536000 Sysop activity on Wikibooks]). There are no hard and fast definitions on what it means to be &quot;active&quot; but a good guideline is to have at least 20 edits in the last year and 1 edit within the past month. Even this might not be enough, if administrator privileges have not been used (or not been used correctly) within the past year. Administrators who are not using privileges, those privileges provided by the community due to the user's knowledge and activity, do not need to continue having them. Administrators do not have a &quot;lifetime membership&quot; and are expected to continually use their tools for the good of the community.
#Administrators are expected to follow [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]. Administrators do not get to make unilateral decisions concerning page deletion, especially in controversial cases. Pages should not be deleted unless they are candidates for [[WB:DP|speedy deletions]] or if there has been a consensus discussion reached about the page on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]. Deleting pages without following policy is a major problem and can be very disruptive to the community.
#Administrators are expected to follow applicable policies concerning blocking users and IP addresses. &quot;Infinite&quot; blocks should not be employed unless specifically warranted. Legitimate users should not be blocked unless they are demonstrably disruptive to the community. If an admin blocks a legitimate user for no good reason that is a major disruption and a violation of this policy
#Administrators are expected to know and understand the uses of Protected pages, and not to abuse this privilege. Protecting and unprotecting pages without proper justification is against policy and prevents users from editing normally. Policies concerning semi-protection must also be understood and properly employed.

Administrators are just regular users, and they can be reprimanded as usual if they are disruptive, if they vandalize, etc.

== Blocking users ==
{{Shortcut|WB:BLOCK}}
If a user is clearly malicious or here for no reason besides to make trouble, they should be blocked. New users who are disruptive, but not maliciously so can receive short-term blocks to cool down. Administrators are trusted to use their judgment in determining whether a user deserves to be blocked and, if so, for how long. If it's not clear, discuss it at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].

Users who make particularly distasteful edits, and sock puppets of known serial vandals should be blocked permanently.

===IP blocks===
Open proxy IP addresses can be blocked forever on sight. It is considered rude to block such an IP address if it is currently being used by a productive contributor, but it is not against the rules to do so.

IP addresses that are not open-proxies should never be blocked forever, except as described below, because they are frequently shared by many users where the majority are probably legitimate. Temporary blocks on IP addresses should be all that is required to handle a single case of vandalism. Shared IPs (such as those resolving to schools) should only be blocked if there is considerable vandalism that is causing serious disruption to the project. If a block is felt necessary, start with short-term blocks (1 hour, then 2, then 24, etc.), as these often provide sufficient time for the vandal to find other things to do.

=== Infinite Blocks ===
Beyond open-proxies, infinite blocks should not be employed without good justification. Highly-disruptive vandals, repeat vandals, sockpuppets of known vandals, and usernames with profane words may all be blocked forever without further justification.

Other users who do not fit into the above categories should never be blocked forever. Many disruptive users only need a day or two to &quot;cool off&quot;. Many vandals can be blocked for longer periods of time, in the hopes that they reform and come back to be productive, or that they lose interest and never return. Vandals returning from a temporary block to continue vandalizing, can be blocked forever.

===Block reporting===
Blocks, if they require explanation, should be clearly explained by the blocking admin on the user's talk page.

== Deleting Pages ==
Pages should only be deleted as per the guidelines on [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]. Speedy delete candidates may be deleted immediately, but other pages may only be deleted as per a consensus discussion on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]].

Deleting pages should never be done lightly, and can be a very disruptive action if done incorrectly.

== Undeleting Pages ==
Deleted pages may only be undeleted as per a consensus discussion on [[Wikibooks:Requests for undeletion]], unless the page was deleted in error. Pages deleted in error may be immediately undeleted ''by the admin who deleted it''. If the deleting admin doesn't undelete it, it must be discussed on [[Wikibooks:Requests for undeletion]].

Undeleting pages, especially pages with profanity or pages that contain copyright infringements, may cause bigger problems for the community, and should be carefully considered.

Undeleting pages without justification is a violation of policy.

== Protecting Pages ==
Pages may be protected, semi-protected, and unprotected according to the relevant policies. Page protections cannot be altered without proper justification.

== Inactivity ==

I have moved over the inactivity requirements from the Help page. These edit counts and time periods came from a previous consensus discussion at the Staff Lounge. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
: A requirement of 5 edits within the past month is a bit much, even active admins will occasionally take a break/get busy else where.  If this was to be enforced we would lose a number of good admins. (At least 25 according to [[Wikibooks:Administrators]], over half of Wikibook's admins).--[[User:Cspurrier|Cspurrier]] 21:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
::Fair enough, I pulled that number out of thin air. I don't mind admins taking a break here and there, but i do care about admins disappearing for long periods of time. If an admin is gone long enough, it's a safe assuption that they will not be up-to-date on current matters of community and policy. I'll extend this limit (or even make it arbitrary) for now, But 1 year of inactivity is a hard limit for de-sysoping without a vote, so we should be able to call a vote on an admin for less time then that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:34, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
::I think getting the admins cleaned out here is a very important thing to do (and yes, almost all of those 25+ sysops aren't here at the project anymore and have no use for the tools). I was planning on getting all the de-adminships posted quite soon since the community already had consensus on those edit amounts (this sat at the Staff Lounge for several months) but now I will wait until this policy becomes enforced. Wikibooks has a lot of &quot;legacy&quot; ideas including the original set of admins that don't apply at all anymore. Several admins who hadn't edited in about two years came back to say they wanted to keep adminship yet provided no reason why and had never even used any of the tools (no logs). Adminship is like a trophy to many of those users and many have simply received it because they were here way back when Wikibooks was brand new and there was no one else around really. This is a very important cleanup task. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
I made a number of changes on this topic myself. This draft is a clean slate, i think, and we can play around with it until we find things that we like. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

Might be a good addition/loophole to allow admins to take a sebatical when announced (I mean, who's to say an admin would never go on safari for a few months?). It's one thing if an admin &quot;just disappears&quot; (which I understand has happened in the past), but if an admin needs a break for some reason or another, I don't see why they couldn't have it. (Another example that comes to mind is a new mom... she might pop by and edit once in a while, but probably wouldn't be very active until the baby is weaned). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
:Like the policy allows, an admin can again request sysop powers at a later date. If an admin leaves the project for a significant period of time, policy could change quite a bit and the whole environment of Wikibooks may be different. If the user was still an active member upon return, then there would be no problem in being reinstated. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

---

I think the idea that admins absolutely must be active all of the time is an absurd idea.  We are all volunteers, and somebody who only occasionally is able to particiapte as an admin is still as useful as people who are for all pratical purposes a full-time administrator.  And just as with content development, you can participate with admin duties as much or as little as you have time to do them.

As far as trying to remove &quot;trophy&quot; admins, I would have to agree here more.  Even then, adminship was given to trusted users who for the most part havn't violated that trust either.  They just havn't done anything at all.  

The larger worry is for somebody who becomes an administrator and then starts to be very active and aggresive, removing content even when other users don't think it should be removed.  In one situation here on Wikibooks, an admin even went out and changed a policy document, and then acted on this &quot;new&quot; policy as if it were there all along and removed content on Wikibooks based on that policy.  Now I'll admit that I even have a few &quot;arrows&quot; in my back from some people who are not pleased with some of my actions as an admin.  Still, you need to be careful when you delete content or do admin-only actions like page protection and user blocking, and be responsive to other users, especially brand new users who are not quite sure of what all of the policies are here on Wikibooks.

Getting back to the issue of admin activity levels:  Admins should not, and do not have to be able to do anything, if that is what they choose to do.  Admins are volunteers, just as being a contributor on Wikibooks is voluntary in all aspects.  There are no quotas on activity, and there never should be.

The one, and only, reason I have that strongly stands out for de-admining a very inactive user (&gt; 2 years of inactivity from editing even, for example) is the potential that their account can be compromised by someone other than the actual user and potentially be used to damage the project.  Given enough time, all accounts can be compromised through even a brute force technique of trying to log into the account with every possible password.  Such a hack can even be done that wouldn't be detected as repeated attempts to log in.

Still, this whole policy page seems to be missing the most important and crucial element of what an admin is supposed to be:  a mere user who is simply trusted by the community to do harder to reverse changes.  Becoming an administrator is not supposed to be that big of a deal, and certainly you shouldn't feel elite or privileged because you have administrator options available to you.  Any very active user who has demonstrated they want to help out signficantly with the project should be allowed to become an admin.  Even if afterward they only very rarely or occasionally use the admin options, they still help out the project simply by having somebody who can defend against radical vandals or even rogue admins who seek to damage stuff.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:I dont think there is any expectation that admins need to be active all the time (maybe the wording of this proposal needs to be altered to better reflect that) but I can't see a reason why a user who has been absent from all wikibooks editing for a year or more should need to have increased privledges. Adminship is defined by a user having a greater set of tools then the average user. The only reason you need these tools is if you intend to use them to benefit the project. Because adminship isn't some kind of special distinction or award, people who don't use the tools shouldn't have them. ''Admins are regular users'' who have a need for additional tools. I don't see any reason to give tools to people who aren't going to use them, and i certainly don't see a reason for a person with these tools to keep them if they aren't being utilized. 
:Beyond that, If an admin is gone for a year or more, can you really expect that they are going to still be up to date with their knowledge of deletion policy, page protection policy, vandal-blocking policy? Not only does it not benefit us for people to have these tools when they aren't being used, it poses a potential danger to us that old inactive admins are going to come back from hiatus and make difficult-to-repair mistakes. Adminship tools should be granted to trustworthy users when they are needed, and they should be removed when they are not needed. Since it isn't a distinction that sets accomplished users above the pack, then it shouldn't be treated like a life-time membership to a special club. 
:If an admin is just a regular user (and everybody agrees on this point), then there should be no problem in saying &quot;you have been inactive as an admin, so you are now just a regular user&quot;. If we do have a terrible vandalism attack, what do you think are the odds that a defunct admin who has been absent for months on end is going to come in here to help us with the cleanup effort? I say that there is zero chance of such a happening. Keeping around admins who aren't active makes it appear that we have more admins then we actually do: an inactive admin is just as good as no admin at all. Look at our current [[Wikibooks:Administrators|list of administrators]]. More then half of them are, by some measure, inactive. If we have a major problem, are 20 admins and 5 bcrats going to help with the cleanup? no. Keeping around old inactive admins makes our need for new, fresh admins less apparent. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
::Exactly. I don't always think that specific numbers need to be assigned for &quot;inactivity&quot; but we have to draw the line somewhere because once de-adminships begin there will be trophy users coming here to say that there's no official removal process. I think Wikibooks' presence is tarnished when users have sysop rights and have '''never''' used them. People may actually think these are helpful sysops and their existence on the admin page is misleading to me. Several months ago a couple admins subject for de-adminship came back just to say they wanted to keep the tools. When asked why, they never provided any reasons. However, discussion stagnated since there was no official rule. An admin can lose track of Wikibooks and how it works in 1+ years' time. Sysop access isn't a gift someone keeps forever. If I leave the project, I don't want to be an admin anymore. It's a bad representation. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

Although this doesn't directly relate to the current condition on Wikibooks, one of the justifications used in the past for denying people adminship was that there were plenty of admins on Wikibooks.  It was into this environment that I set up the &quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot; admin status, primarily to note those individuals who are somebody you can contact in an emergency and get a response.  Some admin talk pages had been filling up with requests, but no action, and every single Wikibooks bureaucrat had gone inactive.  I've been very careful at trying to make sure that Wikibooks is keeping at least ''somebody'' who is active as a bureaucrat, as going through the process of getting stewards to make admins is a nearly impossible task.

I consider this to be a weak reason to de-admin somebody, but it at least is something to consider and why I brought up the whole issue to begin with more than a year ago.  What I find so interesting is that previsouly the prevailing attitude was to allow lifetime appointments as admins, while now there are many vocal opponents to the idea.  Of course the Wikibooks commmunity has changed quite a bit in the past year or so.  This is a good and healthy thing, too.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Some Adjustments ==

I added a line here or there in an effort to clarify that inactivity hurts the progress of the community. After an incident where a previous admin acted sorely after losing his rights, I felt that the page could use an extra word or two to try to convey that de-adminship is not a punishment. Such inactivity hurts progress here, a much less active project compared to Wikipedia, and I belive there is a much tighter community of users here that some do not understand. The facade of being an administrator when nothing is gained from it should be something changed, and it was. If anyone wants to modify these changes, then let's chat about it. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 09:24, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with you whole-heartedly. I've been having an email discussion with [[User:Herbythyme]], and we both think that a user is only as valuable to the community as the contributions that they make. Inactive admins can be broken up into two categories:
:#Admins who are inactive for a long time, but intend to return to the project at a later date.
:#Admins who are inactive for a long time, and have no intention to return (or expressed intention to never return)
:I would say that the first group of admins are a valuable group, but that an admin who returns after a long hiatus, even if they are acting in good faith, cannot be expected to know and understand all the recent policy changes that have been happening here. At the very least, they should have to reapply to be an admin, to ensure that the present community (which may be significantly different from the community when those admins first became inactive) still knows and trusts that admin. 
:The second group of admins are, in my eyes, a dangerous group. These are people who have tools to do some exceptional harm (block users, delete pages, rollback edits), and who don't care about the project, or may even harbor some anger towards it. If a person says &quot;I hate wikibooks, i'm leaving forever&quot;, they shouldnt have the ability to do substantial harm to our project in the future. Also, if an admin says &quot;I intend never to return to this project&quot;, it must be wondered why those users should have any sort of special rank or tools here in the first place?
:The important thing to remember here is that de-sysopping is not a punishment, it is a way to ensure that (a) people who are upset with this project don't have tools available to cause harm in the future, (b) people who absolutely have demonstrated no need to have the tools should not keep them as some &quot;badge of honor&quot;, and (c) people who may not be able to use them correctly, or who are out of touch with the community should learn to use them correctly before applying them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::Well seeing as you mentioned me anyway &lt;g&gt;.  My own view is that the first group are probably aware that they will be contributing little and should state that (leave of absence? - agree approx period?).  I noticed on meta (the de sysop request area) that someone was asking to be taken off for a specific period for a reason - seemed sensible.  The second group I agree with [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] on.  (Wonder how many pages I'm going to need to watch now!) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Renaming users ==

In addition to creating admins, Bureaucrats also have the additional ability to rename a username. This is a pretty important responsibility (although one that isn't employed often here), but one that we should definately write about in this policy. For instance, a legitimate user should never be renamed without express request from that user. Also, renaming is useful when &quot;vanishing&quot; a user account:
;Vanishing:A user account can be '''vanished''' by renaming that user to a new user name, and deleting all pages in that person's old user and user talk namespaces.
Renaming a user changes all references to that person in the database to the new name (including page histories). Renamed user accounts shouldn't be profane or obscene (as per policy). What do people think about adding this kind of material into the policy? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:49, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::Uh, now that you mention it, I probably need to be renamed to SB_Johnny (my username on all other projects), rather than SBJohnny, which I am here. Might be an issue when SUL eventually comes about.

::Speaking of which... I wonder whether this will still be a bureaucrat responsibility after SUL, or if maybe it's going to become a problem for the stewards to deal with. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:45, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== Semi-Protecting Admin Userpages ==

It's my opinion that the user and user talk pages of administrators (and other high-profile editors) should be able to have their user and user talk pages semi-protected against page moves. I say this for three reasons:
#The user and usertalk pages of active admins are favorite targets of page-move vandals. 
#Regular users should be able to contact an admin on their usertalk pages, without having those pages be moved to an obscene location.
#The only time these pages should be moved is if the admin who owns them decides to move them.
I have protected my own user pages like this, and I have also recently protected [[User:Herbythyme]]'s userpage as well, because his is a frequent target of such vandalism. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Strange that this was brought up.  I did a full page protection (sysop only edit/move) on my own user page about a year ago.  I figured that since I had admin privileges, I could make whatever changes I felt were necessary.  I did this in response to a page move vandal, and (obviously) I haven't had problems since.  I look at this as a sort of perk of being an administrator, and it hasn't been a problem on those Wikimedia projects where I'm not an admin.  In fact, I havn't even thought about it being a problem until I read this little discussion.  My talk page is also move protected (sysop only), but I have it wide open for anybody to edit.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== Bureaucrats and eligibility requirements ==

:''Bureaucrats can be selected from the pool of current admins only. Users who are not currently an admin are not eligible to be a bureaucrat. There are no other specific requirements on creating new bureaucrats, although candidates are generally expected to be active wikibookians, and well-respected admins.''

When did this become &quot;official&quot; policy?  This is clearly something that flew under the radar for me, as I would have strongly and voracously objected to this idea on several levels, including the fact that we had one of our previous (now de-admined) bureaucrats go from being a regular user to bureaucrat without having been an admin first.  I will admit, however, that the rationale was that there was no other active admins on Wikibooks (not currently a huge problem), and we needed a bureaucrat to help make admins, but that is besides the point.

That somebody who becomes a bureaucrat can and ought to be a very well trusted memmber of the community, and that as a matter of practicality you perhaps ought to try and become an admin first should be suggested, but as a formal policy requirement?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:35, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
:That was added some time ago and no one had any problem with it. I find it a very sensible rule to have in place. Users were brought up to bureaucrat status directly when the project was in a special time of development, namely at the beginning of Wikibooks' life. You cannot be a bureaucrat without being an admin since that is how the system works, so we saw it as useful to say you must have some practice as an admin before you continue to gain in tool access. I see no problem whatsoever with this and see no reason to remove these statements from the policy. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Trolling ==

In response to some discussions i've had recently with wikibookians, I would like to propose an addition to this policy concerned with trolling. There is a precedent here, if only an inadvertent one, against blocking non-vandals. historically we never really have blocked non-vandals, although I dont know whether there was a concerted effort not to, or whether the issue simply never came up. 

I would like to add text to the blocking section of this policy about trolling. In extreme cases, trolling can lead to decreased motivation and decreased productivity throughout the entire community. We do need to remember that wikibooks exists for the production of textbook content, not as a general-purpose web forum or discussion board. We certainly should advocate tolerance because diversity among our contributors will lead directly to higher quality content in our books. However, there is a limit to all tolerance, and people who make a concerted effort to stand in the way of progress here should be removed from the project. Wikibooks has a mission, and it should be unacceptable for the entire community to be sidetracked from that mission in order to deal with a single disruptive individual. 

Any policy that we create on this issue should not be applied retroactively to previous instances of trolling. No change that we make should be used as revenge to previous infringements, only as a warning to future trolls. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:Please define what you are talking about here.  This looks like a very easy way to shut down legitimate disagreements if you don't agree with the POV of that person.  I know there are certainly very active individuals who are perhaps [[wikt:Gadfly|gadflies]] (see definition 4), although blocking them does seem to be a bit harsh.

:While I know you are not trying to write this on behalf of one particular individual here (*cough*), the range of what can be said is somebody who is trollish can be quite broad.  By even trying to codify this, it seems like a quick and easy way to try and deal with what is actually a difficult problem.  I'm not here trying to defend &quot;trollish&quot; behavior, but arriving at a definition does seem to have some problems.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

::I do understand your concern, and trust me when I say I gave it serious consideration before i made this post.  I can't really give a good definition, because as you pointed out above, what precisely constitutes &quot;trolling&quot; is very ill-defined. It's another issue, perhaps, of &quot;i know it when i see it&quot;, although you are right to point out that something like that without the appropriate safeguards could be open to abuse. 
::The problem is that wikibooks does have a particular purpose, and that is to write textbooks. Our purpose is not to teach people to tolerate our gadflies, or even to provide a place for the gadflies to hang out. Tolerance is certainly a virtue and one that we should not easily lay down. However, there comes a point when we spend more time tolerating the gadflies, and less time working on books like we should be. A troll is a person who disrupts, side-tracks, or even brings to a screeching halt the progress that we should be making here, and we all should find that to be unacceptable behavior. I didn't propose any particular text for this specifically because the community should take time and write something that will enable us to block trolls, while at the same time promoting tolerance of others.

::::I'm not entirely sure that the blocking policy as written is necessarily the best way to deal with this either.  Since this is technically &quot;enforced policy&quot; already, and this policy already covers user blocks, discussion here certainly is reasonable and shutting down this thread is not necessarily the best way to deal with this issue.  And I do have a few issues with the proposed blocking policy, as they do seem to be oriented toward legislating the behavior of one particular user on this project.  I say seem, even though I know efforts to write policies have been a continual process here on Wikibooks among some users.

::::As for tolerating gadflies, trolls, and malicious vandals, yeah, I would say that this is a spectrum range of people rather than something you can point a finger and say &quot;this person needs to go&quot;.  Certainly the extreme end needs to be block, and they are.  What I see happening here is trying to define more clearly where that fuzzy line is that might make one user's actions acceptable over somebody else.  And this is also something that clearly not everybody is going to agree upon, especially for those borderline cases.

::::There was one particular user about a year ago (well before Panic became an issue) that exhibited some rather interesting behavior... and it seems as though Wikibooks tends to attract these sorts of individuals as well.  There are some psychological disorders that could explain some of these individuals (and some of them have even written Wikibooks about those same disorders when they've self-identified that they had the condition).  They tend to be very active in writing a whole lot of content over a relatively short period of time, and get very argumentative.  More often then not, these same individuals over time gradually fade away from Wikibooks and only occasionally come back and edit what they started.

::::I know most of what I mentioned above can also apply to other typical Wikibookian behavior, but there seems to be an intangible something that seems to seperate out certain individuals meriting special concern.  More often than not they are left to their own devices (seperate Wikibook projects) where they do their thing and then eventually the content they participated in developing is also frequently deleted on the VfD page as well.  This is a pattern I've seen repeated several times, and so much so that I've wondered if there might actually be something that could be clinically diagnosed from a medical standpoint.  I'm serious here too.  The main problem is when these same individuals get involved with active projects others are participating in, which I will admit tends to be rather disruptive.  

::::In this case I say disruptive because they are not following the typical pattern of being a little shy and starting off with just making a few minor changes to gradually gain acceptance in the &quot;community&quot; of content developers.  A more typical Wikibookian will not &quot;rock the boat&quot; from more established users until they have more completely integrated into the community.  Instead, this other type of user I'm mentioning here is so active that from their perspective they are full members of the community in just a few days or weeks, and make big bold changes as if they were around from the very beginning of the project.  They also get very resentful if you try to classify them as 2nd class citizens (even if that was not your intention).  Mind you, a 3rd type of personality is somebody who is a &quot;veteran&quot; wiki user (especially somebody experienced with Wikipedia) and comes in here thinking they know all of the project policies when they really aren't a member of ''this'' community.  That is still something different yet, and can be just as disruptive but in their own unique way.

::::OK, I'm rambling with my thoughts and observations, but the point I'm bring up here is that there are very many personality types that make up Wikibookians, and to condemn them to being &quot;troll&quot; or &quot;not troll&quot; can be difficult to do.  That this is an issue to watch for, I would have to agree.  And that we as admins need to have the tools to help cool off behavior that is disruptive certainly is something that should happen as well.  For myself, I think that protecting a page where edit wars are happening can do more good than performing a user block, as a warning that the issue has gone too far.  It is also less disruptive to the project, but I also know that something of that nature is not always possible to keep everybody from making a big mess.  User blocks are a good tool to help with the moderating process as well... if used in a responsible manner.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I try to get the ball rolling and then see comments like this, and while (at least in this case) they are applicable to certain issues, they don't really make progress. I see debates forming and purposely avoid policy discussions because it becomes a waste of time (and if you notice I have made little to no comments on the new [[WB:WIW]] or [[WB:DM]] because those pages are like black holes for progress nowadays). I ratified [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]] myself and then told people I did it, something that seemed fine (as well as it being a simple policy, even though we might add a little bit to it about study guides that aren't annotated shortly) but that's been it for policy progress in a long time. I guess this goes back to trolling but we can't stop policy progress any longer; let's just get to work and edit something. I want the blocking policy in, something common on Wikimedia wikis, something we shouldn't have real trouble in getting done. I'm tired of writing long talk page responses as well, something I don't have to do but I just want ''something'' that I feel is positive to happen. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== Inactive administrators ==

I'm starting up this discussion area to review the practice of de-admining inactive administrators. Some concerns have been raised about that issue, and almost all of them have been inappropriately made at [[WB:RFA]]. If people want to discuss a change of policy, they can now discuss it right here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:34, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:Furthermore, all users taking part in the discussion are '''expected''' to have read all previous discussion on this matter. There is no purpose in repeating the same statements every six months. Many previous discussions exist at the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archives|old Staff Lounge]] as well as here. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:45, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
::Simple - my views - I would de-admin after 6 months inactivity at the latest '''unless''' a &quot;leave of absence&quot; had been advised (someone traveling, circumstances etc etc) which would allow extended leave (when I would expect no editing).  Personally I will resign any rights I have on any wiki if I am inactive for three months as stated on my RFA etc).  The tools are for people who use them, while they use them.

:::I find that to generally be a good rule of thumb. Six months might be a bit short to some so I like the current plan of one year a little bit more. One year should be enough time for someone to finish up their leave of absence in my opinion, and in one year policies could change significantly enough as well that the user will really need a refresh. I agree that if a user ever permanently leaves, they should renounce their status as a common courtesy to the project. If you don't know how to use the tools, you shouldn't keep them. They are not a trophy but are meant to be used.

Wikibooks is not a job nor a career and we can't expect such kinds of loyalty although a 6 month absense is a long period of no activity.

::::Maybe it is a little too formal, I can agree with that. But what I dont want to see are any objections being ignored because they are put in the wrong place. I'm of the opinion that complaining about a problem is much easier then finding a solution to that problem. Along with that, people who complain about things are less likely to be heard and appreciated then people who actually work to find a solution to it. The best thing that a person can do is create a new unstable version of the policy that reflects their concerns. Talking about how much you dislike a policy in the wrong place looks very much like simple complaining and just doesnt strike me as being particularly constructive. That's just my two cents, but If you really want to change a policy this is the absolute best place to go about doing it.

== Checkuser Legal Issues ==

There was a note posted to Checkuser-l the other day, and I know that not all of our checkusers are members of that list. The WMF has an &quot;Ombudsman&quot; who is in charge of handling and investigating violations of the privacy policy, especially in respects to people with checkuser access. All checkusers should be careful therefore to read and understand the privacy policy so nobody accidentally lands in hot water over it. The link is here:

:http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Ombudsman_commission

Apparently most of the checkusers on the checkuser-l list dont know about this either, so alot of people are reading over those policies very frantically right now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:09, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== stewards ==

Hi guys,

Why is there a (small) list of stewards on this page? Stewards are Wikimedia-wide, and I think it is confusing for new users this way. First there is an intro about administrators who can help, and then first a list of stewards? If you really want to mention some, please to that all down, and explain in short what a steward could be needed for (a desysop decided by the community for instance). Better is to direct to the [[m:RfP|Requests for Permissions]] page on meta. [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 19:13, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

:I shifted the content and made a more clear mention of the roles of these accounts. We like to differentiate Stewards since none of them really have any activity here yet show up in the sysop list and we want to avoid confusion over who to ask for help. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:13, 24 August 2007 (UTC)

*{{support}} '''x 10'''. Please read '''all''' of the above sections before casting a vote, as this issue has been '''heavily''' discussed already and I really hope only new topics will be addressed. Since I don't believe there's anything else to say about this, I feel things should stay just as they are. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:25, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
*{{support}} I'm very happy to see the issue brought to the relevant discussion page so that we can make a concerted effort to address this issue. It has been some time since this was made a policy, and it is high-time it was brought up for reconsideration, to evaluate whether the policy has been useful. That much said, if you consider the admin nomination process, we don't give admin tools to inactive or minimally active users. A user must display a certain level of activity, and activity of a certain type (helpful, maintenance contributions, etc). If activity is a requirement in receiving the tools, I suppose I don't see a reason to differentiate between receiving and keeping the tools: If an admin is inactive, they likely shouldnt have the tools any more then a regular inactive user should have them. Some users, such as [[User:Iamunknown]] and myself (for my bot account) have willfully given up tools because of inactivity. Many users who have been nominated for deadminship and have been contacted, replied that they were happy to return the tools because they were not being used. One user did contest the deadminship, but after the nomination was over, that user returned to inactivity. I am making the assumption that the user in question would not have returned to activity had his tools not been removed. During the Karl Wick nomination, the point was brought up and readily reaffirmed that adminship is not a badge of honor and shouldnt be given to people as an award. However, I see an immediate analogy between giving people the tool as an award, and allowing people to keep them if they arent being used. That is, we can't say that people dont receive them if they havent earned them, and that people can keep them if they aren't continually deserving of them. Either way, it becomes less like tools, and more like a badge of honor, which I think we all have agreed that we want to avoid. I say that I do support the policy of removing unused tools, but I wonder if there could be a &quot;nicer&quot; or &quot;softer&quot; way of doing it then has been done so far (because I feel that the cold manner of the proceedings is what triggers a lot of anger among opponents). Maybe we could petition to give bureaucrats the &quot;de-op&quot; flag, that would enable desysoping to be performed locally, and reduce the need for steward intervention. Doing that would enable more discussion to occur in a desysop nomination, because we would need to worry about confusing the issue for the stewards. Those are my thoughts on the issue. I'm highly interested to see what others have to say about it. If significant support to overturn the policy emerges, I wont stand in the way of it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:15, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
*{{comment}} - I though local bureaucrats could de-sysop people. If they can give the tools, shouldn't they be able to remove them? That seems like something we should definitely change.

:*I believe the developers think there's danger in allowing removal of the tools because it could allow a &quot;mutiny&quot; to happen more easily.

:::Yeah, I think it's an unlikely thing to change. The reason why we would want to have this is so that we wouldnt need the stewards, and we wouldnt need to worry about confusing the stewards on the discussion page. In turn, this would allow us to have more discussions about this subject on the RFA page. If people are willing to keep the conversations here, or in the Reading room, it would be a non-issue. Somehow, I doubt that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:29, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
::::Well, if I understand what you're saying, we will vote for both sysopping and de-sysopping on RFA just like now, but in the future we'll complete the de-sysopping ourselves. That would be fine with me if we actually were given de-sysopping rights of course. I would still want the inactivity clause to be a non-voting issue however, so I don't think any of this is different from current policy besides that we'll de-sysop ourselves. We could always try to get one of use made a Steward, wouldn't bother me to have it. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:43, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
:::::Playing devil's advocate for a minute, what if it was a voting issue, but votes were counted based on their merit as it pertains to the particular candidate, and not based on the disagreement of the entire policy? That is, what if we don't count votes of people who say &quot;I just dont agree with this policy&quot;, and only count votes of people who say &quot;this specific user should keep his tools because...&quot;. Not allowing any discussion has caused some obvious anger at the whole procedure, but allowing discussion quickly degenerates into arguments over this policy and not discussions of the individual candidates (which is where the focus really should be). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:07, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
 reset
If we're not going to get the ability to de-sysop (which I don't really understand) then I'd support merit-based discussion over either voting or applying an arbitrary time limit (though 1 year ''is'' a good ''guideline''). Sysop tools are for users who need them. If you're not using them, you don't need them. I'd also support automatically removing the tools (more-or-less-)immediately if an sysop declares that they're leaving WMF projects and then actually leaves. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:14, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

:I would support Whiteknight's general idea. The way I see it is after a year of inactivity, the user will be nominated for de-adminship. The primary reason, inactivity, will be mentioned as the trigger for de-adminship. Anyone who opposes the de-adminship will have full rights to mention why the user shouldn't lose the tools. What I've described isn't really much different from the current policy. Users can now propose &quot;good reasons&quot; why an admin shouldn't lose the tools. However, I don't see how this will ever be sufficient to stop the de-sysopping. We already have a solid time period proposed that almost everyone agrees with. If a sysop doesn't want the tools, all they have to do is request their removal at Meta.

:On a related note, I don't believe we'll have that many de-sysoppings in the future. Wikibooks was basically abandoned by all the supposed admins (almost all of them never even used any tool yet had problems losing their status) that were here when the project began. They moved onto other things or whatever else, but it left a majority portion of the sysop list useless. Now that almost all of these users have been de-sysopped, the list is full of admins who are almost all quite active and we're in a much better state. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:33, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

*{{comment}} - I've always been a bit ambivalent about this, but it seems to me that performing the desysoppings are pretty much harmless (if someone's not using the tools (or even editing!), they clearly don't need them) and the possibility of lost/sold computers being around or just someone coming around after a long absence and not being aware of policy changes can cause issues (even in my own case, I've been so busy at Wikiversity the past 6 months that I'm feeling a bit behind on what's going on here). The main reason I ''don't'' like the desysopping is that it always ends up causing silly drama, and might not be worth the trouble. Nevertheless, I {{support}} turning off the buttons for people who are apparently long gone. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:48, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

*{{comment}} I'm sick and tired of all this.  I have no problem removing sysop abilities for those who don't want them or have long gone but such requests should still be up for comment and discussion.  Why do we need policies about all this crap?  Just have a vote for each one.  Creating endless policies (which is what Wiki projects seem to be all about) just alienates new users and allows more established users to have a greater say (as they know where to find such policy discussions).  Having a policy on this matter means that newer Wikibooks users have no say because the matter was decided long ago and often by people who have since left the project.  This isn't a Wikibooks thing but rather a Wiki thing as Wikipedia also seems to becoming taken over by a small group of very active administrators and the democractic element seems to be disappearing.  I can't be bothered to vote for this policy but will continue to vote for each request for deadminship that comes up in future.  Stop trying to silence me.

**I'm baffled by this comment. Here is the perfect forum for you to discuss your rationale on the matter, and you don't take it. You want to change the policy? Do it like everybody else tries to. Create a discussion here, post messages on the Reading Room and the bulletin board, and get people involved in the discussion. You talk about how new users aren't being involved in the process, but I feel that your approach to the problem does more to exacerbate that problem then to fix it. How are people supposed to know that an important discussion is taking place if we all just leave short passive-aggressive complaints on various pages? You have the opportunity to discuss the issue and to convince others of the need for change, and you don't take it. I also don't understand how you have the time to post comments about how you disagree with the policy, and how you have time to argue endlessly and angrily when people try to move your comments to a more appropriate location, but you dont have time to vote when the matter actually comes up for discussion. It's akin to saying you don't like how things are, but that you can't be bothered to change them. It's a hypocritical attitude that is the absolute antithesis of the wiki- way of making changes. We arent going to change the policy because we feel sorry that Xania doesnt like it and can't be bothered to change it himself. We will change the policy when Xania takes the floor, convinces us of the merit of his viewpoint, engages the community, and leads the community to change.

== Wheel-warring ==

I want to add a section to this policy to specifically condemn wheel-warring among admins. Admin actions, such as blocking and unblocking, protecting and unprotecting, deleting and undeleting, etc should not be used as part of a wheel war without discussion. One admin should  not undo another admin action without some measure of discussion. If we consider things like the administrator's noticeboard or VFD, most admin actions are made after such discussion anyway, or else they are made in response to a clear need. Either way, they shouldn't be undone without at least some discussion. We tend not to have many of these conflicts around here anyway, so hopefully it's not something we are going to miss, nor a rule that we are going to run afoul of. Here is an idea of what I would like to include:
:''Administrators should never undo actions done by other admins without some amount of discussion first. Undoing another admin's actions without discussion or, preferrably, reaching consensus first is an abuse of administrator tools and is cause to have those tools immediately removed. Administrative actions can always been reconsidered and reexamined over time, but administrative actions should not be reverted in the heat of the moment without proper discussion first.''
I think that an admin who can't be trusted to use the tools cautiously and responsibly really can't be trusted enough to keep the tools, so I advocate rdesysopping admins who abuse them like this. Notice that I have added a moratorium clause, that decisions can be reexamined at a later date, but that reverts should not be made in the heat of the moment. We could likely make this point more explicit, if that would put some fears at ease. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:15, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

:'''Yes, but...''' - There are some times when an undiscussed change to an admin action is legit. The first one that pops to mind is changing a short-term block to a long-term block because another admin discovered that the IP is an open proxy. I suppose it could be argued that the 2nd admin should just let the 1st know and they can redo their own block.
:Take my block of [[User:Flickts|Flickts]] ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Flickts]). How are we to interpret the above if some other admin had come across the unblock request and wanted to grant it? That's undoing one of my admin actions. Should that be discussed first? I guess, but I'd say that the unblock would be relatively uncontroversial and needn't be discussed prior. I'd say that the wording above is overly restrictive in such cases. I'd suggest changing it to &quot;wheel-warring in controversial cases...&quot; but then we run into the problem of &quot;what is a controversial case?&quot; I'll sleep on it and maybe come up with some different wording later.

::Like I said, there is a little bit of tweaking to be done here. I'm arguing the point with Darklama right now on IRC, and he has a million infuriating little examples of instances when what I said above would be bad. The gist of this is that admins shouldn't be engaging in fights using admin tools. Changes or modifications to an admin action that are not aggressive, and that are properly considered shouldn't fall under this category. If an admin is warring using admin tools, that's a problem and we need to be vigilant against that. Admins making changes to other people's actions to help them, or to make things better in general should obviously be out of the scope of this.

::Mike, you might end up horrified over the next few weeks, because ''real'' wheel wars have happened on wb before, and might happen again soon.

:::To be fair, I doubt (hope) that things won't get so bad again. My point with this is that I want to make it clear that wheel-warring (which is different from undoing an admin action, or modifying an admin action with justification and support) is really unacceptable. We shouldn't just request that admins act civily, we should require it. If an admin can't use the tools properly and respectfully, they shouldnt be admins. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:09, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

::I don't think we need an explicit policy for this. Changes can be quickly reverted and if they continue to be reverted then the best method is to raise the issue with those concerned or if absolutely necessary vote for a desysopping. Where are any examples of this problem happening (except for the situation with Panic which was almost a year ago). We shouldn't create policies for all possibilities as this creates too much beaurocracy of which there seems to be too much already. Also there are many situations where changes need to be made for example if an admin blocks a user but another thinks the offence was minor (sometimes what appears to be vandalism actually isn't when you read the whole page), extending blocks or undeleting images.

:::I don't really think it creates any additional bureaucracy, it just makes more explicit a point about civility that people take for granted. In the event of a wheel war, if we don't have this kind of policy, there will just be de-sysop nominations instead, which are slower and will just create more anger. The old panic stuff is water under the bridge at this point, but a lot of ugly things came out then that we should take some precautions to prevent in the future. There is no reason to assume that kind of uglyness can't come back out again. If people don't respect process and go &quot;rogue&quot; or &quot;vigilante&quot; or whatever, they are going to be de-sysopped one way or another. If it happens in the future, i just don't want anybody acting surprised. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:23, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

== CheckUser section ==

Being the son of an editor, there are times that I find myself horrified by something in print, and I'm afraid that this is one of those times. If I were called on to grade the CheckUser section, it would get very low marks for grammar and sentence structure. As it is an official policy, I don't feel that I should edit it; yet, as my changes would not have any real effect on the meaning, I don't think it belongs in the unstable branch either. So, I'm going to drop my proposed rewrite of this section here on the discussion page, where it can be discussed with, hopefully, less acrimony and urgency.

:CheckUser rights allow an Administrator additional tools for fighting vandalism. The CheckUser tools allow an Administrator to see a registered user's IP address, in order to identify policy offenders.

:CheckUser rights can be requested, or an Administrator may be nominated to receive them, on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. As with Administrator and Bureaucrat votes, a CheckUser candidate must accept the nomination explicitly for the vote to continue.

:CheckUser rights can only be granted by the stewards at Meta, and the stewards may not be contacted to grant these rights if consensus has not been reached at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. The stewards may impose additional restrictions on the creation of CheckUsers, which Wikibooks policy has no say over.

:Prospective CheckUser candidates must currently be Administrators; regular users are not eligible to gain CheckUser rights. There is no explicit requirement on the number of contributions, or activity here at Wikibooks, but it is expected that a CheckUser candidate will be a noted active vandalism fighter.

I would also add &quot;One of these is the requirement (current at this writing) that there must be 25 votes of support, in addition to consensus support, for the candidate.&quot; at the end of the third paragraph, but that changes meaning and so opens a whole other can of worms.

== Extraneous sections ==

[[Wikibooks:Protected page]] covers page protection, [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] covers deletions/undeletions, and eventually [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]] could cover blocks as an approved policy.  Sections &quot;Blocking users&quot; through &quot;Protecting Pages&quot; are redundant with these other pages and as a result both pages have to be checked to ensure there are no conflicting statements.  Certainly the blocking section shouldn't be removed until the respective standalone page is approved.  My ''opinion'' is that the page is already pushing it with definitions of bureaucrats and CheckUsers on a page with &quot;administrators&quot; as the title, but it's going too far as to try to include every single policy within itself that applies to administrators.  For clear separation, it ought to simply link to the respective policies. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:07, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

== adminstats ==

Although the adminstats tool is linked from [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}#Expectations]], it appears not to reflect the current configuration of Wikibooks.  It counts [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=import}} importing], and doesn't count [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=stable}} changing page stabilization settings].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:24, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

:Imports used to be only done by administrators.  This tool is used for multiple wikis.  Wikibooks is unique in that it grants the ability to import to anyone besides admins.  I don't know of any other wiki that does that.  Wikibooks is also a rarity in that it has flagged revisions, more so with a configuration in which the default page state isn't acceptable for a significant portion of the pages.  Thus it's likely that the output on that page will not be changed to reflect this. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:40, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

:You can always put our 10 administrators into [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/yaec.php Yet Another Edit Counter] which shows all the actions including page stabilisation. Irritating to do them one at a time but not too onerous I guess. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:45, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

::The bad thing about that one is that you can't limit it to a period of time like the other tool, which the link on the content page sets to a year (the period required for inactivity).  It also seems to be missing labels for some of the log actions (I see nine missing for [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/yaec.php?user=Adrignola&amp;wiki=enwikibooks_p mine]). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:57, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

::Um, Adrignola, the Chinese Wikibooks has given out importer to non-admins before we did. :) Does any Wikibookian know how to program a tool to count admin actions?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Romanticism was a secular and intellectual movement in the history of ideas that originated in late 18th century Western Europe. It followed the Enlightenment period and was in part inspired by a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the previous period, as well as a reaction against the rationalization of nature by the Enlightenment: Romanticism is an aspect of what has been called the Counter-Enlightenment. It stressed strong emotion (which now might include trepidation, awe, and horror as aesthetic experiences), legitimized the individual imagination as a critical authority (which permitted freedom within or from classical notions of form in art), and overturned some previous social conventions. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability in the representation of its ideas.

Romanticism stressed the awe of &quot;nature&quot; in art and language and the experience of sublimity through a connection with nature. An influence upon the Romantic movement by the ideologies and events of the French Revolution is thought to have characterized the movement. Romanticism is also noted for its elevation of the achievements of what it perceived as misunderstood heroic individuals and artists that altered society altogether.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Atlantis is an ancient mythical island, whose existence and location have never been confirmed. The first ''known'' references to Atlantis are from the classical Greek philosopher Plato, who said it was engulfed by the ocean as the result of an earthquake 9,000 years before his own time. Plato claimed it was somewhere outside the Pillars of Hercules, now known as the Strait of Gibraltar. While there are many theories about Atlantis, nearly all serious research concludes that Atlantis never existed as Plato described it, although elements of his story may have been drawn from real events.

By clicking &quot;Save page&quot; you are indicating you grant the Wikimedia Foundation a license to use your work under terms of the above bolded text. If you do not agree with these terms, then do not submit your work to this website.

== Publication by third parties ==

You may use the same title as the Wikibooks book and/or module(s) but trademark law prevents you from advertising the Wikibooks or Wikimedia names without our written permission. This does not prevent you from giving either Wikibooks or Wikimedia credit for the work by name; as a matter of fact we very much appreciate all the credit we can get (this is a separate issue from author credit; see below). But it does legally prevent you from leading your readers to believe that your version of our work is in fact an official Wikibooks or Wikimedia publication. See below for more.

===Use on the Internet===
For specifics read: [[GNU Free Documentation License]]
#Mention Wikibooks as the source (not mandatory; but appreciated) 
#Provide a functional link back to the Wikibooks book or Wikibooks module  (this satisfies the author credit requirement of our license)
#State that the text is available under the GNU Free Documentation License 
#Link to a copy of the GNU FDL license (preferably stored on your own server).
#Your version of the text must be machine readable (meaning you cannot prevent others from copying the text)

===Use in hardcopy===
For specifics read: [[GNU Free Documentation License]]
#Mention Wikibooks as the source (not mandatory; but appreciated)
#Give credit to at least 5 authors listed on the &quot;Authors&quot; page of whatever book you are re-publishing (if fewer than 5 then include all).
#State that the text is available under the GNU Free Documentation License on at least one page of the book with the above bolded copyright notice.
#A full copy of the license needs to be included with the printed book.
#Whenever more than 100 copies are made, you must (choose one): 
##Provide a floopy disk, CD, DVD or other computer media with the entire content of the book in machine readable text.  
##Provide a network link to a website where the machine readable text can be obtained (this link must remain active for at least one year after publication of the hardcopy; if all you are doing is making an exact copy of a Wikibooks book, then you may use the [[w:URL|URL]] of the corresponding Wikibooks book index page).

==Copyright infringements==
If you are the owner of content that is being used on Wikibooks without your permission, then please contact our [[Wikibooks:Designated agent|Designated agent]] (see below) to have it permanently removed (you may blank the page but the text will still be in the page history). You may also place the module title of the offending page on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. We will, of course, need some evidence to support your claim of ownership.  

If you suspect that content on a particular module contains a copyright infringement, then you may add {{tlx|copyvio|&lt;web page or source containing contents that was copied&gt;}} to the top of the page. This will produce the following content:

{{copyvio|&lt;web page or source containing contents that was copied&gt;|example=yes}}

In addition, this template will automatically add the violating page to [[:Category:Copyright violations]] which will be reviewed by administrators at Wikibooks.

== Fair Use Material ==

In some situations you may encounter material on Wikibooks that has been added because using it is considered to be Fair Use. The restricted sub-set of fair-use material should be legal to reproduce in most countries around the world, but you should check with expert legal opinion if you plan to commercially reproduce this sort of content, or if you plan on distributing a large number of copies of any Wikibooks content that uses this sort of material.  All material that is being used under fair-use guidelines should be clearly identified as such, either through an image copyright identification tag or within the Wikibook itself. Fair Use of both text and images is a legal grey area where you must use judgment and personal opinion as to if something qualifies as fair-use or not.

=== What is Fair Use ===

Generally the term ''fair use'' applies to personal use of copyrighted material.  One common example of fair use is to be able to copy music on a vinyl album or compact disc onto your home computer or portable MP3 player.  This still doesn't give you permission to share these computer files with your friends, however.

Instructors are also given special permission to copy some materials in limited quantities for direct instructional purposes.  This is known as '''educational fair use''' and should not be an excuse for material used on Wikibooks.

=== Problems with Fair use ===

We suggest that you avoid fair use materials and use them only if you can find a good reason and cannot substitute them. Generally, more and more media is available at [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], which is a common repository of free media for all Wikimedia Projects and use of Commons should be a normal procedure. Wikimedia Commons does not permit fair use images within their collection.

Fair use law is exclusive to United States and countries with similar law systems. In most of the European countries works that fall into fair use in the US cannot be used at all or the number of conditions when fair use applies is substantially smaller. This is sometimes called ''fair dealing'' where scholarly use of copyrighted material may be used in limited situations.  When you use fair use images in your book, many people from other countries won't be able to print it. Most of the purposes listed below as acceptable according to the Wikibooks narrower standard may be accepted in many more countries than solely the US, but you should still be aware of further restrictions.  Get to know the laws governing fair use or fair dealing within your country if you use content like this or try to reproduce Wikibooks content in general.

=== What is Permitted on Wikibooks ===

To simplify the process of trying to determine if something qualifies as fair-use here on Wikibooks, '''only content which meets the following criteria will be allowed to stay on Wikibooks'''.  We are not lawyers here and are not prepared to stay on the leading edge of legal theories and the latest court judgments and case law.  The only real alternative is to simply ban fair use content on Wikibooks altogether, which has been done for some Wikimedia projects due to the complex issues involved.

==== Fair Use Text ====

Permitted Fair Use on Wikibooks for Text:

*'''Textual Excerpts'''
*:Very short excerpts from a much larger work, usually just a few words or a single sentence or two.  Scholarly citations of the source of that text is especially encouraged.

==== Fair Use Images ====

Permitted Fair Use on Wikibooks for Images:

* '''Coat of Arms, Flags, Seals, etc. of administrative entities, political authorities and institutions'''
*:These items are often protected by Crown Copyright or other similar legal protections, where copyright does not expire. As with company logos, it should be in some text that is specifically about the entity represented by the seal, or the seal itself. While this may seem like a violation of NPOV guidelines, you should be respectful when dealing with official symbols of various governments and not desecrate these symbols or use them in irreverent manners. Violating this standard is not only unethical, but can get you arrested even by countries other than the ones which these official symbols represent.
* '''Coins, Banknotes, Stamps'''
*:These images should also be resized, partially covered, or otherwise changed to avoid counterfeiting laws. Adding text over the top of the image like ''Sample'' or ''Copy'' may be useful, or if you are pointing out features of the money, using arrows within the image that would otherwise ruin its value as legal tender may also be acceptable. Displaying stamps is often done by graphically &quot;cancelling&quot; the image with usually a solid black line across the denomination value of the stamp or some other simple mark that still leaves most of the image available for viewing.
* '''Company Logos and trademarks'''
*:Logos are permissible only for modules that are specifically about the company or product whose trademark is being used.  Under no condition should endorsement be implied by the use of the logo, which would be an inappropriate use.  A formal disclaimer is suggested within the text (perhaps as a footnote) to acknowledge the appropriate owner of the trademark.
* '''Software Screenshots'''
*:It is important that these screen shots be of significantly lower resolution than would be found on the computer screen (10% of the original pixel size or even considerably less) and that the screen capture is there to illustrate a specific point you are trying to make within the text you are writing.  Rather than a full screen capture, you may even want to only display a small portion of the screen instead.  Using these screen shots should not be done for decorative purposes simply to have some graphical elements in the content of the Wikibook.

=== What is not accepted on Wikibooks ===

* Large amount of text copied from other websites.
* Images used for decorative purpose.
* Parody applications of fair use.  While funny and considered legal, fiction is not appropriate for Wikibooks as defined in [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].  You may instead want to consider the [[uncyclopedia:Main Page|Uncyclopedia]] for content like this.

You can use images in a Wikibook when they are uploaded to English Wikibooks or to [[Commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]. You can upload new images to Wikibooks, but we will delete unlicensed images. This policy explains how.

== Image upload policy ==
[[Image:Roasted coffee beans.jpg|thumb|right|Click the image to view its image description page, which includes copyright information.]]
To use an image, you must first upload the file to English Wikibooks '''or''' to [[Commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]. If you have an image file with a [[Commons:Licensing|free licence that is acceptable to Wikimedia Commons]], you can upload it to either place, but we strongly recommend that you upload it to Commons so that other wikimedia projects may use it if they wish. If it a fair use image (see above), you can only upload the image to Wikibooks. Otherwise, you cannot use the image.

=== Before you upload an image ===

Wikimedia Commons contains many media files and so the image you want to use may already have been uploaded. Try searching Commons before you upload any files.

=== File types ===

There are many acceptable [[Commons:file types|file types]], but the most common are GIF, PNG, JPG, and SVG. The filename should end in &quot;.gif&quot;, &quot;.png&quot;, &quot;.jpg&quot;, or &quot;.svg&quot; respectively. The server automatically renders SVG images into PNG; thus, you can upload SVG images without requiring your readers to add SVG support to their browser.

=== Acceptable licences ===

# Ensure the file licence is a '''free licence''' compatible with the [[Commons:Licensing|Wikimedia Commons' rules]] '''or''' that '''fair use''' applies.
#* The [[w:Creative Commons License|Creative Commons]] Attribution licences, the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licences, the [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation Licence]] and the [[w:Free Art License|Free Art Licence]] are examples of acceptable licences.

      <comment>/* Types of Noise */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

This page is going to talk about the effect of noise on transmission systems.

==Types of Noise==

{{Wikipedia|Electronic_noise}}

Most man made electro-magnetic noise occurs at frequencies below 500 MHz. The most significant of these include:

::• Hydro lines
::• Ignition systems
::• Fluorescent lights
::• Electric motors

Therefore deep space networks are placed out in the desert, far from these sources of interference.

There are also a wide range of natural noise sources which cannot be so easily avoided, namely:

::•''Atmospheric noise'' - lighting &lt; 20 MHz
::•''Solar noise'' - sun - 11 year sunspot cycle
::•''Cosmic noise'' - 8 MHz to 1.5 GHz
::•''Thermal or Johnson noise''. Due to free electrons striking vibrating ions.
::•''White noise'' - white noise has a constant spectral density over a specified range of frequencies. Johnson noise is an example of white noise.
::•''Gaussian noise'' - Gaussian noise is completely random in nature however, the probability of any particular amplitude value follows the normal distribution curve. Johnson noise is Gaussian in nature.
::•''Shot noise'' - bipolar transistors
::::&lt;math&gt;i_n  = \sqrt {2qI_{dc} \Delta f} &lt;/math&gt;
::::where ''q'' = electron charge 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs
::•''Excess noise, flicker, 1/f, and pink noise'' &lt; 1 KHz are Inversely proportional to frequency and directly proportional to temperature and dc current
::•''Transit time noise'' - occurs when the electron transit time across a junction is the same period as the signal.

Of these, only Johnson noise can be readily analysed and compensated for. The noise power is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;P_n  = kTB&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

::''k''  = Boltzman's constant (1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K)
::T = temperature in degrees Kelvin
::B = bandwidth in Hz

This equation applies to copper wire wound resistors, but is close enough to be used for all resistors. Maximum power transfer occurs when the source and load impedance are equal.

===Combining Noise Voltages===

The instantaneous value of two noise voltages is simply the sum of their individual values at the same instant.

::&lt;math&gt;v_{total\;inst}  = v_{1\;inst}  + v_{2\;inst} &lt;/math&gt;

This result is readily observable on an oscilloscope. However, it is not particularly helpful, since it does not result in a single stable numerical value such as one measured by a voltmeter.

If the two voltages are coherent [K = 1], then the total rms voltage value is the sum of the individual rms voltage values.

::&lt;math&gt;v_{total\;rms}  = v_{1\;rms}  + v_{2\;rms} &lt;/math&gt;

If the two signals are completely random with respect to each other [K = 0], such as Johnson noise sources, the total power is the sum of all of the individual powers:

::&lt;math&gt;P_{total\;random\;noise}  = P_{n1\;random}  + P_{n2\;random} &lt;/math&gt;

A Johnson noise of power ''P = kTB'', can be thought of as a noise voltage applied through a resistor, Thevenin equivalent.

::::[[Image:noise source.gif]]

An example of such a noise source may be a cable or transmission line. The amount of noise power transferred from the source to a load, such as an amplifier input, is a function of the source and load impedances.

::[[Image:noise circuit.gif]]

If the load impedance is 0 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, no power is transferred to it since the voltage is zero. If the load has infinite input impedance, again no power is transferred to it since there is no current. Maximum power transfer occurs when the source and load impedances are equal.

::&lt;math&gt;P_{L\;\max }  = \frac{{e_s^2 }}{{4R_s }}&lt;/math&gt;

The rms noise voltage at maximum power transfer is:

::&lt;math&gt;e_n  = \sqrt {4RP}  = \sqrt {4RkTB} &lt;/math&gt;

::[[Image:matched thermal noise.gif]]

Observe what happens if the noise resistance is resolved into two components:

::&lt;math&gt;e_n^2  = 4RkTB = 4\left( {R_1  + R_2 } \right)kTB = e_{n1}^2  + e_{n2}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

From this we observe that random noise resistance can be added directly, but random noise voltages add vectorially:

::[[Image:vector addition.gif]]

If the noise sources are not quite random, and there is some correlation between them [0 &lt; K &lt; 1], the combined result is not so easy to calculate:

::&lt;math&gt;P_{Total\;\left( {{\rm{not }}\;{\rm{quite}}\;{\rm{ random}}} \right)}  = \frac{{E_1^2  + E_2^2  + 2KE_1 E_2 }}{{R_0 }} = P_1  + P_2  = 2K\sqrt {P_1  + P_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

::where

::''K'' = correlation [0 &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; ''K'' &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; 1]
::''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = reference impedance

== Noise Temperature ==

The amount of noise in a given transmission medium can be equated to thermal noise. Thermal noise is well-studied, so it makes good sense to reuse the same equations when possible. To this end, we can say that any amount of radiated noise can be approximated by thermal noise with a given '''effective temperature'''. Effective temperature is measured in Kelvin. Effective temperature is frequently compared to the '''standard temperature''', &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt;, which is 290 Kelvin.

In microwave applications, it is difficult to speak in terms of currents and voltages since the signals are more aptly described by field equations. Therefore, temperature is used to characterize noise. The total noise temperature is equal to the sum of all the individual noise temperatures.

== Noise Figure ==

{{Wikipedia|Noise_figure}}

The terms used to quantify noise can be somewhat confusing but the key definitions are:

::'''Signal to noise ratio''': It is either unitless or specified in dB. The S/N ratio may be specified anywhere within a system.

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{S}{N} = \frac{{{\rm{signal}}\;{\rm{power}}}}{{{\rm{noise}}\;{\rm{power}}}} = \frac{{P_s }}{{P_n }}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( {\frac{S}{N}} \right)_{dB}  = 10\log \frac{{P_s }}{{P_n }}&lt;/math&gt;

::'''Noise Factor (or Noise Ratio)''': &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{{\left( {\frac{S}{N}} \right)_{in} }}{{\left( {\frac{S}{N}} \right)_{out} }}&lt;/math&gt; (unit less)

::'''Noise Figure''': &lt;math&gt;NF = 10\log F = SNR_{in}  - SNR_{out} &lt;/math&gt; dB

This parameter is specified in all high performance amplifiers and is measure of how much noise the amplifier itself contributes to the total noise. In a perfect amplifier or system, ''NF'' = 0 dB. This discussion does not take into account any noise reduction techniques such as filtering or dynamic emphasis.

::::[[Image:g.gif]]

===Friiss' Formula &amp; Amplifier Cascades===

It is interesting to examine an amplifier cascade to see how noise builds up in a large communication system.

::&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{{\left( {\frac{S}{N}} \right)_{in} }}{{\left( {\frac{S}{N}} \right)_{out} }} = \frac{{S_{in} }}{{N_{in} }} \times \frac{{N_{out} }}{{S_{out} }}&lt;/math&gt;


Amplifier gain can be defined as: &lt;math&gt;G = \frac{{S_{out} }}{{S_{in} }}&lt;/math&gt;

::::[[Image:g2.gif]]


::Therefore the output signal power is: &lt;math&gt;S_{out}  = GS_{in}&lt;/math&gt;

::and the noise factor (ratio) can be rewritten as: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{{S_{in} }}{{N_{in} }} \times \frac{{N_{out} }}{{GS_{in} }} = \frac{{N_{out} }}{{GN_{in} }}&lt;/math&gt;


::The output noise power can now be written: &lt;math&gt;N_{out}  = FGN_{in} &lt;/math&gt;


From this we observe that the input noise is increased by the noise ratio and amplifier gain as it passes through the amplifier. A noiseless amplifier would have a noise ratio (factor) of 1 or noise figure of 0 dB. In this case, the input noise would only be amplified by the gain since the amplifier would not contribute noise.


::The minimum noise that can enter any system is the Johnson Noise: 

::::&lt;math&gt;N_{in\left( {{\rm{minimum}}} \right)}  = kTB&lt;/math&gt;


::Therefore the minimum noise that can appear at the output of any amplifier is:

::::&lt;math&gt;N_{out\left( {{\rm{minimum}}} \right)}  = FGkTB&lt;/math&gt;


::The output noise of a perfect amplifier would be (''F'' = 1):

::::&lt;math&gt;N_{out\left( {{\rm{perfect}}} \right)}  = GkTB&lt;/math&gt;


::The difference between these two values is the noised created (added) by the amplifier itself:

::::&lt;math&gt;N_{out\left( {{\rm{added}}} \right)}  = N_{out\left( {{\rm{minimum}}} \right)}  - N_{out\left( {{\rm{perfect}}} \right)}  = FGkTB - GkTB = \left( {F - 1} \right)GkTB&lt;/math&gt;

::This is the additional (created) noise, appearing at the output. 


'''The total noise out of the amplifier is then given by:'''

::::&lt;math&gt;N_{total}  = N_{out\left( {{\rm{perfect}}} \right)}  + N_{out\left( {{\rm{added}}} \right)}  = GkTB + \left( {F - 1} \right)GkTB&lt;/math&gt;


If a second amplifier were added in series, the total output noise would consist the first stage noise amplified by the second stage gain, plus the additional noise of the second amplifier:

::::&lt;math&gt;N_{total}  = G_1 G_2 kTB + \left( {F_1  - 1} \right)G_1 G_2 kTB + \left( {F_2  - 1} \right)G_2 kTB&lt;/math&gt;


::If we divide both sides of this expression by the common term: &lt;math&gt;G_1 G_2 kTB&lt;/math&gt;

::we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{N_{total} }}{{G_1 G_2 kTB}} = \frac{{G_1 G_2 kTB + \left( {F_1  - 1} \right)G_1 G_2 kTB + \left( {F_2  - 1} \right)G_2 kTB}}{{G_1 G_2 kTB}}&lt;/math&gt;

::Recall: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{{N_{out} }}{{GN_{in} }} = \frac{{N_{total} }}{{G_1 G_2 kTB}}&lt;/math&gt;

::Then: &lt;math&gt;F_{overall}  = F_1  + \frac{{F_2  - 1}}{{G_1 }}&lt;/math&gt;


This process can be extended to include more amplifiers in cascade to arrive at:

:'''Friiss' Formula''' 

::::&lt;math&gt;F = F_1  + \frac{{F_2  - 1}}{{G_1 }} + \frac{{F_3  - 1}}{{G_1 G_2 }} +   &lt;/math&gt;


This equation shows that the overall system noise figure is largely determined by the noise figure of the first stage in a cascade since the noise contribution of any stage is divided by the gains of the preceding stages. This is why the 1st stage in any communication system should be an LNA (low noise amplifier).

== Receiver Sensitivity ==

In a given bandwidth, W, we can show that the noise power N equals:

:&lt;math&gt;N = F(kT_0)W&lt;/math&gt;

From N, we can show that the sensitivity of the receiver is equal to 

:&lt;math&gt;SNR \times N&lt;/math&gt;

A lot of programming is math. Don't let this scare you: a lot of the math is simple, but it's still math. In this section, we will look at doing some basic math (the same stuff you learned in the 3rd grade) and manipulating numbers.

==Equation Setup==
In QBasic an equation has a basic setup a right side and a left side. For instance X=5, as you can probably figure out, this sets the variable X to 5. But we can use variables on the right side too. Y=X*10 would set Y equal to 10 times X, in this situation, 50. In this next program I will show several equations to give you a feel for math.

==7MATH.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 
 'Set a-d to initial values
 a = 10
 b = 6
 c = 3.1415
 d = 3.333333
 
 e = a + b
 PRINT a; &quot;+&quot;; b; &quot;=&quot;; e
 
 f = c * d
 PRINT c; &quot;*&quot;; d; &quot;=&quot;; f
 
 g = b - c
 PRINT b; &quot;-&quot;; c; &quot;=&quot;; g
 
 h = b / d
 PRINT b; &quot;/&quot;; d; &quot;=&quot;; h
 
 i = INT(d)
 PRINT &quot;Remove the decimal from &quot;; d; &quot;=&quot;; i
&lt;/source&gt;

==Understanding 7MATH.BAS==
The most important thing you can take away from this is the setup for math equations. I think you can figure out what all the symbols are and what they do, but QBasic is picky about equations. For 'e=a+b', if you try 'a+b=e' it will not work. 
The final thing I would like to address in 7MATH.BAS is the INT() function. As far as vocabulary, a function is something that takes in a piece of information and gives you another piece of information back. So PRINT, was a statement, and INT() is a function. The INT() function takes a number and truncates it's decimal, it does not round. So INT(5.1) is 5 and INT(5.999) is still 5. If you want to round a number use CINT().

==8MATH.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 INPUT &quot;Enter a number: &quot;, x
 PRINT
 
 x = x + 5
 PRINT &quot;X is now: &quot;; x
 
 x = x * x
 PRINT &quot;X is now: &quot;; x
 
 x = x / 5
 PRINT &quot;X is now: &quot;; x
 
 x = x - 4
 PRINT &quot;X is now: &quot;; x
 
 x = x / x
 PRINT &quot;X should be 1: &quot;; x
&lt;/source&gt;

==Understanding 8MATH.BAS==
8MATH.BAS shows one simple concept that is very important in programming, but impossible in math. The way that the computer calculates the equation is it does all the math on the right side of the equation and then sticks it in the variable on the left side. So the equation x=x+5 makes perfect sense, unlike math where it is a contradiction. Reassigning a value to a variable based on it's current value is common and a good way to keep the number of variables down.

==9TIP.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 INPUT &quot;How much is your bill: &quot;, bill
 INPUT &quot;What percent tip do you want to give: &quot;, tip
 
 tip = tip / 100   'change percent to decimal
 tip = tip * bill  'change decimal to money
 
 PRINT
 PRINT &quot;The tip is&quot;; tip; &quot;$.&quot;
 PRINT &quot;Pay&quot;; tip + bill; &quot;$ total.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Tip Calculator==
9TIP.BAS calculates your tip and total bill from the bill and percent tip you wish to give. The first three lines clear the screen and get the information from the user. The fifth line changes the tip from a percent to the correct decimal by dividing by 100 (ex. 20%=.2 because 20/100=.2) the next line takes that percent and turns it into a dollar value by multiplying the decimal value by the bill. So if your bill is $20.00 and you leave a 20% tip, it multiplies 20*.2 which is 4 or $4.00. The last three lines format the output.&lt;br&gt;
This is a good example of a complete program. It collects information from the user, it processes the information and it gives the user feedback. Also, the middle section of the program is a good example of variable conservation. This is subject that will take some practice to get used to. In writing a program, if you use too many variables, it will become difficult to keep track of all of them. If you try and conserve too much, you code may become difficult to understand.

You may notice that the program may print more than two decimal places if you enter a bill that is not an exact dollar value.  As an exercise, try modifying the program so that it only displays two decimal places - you can use the &lt;code&gt;CINT()&lt;/code&gt; function or any other rounding method you intend to use.

==10OROP.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 'ORder of OPerations
 CLS
 a = 15
 b = 10
 c = 12.2
 d = 1.618
 
 PRINT a * b + c   'these two are different
 PRINT a * (b + c)
 
 PRINT
 
 PRINT b - c / d   'these two are different
 PRINT (b - c) / d
 
 PRINT
 
 PRINT a * b - c * d / a + d   'these two are the same
 PRINT (a * b) - ((c * d) / a) + d
&lt;/source&gt;

==Parentheses and Order of Operations==
10OROP.BAS is an example of order of operations and how parentheses can be used to manipulate it. I do not want to go into an indepth explanation of the order of operations here. The best advice I can give is unless you are sure of the order of operations, use parentheses to make sure the equation works how you want. All you need to know about parentheses is that the deepest nested parentheses calculate first. If you wish to know more, there are plenty of algebra resources available. On that note, you may wish to brush up on algebra. While it is not necessary for programming, it can help make programming easier and it can allow you to create more advanced programs.

==Random Numbers==
Though we will not go into their use until the next section, I would like to discuss the generation of random numbers. QBasic has a random number statement, RND, that generates a random decimal between 0 and 1. You can think of it as a random percent. At first, this may seem like an odd way to generate random numbers. However, with a little math it is very easy to manipulate this to provide numbers in whatever range you want.&lt;BR&gt;
The first step is to multiply RND by a number (the range you want). For instance 'RND*10'. This will return random numbers (decimal numbers) between 0 and 10(both included). So, to pick a random number between zero and ten we would say '(RND*10)'

==11RND.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 RANDOMIZE TIMER
 
 PRINT &quot;Random number from 0-9:&quot;; RND * 10
 PRINT
 
 PRINT &quot;Random number from 1-10:&quot;; (RND * 10) + 1
 PRINT
 
 PRINT &quot;Random integer from 1-10:&quot;; INT(RND * 10) + 1
 PRINT
 
 PRINT &quot;Random even integer from 50-100:&quot;; INT(RND * 25) * 2 + 50
&lt;/source&gt;

==More on RND==
A few notes on 11RND.BAS, the second line, RANDOMIZE TIMER, sets it so that the computer uses the current time to pick random number. If you don't do this, it picks the same random number every time (try it, write a one line program, PRINT RND, and run it over and over, your screen will fill up with the same number) this can prove useful for some applications, but not most. Stick RANDOMIZE TIMER in at the top of all your programs that use the RND statement and they will be far less predictable. This program just show some ways to choose what you want from your random number generator. The last line shows that you can be very specific in what you get. Make sure to run this program several times to see the different results.

This page is all about '''Space-Division Multiplexing''' (SDM).

* What is SDM: When we want to transmit multiple messages, the goal is maximum reuse of the given resources: time and frequency. Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), operates by dividing the time up into time slices, so that the available time can be reused. Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM), operates by dividing up the frequency into transmission bands, so that the frequency spectrum can be reused. However, if we remember our work with directional antennas, we can actually reuse both time and frequency, by transmitting our information along parallel channels. This is known as '''Space-Division Multiplexing'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi - This recipe doesn't seem to be for [plain] chocolate fudge, as it involves marshmallow cream (which isn't actually available outside of the US).  Traditional fudge is just made from milk and chocolate and stuff.  Perhaps it could be renamed Marshmallow fudge?

== Assembly for beginners ==

This book takes the opposite approach to teaching assembly by assuming the reader doesn't know anything about programming. It tries to make it as easy as possible to learn x86 assembly. To be useful to as many people as possible, this tutorial will assume that you're running Windows (2000 or higher.)

== x86 means: ==

x86 is a family of 32-bit processors which includes the 386, 486, Pentium (586), Pentium Pro (686), Pentium 2, 3, 4, as well as all AMD processors such as the Duron and Athlon XP. This tutorial assumes that you have a 586 or higher processor.

== Binary and hex ==

When programming assembly, binary and hexadecimal numbers are often used in place of their base 10 counterparts. There are many other pages on the web which cover this subject in great detail.

== Hands on experiment ==

Go to start&gt;run and type '''cmd.exe'''

This will send you into the windows command prompt, from here type '''debug''' and press enter then type '''r''' and press enter. 

For now let's just explain what the lines a-dx=0000 mean, these are general purpose registers, and note that the 0000 is hexadicimal, not decimal or binary. 

(place holder)

type '''a''' then enter

type mov ax,100 then enter twice

type t

you will notice that AX=0000 has now changed to AX=0100, not a whole lot of interesting stuff going on there. the '''mov''' instruction moves the second value into the first thing you give it. try this

a

mov bx,ax (enter twice)

t

note that bx now has the same value as ax, the value of ax was moved or copied into bx.

the commands '''add''' and '''sub''' work about the same and you can imagine what they do. You might be wondering what happens when you add 1 to FFFF, go ahead and try it just goes to zero, 2+FFFF=1, etc. same for subtracting.

mov ax,FFFF

add ax,1

-t

AX=0000

Also the registers can be split by changing the &quot;x&quot; in ax,bx,etc... to '''l''' or '''h''', you can enter a two digit hexadecimal number, h is two high digits, l is two low digits. h would go on the left, l on the right.

mov ah,FF

add ah,2

t

AX=0100

note that only the first two decimals were changed.

== To go any further ==

Well I don't really know how to do much more of this and you may have notice that the windows command line doesn't work so well and doesn't always give you what you think the answer should be. since all tutorials are outdated and windows is said to be horible for assembly programming someone needs to contribute a a better tutorial with an instruction on how to set up an emulation of a good operating system for assembly.</text>

      <comment>/* Differential Equations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Differential equations are all made up of certain components, without which they would not be differential equations. In working with a differential equation, we usually have the objective of ''solving'' the differential equation. A solution in this context is a new function with all the derivatives gone. If this is impossible, we go for a numerical solution.

==Differential Equations==
The first and most basic example of a differential equation is the one we are already familar with from calculus.  That is
:&lt;math&gt;y'(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
In this case we know how to solve for y (eliminate the derivative) by integrating ''f''.  So we know that 
:&lt;math&gt;y(x)=\int_{a}^x f(x)\,dx+c.&lt;/math&gt;  

Recall from the fundamental theorem of calculus that &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^x f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; is an anti-derivative for ''f''(''x'') for any choice of ''a''.  Notice that there is an arbitrary constant ''c'' and so we get a family of solutions, one for each choice of ''c''.  Often in the study in the book we will encounter ''initial value problems''.  These are problems where we are asked to find a solution to an ordinary differential equation that passes through some initial point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the independent and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the dependent variable. To find which solution passes through this point, one simply plugs ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  into the equation for ''x'' and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in for ''y''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  This allows us to make a specfic choice for ''c'' which normally would be arbitrary.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}y_0&amp;=\int_a^{x_0} f(x)\,dx+c\\ c&amp;=y_0-\int_a^{x_0}f(x)\,dx\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
If we substitute this choice for ''c'' into the expression for ''y'' we find that:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}y(x)&amp;=\int_a^x f(x)\,dx+y_0-\int_a^{x_0}f(x)\,dx\\&amp;=y_0+\int_{x_0}^x f(x)\,dx\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Notice this is really a statement of the fundamental theorem calculus.
 
{{TextBox|1=
;Definition:

An ''n''-th order ordinary differential equation is an equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;F(y^{(n)},y^{(n-1)}, \ldots, y, x)=0&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''F'' is a function of ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 variables that is not constant with respect to its first variable. 
}}

Note that n can be interpreted as the degree of derivation and that &lt;math&gt;y^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the first variable which in turn is itself a function of ''x''. This definition can be a lot to swallow.  It helps to take an example.  Suppose ''F''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)=''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-cos(''t''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then F(y',y,x)=0 becomes 
:&lt;math&gt;y'-\cos(x)y=0\quad\text{or}\quad y'=\cos(x)y&lt;/math&gt;.  
Thus, by our definition above, ''y''&amp;prime;=cos(''x'')''y'' is a first order ordinary differential equation.

In general we will run into problems if some restrictions are not placed on the function ''F''.  For example, if we didn't require ''F'' to depend on its first variable, then we could have taken a function like ''F''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)=1-cos(''t''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is independent of its first variable.  In which case 
''F''(y&amp;prime;, y, x)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 simply becomes 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;cos(''x'')''y''=0 which involves no derivatives at all!  It would be very odd indeed to call this a first order differential equation. 

Specific examples of ordinary differential equations we are familiar with from calculus would be:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x \, &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=2 \sin x^2. \, &lt;/math&gt;

However, they can also involve the higher order derivatives of y with respect to x. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;xy\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+y\frac{dy}{dx}+e^{3x}=0&lt;/math&gt;

is also an ordinary differential equation.

==Characteristics of Differential Equations==

The '''order''' of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative involved in the equation. Thus:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-4\frac{dy}{dx}-3y=27x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is a '''second-order differential equation''', as the highest derivative is the second: ''d''²''y''/''dx''².

The ''degree'' of a polynomial differential equation is the power to which the highest derivative is raised.

===Linear and Non-Linear Differential Equations===

DEs fall into two major types: linear and non-linear.

'''Linear''' DEs are the simpler kind. A partial differential equation or an ordinary differential equation that has a degree of 1 and no higher degree is called '''linear.'''Thus,

::&lt;math&gt;4\frac{dy}{dx}-3y=27x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is a linear DE.

'''Non-Linear''' DEs are much more complex, as they are any DEs that are not linear. For example,

::&lt;math&gt;y^2, \,\,\,\sqrt{y}\,\,\,\cos y &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \right)^2=-7y&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}+y^2=x&lt;/math&gt;

are non-linear DEs.

Only a tiny proportion of non-linear DEs are solvable exactly - most have to be approximated.

===Homogeneous Differential Equations===

A '''homogeneous''' DE is one in which only the terms involving ''y'' ( includes the derivatives of y ) are present in the equation. No terms involving the independent variables must be present in the equation. Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-y=0&lt;/math&gt;

is homogeneous. If something is left over, then the DE is '''non-homogeneous''', like this one:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-y=2x&lt;/math&gt;

A non-zero constant on the right-hand-side also implies a non-homogeneous DE - after all a constant is still a function.

Generally, if a DE can be written as:

::&lt;math&gt;a_n(x)\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+\ldots+a_1(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+a_0(x)y=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), etc are functions of ''x'', it is homogeneous. However, if it can only be written as

::&lt;math&gt;a_n(x)\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+\ldots+a_1(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+a_0(x)y=b(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b''(''x'') is a function of ''x'', it is non-homogeneous.

==Solutions of a Differential Equation==
{{uncited}}
A '''solution''' of this differential equation is any function y=f(x), which, when substituted into the above equation, satisfies the equation.

An equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f_1(x,y,C_1,C_2,C_3,...,C_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,C_3,...,C_n&lt;/math&gt; as arbitrary constants is called an ''integral solution'' of the differential equation if all functions y=f(x) that are solutions to the integral solution when &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,C_3,...,C_n&lt;/math&gt; are substituted for any values (with the possibility of restrictions) are solutions to the differential equation. Originally, James Bernoulli in 1689 used the term ''integral'' and Euler used the term ''particular integral'' in 1768. The word ''solution'' seems to have first appeared around 1774 by Lagrange, and through Poincaré this term has been established.

A third type of solution is called the '''parametric solution''' in the form 

&lt;math&gt;x=x(t,C_1,C_2,C_3,...,C_n)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;y=y(t,C_1,C_2,C_3,...,C_n)&lt;/math&gt;

with arbitrary constants &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,C_3,...,C_n&lt;/math&gt; whenever all functions y=f(x) that make the second equation an identity are also solutions to the differential equation.

People have tried to define '''general solutions''' (formerly known as ''complete integral'' or ''complete integral equations'' due to Euler, these two terms now mean something different) to be integral solutions with arbitrary constants, and '''singular solutions''' to be integral solutions which are not contained in the general solution. However, these definitions have turned out to be contradictory, since it may be possible that given one general solution that excludes a singular solution, that another general solution may be found that includes the singular solution. Thus, the idea of '''singular solutions''' is contradictory and there is no good way to work with these terms.

Instead, we are going to define '''general solutions''' to be an integral solution that includes ''all'' solutions of the DE, and a '''particular solution''' to be any single solution or integral solution of the DE.

When solving a DE in the crude sense, we aim to find ways to solve equations in particular forms to solutions directly, or to reduce them to a more amenable form. Later, we will aim to solve a DE in a more general sense.

An ''initial value problem'' is a differential equation together with the ''initial conditions'' that the solution &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; also satisfy the equations

:&lt;math&gt;y_0=f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_1=f'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2=f''(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
...
:&lt;math&gt;y_n=f^{(n)}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

at a specific &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. If the &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; are different, then it is called a ''boundary value problem'' with ''boundary conditions.''

We first consider the simple case of the equation &lt;math&gt;y'=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is easily solvable with the following theorem that you probably have already proved in Calculus:

== Relationship to other types of equation ==

The following types of equation are not normally encountered in a first course in differential equations but are included here to illustrate the range of problems where differential equations play a role. 

It is possible to formulate equations where the function being sought is part of the integrand. Such equations are known as integral equations. It is a theorem in differential equations that states that virtually any differential equation can be reformulated as an integral equation. Integral equations are normally studied after differential equations have been mastered. In practice it is sometimes the case that the corresponding integral equation may be easier to solve than the original differential equation. 

It is also possible to encounter equations which include both derivatives and integrals. These equations may or may not be convertible to either purely differential or integral equations.

Another related area is that of difference equations. These equations involve the formation of derivatives where the denominator is not an infinitely small quantity but one of finite size. Their methods of solution parallel those of differential equations. One major difference in their solutions is the role played by the exponential function in differential equations is often replaced by another value which may be complex. 

Equations containing both difference and differential terms are not commonly encountered in practice. These may be difficult to solve in closed form.

Differential equations may be formulated for matrices as well as for real and complex numbers. Because matrix multiplication is not in general commutative while solving these equations careful attention to the order of the factors must be paid.

Additionally, fractional differential equations, which may be either ordinary or partial differential equations, also present some peculiarities and for this reason are also studied after a firm grounding in the more usual forms have been mastered.

Fractional differential equations are rarely mentioned in most text books so a brief note is included here. Typical ordinary differential equations involve integer power of derivatives while fractional differential equations involve any power. This class of equation has been studied almost as long as the other types of differential equation but other than the semi derivative equations - those involving powers of +/- 1/2 - methods for solving them in closed form are not known. Many examples of the diffusion equation - a commonly occurring partial differential equation in physics and chemistry - can be reformulated in terms of a semiderivative equation and solved immediately. 

One reason for the difficulties encountered with this type of differential equation is because the range of potential solutions is much larger than those encountered elsewhere. Integer valued derivatives require a function to be differentiable: only functions of this type can be solutions to a typical differential equation. Fractional derivatives may be applied to completely discontinuous functions and some generalized functions. Methods for identifying these less well studied functions as solutions to fractional differential equations have yet to be developed systematically.

== Existence and Uniqueness theorems ==

As well as attempting to solve a new differential equation it is frequently worthwhile determining if a solution to the equation actually exists and if it does whether the solution is unique. The answers to these questions will be addressed in the section on the existence and uniqueness theorems that will be proved later.

Since most differential equations cannot be solved in closed form, numerical solutions are of great importance. While the existence theorems may seem to be rather esoteric to the beginner they are of considerable importance when attempting a numerical solution: in practice it is very helpful to know that a solution really does exist before trying to compute it.

Understanding when solutions exist and are unique often provides qualitative information about solutions.  For example, the basic theorems about uniqueness state that for each initial condition, there is a unique solution.  This immediately implies that two solutions can never intersect.  If they did you could take the intersection point as the your initial data and the uniqueness theorem would imply the solutions are the same function.  We will discuss more about qualitative behavior toward the second part of the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Playing chromatic notes==
In general, there are five main ways to get chromatic notes on a harmonica: use a chromatic harmonica, overbend on a diatonic, valve diatonics, use the Hohner XB-40, or use two 24-hole tremolos stacked together. Here is a comparison of all five:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-----
|  || '''Octaves''' ||'''Chords'''|| '''Rapid key switching''' || '''Size''' || '''Learning Difficulty'''|| '''Tonal Precision''' || '''Tonal Quality''' || '''Playing range''' || '''Price'''
|-----
| '''Chromatic''' || All blows and draws ||I, ii, vii || Possible || Big || Easy || Always exact || Quantitized (tonal vary little) || Most common is three octaves; Four octaves is also quite common || Expensive
|-----
| '''Overbend (diatonic)''' || All blows, some draws ||I, ii, V-7 (straight harp)&lt;br&gt;I, IV, v (crossharp)|| Possible || Small || Difficult to master technique. Easy afterward. || Sound different for overbended notes || Very dynamic || Typically three octaves. Four octave diatonic harps rare. ||Cheap (but need proper calibration)
|-----
| '''Valved diatonic''' || All blows, some draws ||I, ii, V-7 (straight harp)&lt;br&gt;I, IV, v (crossharp)|| Possible || Small || Slightly difficult || Bended notes &quot;bluesy&quot; || Quite dynamic || Typically three octaves. Must be self-valved to obtain four octaves. || Cheap if self-valved; expensive if buying Suzuki MS-350v
|-----
| '''Hohner XB-40''' || All blows, some draws ||I, ii, V-7 (straight harp)&lt;br&gt;I, IV, v (crossharp)|| Possible || Sort of Small || Difficult (much precision required) || Sometimes exact, sometimes &quot;bluesy&quot; || Mostly are dyanmic; sometimes quantitized || Three octaves only || Expensive
|-----
| '''Stacked tremolo''' || All blows and draws ||I, ii|| Not available || Big || Easy || Always exact || Quantitize || Three octaves only || Relatively cheap
|}

As referred by the table, if one wants an instrument that is capable of thickening the sound and playing many tricks (essentially a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;), then a chromatic harmonica, especially a four-octaves version, is the only way to go. This is because the lowest octave actually allows transposing to even lower octaves; additionally it will make the music sound closer to the saxophone in lower registers. Since there are still some chords and bends available, it can also convey some of those jazzy feelings.

However, if one truly wants to gain the dynamic feelings of blues and jazz (growling and wailing, for example), it is a good idea to either get the valved harmonica or learn overbends; however, much skill is needed since those methods depend on proper embouchure. Overdrive is difficult to use due to its small size (many players have large hands).

Alternatively, the XB-40 is quite easy to bend, but this is also a disadvantage; one will need precise control of the bending in order to bend a semi-tone down instead of a full tone down. However, if played properly, it has the tonal quality and precision of both diatonics and chromatics; adding to the fact is that it is capable to do some true tones and double reed bends because of the additional reeds. Thus, it can be very suited for hands-free playing at the very least, and is a definite must for people interested in playing music that have a bluesy or jazzy feeling; lastly, since there are many ways to play the same note, it is easier to play legato on XB-40.

Still, XB-40 is not without problems; the C-key model, for example, often warrants complaints about its third octave, in which bending (blow and draw) is difficult to perform. Also, it requires precise tonal control (not unlike playing trumpet), as it is easy to miss the required note during bending and accidentally bend down a whole tone. Lastly, it is limited to three octaves, making it restricting if players truly want to play in numerous keys. (Of course, Toots use a standard 3 octaves harmonica to play jazz, so maybe it's not much of a problem.)

Stacked tremolo, as common as it is in East Asia, just do not cut it, since switching the notes in a key is very slow. If one must have the tremolo sound, get Suzuki's chromatic tremolo, which plays just like a conventional 16-hole chromatic.

All in all, it depends on how a player approaches playing music. Keep in mind that just because a piano is designed to play classical music doesn't mean a jazz player cannot play piano jazz with the proper feeling. Likewise, a chromatic harp can also play jazz harp, as long as the musician is skilled enough.  On the other hand, classical music has such a rigid requirement that some view XB-40 as inappropriate; to those classical musicians, they will simply call it &quot;classical music play in jazz style&quot;, as they will deem the wailing effect not proper. Others, however, believe that it's fine, so long as the player can hit the notes precisely.

There is a strong incentive among North American players to play chromatic-capable harmonica in positions only, and thus treat it as diatonic. This is inappropriate, as it defeats the purpose of a chromatic-capable harmonica. They should instead train themselves so that they can play with only one or two harmonicas (e.g.: chromatic and XB-40)

==Opinion of playing chromatically==
*In classical playing, as recommended by Chmel and Adler, '''leave out &quot;trills&quot;'''. That is, do not use trills as in pushing the buttons in and out.
*One thing that I agree whole heartly to Chmel and Adler is their opinion of playing chromatic on other keys than C: '''DO NOT BOTHER'''. This is the exact reason why people claim harmonica is not an instrument but a toy (I think people treat xaphoon as an instrument more than harmonica). Yes, a piece may be &quot;close to impossible&quot;, but not &quot;impossible&quot;; this is common in classical music, which as Chmel had pointed out, may need ten hours per week to practice.
*Practice, practice, practice. Playing chromatically require such effort.
*Learn to read from the traditional notation instead of tabulature. Aside from giving one the sense that it is truly an instrument, traditional notation also provide many information unavailable in other forms.

==Getting Over the Physical Movement limit==
A harmonica basically have the following physical limits:
*Horizontal movement
*Movement of blowing and drawing
*Slide movement

One solution would be to make extensive use of lines which are based on the layout of the harmonica. Lines that need 'limited' 
control over all the variables at the same time. This is basically the solution Toots uses in a very effective way. From many people's research, it would seems his legato is based on the double notes. For example, in the key of C: 
*C
**slide-in draw: hole 4', 4, 8
**slide-out blow: hole 4', 4, 8, 12
**slide-out blow: hole 1', 1, 5, 9
*F
**slide-in blow: hole 2', 2, 6, 10
**slide-out draw: hole 2', 2, 6, 10

Additionally, horizontal movements can be overcome somewhat by using tongue/corner-switching, which involves, in tongue block, moving the tongue from using the left to the right (or even using U-block).

Then there's the interval grid approach, which is by looking at sequences of intervals. There are various systematic ways of approaching these in composition and arranging. Recently there was talk on Slidemeister of an interval-based instrument-neutral study approach to improvisation authored by Joe Messina, a guitarist who also plays jazz chromatic in a non-Toots influenced style. Something that simultaneously and systematically approached both interval-based patterns (by this I mean outside the hierarchy of identified scales and harmonic considerations) and action patterns on the harmonica.

One special topic that should be paid attention is the C notes. Even for the same C notes, there are three positions to choose:
*Slide out blow lower C
*Slide in draw (lower) C
*Slide out blow upper C.

One way, as Chmel had explained, is that if playing a descending passage going past a C note, it’s best to choose either of the
lower Cs, since this allow a quick switch to B. Likewise, during an ascending passage, it would be best to use the upper C notes, as this allow a quick switch to D. 

On the other hand, should I need to change the direction of breathing (such as too much draw notes), it could be wise to do so during the Cs and Fs. While for that notes it would create a slight dissonance, it would be much better than create a much longer period of discord afterwards.

Ultimately, though, this depend more of the general flow and any other requirements when playing the melody. Obviously, for a quick change, it would be better to use the slide to change such notes... though make sure the note after the next notes allows it. Basically, it is all intuition and feeling. This is especially true on a chromatic: If you are playing blues, it may be better (and easier!) to use a bend instead of the slide.


{{harmonica}}

&lt;!----

For many years I have been studying the basic physical movements for playing
the harmonica. I have been playing excersises
that helped me to control the elementary movements as well as the
combination of these movements which I think are
1) the horizontal movement of the harmonica
2) the movement of blowing and drawing
3) slide movement

For some time now, I have to conclude that this helped me to overcome only the basic limitations of playing the harmonica. 
But I would like to be able to play faster and more fluent in every key.

One solution could be to make extensive use of lines which are based on the layout of the harmonica. Lines that need 'limited' 
control over all the variables at the same time. I think this is the solution Toots uses in a very effective way. The way
he uses the layout of the harmonica is incredibly inventive and creative. I think his playing of 'Começar de Novo' on 
'The Brasilian Project volume 1' is one of the many good examples.

My questions are like the following:
1) Does anyone have ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the basic physical movements?
2) Are there any excersises suggested by other great harmonica players?
3) Did anyone study the approach of Toots and are there basic guidelines with suggested excersises?
4) What other kind of approaches do exist that have proved to be valuable?

This could be a great new starting point for me to study for the next decade.


&gt;

&lt;!----
Years ago I transcribed several of Toots' solos with an eye to seeing how he came up with melodic patterns that &quot;lay well&quot; on the instrument - my idea of what lay well being very similar to your:

&quot;lines which are based on the layout of the harmonica . . .. lines that need 'limited' control over all the variables at the same time.&quot;

Like you, I had identified slide change, breath change, and hole change (with distinction between hole leap to a distant hole and hole step to a directly neighboring hole as these made a difference in the continuity of breath; achieving legato was a big part of my thinking at the time) as the primary elements in getting from one note to another.

I had an idea of getting Toots to comment on this and come up with something like the exercises you speak of. I know he has done thorough investigations on his own, and we discussed the possibility, but he simply did not care to address the subject in a linear, didactic way. Also, publishers were not interested in anything this advanced (even though it seems fundamental from my point of view, as I'm sure it does from yours).

Tommy Reilly came up with a series of exercises that were published in, perhaps, the 1950s; various people have copies. Before he died, Douglas Tate re-edited these materials and they are available from Mrs. Tommy Reilly, I believe. From what I've seen of them, I don't think they are really what you're looking for. 

TOots has come up with what seems to be a template for jazz harmonica. Many of the players who have come after him, much as they might not care to hear or believe it, sound like they have benefited enormously from the results of his investigations and would have difficulty in finding harmonic and scale territory where his footprints will not be detected and followed, even without meaning to. Is this inevitable, considering Toots' deep experience with the harmonic territory of the style and the tuning layout of the instrument? Much as I love his playing, I like to think not.

Two ways to approach the problem present themselves quickly:

The pure action approach (which is neutral as to note layout, i.e. would work with dimi and toni tuning, etc.) and the interval grid approach. By that I mean looking at sequences of intervals. There are various systematic ways of approaching these in composition and arranging, though I ahve to admit I know little about them. Recently there was talk on Slidemeister of an interval-based instrument-neutral study approach to improvisation authored by Joe Messina, a guitarist who also plays jazz chromatic in a non-Toots influenced style. Something that simultaneously and systematically approached both interval-based patterns (by this I mean outside the hierarchy of identified scales and harmonic considerations) and action patterns on 
the harmonica might be what you're looking for - and which you would have to build more or less from the ground up.

I know this is exceedingly vague and is essentially throwing the ball back to you; I hope it provides food for thought.

he took Charlie Parker II-V-I progressions and played them through 12 keys.  I think the key is the legato around doubled C's and F's.

&gt;----&gt;

&lt;!----
In general, Toots uses the slide very effectively in conjunction with simple breathing patterns to get a lot of movement without a lot of effort. In that sense, he's got something in common with Stevie Wonder, though of course their musical approaches and roots are very different.

In my 1979 interview with Toots, he told me flatly that you can't play Charlie Parker on the chromatic. I was floored, given that I'd just been listening to Toots's recording of &quot;Au Privave&quot; on the Montreaux live recording of Oscar Peterson's Big 6. Sure sounded like the real thing to me. But I agree that playing Charlie Parker licks at high tempo on the chromatic is not easy, mainly because, as Toots pointed out to me, the accenting doesn't work.

But then Toots doesn't use Robert Bonfiglio's corner switching technique; if he did, the accenting might just work. As I noted here a while ago when some of us were posting our takes on &quot;A Night in Tunisia,&quot; I think corner switching is the best, if not the only, way to get the accenting right on that melody, which jumps around a lot more than is comfortable to handle otherwise. This technique hasn't been heavily explored by most jazz players, but I've tried to play some of Clint Hoover's stuff, and I bet he uses it. Whatever he's using, it's very good stuff -- the best post-Toots jazz chromatic I've heard.

==Johdanto - Introduction==

Tässä tekstissä, kaksi suomalaista on juttelemassa kahvista ulkomailla.  
::''In this text, two Finns are chatting about getting coffee when abroad.

Teksti on otettu chatista, siinä on siis aika paljon puhekieltä sekä lyhenteitä ja oikeinkirjoitusvirheitä. 
::''The text has been taken from a chat room, and it therefore contains quite a lot of spoken language as well as abbreviations and typing/spelling errors.

==KAHVIA ULKOMAILLA perusteksti  basic text==

==KAHVIA ULKOMAILLA    Coffee abroad (with translation &amp; explanantions)==

'''A. Miten esim. Italiassa kannattaa tilata kahvia, jos haluaa saada mahd. suomalaisen oloista?  Vai onko meidän tapamme keittää kahvia niin erikoista, ettei sitä muualla saa?
::''How for example can one successfully order coffee in Italy, if you want to get one in the best possible Finnish style?  Or is our way of making coffee so special that you can't get it anywhere else?


:::'''kannattaa''' This verb has two main meanings (1) Support physically, personally, or commercially, (2) to be worthwhile or profitable.  The meaning in this sentence approximates to the second meaning but has been translated as &quot;successfully&quot; to nomalise the english translation. 
:::'''mahd.''' abbreviation of '''mahdollisimman''' 
:::'''mahdollisimma-''' stem form of '''mahdollisin''' ''best possible'' (superlative adjective, formed from '''mahdollinen''' (adj.) ''possible'')
:::'''mahdollisimman''' genitive (as an attributive or adjectival form) ''the best possible''

Yleensä, kun tilaat ulkomailla kahvia, niin saat espressoa tms.  
::''generally, when you order coffee abroad, you get an expresso or something similar.

::'' 


B. Danish Cofee.

A. Vaikka ei ne ulkomaan pellet ossaa ees kahvia keittää, saatikka hernekeittoa.

Those foreign clowns, they even can't make a decent cup of coffee, nor pea soup. 

B. Mie siuna ottaisin mukkaa paketin pari Saludua ja nokipannun, ainakin purkin Kotisaaren hernekeittoa per matkapäivä, Sikanautaa muutaman purkin, näkkileipää loopantin mustikkakeittoa. 

A. Ei niihin ulkomaan ruokiin oo luottamista. Ei varmaan kaikki oo edes ihmisravinnoksi tarkoitettu. Saattavat vaikka jotain jyrsiää syöttää kanan sijasta näin lintuinfluenssan aikana.

B. Ja maitoo mie ottaisin myös mukkaa, ettei tarttis niitä happamii viinilitkuja juuva. Joka puolella lähinn suomalaista vastaava on deutsch/german coffee. 

B. Ihan suomalaista kahvia. Kyllä ne turistikuppiloiden kyypparit osaa sulle jonkinlaisen kahvinsukuisen juoman pöytään kantaa.

A. Ihan turha vittuilla, koska kahvi ulkomailla on useasti ihan hirveetä kuraa. Kannattaa yritä tilata filter coffee jos ei tosta pressosta niin välitä. Usein vaihtoehdot on lähinnä presso ja presso + kuuma vesi= kahvi. Tai sit sulle tarjoillaan neskahvia. 

B. Eihän täällä kukaan vittuile. Mistä sinä sellaisen käsityksen olet saanut.

A. Olisi pyytää CAFE AMERICANO. Se toimii ainakin Espanjassa, joten oletettavasti myöskin Italiassa. 

A. Cafe Americano on yleensä se mitä käytetään keski-Euroopassa filtterikahvista, Ranska, Belgia, Italia jne. Itse espresson ystävänä vältän tätä litkua kuin myrkkyä. Makunsa kullakin.

B. Cafe Latte. Kokeilepa sitä.

A. Eipä ole vieras tuo lattekaan, mutta yleensä maistuu espresso tuplana, kiittooss… *hörppää  halvasta nescafesta*.

==KAHVIA ULKOMAILLA (ja selitykset) with explanations in Finnish only==

A - Miten esim'''(erkiksi)''' Italiassa kannattaa '''(=on hyvä)''' tilata kahvia, jos haluaa saada mahd'''(ollisimman)''' suomalaisen oloista '''(=tyypillistä suomalaista, tavallista suomalaista)'''. Yleensä, kun tilaat ulkomailla kahvia, niin saat espressoa tms. '''(=tai muuta sellaista)'''. Vai onko meidän tapamme keittää kahvia niin erikoista (&gt;erikoinen), ettei sitä (kahvia) muualla saa?

- Danish Cofee.

Vaikka ei ne ulkomaan pellet osaa ees (=edes) kahvia keittää, saatikka (=saakka, asti) hernekeittoa. TARKOITTAA ETTÄ KAHVIN KEITTÄMINEN ON HELPPOA JA HERNEKEITON VAIKEAA. JOS EI OSAA TEHDÄ KAHVIA, EI VOI OSATA TEHDÄ HERNEKEITTOA.

Saattavat (=voivat) vaikka jotain jyrsiää (=jyrsijä on esimerkiksi hiiri) syöttää kanan sijasta (=kanan 'paikalla') näin lintuinfluenssan aikana.

Ja maitoo mie (=minä) ottaisin myös mukkaa (=mukaan), ettei tarttis (=tarvitsisi, tarvita) niitä happamii (=happamia, hapan) viinilitkuja (=viini+litku; litku on huonolaatuinen neste) juuva (=juoda).

- Joka puolella lähinn(ä) suomalaista (kahvia) vastaava (kahvi) on deutsch/german coffee. 

- Ihan suomalaista kahvia. Kyllä ne turistikuppiloiden (=turistikahviloiden) kyypparit (=tarjoilijat) osaa sulle (=sinulle) jonkinlaisen kahvinsukuisen juoman pöytään kantaa.

- Ihan turha vittuilla (=älä ärsytä minua; vittu on naisen sukuelin), koska kahvi ulkomailla on useasti ihan hirveetä kuraa (=kura on likavettä ja savea). Kannattaa yritä tilata filter coffee jos ei tosta (es)pressosta niin välitä (=pidä). Usein vaihtoehdot on lähinnä presso ja presso+kuuma vesi = kahvi. Tai sit(ten) sulle tarjoillaan neskahvia (=Nescafé). 

- Eihän täällä kukaan vittuile. Mistä sinä sellaisen käsityksen olet saanut.

- Olisi (pitänyt) pyytää CAFE AMERICANO. Se toimii ainakin Espanjassa, joten oletettavasti myöskin Italiassa. 

- Cafe Americano on yleensä se mitä käytetään keski-Euroopassa filtterikahvista (=suodatinkahvista), Ranska, Belgia, Italia… jne. (=ja niin edelleen). Itse espresson ystävänä vältän tätä litkua kuin myrkkyä. Makunsa kullakin (= jokainen saa pitää mistä haluaa).

- Cafe Latte = maitokahvi. Kokeilepa sitä.

- Eipä ole vieras tuo lattekaan, mutta yleensä maistuu espresso tuplana (=kaksinkertaisena), kiittooss… * hörppää (=juo suullisen) halvasta nescafesta*.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Asynchronous Learning ==


Asynchronous learning is the concept that students acquire the necessary skills and experience at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning is opposite to synchronous learning, where students must learn at the same time by activities such as attending a lecture or tutorial. An asynchronous learning environment provides students with teaching materials and tools for registration, instruction, and discussions outside of the classroom scenario and incorporates the ability to maintain communication with tutors and other students outside of rigid educational timetables. Asynchronous Learning Networks (ANL) make extensive use of software and the Internet, using packages such as blackboard, e-mail, or chat rooms, and is available so that people can post, read and respond to subject instruction, queries and messages all within the same shared space.

This type of study means that students can be located anywhere throughout the world, hence giving rise to the phrase “Global Learning”, or more commonly “Location Independent Learning” and is an ideal delivery mode for individuals in different geographical locations, for those whose work schedules or other obligations have previously kept them from furthering their education. It is this type of learning that occurs independently of time and space. Students are able to interact with course materials and with each other at a time of their choosing and it is through this medium that e-learning gets much of its appeal. Traditionally, students needed to be physically present to engage in learning with other students now students can engage with each other when it is most convenient.

A major advantage of this learning style is that it promotes more uniform participation by all students than either face-to-face or synchronous communication because all students have an equal opportunity to contribute and those who have trouble speaking up in traditional classroom environment because of language differences or other reasons can take time drafting a thoughtful written reply (Mitchell, 2002).  By utilising the tools through an ANL, students are allowed time to think about a given subject and formulate their thoughts. Another advantage of the asynchronous environment is that the learning does not have to be geared to the average student. Those who want to research a subject in more depth can do so, and those who are slower learners can review material as many times as needed. 

Many different teaching methodologies state &quot;The teacher will appear when the student is ready&quot;.  Asynchronous learning is no different and could be said to give the student more control and autonomy over the pace and style of his tuition and is therefore through this medium that the students thus become ready for the teacher.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Plagiarism Advisory Service ==

The Plagiarism Advisory Service’s (PAS) title is self explanatory. The service provides tutors and students in UK with information about and guidance on plagiarism prevention and detection. Following the advent of the Internet and the almost limitless access to online resources and information, research papers and the relative ease that these electronic text sources can be duplicated academic institutions are forced to view plagiarism and it’s implications with growing concern. (JISC 2005) The service promotes the adoption of a holistic approach to plagiarism prevention encompassing institutional policy and procedures, academic practice and student skills, an approach which is supported by the implementation of best practice procedures,  the evaluation of appropriate learning materials, the support of online discussions forum to increase awareness and stimulate debate, assistance with regional training workshops with focus on prevention strategies and the provision of training for the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) funded electronic plagiarism detection service.

The subject of plagiarism and the possible sources of data are and will remain eternally fluid, so there is a requirements that any newly identified loopholes are detected and closed. However, after due consultation with users, PAS has the aim to establish advice, guidance, information and materials to assist both students and tutors which have been designed to promote understanding of, and compliance with, the issues surrounding plagiarism.

An overview of this information is available online. Also, there are now a number of software applications available that run electronic detection service packages. Examples of such programmes are &quot;iThenticate&quot; or  “Turnitin”, which sell themselves on their plagiarism prevention, and appears to be the standard in online plagiarism prevention. (Turnitin, 2006)

Programmes and software such as this can generate ‘originality reports’ to assist students and tutors alike in the debate on the importance of academic honesty in the teaching and learning environment. PAS views detection or plagiarised document, but are used only within the PAS service as a single part of its remit and strategy of prevention.

PAS’s role is that of a provider of information and advice firstly and then a policing group second, however it must not be forgotten the plagiarism has multiple guises which can have serious repercussions. By promoting best practice within the academic community PAS seeks to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the prevention and detection of plagiarism and thereby maintain levels of incidents of plagiarism and of academic misconduct within the community.

Does anyone know why this is in the partitive?

:'''Oloista kahvia''': this is the object and an object can be either in partitive or accusative (genitive or nominative). Partitive is used for unspecified amounts of something, in this case, just coffee in general. '''Oloisen kahvin''' would be used for a cup of coffee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{unstable}}

'''Wikibooks''' is a collection of free [[w:open content|open-content]] textbooks, supplementary texts and [[WB:AT|annotated texts]] that anyone can edit. This page briefly defines English Wikibooks' basic project scope which allows us to maintain focus and stay on task. The process for removing material that does not aim to be within project scope is described in the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|deletion policy]].

== Wikibooks materials are ==
* '''Free.''' They can be used and distributed by anyone that accepts the terms of the ''[[WB:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike]]'' license. They may include derived and aggregations of works that are compatible with the CC-BY-SA license, if properly attributed.
* '''Open.''' They aim to be the result of many people working together through [[Wikibooks:Decision making|consensus building]]. Almost anyone with an Internet connection can contribute. If you do not want your writing to be edited [[WB:BOLD|mercilessly]] and redistributed at will, then do not contribute to Wikibooks.
* '''Educational.''' They aim to be suitable for ''learning and teaching'' class or course curricula, and/or for self-learning. Materials are written for fluent English language readers (for other languages see Wikibooks' [http://www.wikibooks.org portal page]). ''Published educational standards'' are followed when appropriate.
* '''Comprehensive.''' They aim to be easy to ''understand and follow'' by a targeted ''audience'' that is able to learn from reading it, with a ''scope'' that defines what is covered and how complete that coverage is intended to be. They are written with purpose and allow readers to read with purpose. To this effect they may use interactive features, multimedia files, a narrative, or links that directly benefit the target audience.
* '''Consistent.''' They aim to be consistent in tone, narrative, layout, scope, purpose, audience, and [[WB:LMOS|writing style]]. They should explain these things to authors and readers. They must also build knowledge from one page to the next in a consistent way. 
* '''Reliable.''' They aim to maintain a [[WB:NPOV|neutral tone]] and present factual information that anyone can independently and easily verify to be accurate and balanced by checking established, respected and reliable sources, or through reasonable and safe reproduction. For primary research use peer-reviewed journals or other websites instead, such as [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[wikia:academia|Academia Wikia]]. For original works of fiction use [[wikia:novelas|The Fiction Wikia]].
* '''Dynamic.''' They aim to evolve and change over time to reflect current knowledge. Static versions of previously published works that have been released into the public domain or a compatible license may qualify for inclusion on [[s:|Wikisource]].

== Wikibooks materials are not ==
* '''Collections.''' They are more than just ''outlines'' or a collection of ''facts'', ''[[Commons:|images]]'', ''[[q:|quotations]]'', or ''lists''. Bibliographies, Appendixes, Glossaries, reference material, or other collections of information must be part of a book that provides a comprehensive coverage of a subject mater.
* '''Fiction''' including ''novels, stories, poems and other non-factual works''. However [[WB:AT|Annotated texts]] are fine. For original fiction use [[wikia:novelas|The Fiction Wikia]].
* '''Dictionaries''' or '''thesauruses'''. They aim to do more than define topics. For dictionary or thesaurus entries use [[wikt:|Wiktionary]] instead.
* '''News stories'''. They are not a primary source of current or breaking news. Use [[n:|Wikinews]] for that instead.
* '''Macropedias or encyclopedia articles'''. They aim to do more than provide topic overviews. For that use [[w:|Wikipedia]] instead.
* '''Unverifiable'''. Even books must be composed of verifiable material. If you can't prove it, don't add it!
* '''Primary sources'''. They are not for reporting or publishing new information and ideas. For that use [[v:|Wikiversity]] instead.
* A main source for other forms of '''class curriculum''', this includes ''tests'', ''notes'' and ''class plans''. Use [[v:|Wikiversity]] instead.
* '''Promotional'''. They are not for promoting or advertising products, services, companies, events, people or other things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Second Life ==

Second Life is a 3-D virtual world and has been available online since 2003. Since then it has become “inhabited” by nearly 100,000 people from around the globe. ([http://secondlife.com/whatis/]Second Life, 2006). The “world” is a simulation that provides a unique and flexible environment for educators interested in distance learning, computer supported cooperative work, simulation, new media studies, and corporate training and provides an opportunity to use simulation in a safe environment to enhance experiential learning, allowing individuals to practice skills, try new ideas, and learn from their mistakes. The ability to prepare for similar real-world experiences by using Second Life as a simulation has unlimited potential.  It is in this manner that it can be likened to the popular games series such as “The Sims” and “SimCity”, but instead of a person on a machine, this environment interacts with other people playing the same game across the globe. It is the accessibility of Second Life that allows students and educators to work together from anywhere in the world as part of a globally networked virtual classroom environment. 

According to the entry for Second life in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life]Wikipedia (2006) It has been claimed that Second Life, and several other virtual worlds, have been inspired by the science fiction novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. Indeed, the stated goal of Linden Lab was to create a world like the metaverse described in Snow Crash: a user-defined world of general use in which people can interact, play, do business, and otherwise communicate. 

It is popular and successful simulation games such as “The Sims” though that ensure that the majority of students have had some experience with simulation games. On the whole, these games, or environments, represent active, immersive learning environments where users integrate information to solve a problem. Learning in this manner incorporates discovery, analysis, interpretation, and performance as well as physical and mental activity, which gives the educational content required for students and teachers alike.  It is these features within Second Life that attract educators and students alike.

There are many options for Educators in Second Life, as well as having its own economy, market place and variety of building tools, you can also create a secure internal area, called “Private Islands” that restrict membership and thus only allow access to those who require it. Those with access to private areas can still access those areas deemed “Public land” and thereby interact with all the Residents of Second Life.  It is by being able to have an “internal” and external area within the world-wide virtual world which make it an ideal environment for educators and students to come together and promote learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In biology the genome of an organism is the whole hereditary information of an organism that is encoded in the DNA (or, for some viruses, RNA). This includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences. The term was coined in 1920 by Hans Winkler, Professor of Botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany, as a portmanteau of the words gene and chromosome.

More precisely, the genome of an organism is a complete DNA sequence of one set of chromosomes; for example, one of the two sets that a diploid individual carries in every somatic cell. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean the complete set of nuclear DNA (i.e., the nuclear genome) but can also be applied to organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the mitochondrial genome or the chloroplast genome. When people say that the genome of a sexually reproducing species has been &quot;sequenced,&quot; typically they are referring to a determination of the sequences of one set of autosomes and one of each type of sex chromosome, which together represent both of the possible sexes. Even in species that exist in only one sex, what is described as &quot;a genome sequence&quot; may be a composite from the chromosomes of various individuals. In general use, the phrase genetic makeup is sometimes used conversationally to mean the genome of a particular individual or organism. The study of the global properties of genomes of related organisms is usually referred to as genomics, which distinguishes it from genetics which generally studies the properties of single genes or groups of genes.

== Overview of our progress so far ==

We have seen how to describe various mechanical systems in terms of Lagrangians. It is straightforward to find the Lagrangian for any system consisting of point masses, rigid sticks, ropes, rolling wheels, etc. Given a Lagrangian, it is very easy to derive the equations of motion (the Euler-Lagrange equations. Solving these equations is a technical task that may be accomplished using computers. In principle, the theoretical description of mechanical systems is now complete.

There is one caveat: Mechanical systems involving the force of friction generally ''cannot'' be easily described by the Lagrangian formalism! The Lagrangian formalism includes only '''conservative forces''', i.e. forces which are gradients of a potential. (A ''constraint'' can be seen as an idealization of a very steep potential that effectively prohibits motion in some directions but allows motion in other directions.) However, friction is not a conservative force because it usually depends on velocity and position in a nontrivial way. In physics, the force of friction is not considered a fundamental force, but rather a force arising out of interactions with a large number of particles in the environment. Thus, effects of friction can be derived, in principle, from a more fundamental picture that involves only conservative forces. Of course, in practice it is much more convenient to introduce the force of friction '''phenomenologically''', i.e. by guessing or experimentally measuring the formula for the friction. One well-known formula is &lt;math&gt;F=\mu N&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the friction coefficient; this formula approximately describes dynamic friction on rough surfaces. Another known formula is &lt;math&gt;\vec F= -A(v)\vec v&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of a body moving through a medium and &lt;math&gt;A(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient that usually depends on the velocity and on the shape of the body in some complicated way. This formula can be used for bodies moving through air or water, although one needs to measure the function &lt;math&gt;A(v)&lt;/math&gt; in each case.

=== What remains: applications ===

You still need to learn some practical applications of this mathematical theory to various important cases. In each case, one can apply the general theory, use suitable mathematical techniques, and extract important physical consequences. Students of theoretical mechanics need to learn these mathematical techniques, as well as the accompanying notions and their physical interpretations. Here are the major areas of interest:

* Describing the motion of a point mass in a central field of force. The most important example is the '''Kepler problem''', which corresponds to a force that decays as &lt;math&gt;1/r^2&lt;/math&gt; with distance. This setup describes, for instance, the motion of planets and comets around the sun.  In this case, one can solve the equations of motion analytically and derive important properties of the motion in a central field, such as periodicity, orbit parameters, escape velocity, Kepler laws, perihelion precession, etc. The theory of the Kepler problem is the foundation for '''celestial mechanics'''.

* Describing the motion of a rigid body under external forces. A '''rigid body''' is a collection of a very large number of point masses, which are spread in space and constrained to remain at fixed distances from each other. So, a rigid body may move as a whole or rotate as a whole, but it cannot be squeezed or deformed in any way. The concept of a &quot;rigid body&quot; is very important because it is an idealization of the behavior of rigid things that we use in real life. The motion of a rigid body is, of course, much simpler than the set of all possible motions of its constituent particles. So it is very useful to develop a special formalism describing the possible motions of a rigid body. This formalism involves such concepts as the tensor of inertia, torque, angular momentum, and rolling without sliding. I would like to stress that these concepts are ''not'' new fundamental axioms of mechanics; these concepts can be ''derived'' from the standard Lagrangian for the system consisting of many massive particles that are spread in space and constrained to remain at fixed distances from each other.

* Describing small oscillations around a static configuration. For a mechanical system that has oscillating degrees of freedom around a static equilibrium position (these systems range from molecules to bridges), we make an approximation that the system has only very small deviations from that position. In the limit when these deviations are very small, it is usually possible to derive a linear equation of motion for these deviations.  These equations of motion describe oscillations and can be analyzed to verify that the position of the system is stable against small deviations. (The analysis proceeds most conveniently in the Lagrangian formalism.) The key concepts in this area are normal modes, normal frequences, and stability.

* Describing elastic scattering of point masses. More generally, one considers a point mass moving in a potential, such that the force is appreciably nonzero only in a small portion of space. A typical problem is to describe the motion of a point mass that has a given velocity far away from the interaction area. The particle flies in, is deflected ('''scattered''') by the potential, and flies away with a the same speed but in a slightly different direction. A typical experimental situation is when one has an initial beam of particles with slightly different positions. In that case, the interesting question is not to describe the precise trajectory of each particle, but to predict how many outgoing particles will fly in a particular direction. In other words, one wants to characterize the final (outgoing) states at infinity in terms of the initial (ingoing) states at infinity. The key notions in this area are the  differential and the total scattering cross-section.

=== What remains: theoretical developments ===

Besides these applications, there are certain theoretical developments that enrich the Lagrangian formalism and provide essential foundations for other areas of theoretical physics. At least some of these theoretical developments are usually included in courses of theoretical mechanics, even though some of them do not have a direct application in the field of mechanics proper. We shall only study the most important of these developments:

* General properties of Lagrangian formalism: invariance under coordinate changes, equivalence of systems with different Lagrangians, motivations for using the action principle, equivalence of Lagrangians with higher-order derivatives and first-order derivatives, etc. These are more or less formal developments that deepen our understanding and clarify the structure of the theory but only rarely help solve particular problems. For instance, the invariance under coordinate changes is an important conceptual fact which justifies why we can choose arbitrary generalized coordinates.

* Hamiltonian formalism. This is a very important mathematical development of the Lagrangian formalism, where a mathematical trick is used to include velocities as independent variables into the Lagrangian, thus making the equations of motion first-order in time derivatives. The Hamiltonian formalism involves such notions as Legendre transformation, Poisson brackets, and symplectic geometry. The most important application of the Hamiltonian formalism is in quantum mechanics; within classical mechanics, it largely remains a mathematical game which only occasionally has an advantage over the Lagrangian formalism in solving mechanical problems, although it has far-reaching consequences for the formal development of physics. For instance, such features as the presence of constraints, integrability, and a transition to chaos is most naturally expressed using the Hamiltonian formalism. In the minimal standard course of mechanics, only some basic ideas of the Hamiltonian formalism are covered: the Poisson brackets, canonical transformations, and the Hamiltoin-Jacobi equation.

* Perturbation theory. This is a method to describe a system approximately, if that system is only a small deviation from another system which we can solve exactly. Several methods of perturbation theory are known; only the most basic ones (anharmonic oscillations) are studied in the minimal standard course of mechanics.

* Symmetries and conservation laws. The discovery that the existence of a group of symmetry transformations is equivalent to the existence of a conservation law has become a very important foundation of particle physics and field theory. Keywords include: symmetry groups, infinitesimal transformations (also called &quot;'''generators'''&quot;), the Noether theorems, Galilei and Lorentz invariance. Only a qualitative understanding is intended at this point.

==Overview==
This tutorial is designed to teach users to make a low-poly animesque head in Blender.

What you need to know:
*Basic Blender controls



==Add a plane==
[[Image:bl1.jpg|right|200px|Add a plane]]

Start with a new file, and delete ({{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}) the default cube.

Be in '''Front''' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) 

Add a plane ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}}-&gt; add-&gt; mesh-&gt; plane)

{{Clear}}

==Make a pointed chin==
[[Image:bl2.jpg|right|200px|Merge the vertices]]
Switch to '''Edit mode'''

Be in '''Vertex select''' mode

Select the bottom two vertices ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}) and press W to bring up the vertex menu. &quot;Select Merge&quot;, then &quot;At Center&quot;, or just hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|M}} and choose &quot;At Center&quot;.

{{clr}}


[[Image:bl3.jpg|right|200px|A pointed chin!]]
Now you have a pointed chin.

{{clr}}

[[Image:bl4.jpg|right|200px|A pointed chin!]]

Select the top two vertices (use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) 
{{clr}}

[[Image:bl5.jpg|right|200px|Select the top 2 vertices]]

Re-arrange them so they make more of a chin shape by pressing the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} to move and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to constrain the movement to the Z-Axis.

'''Noob Note:''' Move it down; don't scale it out.


{{clr}}

==Extrude the face==
[[Image:bl6.jpg|right|200px|Extrude along the Z-Axis]]
Now extrude ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}) &quot;edges only&quot;, along the Z-Axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) so that you have another area.



{{clr}}


[[Image:bl7.jpg|right|200px|Scale it]]

As a precaution, remove doubles. ('''WKEY''')


Scale it ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}) so that it's not so cubic.
{{clr}}

[[Image:bl8.jpg|right|200px|Extrude along the Z-Axis again]]
Now extrude along the Z-Axis again ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} then {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) and scale ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}) it down a bit.


{{clr}}


[[Image:bl9.jpg|right|200px|Extrude along the Z-Axis again]]
One last time... (E) (Z) (S)

{{Clear}}

==Make the facial features==
[[Image:bl10.jpg|right|200px|Select the middle vertices]]
Select the middle vertices ('''BKEY''') or ('''RMB''') and press ('''WKEY''') to bring up the specials menu. Subdivide it once.

'''Noob Note''': On version 2.67. Subdividing doesn't appear to give the desired effect. I used the 
Knife tool. ('''KKey''') instead.

'''Noob Note''': I used version 2.68 and when I subdivided I checked the box saying &quot;Quad/Tri Mode&quot; in the lower left corner. In the end I got the result I needed, so I think this is the option you need to get the desired effect.

{{clr}}

[[Image:bl11.jpg|right|200px|Select the vertices]]
Now select at first the pair of vertices above and subdivide once.

{{clr}}

[[Image:bl12.jpg|right|200px|Subdivide!]]
Now subdivide 3 times with the pair of vertices below the center line.

{{clr}}


[[Image:bl13.jpg|right|200px|There!]]
Yours should now look like this one on the right.

{{Clear}}
===Eyes===
[[Image:bl14.jpg|right|200px|Subdivide some more]]
Select and subdivide here, so you can make the eyes.


{{clr}}

[[Image:bl15.jpg|right|200px|Make some eyes]]
And rearrange the vertices so they make eye shapes.

{{Clear}}
===Nose===
[[Image:bl16.jpg|right|200px|Select these]]
Now select the middle vertex here (right mouse button).

Extrude it along the Y-Axis ('''EKEY''') ('''YKEY''') and move your mouse around to change how far it moves.

{{clr}}

[[Image:bl18.jpg|right|200px|Let's make a nose!]]
Select these three vertices ('''SHIFT+RMB'') and press (F) to 
make a face.

{{clr}}

[[Image:bl19.jpg|right|200px|Do the same to the other side]]
Now do the same to the other side, and you will have the nose's base.

{{clr}}
[[Image:bl20.jpg|right|200px|Make a face]]
Select these vertices ('''SHIFT+RMB''') and make a face (F). 

Do this to the other side.


{{clr}}

[[Image:bl21.jpg|right|200px|You have a nose!]] 
Now you have a nose.

{{Clear}}

===Remove interior nose faces===
[[Image:bl22.jpg|right|200px|Rotate the camera]] 
Rotate the camera ('''CTRL+NUM1''') so you are seeing the back.

Be in '''Face select''' mode.



{{clr}}

[[Image:bl24.jpg|right|200px|Get rid of these]]

===Introducing the Constitutional Structure of the United States===

The United States is a country ruled by an association representative of, elected by, and accountable to, the people of the United States (as opposed to being ruled by a king or a dictator--in essence, a country ruled by those possessing superior capability for violence compared to anyone else); this makes the United States a &quot;democracy&quot;, a country ruled by the people. 

The association of the people of the United States - the government of the United States - is ruled by a set of previously declared principles applied in a uniform, consistent, and fair fashion to every situation the government of the United States finds itself in; these principles, and their application, are called &quot;law&quot;; this makes the United States a country that is ruled by law, or has the &quot;rule of law&quot;.

But who rules the law? The law rules the law; the system of laws of the United States has certain laws that are more important than others. The highest law of the United States, the &quot;supreme law of the land&quot;, is called the &quot;Constitution of the United States of America&quot;; it is a set of laws that govern laws and govern the government. It specifies what kind of laws can be made, and what the government can do. It prohibits certain types of laws from being made, and specifically forbids the government from doing certain things. And it places fundamental limits on the power of government, by specifying that every power that is not specifically granted (or specifically implied) to the government in the Constitution, the government does not possess, may not exercise, and cannot claim to have. This makes the United States a country that has a &quot;limited government&quot;--there are things that the government of the United States cannot do, like throw people in jail for no reason, name one religion as the only religion allowed, send the police to search homes without evidence of crimes being committed, or punish people because they say things that other people disagree with. The reader should understand that the government of the United States does not do these things not because it chooses not to do them--but  because it has no power to do them.

But who rules the Constitution? The individual people of the United States do. They can change it, if it becomes necessary. It has been changed 27 times in the past two-hundred-and-twenty or so years. But the process to do so is slow, and arduous, and most people hesitate to change what has worked so well for so long, especially for light causes.

===The Constitution In Practice===

A word about the Constitution: it was written before the Internet, the computer, the television, nuclear power, radio, the airplane, the automobile, electricity and electric lighting, the train, or in-home running water--before 37 of the 50 current states were part of the United States--before there were any other democracies on the face of the Earth--before there were large cities in our country--and before there were industries, or corporations, or any of the other modern conveniences of life. It was written by candlelight, not by electric light, it was delivered to the 13 states by riders on horseback, not by posting it on the Web. But it was not written before there was what many Americans believe to be God, or before there was a notion that all people are equal, and have the right to be free. Many view the Constitution as a set of truths that apply themselves in similar ways in changing times.

Therefore, the Constitution can sometimes be unclear, and be subject to changing situations. In those situations, there are people who interpret the Constitution and the law of the United States; they are called judges; and the supreme interpreters of the Constitution are called Justices; there are nine of them, and together they form the Supreme Court of the United States. They decide what the Constitution means to us when a situation presents itself where the Constitution is unclear. These decisions are made when one person argues that what another person is doing (or not doing) is forbidden by the Constitution. That is why they have names like &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;; Marbury, a person, complained against Madison, a person. 

When the Justices of the Supreme Court make decisions in the present, they look to their past decisions (what they call &quot;precedents&quot;) for guidance. This is an important part of the law, because the law must be consistent. Sometimes, however, they find their past decisions to be wrong--or inapplicable--and revise them. Sometimes they are upheld, or expanded upon. In any event, there are times when Supreme Court decisions play a very, very major role in the history of the United States.

In the following sections, we name the most major decisions of the Supreme Court and discuss why they occurred, what was decided, and why the decision was important. These decisions--these interpretations of the Constitution by the Supreme Court of the United States--form an important part of the history of the United States, as the United States is a nation ruled by law.

==First Constitutional Era (1787-1850)==

The Union, its nature, judicial supremacy, rule of law, states' rights, federal powers and the limits thereof, allotment and allocation of powers between the several branches, the several states, and the people thereof, the question of slavery.

===[[w:Marbury v. Madison|Marbury v. Madison]] 5 U.S. 137 (1803)===

The day before his last in office, President John Adams appointed 42 judges to fill seats in many newly-created courts. One of these was William Marbury. The Senate confirmed the judges, and Secretary of State John Marshall signed their commissions, the paper each requires to assume his appointment. But the day Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated, he ordered his appointed Secretary of State, James Madison, not to deliver the commissions to many of the confirmed judges, Marbury included. Marbury sued to force Madison to give up the commissions. The suit was filed directly in the Supreme Court, since Marbury argued that the Judiciary Act 1789 gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction over ''writs of mandamus'', court orders that force public officials to do things.

John Marshall, who incidentally was appointed to the position of Chief Justice on Adams' last day, wrote in the court's unanimous decision that the Court could not rule in Marbury's case because it did not have the jurisdiction to do so. Marbury had argued that Article III of the Constitution only set basic rules concerning the Supreme Court's powers, and that they could be expanded by Congress any time it wanted. Marshall disagreed, pointing to the simple logic: what was the point of having a Constitution if Congress could write laws that changed courts' jurisdictions, thus ignoring the rules explicitly stated in Article III? If laws could be written that circumvented Article III in the way that Marbury argued that the Judiciary Act should, could laws be written that allowed the courts to ignore the Constitution altogether?

In determining that the Judiciary Act was in violation of the Constitution by adding on to Article III, Marshall affirmed the all-important principle of '''judicial review'''. Judicial review is the judicial branch's, and specifically the Supreme Court's, power to declare laws in conflict with the Constitution and overturn them.

===[[w:Fletcher v. Peck|Fletcher v. Peck]], 10 U.S. 87 (1810)===
Fletcher v. Peck was the first case in which the Supreme Court ruled a state law unconstitutional. In the course of the westward push for the control of Indian lands, the state of Georgia took from the Indians a 35,000,000-acre (140,000 sq. km) region in the Yazoo River area known as the Yazoo Lands. This land later became the states of Alabama and Mississippi. In 1795, the Georgia legislature divided the area into four tracts. The state then sold the tracts to four separate land development companies for a modest total price of $500,000, i.e. about 1.4 cents per acre, a good deal even at 1790s prices. The Georgia legislature overwhelmingly approved this land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795.

It was revealed that the Yazoo Land Act sale to private speculators had been approved in return for bribes. Voters rejected most of the incumbents in the next election, and the next legislature, reacting to the public outcry, repealed the law and voided transactions made under it.

John Peck had purchased land that had previously been sold under the 1795 act. Peck sold this land to Robert Fletcher and in 1803, Fletcher brought suit against Peck, claiming that he did not have clear title to the land when he sold it. The case reached the Supreme Court, which in a unanimous decision ruled that the state legislature's repeal of the law was unconstitutional. The opinion, written by John Marshall, argued that the sale was a binding contract, which according to Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution cannot be invalidated, even if illegally secured. Today the ruling further protects property rights against popular pressures, and is the earliest case of the Court asserting its right to invalidate state laws conflicting with the Constitution.

===[[w:Martin v. Hunter's Lessee|Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]], 14 U.S 304 (1816)===

During the Revolutionary War, Virginia passed legislation allowing it to take Loyalists' property. The United States signed the Treaty of Paris in 1783 with Britain; it included a clause that stated that the federal government would tell the states to give back the Loyalists' property. A Loyalist named Denny Martin sued in Virginia's state court system on the grounds that Loyalists were to get their properties back in accordance with the treaty.

The case eventually reached the Virginia Supreme Court, which upheld the confiscation on the grounds that the court's interpretation of the treaty was that it did not cover the case. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which decided that the treaty did apply to the case and remanded it back to the Virginia Supreme Court. The court decided that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over cases originating in state courts, and the decision was appealed back to the Supreme Court. Once again, the Supreme Court overturned the Virginia Supreme Court's ruling, arguing that the case involved federal law. The Court's decision was very important because it affirmed that it had supreme power over all courts in regards to federal law and the Constitution.

===[[w:McCulloch v. Maryland|McCulloch v. Maryland]], 17 U.S. 316 (1819)===

This case was a very important test of States' Rights against the power of the federal government. Many states continued to oppose the Bank of the United States after it was reinstated in 1816, mostly because it called for its loans to be owed by the states. In retaliation to this policy, Maryland passed a tax on the bank, which the bank refused to pay. Maryland soon filed suit against James McCulloch, the head of the Baltimore branch of the bank.

The Court's unanimous opinion established two extremely important principles. The first was that, yes, Congress could create the Bank under the doctrine of implied powers. The Constitution specifically lists that Congress has the power to borrow money and regulate commerce (among others), and it can be implied that Congress had the power to create the Bank. The second point that the Court made was that Maryland's tax was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with the Supremacy Clause, which says that states can never willingly impede the federal government. The court reasoned that taxing, if other states decided to adopt Maryland's policy, had the potential to destroy the bank, and thus impede the federal government's efforts to regulate the economy.

===[[w:Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Dartmouth College v. Woodward]], 17 U.S. 518 (1819)===

The Dartmouth College Case was a reiteration of the judicial principle of ''pacta sunt servanda'' (&quot;contracts are to be held&quot;). Dartmouth College was established per a colonial charter in 1769, by King George III. In 1815, the legislature of New Hampshire attempted to change the charter of the College in such a way that the governor would be able to appoint a new president of the College, as well as appoint new members of the Board of Trustees and to create a state board to supervise the school, effectively trying to change the college from private to public institution. The court ruled that the old charter was still valid per the Contract Clause of the Constitution (also cited in Fletcher v. Peck). Essentially, the ruling was that a charter was also a contract, and the state legislature had no right to convert the private institution to a public institution as long as the old charter was in power.

===[[w:Gibbons v. Ogden|Gibbons v. Ogden]], 22 U.S. 1 (1824)===
In Gibbons v. Ogden, the Supreme Court held that the power to regulate interstate commerce was granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The case was argued by some of America's most admired and capable attorneys at the time. Exiled Irish patriot Thomas Addis Emmet and Thomas J. Oakley argued for Ogden, while William Wirt and Daniel Webster argued for Gibbons.

==The Constitution In Crisis and Decision (1850-1871)==

The Union; its fundamental nature and character; the nature and character of states, and sovereignty; the meaning of citizenship; the extraordinary powers of the President; the war powers; the customs, usages, rules, and articles of war; the Great Writ, and its application in times of crisis; the formal ratification of the principles of the Declaration of Independence, and the formal repudiation of the [[w:John Calhoun|Calhounian]] counterrevolutionary ideology of oligarchic slave power despotic tyranny.

This section will depart from the normal style, as there are important changes that were made in the Constitution and Constitutional interpretation through means other than judicial interpretation, such as by means of amendment, or by right of the victor.

===[[w:Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott v. Sandford]], 60 U.S. 393 (1857)===

''Dred Scott'' was perhaps the most controversial Supreme Court decision in all of U.S. history, quite possibly was a major cause of the U.S. Civil War, and is generally regarded by most U.S. historians, scholars, and lawyers as a moment of supreme infamy, when the U.S. unquestionably knew sin. 

Dred Scott was an African-American slave who originally lived in Missouri, and was taken to Illinois, a free state, by his master. Scott sued for freedom, as he was in a free state. The case worked its way through the courts, until it reached the Supreme Court. Although the case could have been dismissed for technical reasons, Chief Justice Roger Taney decided to attempt to resolve the slavery issue in the United States once and for all, by imposing his personal opinion (his personal opinion as a slaver) upon his fellow citizens. Taney declared, simply, that African-Americans were not citizens within the meaning of the Constitution, and had no rights except for what &quot;those who held the power...might choose to grant them&quot;, and thus, not being citizens, in Taney's opinion&lt;ref&gt;Taney's personal view on the potential citizenship of free African-Americans was markedly inconsistent with the expressed opinion of the Framers of the Constitution. During the time when the Framers yet lived, there existed a question as to whether the territory of Missouri was to be admitted into the Union. As is written in Elson, Henry Wm. ''History of the United States of America'' (1905), p. 460-461: &quot;When the people of Missouri adopted a constitution, they inserted a clause making it the duty of the legislature to exclude free Negroes and mulattoes from the commonwealth. This brought on another great debate in Congress. ''The objection to this clause was based on the ground that the Constitution '''guarantees to the citizens of any state''' all the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several states.'' The two houses again failed to agree, and again the decision was made through a joint committee. Henry Clay was the mover and the chairman of this committee, and from this fact he became known as the author of the Missouri Compromise... This committee reported a bill to admit Missouri on an equal footing with the original states, ''on the condition that its constitution should never be construed so as to authorize '''any law by which a citizen of any other state should be excluded from the privileges''' which he enjoyed in other parts of the Union''; and that the legislature of Missouri should pass a solemn act declaring its consent to this condition.&quot; This suggests that the Missouri Compromise - made while Adams, Madison, and Jefferson still lived - very strongly implied that free African Americans were, in fact, citizens of the United States. (However, the 14th Amendment (in theory), the Civil War, and the later Civil Rights Movement (in fact), settled the question, for all time.)&lt;/ref&gt;, had no standing to sue. He dismissed the case.

The most infamous passage of ''Scott'' is as follows:

&quot;The words 'people of the United States' and 'citizens' are synonymous terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the Government through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call the 'sovereign people,' and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty. The question before us is, whether the class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty? We think they are not, and that they are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word 'citizens' in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them.&quot;

It took a civil war and 700,000 dead U.S. citizens, both black and white, to obliterate the stain of ''Scott'' from the Constitution with the blood of patriots and tyrants, to end slavery once and for all, but it was done.

===[[w:Ex parte Merryman|Ex parte Merryman]], (1861)===

''TBD''

Merryman was not decided by the Supreme Court, but is included for purposes of clarity, as it involves the extraordinary powers of the Presidency.

The United States, as it was in 1860, was a vast, sparsely populated, primarily agricultural nation. She was not a Great Power, for the Great Powers of the day were European principalities, kingdoms, and empires who did the world's business at the Docklands of London, the harbors of Amsterdam, and the Palaces of Versailles, The Hague, and Vienna. She was a minor power who kept to herself and was looked upon by the philosophers and thinkers of the time as a minor experiment in popular rule which was not bearing major fruit; to the princes of Europe, the United States was a convenient place to exile their radicals to who were calling for elected governments or civil liberty. In the words of certain Europeans, the United States had &quot;gone from barbarism to decadence without passing through civilization&quot;. Washington, D.C. was viewed as a semi-tropical backwater of minor import; for many European diplomats used to soirees in the imperial courts of France and Prussia, or grand balls in the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, it was a post worthy of substantial hardship pay.

Many of the Far Western states (the Great Plains States and the Rocky Mountain States) were not States at that time, and those regions were mostly unsettled, with the land owned by the Government, but the Government unable to disburse of it at the time in a manner perceived as fair. The Pacific Coast States were settled, but only moderately, and had low levels of industry and moderate levels of agriculture prior to the construction of the Transcontinental Railroads (the completion dates of those being the Union Pacific in 1873; the Southern Pacific in 1882; and the Great Northern in 1891). In the Eastern States, the United States had a moderate population level in the Old Northwest, along with mining, industry, and agriculture; a comparatively high population level in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, where the industry and trade of the nation was concentrated; and a moderate to high population level and large scale agriculture in the Old South. Transportation links in the North, which consisted of the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and the Old Northwest (what we now call the Upper Midwest - beyond the Appalachians to the Mississippi River) were rather developed, to meet the needs of commerce and industry, and the railroads provided transportation from one city to another in the North within the travel of 2-3 days. The South's rail systems were underdeveloped, and transit there was often an extended affair. To the Far Western states, transit would have to be either by steamer or overland; either mode of transit was not particularly fast. It could take a month - or more - for a person to get from one side of the United States to the other. Information did travel much faster than that - the Transcontinental Telegraph permitted the news of the East to reach the West within minutes, while the Pony Express served such purposes prior to that point, with round-trip mail times of days.

The reason for this being important to this case is that the Congress of the United States did not, like it does today, meet during all the year. The Congress was but a part-time legislature; the laws were few and simple, the business of the time was of import but not of great urgency, and following their session, the Congress dissolved and returned to the states and districts, the log cabins, the small farms, the cities, and the plantations from whence they came.

Following the election of the Northerner Abraham Lincoln as President, an insurrection had broke out in certain areas of the United States, as the slave-power of the South was desirous of subduing the anti-slavery North once and for all by fire and the sword, or at the very least, breaking free of the &quot;oppressive&quot; Federal rule so she could once again traffic in the human flesh of the African coast and build a slave empire extending even to Cuba and Mexico, as contemplated by the then dead John Calhoun, chief of the slave-power faction in the Congress at one time. This insurrection had turned into a rebellion, forming an alleged government; South Carolina, a hot-bed of slaving conspiracy where there were more African-Americans in bondage than there were people of any race, had seceded from the Union first, and was followed by the states of the Deep South where the Slave Power was the strongest. The less degenerate slave states of Virginia and Tennessee only saw treason openly fomented in their legislatures at first, and they did not break from the Union yet... Prior to attempts to peacefully settle the crisis, the South Carolinian fire-eaters fired the first shot of the coming war at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, the property of the Federal Union, and with those shots, the war came, the War Between the States, The War of Southern Aggression, The War of Northern Aggression, or as it is known by later times, the U.S. Civil War.

Following the assault on Fort Sumter, the Upper South joined itself to the rebellion, and even Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, only lightly scarred by the lash of the slaver, were rumored to be beset by internal commotion by slavers and slave-power sympathizers who sought to secede from the Federal Union and deliver those states into the hands of the so-called Confederacy.

During the first six or seven months of 1861, the Congress was not assembled in Washington D.C., and it could not be returned into session, because its members were scattered around the nation, word of the emergency traveled slowly, and people traveled like molasses, if they traveled at all. 

During the first year of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln

Compare and contrast with the more moderate opinion of the Court in '''Youngstown'''.

===[[w:Ex parte Milligan|Ex parte Milligan]], 71 U.S. 2 (1866)===

Case involving Confederate sympathizers subjected to (sham) trial by &quot;military commission&quot; based on  order of the so-called unitary executive. Supreme Court ruled that use military commissions or any form of attenuated due process had to be based on military necessity, and proximate in time and space to the actual zone of military operations.

==Second Constitutional Era (1871-1938)==

Substantive due process, &quot;corporate personhood&quot;, &quot;separate but equal&quot;, &quot;freedom of contract&quot;, monopolies, corporations, the national and state level economies, private greed v. public need.

===[[w:Slaughter-House Cases|Slaughter-House Cases]], 83 U.S. 36 (1873)===

===[[w:The Civil Rights Cases|Civil Rights Cases]], 109 U.S. 3 (1883)===

===[[w:Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company|Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company]], 118 U.S. 394 (1886)===

Decision where the scope of the term &quot;person&quot; under the 14th Amendment and the Constitution of the United States was expanded to include legal fictions, such as corporations. This granted to corporations the same rights (such as freedom of speech, freedom of contract) that previously were retained only by human persons, under the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the 14th Amendment. Enormously controversial, as decision allowed corporations to claim the Constitution protected them from popular legislation such as minimum wage laws, health and safety standards, taxation, labor laws, etc. Set the defining theme of the Court's jurisprudence for the next 50 years, until ''Carolene Products'' in 1938.

===[[w:In_re_Debs|In re Debs]], 158 U.S. 564 (1895)===

===[[w:Plessy v. Ferguson|Plessy v. Ferguson]], 163 U.S. 537 (1896)===
The Plessy v. Ferguson decision upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation even in public accommodations (particularly railroads), under the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot;. This case remained the legal basis for Jim Crow segregation laws in the Southern states.

The decision was handed down by a vote of 7 to 1, with the majority opinion written by Justice Henry Billings Brown and the dissent written by Justice John Marshall Harlan. Justice David Josiah Brewer did not participate in the decision. &quot;Separate but equal&quot; remained standard doctrine in U.S. law until its repudiation in the 1954 Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education.

After the high court ruled, the New Orleans Comité des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens) that had brought the suit and that had arranged for Homer Plessy's arrest in order to challenge Louisiana's segregation law, replied, &quot;We, as freemen, still believe that we were right and our cause is sacred.&quot;

===[[w:Insular Cases|Insular Cases]], (1901-1905)===

The Insular Cases were a series of Supreme Court decisions concerning territories annexed by the United States during the 1898 [[w:Spanish-American War|Spanish-American War]] and further annexations. The most significant precedent established by these cases was that &quot;the Constitution does not follow the flag.&quot; This means that the rights of American citizens as granted by the Constitution do not necessarily apply to &quot;American&quot; inhabitants of U.S. territories. These cases were known as Insular Cases because the territories annexed by the U.S. were islands, among them the Philippines, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam. These cases also established that the Constitution only applied to &quot;fully incorporated territories,&quot; meaning that the territories had to be fully incorporated into the United States under the doctrine of territorial incorporation, also established during this time.

===[[w:Lochner v. New York|Lochner v. New York]], 198 U.S. 45 (1905)===

===[[w:Schenck v. United States|Schenck v. United States]], 249 U.S. 47 (1919)===

Schenck v. United States was a United States Supreme Court decision concerning the question of whether the defendant possessed a First Amendment right to free speech against the draft during World War I. Charles Schenck was the Secretary of the Socialist party and was responsible for printing, distributing, and mailing 15,000 leaflets to men eligible for the draft that advocated opposition to the draft. These leaflets contained statements such as; &quot;Do not submit to intimidation&quot;, &quot;Assert your rights&quot;, &quot;If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain.&quot; Ultimately, the case served as the founding of the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; rule, first written in the majority opinion written by Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.

===[[w:United States v. Carolene Products Co.|United States v. Carolene Products Co.]], 304 U.S. 144 (1938)===

==Third Constitutional Era (1938-?)==

Civil rights, equality under the law, the right to privacy, &quot;penumbras formed by emanations&quot;, the meaning of justice, the limits of the executive, the manifold possibilities of liberty.

===[[w:Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization|Hague v. CIO]], 307 U.S. 496 (1939)===

First civil liberties case of the Third Era, involving freedom of assembly, association, and speech; specifically, related to the repression of labor unions by infamous [[w:Frank Hague|Boss Hague]] in New Jersey.

===[[w:Korematsu v. United States|Korematsu v. United States]], 323 U.S. 214 (1944)===

Korematsu v. United States was a decision related to internment of Japanese-Americans (including citizens of the United States) in prison camps during World War II. By Executive Order 9066, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered all Japanese and Japanese American residents of certain parts close to the coast removed in 1942, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This eventually led to the establishment of internment camps for around 120,000 ethnic Japanese, most of them citizens of the United States, in the military zones established by the executive order. In this decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the internment, voting by 6-5 that the requirement to protect the United States against espionage was more important than the rights of Japanese immigrants and citizens in the United States.

===[[w:Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer|Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]], 343 U.S. 579 (1952)===
During the Korean War, a labor dispute arose between the Steelworkers (an association of workers, called a labor union) and the various steel mills who employed them. The steel mills claimed that the workers in question were being paid too much, and, after difficult negotiations, decided to lockout these workers, so that they could avoid paying them. The workers were outraged that they were being locked out, due to the enormous unfulfilled needs of soldiers on the battlefield for tanks and weapons that couldn't be produced and were being ignored due to the position of the mill owners, and perhaps also due to the fact that they weren't able to work or get paid.

President [[w:Harry Truman|Harry Truman]] decided to intervene, claiming that due to the fact that a war was going on, he, as &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, could temporarily seize and run the steel mills under the Federal Government so as to continue production during the war. This outraged both the steel mills and the workers; both sides didn't believe the government could do such a thing, as no law had been passed to allow those sorts of actions to take place; indeed, most people believed that unilateral actions like Truman's, in this case, were exactly the type of thing the Constitution was there to prevent.

The owners of the steel mills sued the government for seizing the steel mills. Within several weeks, due to the emergency nature of the situation, the case came before the Supreme Court.

The Court ruled against the Government, finding that there were no provisions in the law or the Constitution that allowed the government to seize private industry (or to force workers to work) during a labor dispute. Though the decision was mixed--almost every Justice wrote an opinion--it was definitively against the Government. Justice Harlan? wrote the most famous opinion in this case--delineating three spheres of Presidential power--that is considered to be the single most authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the scope of Presidential powers since the immediate aftermath of the Civil War; Harlan's? opinion still is considered authoritative to this day.

This case, although it might seem minor to the reader, has great meta-Constitutional importance--Presidential powers have greatly expanded since the Framing of the Constitution--and their exact scope is extremely controversial, especially in the past 30-40 years.

The mills were returned to their owners, who (very quickly) reached agreement with the workers, and the dispute was resolved.

===[[w:Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]], 347 U.S. 483 (1954)===

'''VERY IMPORTANT''' Supreme Court case which decided that [[w:Racial segregation|racial segregation]] in public schools was contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution; one factor that set in motion the [[w:civil rights movement|civil rights]] movement amongst African-Americans.
Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),[1] was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court, which overturned earlier rulings going back to Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, by declaring that state laws that established separate public schools for black and white students denied black children equal educational opportunities. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Warren Court's unanimous (9-0) decision stated that &quot;separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.&quot; As a result, de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This victory paved the way for integration and the civil rights movement.[2]

===[[w:Mapp v. Ohio|Mapp v. Ohio]], 367 U.S. 643 (1961)===

The Exclusionary Rule protects defendants in criminal cases from having unlawfully obtained evidence used against them in court, such as stolen items found during a search of a residence by police without a warrant. For many years, the Exclusionary Rule only was applied at the federal level. Federal criminal prosecutions are an extremely tiny minority of all criminal prosecutions in the United States; most prosecutions occur at the state level, including nearly all of those for extraordinarily serious crimes, such as murder and rape. (Federal crimes include offenses against federal property and agents; certain crimes taking place in multiple states, such as a spree of bank robberies; interstate conspiracies, such as a drug-smuggling ring; crimes taking place under color of law, such as police brutality or judicial corruption; and also include acts of terrorism, military crimes, espionage, and treason. The states are responsible for the prosecution of all other criminal acts, from drunken disorderliness all the way to premeditated murder.)

In Mapp, the Supreme Court found that the Exclusionary Rule applied to the states, and that evidence unlawfully obtained could not be used for state prosecutions, in addition to federal ones. The grounds for this were found in the Fourteenth Amendment, which required that states not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; liberty was held to include those rights protected by the Bill of Rights, which had previously only applied to acts of the Federal Government. 

Mapp forced wholesale changes in police procedure throughout the United States, as police were now required to obtain warrants to gather evidence that could be used in court. (Previously, police were supposed to obtain warrants to search homes, but as the evidence gained by warrantless (i.e. unlawful) searches was admitted regardless of whether it was obtained by warrant or not, this rule was widely ignored.) In addition, Mapp signaled an increased level of scrutiny by the Supreme Court over police practices, which has continued to the present day.

===[[w:Gideon v. Wainwright|Gideon v. Wainwright]], 372 U.S. 335 (1963)===

Case that decided that accused persons had right to a lawyer even if they could not afford one.

===[[w:Escobedo v. Illinois|Escobedo v. Illinois]], 378 U.S. 478 (1964)===

===[[w:Griswold v. Connecticut|Griswold v. Connecticut]], 381 U.S. 479 (1965)===
This Supreme Court case was brought by a married couple who claimed that their fundamental liberties were infringed by a Connecticut statute that outlawed the sale of birth control devices and medicines within the state. The Supreme Court agreed, finding that their Constitutional right to privacy was infringed by the Connecticut birth control ban, and invalidated it for married couples. 

Justice Douglass famously wrote that the right to privacy, a right not explicitly written into the text of the Constitution, was instead implied by &quot;penumbras formed by emanations&quot; by the other enumerated rights reserved to the people and listed in the Constitution, such as the right to be free from unreasonable searches without a warrant. Especially after Roe v. Wade, some conservatives have used the &quot;penumbra&quot; passage to decry what they believe to be the alleged judicial &quot;creation&quot; of rights not found in the Constitution.

Though this case was relatively uncontroversial when it was decided, as it only impacted married couples, it laid the foundation for the Court's decision 8 years later in Roe v. Wade, where the Court overturned all laws banning abortion in the US as violations of the right to privacy, which is perhaps one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions ever.

===[[w:Miranda v. Arizona|Miranda v. Arizona]], 384 U.S. 436 (1966)===

Case requiring that the famous [[w:Miranda warning|Miranda warnings]], advising arrested persons of their right to remain silent, to have a lawyer present, and to have a lawyer appointed for free, in the event of lack of money, be given to persons arrested by police prior to interrogation.

===[[w:Brandenburg v. Ohio|Brandenburg v. Ohio]], 395 U.S. 444 (1969)===

Free speech case. Changed what remained of old &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test to &quot;incitement to imminent lawless action test&quot;. Important in understanding U.S. free speech jurisprudence.

===[[w:Roe v. Wade|Roe v. Wade]], 410 U.S. 113 (1973)===
Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a famous and extraordinarily controversial Supreme Court case that found the Constitution of the United States prohibits outlawing of abortion, or the imposition of undue restrictions upon it, at least during the initial stages of a pregnancy. Roe is likely the most controversial Supreme Court case in 20th century U.S. history, and ranks among Bush v. Gore (2000), Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company (1886), and Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), as one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of all time. 

Roe, a woman from the state of Texas, had an unwanted pregnancy. Texas law, at that time, forbade the termination of pregnancy except under certain medical circumstances, such as the endangerment of the pregnant woman's life. Roe sued the state of Texas, alleging that her 14th Amendment right to privacy was being violated by the law forbidding termination of pregnancy. The case worked its way up through the several Federal courts, and reached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed with Roe, and found the Texas law to be an unconstitutional invasion of Roe's right to privacy between doctor and patient. The decision in Roe was unique, though, as the Court did not just strike down the Texas law; it issued guidelines as to what regulation of abortion it would consider permissible. (It is normally very unusual for the Court to say what is allowed to government, versus determining what is forbidden for government to do.) The Court decided that during the first 3 months of a pregnancy, abortion was acceptable for any reason; during the second 3 months, regulation to protect health could be imposed, such as requiring that abortions take place in hospitals; and during the last 3 months, abortion could be generally forbidden, due to the late stage and development of the pregnancy.

This decision caused immediate and immense controversy throughout the United States. Persons of numerous faiths objected to it (especially Catholics and conservative Protestants); feminist &amp; civil rights groups applauded it; liberal groups (the left of the American political spectrum) were generally viewed as supportive of Roe, while conservative groups (the right of the American political spectrum) were generally viewed as being opposed to the decision. 

====Support &amp; Opposition to Roe====

Political and religious stereotypes scarcely capture the immense political and legal debate about the implications of Roe. This section reviews a few of these arguments.

Supporters of Roe view Roe as an important decision that affirmed what they consider the basic rights of women, especially the right for women to control their own body and reproductive systems. Other supporters view Roe as an important triumph in the area of reproductive public policy, establishing the right to control over active pregnancy into the law of the land. Still others focus on sociological arguments, sometimes claiming that Roe led to decreases in crime in the years since the decision, as unwanted pregnancies, and therefore the number of unsupportable children was reduced by the availability of abortion. (Others claim that the decrease in unwanted children is due to effective contraception widely available upon request, and the rise of comprehensive sex education.) Still others claim that it is hypocrisy for people to object to Roe, especially men, who will never have the &quot;opportunity&quot; to walk a mile in the shoes of a teenage woman with an unwanted pregnancy, which will severely impact her future choices as well as cause her and her family shame. This view can be expressed by the slogan: &quot;Don't like abortion? Get a vasectomy!&quot;

Objections to Roe are numerous. Legal objections can be broken down into several arguments. One is that the Supreme Court, rather than interpreting the Constitution, legislated from the bench, in either upholding or greatly expanding the scope of the unwritten privacy right into an area which is generally not considered a subject of privacy, namely the permissibility of medical procedures performed by state-licensed health-care professionals. Individuals subscribing to this argument may take the view that irregardless of whether abortion is good public policy or not, it is not a legal matter implicating fundamental liberties, due to the uncertain origin and tortured nature of the privacy argument, but a political matter, for the people's representatives to consider and decide upon. Another is that the Supreme Court failed to consider the possibility that fetuses (or, as some term them, babies), may have rights as well as the pregnant woman, and those potential rights have to be analyzed as part of any decisions surrounding abortion. Others focus on the implications of decisions of this nature, viewing them as overreaching, and setting dangerous precedents that allow the Court to deeply intrude into political questions that go further than fundamental liberties (like freedom of speech, or the right to a fair trial), such as the Court was viewed by many as doing in Bush v. Gore. 

Other objections include those of morality and religion. These objections are often raised by conservative Protestants, as well as Catholics, in general. However, a number of liberal Protestant and Catholics, as well as non-religious people also object to abortion, as what they view as a violation of human rights.

====Impact and Implications of Roe====

It can be scarcely disputed that Roe has caused immeasurable political conflict between supporters and opponents of abortion that goes on to this day; some even believe that Roe and the conflicts surrounding it have caused the basic consensus underlying the foundations of United States democracy to be injured. It is arguable that Roe was the last blow that shattered the [[w:New Deal Coalition|New Deal Coalition]] of [[w:liberalism in the united states|liberals]] and moderates that had governed the U.S. for perhaps 40 years at the time. Objectors to Roe no longer saw the general political community of the United States as sharing their values, and opted out of that community, seeking and creating new political communities within and based upon their faith. These faith-based political communities would later do battle with the ideology-based political communities created during and in the wake of the Vietnam War, and forged in place by the great unrest of [[w:Protests_of_1968|1968]].&lt;br&gt;

This clash of beliefs came to be characterised by conservatives as a 'Culture War' which became an evocative touchstone of their political activism from the 1980s onwards.

===[[w:United States v. Nixon|United States v. Nixon]], 418 U.S. 683 (1974)===

This case originated out of a dispute over a subpoena for evidence pertinent to special prosecutor Archibald Cox's Watergate investigation. Because of Cox's insistence that President Nixon hand over his infamous audiotaped conversations, he was fired as a part of Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre. Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski, continued to pursue the subpoena. Nixon continued to refuse to hand the tapes over, and cited his [[w:executive privilege|executive privilege]] in asserting their confidentiality. Jaworski filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court in hopes of obtaining a court order forcing Nixon to obey the subpoena.

Although in private deliberations, the justices did not come to a unanimous opinion, they decided to rule unanimously with the majority's opinion in order to make the ruling more definitive to Nixon and pressure him not to ignore it. The opinion held that, not only as established in ''Marbury v. Madison'' that the Court was the final say concerning whether or not laws were constitutional, the Court could also decide how the President's powers are limited by the Constitution. The court also held that executive privilege did not apply to evidence pertinent to criminal cases. Most importantly, the Court ruled that, using the power it had affirmed, that nobody, including the President of the United States, was above the law.

===[[w:Regents of the University of California v. Bakke|Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]], 438 U.S. 265 (1978)===

Supreme Court case that ruled that quotas as a form of affirmative action (i.e. a guaranteed minimum percentage reservation of seats in a public institution for minority groups who were subject to past discrimination) were violative of the Constitution, and were thus illegal.

===[[w:Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v. Hardwick]], 478 U.S. 186 (1986)===

Supreme Court case that found that laws forbidding and criminalizing private, consensual, non-commercial sexual conduct between unrelated adults that a legislative body found to be immoral were compatible with the Constitutional guarantees of liberty and privacy. Overruled and reversed as being wrongly decided in the first instance by Lawrence v. Texas (2003).

===[[w:Texas v. Johnson|Texas v. Johnson]], 491 U.S. 397 (1989)===

===[[w:Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood v. Casey]], 505 U.S. 833 (1992)===

===[[w:Romer v. Evans|Romer v. Evans]], 517 U.S. 620 (1996)===

===[[w:Bush v. Gore|Bush v. Gore]], 531 U.S. 98 (2000)===

This case is notable, not because it set any new precedent, but because of the magnitude of the decision: the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 Presidential election, due to voting irregularities in Florida.

===[[w:Lawrence v. Texas|Lawrence v. Texas]], 539 U.S. 558 (2003)===

Lawrence, a gay man, was in his apartment, having consensual intimate transactions with his unrelated sexual partner, when local police, responding to a weapons complaint of shots fired, suddenly entered his apartment to search for weapons. No weapons were found, but Lawrence and his partner were discovered by the police ''in flagrante delicto''. They were cited by the police for &quot;unnatural sexual intercourse&quot;, a crime under the law of the State of Texas.

Lawrence and his partner, Gardner, decided to fight the charges, on the grounds that: 
# The law only applied to &quot;unnatural sexual intercourse&quot; between persons of the same sex, but not against persons of the opposite sex engaging in the same sort of &quot;unnatural sexual intercourse&quot;. This, claimed Lawrence, deprived him of the equal protection of the law.
# The law was an unconstitutional invasion of Lawrence's and Gardner's privacy and liberty, as the &quot;crime&quot; Lawrence and Gardner were accused of were transactions of the most intimate character, were consensual, were non-commercial and took place in private, behind closed doors, in a private space where the authority of the state had no power to enter, nor to regulate such transactions, absent some compelling showing of harm.

The State of Texas argued that the charges should be upheld on the grounds that the state has the right to determine and regulate morality, including morality in private spaces, and that laws forbidding homosexuality were found to be constitutional in the case of Bowers v. Hardwick, creating a precedent that had to be upheld by the Court.

The Court agreed with Lawrence and Gardner. Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, concluded:
 
“These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.

Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do. The decision in Bowers would deny them this right. Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now is overruled.

The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. “It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.” Casey, supra, at 847. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.

Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.&quot;

===[[w:Hamdi v. Rumsfeld|Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]], 542 U.S. 507 (2004)===

===[[w:Hamdan v. Rumsfeld|Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]], 548 U.S. 557 (2006)===

===[[w:Boumediene v. Bush|Boumediene v. Bush]], 553 U.S. 723 (2008)===

===[[w:District of Columbia v. Heller|District of Columbia v. Heller]], 554 U.S. 570 (2008)===

This case involved the interpretation of the [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Second Amendment]], appertaining to militias as well as the right to keep and bear arms, as well as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fourteenth Amendment]], which secures and specifies that the people retain certain rights, including those to life, to liberty, and to property, that no state government may deny them.

Heller, the petitioner, lived in the District of Columbia, whose law forbade the possession of handguns within said District, except under certain very narrow circumstances, which Heller was not eligible for. Believing the Second Amendment to apply to individuals, Heller sued, claiming that his right to keep and bear arms was being infringed by the District.

The Supreme Court agreed with Heller, finding that the Second Amendment does indeed secure to individuals the right to keep and bear arms, and that the Fourteenth Amendment applies this right to the several States; the District's handgun ban was thus overturned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The U.S. presidential election of 1860 was a realigning election. The nation had been divided through most of the 1850s on the issue of slavery, with Northerners and Southerners disagreeing over whether or not it should be expanded to the territories, and fighting for each new state admitted to the Union. In 1860, this issue finally came to a head, bringing Abraham Lincoln and the Republican party to power, while it simultaneously fractured the formerly dominant Democratic Party in two.

The immediate result was the secession of seven southern states to form their own country and the outbreak of the American Civil War.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;Opium Wars&quot; were two wars that were the climax of a long dispute between Britain and China. In the second, France fought alongside the British. This dispute was around the Opium trade which was perceived from two different culturtal and economic vantage points -- as with any and all global economic conflicts between two parties. The Chinese Emperor had banned opium in China due to its harmful effects on Chinese citizens and its denigratory impact on the Chinese culture; The British Empire, however, saw opium as a profitable good for commercial trade, as its import would help balance the huge trade deficit with China. The Opium Wars and the many treaties signed afterward led in part to the downfall of the Chinese economy, as many countries followed Britain and forced more treaties to increase trade within China.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria) (24 May, 1819 – 22 January, 1901) was the eminent Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June, 1837, and Empress of India from 1 January, 1877, until her death in 1901. Her reign lasted more than sixty-three years, longer than that of any other British monarch. As well as being Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, she was also the first monarch to use the title Empress of India. The reign of Victoria was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. The Victorian Era was at the height of the Industrial Revolution, a period of significant social, economic, and technological change in the United Kingdom. In that period the United Kingdom became the largest superpower the world had ever seen. Victoria, who was largely of German descent, was the last monarch of the House of Hanover; her successor belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, KG, PC (21 December 1804 – 19 April 1881) was an English statesman and literary figure. He served in government for three decades, twice as Prime Minister – the first and thus far only person of Jewish parentage to do so, although Disraeli was baptised in the Anglican Church at an early age. Disraeli's most lasting achievement was the creation of the modern Conservative Party after the Corn Laws schism of 1846.

Although a major figure in the protectionist wing of the Conservative Party after 1846, Disraeli's relations with the other leading figures in the party, particularly Lord Derby, the overall leader, were often strained. Not until the 1860s would Derby and Disraeli be on easy terms, and the latter's succession of the former assured. From 1852 onwards Disraeli's career would also be marked by his often intense rivalry with William Ewart Gladstone, who eventually rose to become leader of the Liberal Party. In this duel, Disraeli was aided by his warm friendship with Queen Victoria, who came to detest Gladstone during the latter's first premiership in the 1870s. In 1876 Disraeli was raised to the peerage as the Earl of Beaconsfield, capping nearly four decades in the House of Commons. He died in 1881.

Before and during his political career Disraeli was well-known as a literary and social figure, although his novels are not generally regarded as belonging to the first rank of Victorian literature. He mainly wrote romances, of which Sibyl and Vivian Grey are perhaps the best-known today. He was and is unusual among British Prime Ministers for having gained equal social and political renown.

== CTRL-F12/ALT-F12 ==

It seems under 2.41 (on Linux, anyway) CTRL-F12 renders the animation, and ALT-F12 does nothing.  The menus don't seem to reflect this (i.e. on the Render menu, Render Current Image says F12, while Render Animation has no listed hotkey), but CTRL-F12 rendered over and over, incrementing the number in the cursor, (which I assume is the frame count while rendering the animation).

This happens on Mac OS X 10.4.7 with 2.42 as well.

As of at least June 2006 the windows version of Blender will add the .jpg extention to the file  (at least mine does).

== Render shows a different figure from the one in the viewport. ==

(Reader (Colin Connaughton):- My render is quite different from the figure in my viewport. The viewport gives what I would expect with a cube with one vertex pulled out. The render is a bit like that, but the surface which was pulled out is not planar, it is bent so that it stays with the main cube and then branches off towards the pulled vertex. Is this because of some render setting? Can this be rectified so that the render matches the figure?)

(Reader (Tony): From what I understand about how this works at this point the reason it looks different is because it is rendering the image that the Camera see's not what is in the viewport. If you zoom out you will see a camera as well as a light in the sceen.)

(Reader Colin: Thanks Tony, but I've had a new try on a new cube. The figure and the render are different as follows:- I pulled one top vertex down towards the bottom of the cube. That meant that the 4 top vertices were no longer in a plane. So there is a crease. In the viewport the crease (V-shaped) is along the line joining the pulled vertex and the diagonally opposite vertex on the top. In the render the crease (^-shaped this time) is along the line joining the other two vertices on the top!

I suppose the program must choose one way or the other and there is no reason to prefer either. Also, if the model was finely meshed or if the faces were triangular, it would not matter. So I no longer see this as a problem.)

Reader William: I've gotten to this point and the render window is always black. I have a lamp in the scene. If I render an animation my temp folder starts filling with images, but I still don't see anything in the render window.

== Object mode necessary? ==
I can render just fine if I'm still in edit mode by pressing F12. Is the switch back to object mode really necessary?

== Error no camera ==
Sorry total novice to Blender, the tutorial says to hit F12 to render a model, but I get a Error that there is no camera.  Is there a tutorial for adding a simple camera?

== Camera exists, can't align with cube ==
After wading through about all the pages on getting around the UI, I've finally got to the point where I can render something. Hurrah! The only problem is, I keep getting a blank blue page. Some experimentation tells me that the camera is not pointed at the cube, but getting the two to line up is a freaking nightmare. 

So, if you are seeing a blank blue page after rendering, the answer would be to mess around with the numpad until you get the camera (the triangle wiremesh) near the cube. I found that num8 and num6 where the most helpful.

== Missing pictures ==
The pictures from that link to the other tutorial on working with cameras are missing...

== CMD-Tab on Mac ==

CMD-Tab on Mac switches between apps, not windows. CMD-` switches between windows in most Mac apps, but this doesn't appear to be implemented in Blender.

== Blender 2.5 ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would like to introduce this book after the [[Control Systems]] book is introduced and reaches steady-state. Hopefully, this will be no later then June. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:02, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

This book will eventually be a repository for information in designing VLSI systems. It will be a logical conclusion from the VLSI section in the [[Embedded Systems]] book. We will talk about practical uses of VLSI, VLSI chips, compilers, etc... We will talk about state diagrams, and other things. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:16, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

Do you want to focus on all the nifty things we can do with FPGAs?
Or will this go even further to talk about full-custom digital chip design?
(Or go even further to talk about full-custom analog chip design?)
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 11:33, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

:I was thinking that custom digital/analog chip design would be a pretty expansive subject to talk about, and we would probably benefit from having a book right now just focusing on FPGAs. of course, this raises the question of whether we should rename this book to &quot;FPGA Programming&quot;, or something more specific. I think that this book should generally focus on FPGA programming, Verilog, VHDL, and topics of similar interest. We can discuss broader topics in a different book, i think. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Digital Signal Processing|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:19, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

::Your sugesstion to change the title I think is wise. VLSI is a term to state how many transistors are in a chip. It is true however, that FPGAs today are pretty much VLSI size chips. A VLSI Design book (or better yet a book on chip design with a VLSI design section) wouldnt be a bad idea either for a future book, but I have no know how on that subject as of yet. If I can I would like to suggest that you rename the title to &quot;Programable Logic Design&quot;, since there are alot more programable logic devices other than FPGAs (CPLDs are like FPGAs but they are corase grain and have less gates but use the same languages as an FPGA). I also would like to offer help in this article, I havent used an FPGA extensively yet but,I do know VHDL and how a FPGA works. Oh also I was going to ask if you could add a section on SystemC another HDL type language but one that is just starting to become known. --[[User:Asm2750|Asm2750]] 12:27, 3/22/2006

:::Excellent suggestions, all. This is currently just an outline for a book, although I would like to introduce it onto a bookshelf soon that that people such as yourself can start contributing to it. The title &quot;Programmable Logic Design&quot; is a very good one, and more too the point. I originally focused on FPGA as a matter of habit (FPGAs are what I personally use in my research), but we can definately cover CPLDs as well. Also, we will most certainly cover System C. I can't imagine a PGD book without it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe in good food - it has to taste good, be satisfying, and be nutritious. 

==Health==
Health does not require fretting about food - in fact, being neurotic probably means you won't get very old. 

One of the most surefire ways to delay aging is to [http://www.calorierestriction.org/ consume less calories] while still getting proper nutrition. If this means going hungry, then no thanks. But we can imitate the [http://www.okicent.org centenarians of Okinawa] - they have maintained their health by eating well but eat high water content food, which is filling but with less calories. This means lots of vegetables. 

The book [[wikipedia:French Women Don't Get Fat|''French Women Don't Get Fat - The Secret of Eating for Pleasure'']] has helped me in this regard - it's helped me enjoy my food more and feel satisfied without overeating. Do what works for you, as long as you enjoy it. I think the [http://nosdiet.com/ No S diet] has some good ideas - e.g. avoiding snacking. Not sure I can manage that... but I've learnt that it's okay to get hungry, and that way I enjoy my meal all the more. 

And of course, don't forget to exercise. The best way to ensure you get exercise is to sell your car. And you'll reduce your stress levels and improve your finances at the same time. If you can't sell your car because there's no public transport, then keep this in mind next time you vote. And try to choose better next time you move house.

==Great dishes==
Coming soon... the list of foods that I enjoy and which have created an impression when I've served them. They're quite economical as they're vegetarian; they take a bit of time - from 30 to 90 min of relaxed preparation and cooking time - but they're worth it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The name Greco-Turkish War is given to two armed conflicts between Greece and Turkey or its predecessor the Ottoman Empire

*The Greco-Turkish War of 1897 (also called the Thirty Days' War) 
*The Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 (also called the War in Asia Minor, the Catastrophe of Asia Minor, and in Turkey part of the Turkish War of Independence)

The Greco–Turkish War of 1919–1922, also called the War in Asia Minor, and in Turkey considered a part of the Turkish War of Independence, was a war between Greece and Turkey fought in the wake of World War I.

This political context of this conflict is linked to secret agreements on sharing of Ottoman Empire at the end of WWI. Military history begins with the Armistice of Mudros. The war arose because the western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire if Greece entered the war on the Allied side. These included eastern Thrace, the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, and parts of western Anatolia around the city of Smyrna (İzmir)

In return to the contribution of the Greek army in the war effort, the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which ended the First World War in Asia Minor and in parallel determined the future of the Ottoman Empire, assigned eastern Thrace and the millet of Smyrna to Greece.

Around that time Mustafa Kemal, the leader of a group of Turkish revolutionaries, was forming in Anatolia, the Turkish National Movement. The revolutionaries repudiated the Treaty of Sèvres and prepared for defense of what they believed was their national land given up by the weak Ottoman government to the enemy.

In May 1919, Greek troops landed on Smyrna (İzmir) and occupied the city and the surroundings under cover of French, British and American ships. The Greeks of Smyrna, who were the majority of the city's population, and other Christians greeted the Greek troops as liberators. The Turkish population though saw this as an invading force, as they resented the Greeks and presumably preferred to be under Turkish rule.

The resistance started immediately, mainly by small groups of irregular Turkish troops in the suburbs and the Greeks had many losses. In the summer of 1920, the Greek army, launched successful attacks and extended its zone of occupation over all Western and North Western Asia Minor. Greeks already occupied Eastern Thrace.

In October 1920, with the encouragement of Lloyd George who intended to increase the pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of Sevrès, the Greek army advanced further east into Anatolia with the intention of defeating the Kemalist forces before they were ready to attack the Greek perimeter near the coast. They faced little resistance as the Turks were retreating orderly. This advancement begun under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began Venizelos fell from power and was replaced by Dimitrios Gounaris, who appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior commands. King Constantine took personal command of the army at Smyrna (İzmir).

=Phasors=
== Variables ==
Variables are defined the same way. But there is a difference. Before variables were either &quot;known&quot; or &quot;unknown.&quot; Now there is a sort of in between. 

At this point the concept of a constant function (a number) and a variable function (varies with time) needs to be reviewed. See this [[/student professor /]] dialogue. Knowns are described in terms of functions, unknowns are computed based upon the knowns and are also functions. 

For example:
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = M_v \cos (\omega t + \phi_v)&lt;/math&gt; voltage varying with time

Here &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol for a function. It is assigned a function of the symbols &lt;math&gt;M_v, \omega, \phi_v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Typically time is not ever solved for. 

Time remains an unknown. Furthermore all power, voltage and current turn into equations of time. Time is not solved for. Because time is everywhere, it can be eliminated from the equations. Integrals and derivatives turn into algebra and the answers can be purely numeric (before time is added back in). 

At the last moment, time is put back into voltage, current and power and the final solution is a function of time.

Most of the math in this course has these steps:
# describe knowns and unknowns in the time domain, describe all equations
# change knowns into phasors, eliminate derivatives and integrals in the equations
# solve numerically or symbolically for unknowns in the phasor domain
# transform unknowns back into the time domain

==Passive circuit output is similar to input ==

If the input to a linear circuit is a sinusoid, then the output from the circuit will be a sinusoid. Specifically, if we have a voltage sinusoid as such:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = M_v \cos (\omega t + \phi_v)&lt;/math&gt;

Then the current through the linear circuit will also be a sinusoid, although its magnitude and phase may be different quantities:

:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = M_i \cos (\omega t + \phi_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that both the voltage and the current are sinusoids with the same radial frequency, but different magnitudes, and different phase angles. Passive circuit elements cannot change the frequency of a sinusoid, only the magnitude and the phase. Why then do we need to write &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in every equation, when it doesnt change? For that matter, why do we need to write out the cos( ) function, if that never changes either? The answers to these questions is that ''we don't need to write these things every time.'' Instead, engineers have produced a short-hand way of writing these functions, called &quot;phasors&quot;.

==Phasor Transform==
Phasors are a type of &quot;transform.&quot; We are transforming the circuit math so that time disappears. Imagine going to a place where time doesn't exist. 

We know that every function can be written as a series of sine waves of various frequencies and magnitudes added together. (Look up fourier transform animation). The entire world can be constructed from [[:w:Matter_wave|sin waves]]. Here, one sine wave is looked at, the repeating nature (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;) is stripped away. Whats left is a phasor. Since time is made of circles, and if we consider just one of these circles, we can move to a world where time doesn't exist and circles are &quot;things&quot;. Instead of the word &quot;world&quot;, use the word &quot;domain&quot; or &quot;plane&quot; as in two dimensions. 

Math in the Phasor domain is almost the same as DC circuit analysis. What is different is that inductors and capacitors have an impact that needs to be accounted for.

The transform into the Phasors plane or domain and transforming back into time is based upon Euler's equation. It is the reason you studied imaginary numbers in past math class.

== Euler's Equation ==
[[File:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|Euler's Formula]]
Euler started at these three series. Obviously there is a relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{x} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

He did the following:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = 1 + i x + \frac{i^2 x^2}{2!} + \frac{i^ 3 x^3}{3!} + \frac{i^ 4 x^4}{4!} + \frac{i^ 5 x^5}{5!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = 1 + i x - \frac{x^2}{2!} - i\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + i\frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} - i\frac{x^7}{7!} \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = (1  - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots) + i (x - \frac{x^3}{3!}  + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Set x = &amp;pi; and:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi} = -1&lt;/math&gt;

Euler's formula is ubiquitous in mathematics, physics, and engineering. The physicist [[:w:Richard Feynman|Richard Feynman]] called the equation &quot;our jewel&quot; and &quot;one of the most remarkable, almost astounding, formulas in all of mathematics.&quot;

A more general version of Euler's equation is: 

:&lt;math&gt;M e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} = M \cos (\omega t + \phi) + j M \sin (\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation allows us to view sinusoids as complex exponential functions. A cyclic function represented as a voltage, current or power given in terms of radial frequency and phase angle turns into an arrow having length &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; (magnitude) and angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (phase) in the phasor domain/plane or a point having both a real (&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) and imaginary (&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) coordinate in the complex domain/plane. 

Generically, the phasor &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, (which could be voltage, current or power) can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = X + jY&lt;/math&gt; (rectangular coordinates)&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M_v \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt; (polar coordinates)

We can graph the point (X, Y) on the complex plane and draw an arrow to it showing the relationship between &lt;math&gt;X,Y,\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

Using this fact, we can get the angle from the origin of the complex plane to out point (X, Y) with the function:

{{eqn|Angle equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_C = \arctan(\frac{Y}{X})&lt;/math&gt;

And using the pythagorean theorem, we can find the magnitude of C -- the distance from the origin to the point (X, Y) -- as:

{{eqn|Pythagorean Theorem}}
:&lt;math&gt;M_C = |\mathbb{C}| = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Phasor Symbols ==

{{SideBox|Phasors don't account for the frequency information, so make sure you write down the frequency some place safe.}}

Suppose in the time domain:
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = M_v e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}&lt;/math&gt;
In the phasor domain, this voltage is expressed like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = M_v \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt;
The radial velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; disappears from known functions (not the derivate and integral operations) and reappears in the time expression for the unknowns.

== Not Vectors ==

Contrary to the statement made in this heading, phasors (phase vectors), are vectors.  Phasors form a vector space with additional structure, hence they have some properties that are not common to all vector spaces; these additional properties exist because phasors form a field - thus you also get division.

For more details see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor_(electronics)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like many kinds of vectors they have additional struct
Phasors will always be written out either with a large bold letter (as above). They are not a vector. Vectors have two or more real axes that are not related by Euler, but are independent. They share some math in two dimensions, but this math diverges. 

::::::'''Phasors can be divided, but vectors can not.''' 

Voltage can be divided by current (in the phasor domain), but East can not be divided by North (vectors can not be divided). Vectors move into three or more dimensions of linear algebra math that help build complicated structures in the real world such as [[:w:Space_frame|space frames]]. Phasors move into more complicated transforms related to differential equation math and electronics.

[[File:Cross_product_animation.gif|thumb|cross product visualization]]
The math of phasors is exactly the same as ordinary math, except with imaginary numbers. Vectors demand new mathematical operations such as dot product and cross product:

*The dot product of vectors finds the shadow of one vector on another.
*The cross product of vectors combines vectors into a third vector perpendicular to both.

== Cosine Convention ==

{{SideBox|In this book, all phasors correspond to a '''cosine''' function, not a '''sine''' function.}}

It is important to remember which trigonometric function your phasors are mapping to. Since a phasor only includes information on magnitude and phase angle, it is impossible to know whether a given phasor maps to a sin( ) function, or a cos( ) function instead. By convention, this wikibook and most electronic texts/documentation map to the cosine function.

If you end up with an answer that is sin, convert to cos by subtracting 90 degrees:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\omega t + \phi) = cos(\omega t + \phi - \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

If your simulator requires the source to be in sin form, but the starting point is cos, then convert to sin by adding 90 degrees:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t + \phi) = sin(\omega t + \phi + \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

== Phasor Concepts ==

Inside the phasor domain, concepts appear and are named. Inductors and capacitors can be coupled with their derivative operator transforms and appear as imaginary resistors called &quot;reactance.&quot; The combination of resistance and reactance is called &quot;impedance.&quot; Impedance can be treated algebraically as a phasor although technically it is not. Power concepts such as real, reactive, apparent and power factor appear in the phasor domain. Numeric math can be done in the phasor domain. Symbols can be manipulated in the phasor domain.

== Phasor Math ==
{{SideBox|There is more information about Phasors in&lt;br&gt; '''[[Circuit Theory/Phasor Arithmetic|The Appendix]]'''}}
Phasor math turns into the imaginary number math which is reviewed below.

Phasor A can be multiplied by phasor B:

{{eqn|Phasor Multiplication}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A} \times \mathbb{B} = (M_a \times M_b) \angle (\phi_a + \phi_b)&lt;/math&gt;

The phase angles add because in the time domain they are exponents of two things multiplied together. 

{{eqn|Phasor Division}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A} / \mathbb{B} = (M_a / M_b) \angle (\phi_a - \phi_b)&lt;/math&gt;

Again the phase angles are treated like exponents ... so they subtract. 

The magnitude and angle form of phasors can not be used for addition and subtraction. For this, we need to convert the phasors into rectangular notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = X + jY&lt;/math&gt;
Here is how to convert from polar form (magnitude and angle) to rectangular form (real and imaginary)
:&lt;math&gt;X = M \cos (\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y = M \sin (\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Once in rectangular form: 
*Real parts get add or subtract 
*Imaginary parts add or subtract

{{eqn|Phasor Addition}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{A} + \mathbb{B} = (X_A + X_B) + j(Y_A + Y_B) = X_C + jY_C&lt;/math&gt;

Here is how to convert from rectangular form to polar form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M_c \angle \phi_c = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \angle \arctan(\frac{Y}{X})&lt;/math&gt;

Once in polar phasor form, conversion back into the time domain is easy:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(M e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}) = M \cos (\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

== Function transformation Derivation ==

&lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents either voltage, current or power.

:&lt;math&gt;g(t)=G_m cos(\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt; starting point&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(t)=G_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j(\omega t + \phi)})&lt;/math&gt; from Euler's Equation&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(t)=G_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\phi}e^{j\omega t})&lt;/math&gt; law of exponents
:&lt;math&gt;g(t)=\operatorname{Re}(G_m e^{j\phi}e^{j\omega t})&lt;/math&gt; .... &lt;math&gt;G_m&lt;/math&gt; is a real number so it can be moved inside
:&lt;math&gt;g(t)=\operatorname{Re}(\mathbb{G} e^{j\omega t})&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; .... \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; is the definition of a phasor, here it is an expression substituting for &lt;math&gt;G_m e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(t) \Leftrightarrow \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{G} = G_m e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

What happens to &lt;math&gt;e^{j\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; term? [[/j omega disappears/|Long Answer]]. It hangs around until it is time to transform back into the time domain. Because it is an exponent, and all the phasor math is algebra associated with exponents, the final phasor can be multiplied by it. Then the real part of the expression will be the time domain solution.

In all the cases above, remember that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, a known value in most cases. Thus the phasor is an complex number in most calculations.

There is another transform associated with a derivatives that is discussed in &quot;phasor calculus.&quot;

==Transforming calculus operators into phasors==

When sinusoids are represented as phasors, differential equations become algebra. This result follows from the fact that the complex exponential is the [[:w:Eigenfunction|eigenfunction]] of the operation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(e^{j \omega t}) = j \omega e^{j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, only the complex amplitude is changed by the derivative operation.  Taking the real part of both sides of the above equation gives the familiar result:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \cos{\omega t} = - \omega \sin{\omega t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a time derivative of a sinusoid becomes, when tranformed into the phasor domain, algebra:

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dt}i(t)\rightarrow j\omega\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; j is the square root of -1 or an imaginary number

In a similar way the time integral, when transformed into the phasor domain is:
:&lt;math&gt;\int V(t) dt \rightarrow \frac{\mathbb{V}}{j\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

There is an integration constant that will have to be dealt with when translating back into the time domain. It doesn't disappear.

The above is true of voltage, current, and power.

The question is why does this work? Where is the proof? Lets do this three times: once for a resistor, then inductor, then capacitor. The symbols for the current and voltage going through the terminals are:
&lt;math&gt;V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I)&lt;/math&gt;

===Resistor Terminal Equation===
:&lt;math&gt;V=R I&lt;/math&gt;  . terminal relationship
:&lt;math&gt;V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_V) = R I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I)&lt;/math&gt; .. substituting example functions
:&lt;math&gt;V_m e^{\omega t + j \phi_V} = R I_m e^{\omega t + j \phi_I}&lt;/math&gt; .. Euler's version of the terminal relationship
:&lt;math&gt;V_m e^{\omega t} e^{j \phi_V} = R I_m e^{\omega t} e^{j \phi_I}&lt;/math&gt; .. law of exponents
:&lt;math&gt;V_m \cancel{e^{\omega t}} e^{j \phi_V} = R I_m \cancel{e^{\omega t}} e^{j \phi_I}&lt;/math&gt; .. do same thing go both sides of equal sign
:&lt;math&gt;V_m e^{j \phi_V} = R I_m e^{j \phi_I}&lt;/math&gt; .. time domain result
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = R \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; .. phasor expression

Just put the voltage and current in phasor form and substitute to migrate equation into the phasor domain.

===Inductor Terminal Equation===
:&lt;math&gt;V = L\frac{d}{dt}I&lt;/math&gt; ... terminal relationship
:&lt;math&gt;V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_V) = L \frac{d}{dt} (I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I))&lt;/math&gt; .. substitution of a generic sinusodial
:&lt;math&gt;V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_V) = -\omega L I_m sin(\omega t + \phi_I)&lt;/math&gt; .. taking the derivative
:&lt;math&gt;- sin(\omega t + \phi_I) = cos(\omega t + \phi_I + \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt; .. trig
:&lt;math&gt;V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_V) = \omega L I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I + \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt; .. substitution
:&lt;math&gt;V_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V)}) = \omega L I_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j(\omega t + \phi_L + \frac{\pi}{2})})&lt;/math&gt; from Euler's Equation
:&lt;math&gt;V_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\omega t} e^{j\phi_V}) = \omega L I_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\omega t}e^{j\phi_L}e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}})&lt;/math&gt; law of exponents
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Re}(V_m e^{j\phi_V} \cancel{e^{j\omega t}} ) = \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}} \omega L I_m e^{j\phi_L} \cancel{e^{j\omega t}})&lt;/math&gt; .... real numbers can be moved inside
:&lt;math&gt;e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}} = cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) + j*sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = j&lt;/math&gt; ... substitute in above
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I} = I_m e^{j\phi_L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = V_m e^{j\phi_V}&lt;/math&gt; .. substitute in above 
:cancel out the &lt;math&gt;e^{j\omega}&lt;/math&gt; terms on both sides
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Re}(\mathbb{V}e^{j\omega t} ) = \operatorname{Re}(j \omega L \mathbb{I}e^{j\omega t})&lt;/math&gt; .... definition of phasors
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{V} = j \omega L \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; .... equation transformed into phasor domain

Conclusion, put the voltage and current in phasor form, replace &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt; to translate the equation to the phasor domain.

===Capacitor Terminal Equation===
A capacitor is basically the same form, V and I switch sides, C is substituted for L.

:&lt;math&gt;I = C\frac{d}{dt}V&lt;/math&gt; ... terminal relationship
:&lt;math&gt;I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I) = C \frac{d}{dt} (V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_V))&lt;/math&gt; .. substitution of a generic sinusodial
:&lt;math&gt;I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I) = -\omega C V_m sin(\omega t + \phi_V)&lt;/math&gt; .. taking the derivative
:&lt;math&gt;- sin(\omega t + \phi_V) = cos(\omega t + \phi_V + \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt; .. trig
:&lt;math&gt;I_m cos(\omega t + \phi_I) = \omega C V_m cos(\omega t + \phi_V + \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt; .. substitution
:&lt;math&gt;I_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I)}) = \omega C V_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V + \frac{\pi}{2})})&lt;/math&gt; from Euler's Equation
:&lt;math&gt;I_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\omega t} e^{j\phi_I}) = \omega C V_m \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\omega t}e^{j\phi_V}e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}})&lt;/math&gt; law of exponents
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Re}(I_m e^{j\phi_I} \cancel{e^{j\omega t}}) = \operatorname{Re}(e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}} \omega C V_m e^{j\phi_V} \cancel{e^{j\omega t}})&lt;/math&gt; .... real numbers can be moved inside
:&lt;math&gt;e^{j\frac{\pi}{2}} = cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) + j*sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = j&lt;/math&gt; ... substitute in above equation
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = V_m e^{j\phi_V}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I} = I_m e^{j\phi_I}&lt;/math&gt;.. substitute in above 
:cancel out the &lt;math&gt;e^{j\omega}&lt;/math&gt; terms on both sides
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Re}(\mathbb{I}e^{j\omega t} ) = \operatorname{Re}(j \omega C \mathbb{V}e^{j\omega t})&lt;/math&gt; .... definition of phasors
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{I} = j \omega C \mathbb{V}&lt;/math&gt; .... equation transformed into phasor domain 

Conclusion, put the voltage and current in phasor form, replace &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt; to translate the equation to the phasor domain.

In summary, all the terminal relations have &lt;math&gt;e^{j \omega}&lt;/math&gt; terms that cancel: 

:&lt;math&gt;V_m e^{j\phi}\cancel{e^{j\omega t}} = I_m e^{j\phi}\cancel{e^{j\omega t}} * R&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = \mathbb{I}R&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_m e^{j\phi}\cancel{e^{j\omega t}} = I_m e^{j\phi}\cancel{e^{j\omega t}} * j\omega*L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = \mathbb{I}j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_m e^{j\phi}\cancel{e^{j\omega t}} = V_m e^{j\phi}\cancel{e^{j\omega t}} * j\omega*C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I} = \mathbb{V}j\omega C&lt;/math&gt;

What is interesting about this path of inquiry/logic/thought is a new concept emerges: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Device !! &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{V}}{\mathbb{I}}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{I}}{\mathbb{V}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Resistor || &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Capacitor || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;j\omega C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Inductor || &lt;math&gt;j\omega L&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{j\omega L}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt; terms that don't cancel out come from the derivative terms in the terminal relations. These derivative terms are associated with the capacitors and inductors themselves, not the sources. Although the derivative is applied to a source, the independent device the derivative  originates from (a capacitor or inductor) is left with it's feature after the transform! So if we leave the driving forces as &lt;math&gt;\frac{output}{input}&lt;/math&gt; ratios on one side of the equal sign, we can consider separately the other side of the equal sign as a function! These functions have a name ... Transfer Functions. When we analyze the voltage/current ratios's in terms of R, L an C, we can sweep &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; through a variety of driving source frequencies, or keep the frequency constant and sweep through a variety of inductor values .. . we can analyze the circuit response! 

Note: Transfer Functions are an entire section of this course. They come up in mechanical engineering control system classes also. There are similarities. Driving over a bump is like a surge or spike. Driving over a curb is like turning on a circuit. And when mechanical engineers study vibrations, they deal with sinusoidal driving functions, but they are dealing with a three dimensional object rather than a one dimensional object like we are in this course.

==Phasor Domain to Time Domain==
Getting back into the time domain is just about as simple. After working through the equations in the phasor domain and finding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;, the goal is to convert them to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The phasor solutions will have the form &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G} = A + Bj = G_m e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt; you should be able now to convert between the two forms of the solution. Then:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \operatorname{Re}(\mathbb{G} e^{j\omega t})= \operatorname{Re}(G_m e^{j\phi}e^{j\omega t}) = \operatorname{Re}(G_m e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}) = G_m cos(\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

If there was an integral involved in the phasor math, then a constant needs to be added onto the time domain solution. The time constant is calculated from the initial conditions. If the solution doesn't involve a differential equation, then time constant is computed immediately. Otherwise the solution is treated as a particular solution and the time constant is computed after the homogeneous solution's magnitude is found. See the [[Circuit_Theory/Phasors/Examples|phasor examples]] for more detail.

==What is not covered==
There is another way of thinking about circuits where inductors and capacitors are complex resistances. The idea is:

::: impedance = resistance + j * reactance

Or symbolically

::: &lt;math&gt;Z = R + j*X&lt;/math&gt;

[[Electronics/Impedance|Here]] the derivative is attached to the inductance and capacitance, rather than to the terminal equation as we have done. This spreads the math of solving circuit problems into smaller pieces that is more easily checked, but it makes symbolic solutions more complex and can cause numeric solution errors to accumulate because of intermediate calculations. 

The phasor concept is found everywhere. Some day it will be necessary to study this if you get in involved in microwave projects that involve &quot;[[Communication_Systems/Microwave_Systems#Microwave_Components|stubs]]&quot; or antenna projects that involve a &quot;[[:w:Loading_coil#Radio_antenna|loading coil]]&quot; ... the list is huge. 

The goal here is to avoid the concepts of [[:w:Admittance|conductance, reactance, impedance, susceptance, and admittance]] ... and avoid the the confusion of relating these concepts while trying to compare phasor math with calculus and Laplace transforms.

== Phasor Notation ==

{{SideBox|Remember, a phasor represents a single value that can be displayed in multiple ways.}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt; &quot;Polar Notation&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;C = M e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}&lt;/math&gt; &quot;Exponential Notation&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = A + jB&lt;/math&gt; &quot;Rectangular Notation&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;C = M \cos (\omega t + \phi) + j M \sin (\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt; &quot;time domain notation&quot;

These 4 notations are all just different ways of writing the same exact thing.

== Phasor symbols ==

When writing on a board or on paper, use hats &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; to denote phasors. Expect variations in books and online: 
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}&lt;/math&gt; (the large bold block-letters we use in this wikibook)
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{V}&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;bar&quot; notation, used by Wikipedia)
* &lt;math&gt;\vec{V}&lt;/math&gt; (bad ... save for vectors ... vector arrow notation)
* &lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt; (some text books)
* &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; (some text books)

=Differential Equations=
==Phasors Generate the Particular Solution==
Phasors can replace calculus, they can replace Laplace transforms, they can replace trig. But there is one thing they can not do: initial conditions/integration constants. When doing problems with both phasors and Laplace, or phasors and calculus, the difference in the answers is going to be an integration constant. 

Differential equations are solved in this course in three steps:
* finding the particular solution ... particular to the driving function ... particular to the voltage or current source
* finding the homogenous solution ... the solution that is the same no matter what the driving function is ... the solution that explores how an initial energy imbalance in the circuit is balanced
* determining the coefficients, the constants of integration from initial conditions

==Phasors Don't Generate Integration Constants==
The integration constant doesn't appear in phasor solutions. But they will appear in the Laplace and Calculus alternatives to phasor solutions. If the full differential equation is going to be solved, it is absolutely necessary to see where the phasors fail to create a symbol for the unknown integration constant ... that is calculated in the third step.

Phasors are the technique used to find the particular AC solution. Integration constants document the initial DC bias or energy difference in the circuit. Finding these constants requires first finding the homogeneous solution which deals with the fact that capacitors may or may not be charged when a circuit is first turned on. Phasors don't completely replace the steps of Differential Equations. Phasors just replace the first step: finding the particular solution.

== Differential Equations Review ==

The goal is to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) of the first and second order with both phasors, calculus, and Laplace transforms. This way the phasor solution can be compared with content of pre-requiste or co-requiste math courses. The goal is to do these problems with numeric and symbolic tools such as matLab and mupad/mathematica/wolframalpha. If you have already had the differential equations course, this is a quick review. 

The most important thing to understand is the nature of a function. Trig, Calculus, and Laplace transforms and phasors are all associated with functions, not algebra. If you don't understand the difference between algebra and a function, maybe this [[/student professor/]] dialogue will help. 

We start with equations from terminal definitions, loops and junctions. Each of the symbols in these algebraic equations is a function. We are not transforming the equations. We are transforming the functions in these equations. All sorts of operators appear in these equations including + - * / and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. The first table focuses on transforming these operators. The second focuses on transforming the functions themselves.

The real power of the Laplace tranform is that it eliminates the integral and differential operators. Then the functions themselves can be transformed. Then unknowns can be found with just algebra. Then the functions can be transformed back into time domain functions. 

Here are some of the [[:w:Laplace_transform#Properties_and_theorems|Properties and Theorems]] needed to transform the typical sinusolidal voltages, powers and currents in this class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (January 3, 1892 – September 2, 1973) is best known as the author of ''The Hobbit'' and its sequel ''The Lord of the Rings''. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon language at Oxford from 1925 to 1945, and of English language and literature, also at Oxford, from 1945 to 1959. He was a strongly committed Roman Catholic. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, with whom he shared membership in the literary discussion group the Inklings.

In addition to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's published fiction includes The Silmarillion and other posthumously published books about what he called a legendarium, a fictional mythology of the remote past of Earth, called Arda, and Middle-earth (from middangeard, the lands inhabitable by Men) in particular. Most of these works were compiled from Tolkien's notes by his son Christopher Tolkien.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Decolonization is the process by which a colony gains its independence from a colonial power, a process opposite to colonization. Decolonization could be achieved by attaining independence, integrating with the administering power or another state, or establishing a &quot;free association&quot; status. The UN has stated that in the process of decolonization there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination. Decolonization may involve peaceful negotiation and/or violent revolt by the native population. Decolonization in the strict sense is distinct from the break-up of traditional empires, and in modern academic discourse the period of decolonization generally refers to two major waves of independence from European colonial rule:

From the late 18th century up through 19th century decolonization in the Americas occurred, beginning with American colonists' revolt against British rule in the present-day United States, and continuing through the collapse of the Spanish and Portuguese empires in Latin America.

In the 20th and 21st centuries &quot;decolonization&quot; usually refers to the achievement of independence by the various European colonies and protectorates in Asia and Africa following the end of World War II. This conforms with an intellectual movement known as Post-Colonialism. A particularly active period of decolonization occurred between 1945 to 1960, beginning with the independence of Pakistan and India from Britain in 1947.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste or East Timor is the newest independent country in the world, located in Southeastern Asia. It consists of the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, and Oecussi-Ambeno, an exclave of East Timor situated on the northwestern side of the island, surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The small country is located about 400 miles northwest of Darwin, Australia.

The name Timor is derived from timur, the Malay word for 'east', which became Timor in Portuguese. The Portuguese name Timor-Leste and the Tetum name Timor Lorosa'e are sometimes used in English. Lorosa'e means 'rising sun' in Tetum.

East Timor has the lowest per capita GDP (Purchasing Power Parity adjusted) in the world of only $400 (which corresponds to the 192nd, and last, position). However, regarding the Human Development Index, or HDI, it is in 140th place among the world's nations, which corresponds to medium human development.

Colonized by Portugal in the 16th century, East Timor was known as Portuguese Timor for centuries. It was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, which occupied it until 1999. Following the UN-sponsored act of self-determination that year, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory, which achieved full independence on May 20, 2002. With the Philippines, East Timor is one of only two majority Roman Catholic countries in Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Ancient History?==
&quot;Ancient&quot; history is a rather vague term, but its generally accepted denotation is the period of history preceding the birth and beginnings of modern civilisation, in the first few centuries after the fall of [[Ancient History/Rome|Rome]].

However, historians like to argue about what constitutes a historical period, and &quot;ancient history&quot; is understandably vast.  The dawn of time and the Early Middle Ages are separated by a very large gap in time.

Some would argue that history refers to the development of human society.  In this case, ancient history actually begins with the Paleolithic Era, from about 4.5 million years before the present until ten thousand years ago.  This places the development of early hominids into modern-style humans within the compass of ancient history.  Others believe that the origins of agriculture really mark the beginning of ancient history, with the domestication of the first food and fiber crops; this process began about 12,000 years before the present, near the end of the last Ice Age.  Yet another school argues that the invention of writing and arithmetic, in Mesopotamia and China, around 4500 BC marks the beginnings of true ancient history.  

A number of ending points may also be considered.  In the western world, the end of the Roman Empire, traditionally dated to 476 CE, has often been declared a cut-off.  However, this relegates all of world history between 475 CE and 1500 CE to a period usually called medieval history.  The rise of Islam and the early development of science fall within this medieval period, but both are outgrowths of the work of the preceding millennia.

===Start of the Book===
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_History&amp;oldid=169861 By our measurements], this textbook began at  04:23, 1 January 2005 by User:24.18.206.57 as a redirect from the [[Modern History]] page. This page was one year later made into a book by being filed at template:new and soon after being marked at the Humanities bookshelf.

===Themes===
So far, no themes questions have been asked and none have been answered. The themes of the book have been modeled after those of the [[Modern History]] page.
*'''Population''' [P] refers to groups of persons, such as ethnic or social groups. 

In the ancient world, questions of population involve the movements of large numbers of people over great distances.  The appearance of Neanderthal Man in many parts of Europe is one such type of movement; the Germanic invasions of western Europe in the early fifth century CE are another. When possible this will identify a people's conjectured point of origin, and attempt to track its movements both geographically and physically.

Population is often closely tied in western Europe and the Mediterranean littoral with questions of citizenship and eligibility to participate in the political system.  One of the principal themes of Roman history, for example, is the way in which certain social classes and peoples were either included or excluded from the political process in Rome.  During the Hellenistic Age, the idea of who was Greek expanded far beyond the genetic questions of who had come from the geographical region of Greece.

*'''Governance''' [G] refers to rule over a population or populations. Many empires expanded in ancient history until many were sacked. 

Governance deals with how a population ruled itself, and the nature of a population's laws and political customs.  Many modern English words for governmental types -- monarchy, dictatorship, oligarchy, democracy, republic, syndicalism and tyranny -- actually come to us from Greek and Latin, since these nations experimented with all these types of government, with written and unwritten law, and with written and unwritten constitutions.

Governance is often ruled by internal and external considerations.  Governments usually possess domestic policies, which determine how a nation's leadership acts towards people living within its borders.  They also attempt to guide and direct relationships with other nations and people, through treaties and foreign policy.

*'''Invention''' [I] refers especially to new or recovered technology.

Invention and ''Innovation'' may be equally appropriate terms here.  In the modern world, many nations are aware of the same technologies, even if developing nations can not afford these technologies.  Many people know what airplanes do, even if they have never flown in one.  However, in the ancient world, in which factories were rare or non-existent, and most artisans labored to create objects in small workshops or at home, innovations took time to spread across cultural lines.  

Historians of ancient history often use two terms to describe the process by which inventions pass from culture to culture.  The first term is ''Independent Invention'', meaning that two cultures developed a specific idea or technology, but did not learn of that technology from one another.  Each culture invented that technology without knowing of the other culture's technological advance.  For example, both China and Egypt invented paper of a sort; Egyptian papyrus was invented around 3000 BCE by pounding strips of a marsh reed into a flat surface, while Chinese paper was produced on screens from a mash of mulberry leaves or rice husks around 100 BCE.  China knew nothing of Egyptian papyrus paper, so it independently invented paper, even though Egyptian examples already existed.  

The other type of innovation is termed ''Cultural Diffusion'', meaning that a culture invents a given technology and then that technology is passed hand to hand and mind to mind through teaching, learning, and borrowing, until it is accepted by another culture in a different geographical region.  For example, the spinning wheel was invented in northern China in the fourth century CE, but it did not make an appearance in European households until the twelfth century CE.  This advance in thread-making technology advanced year by year along the trade routes from China to Europe, making slow progress but infiltrating each house and culture it passed on the way.  

*'''Combat''' [C] refers to wars, battles, and other destructive competition. In ancient history, it is hard to say what was the deadliest war. 

Combat in ancient times was conducted largely without the use of anything more elaborate than hand-to-hand weapons: swords, shields, armor, spears, and personal valor were the principal tools of battle.  Weapons such as catapults often had to be invented first, before they could be put into use.  Horses and camels trained for battle provided cavalry services to many armies, but the expense of maintaining animals for battle kept these forces small relative to the size of infantry forces.  

In addition, prior to 1500 CE few nations or countries were able to maintain state monopolies on the use of military force.  Arms and armor were relatively inexpensive, and private armies and navies existed even if they were not particularly common.  Because of the nature of government, a charismatic leader in many places and times could raise a private army and go into the business of conquering a nation, or starting one of his own.  

*'''Trade''' [T] refers to any exchange of goods or services, from the exchange of some money for a slice of bread to the many camels crossing the Arabian Desert.

Compared to the present day, where masses of statistical data and reams of financial information are available, ancient times had little in the way of accurate economic information.  Most production of goods occurred at the level of a workshop or household's cottage industry, rather than at the level of a factory or multi-national corporation.  While some mercantile companies of a sort did exist, most trade at the international level was conducted by adventurous individuals or families, and it often occurred in a haphazard way.  

At the level of local production in the ancient world, numerous types of commerce existed.  The first type was ''barter'' in which goods are evaluated by the trading partners, and rough estimates of value are assigned to commodities; the commodities themselves are then exchanged, without the use of money.  In ''medium of exchange'' commercial systems, buyer and seller agree on a value for a commonly available product, such as salt in ancient China or olive oil in ancient Greece, and other products' values are assessed in terms of measured units of that common substance.  In ''specie'' commerce, a rare product such as gold or silver or precious stone which is small and relatively easily transported, becomes the valuation system.  Specie systems often led in the ancient world to the creation of ''coinage'' in which coins of indefinite or nominal specie value become the medium of exchange.  The most advanced system of trade, ''credit'', did exist in the ancient world, but tended to be rare and reserved for financial transactions of stupendous size.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In astronomy, the geocentric model (in Greek: geo = earth and kentron = center) of the universe is the theory that the Earth is at the center of the universe and the Sun and other celestial objects go around it.

Belief in this system was common in ancient Greece. It was embraced by both Aristotle and Ptolemy, and most Greek philosophers assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and naked eye planets circle the Earth. Aristarchus of Samos proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system, but he was clearly in the minority in believing that the Earth was not central.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The archeological record and evidence from mitochondrial DNA studies indicate that Cuba and the Antilles have been inhabited by peoples ancestral to the indigenous inhabitants for at least several thousand years. Some studies ascribe a role to these original inhabitants in the disappearance of the islands' megafauna, including condors , giant owls and eventually groundsloths.

Before 1492, Cuba was populated by at least two distinct indigenous peoples: Taíno and Ciboney (or Siboney) (some consider these populations to be neo-Taíno nations). These two groups were prehistoric cultures in a time period during which humans created tools from stone, yet they were familiar with gold (caona) and copper alloys (guanín) Copper Age. The Taíno agriculturalist and the Ciboney were a self-sufficient society, although their development was not limited to fishing and hunting, farming and production of wooden structures. Taínos and Ciboney took part in similar customs and beliefs, one being the sacred ritual practiced using, often nasally inhaled, narcotized tobacco vapors and particulates called cohoba, is known in English as smoking.

The Taino (Island Arawak) were part of a cultural group commonly called the Arawak, which extends far into South America. The wide diffusion of this culture is witnessed even today by names of places in the New World; for example localities or rivers called Guama (the Taino name for Lonchocarpus domingens, a leguminous tree, the designation of a chief (as in Guamá a famous Taino who fought the Spanish) are found in Cuba, Venezuela and Brazil.

The Arawaks incorporated readily into the successive invading groups and acculturated almost to the point of disappearance. Residues of their poetry, songs, sculpture, and art are found today throughout the major Antilles. The Arawak and other such cultural groups are responsible for the development of perhaps 60% of crops in common use today and some major industrial materials such as rubber. The Europeans were shown by the Native Cubans how to nurture tobacco and consume it in the form of cigars.

Approximately 16 to 60,000, Bartolome de las Casas estimated 200,000, natives belonging to the Taino and Ciboney nations inhabited Cuba before colonization. The Native Cuban Indian population, including the Ciboney and the Taíno, were forced in to reservations during the Spanish subjugation of the island of Cuba. Many Natives were put in reservations. One famous reservation was known as Guanabacoa, today a suburb of Havana. Many indigenous Cuban Indians died due to the brutality of Spanish conquistadores and the diseases they brought with them, such as the measles and smallpox, which were previously unknown to Indians. On the other hand the introduction of smoking and most probably syphilis into Europe as a result of this contact caused uncounted deaths in Europe {{ref|Duarte1989a}}. Shakespeare's character Caliban is taken by many to represent a Caribbean Shaman. Sir Walter Raleigh's execution is said witnessed by his Caribbean servant. By 1550, many tribes were eradicated. Many of the Conquistadors intermarried with Native Cuban Indians. Their children were called mestizos, but the Native Cubans called them Guajiro, which translates as &quot;one of us&quot;. Today, the descendants are maintaining their heritage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Templates''' in Umbraco defines the general layout of the public website, the template
''combined'' with a document, outputs a webpage – by ensuring that content and
presentation is separated in different layers of the application, it’s guaranteed that you
can change one layer without compromising the other.
Umbraco itself does not generate any html, the webpages of the public website, are
100% generated from the html in the templates and data from the documents (for
some webpages, a subset of the html comes from macros – more on that subject
later).

This means that the web developer is 100% in charge of what kind of the HTML
output that is served when a user visits the website.
