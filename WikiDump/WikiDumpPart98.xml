      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction &amp; Overview==


Cells are divided into two broad categories, '''Prokaryocytes''' and '''Eukaryocytes'''. Basically Prokaryocytes have no nucleus, and all bacteria fall into this category,; Eukaryocytes have a nucleus, and animal and Plant cells fall into this category. A characteristic of both cells is that they contain all the information necessary to build a complete organism. This information is carried in the cells '''DNA'''. In prokaryocytes this exists as a ring of DNA which is found in the cell cytoplasm, in the Animal the DNA is found in the nucleus, and is organized into chromosomes. Both types of DNA are organised into '''genes'''. A gene is thesequence of Nucleic acids necessary to produce a protein. This section looks at the Chemistry of DNA and RNA.

We will look at the chemical structure of Nucleic Acids and related compounds. We will only touch briefly on protein synthesis and replication. we will look at this in much more detail in the Section on Cell Biology particularly in the sections on ''Gene Expression'' and ''Cell Reproduction''.
===DNA Structure===
A DNA molecule consists of two polymers of nucleic acids: the polymers consist of strands of nucleic acids joined together. There are thus two strands of DNA which run in opposite directions - they are said to be ''anti-parralel'' - and these strands are joined to each other by '''hydrogen bonds'''. (see below for the details). The weakness of these bonds allows the strands to be easily separated for reproduction and for the manufacture of RNA. There are four nucleic acids found in DNA, and these are grouped together in triplets called '''codons'''. Each codon is specific for a particular amino acid.

===DNA Function===
DNA controls the whole functioning of the cell. Although each cell contains an entire copy of the body's DNA, only some of the DNA is '''expressed''' in any given cell. The expression is both temporal and spatial, and will also vary according to the needs of the body. It is carried out by way of of manufacturing proteins, both structural proteins and enzymes.

                                                  /----&gt;Cell Enzymes------&gt;\
 Gene(DNA) ---&gt;RNA Formation---&gt;Protein Formation                            ---&gt; Cell Function
                                                  \----&gt;CellStructure ----&gt;/

The importance of DNA lies in its ability to control the formation of proteins via the genetetic code. It does this by way of '''codons''' which as already mentioned is a triplet of nucleic acids. When a signal arrives to create a particular protein, the relevant section of DNA is identified, and an enzyme called RNA polymerase causes the two strands break apart. DNA of one of the strands, called the transcription strand serves as a template for the manufacture of messenger RNA (mRNA), a process called '''transcription'''. This strand of RNA contains a mirror image of all the ''codons''  each of which represents an amino acid.

After further processing the mRNA passes out of the nucleus through membrane pores and attaches itself to a '''ribosome'''. A second form of RNA called '''transfer RNA (tRNA)''' then ferries amino acids to the mRNA which assembles them into a poly peptide of the sequence dictated initially in the DNA of the gene. This process where by a protein is manufactured from an mRNA strand is called '''Translation'''. Proteins are usually then taken inside the '''endoplasmic reticulum''' for further processing.

===Protein Synthesis===
The following illustrations show in simplified form how protein synthesis is carried out. More details are given in the section on Gene expression in the Cell Biology section.

A mRNA strand is '''transcribed''' from the DNA template; it is further modified in the nucleus; then it leaves the nucleus and attaches to a '''ribosome'''; then the peptide is '''translated''' from this mRNA strand. This peptide can be further modified in the endoplasmic reticulum.

====RNA Transcription ==== 
This illustration shows a summary of the Transcription Process;

====RNA Translation ====

This is a very simple over view, and will be look at in more detail when we consider Gene Expression in a later chapter.

==Chemistry and Structure== 
===Basic Structure===
Nucleotides are three part molecules that link together to form '''DNA''' ('''D'''eoxyribose '''N'''ucleic '''A'''cid) or '''RNA''' ('''R'''ibose '''N'''ucleic '''A'''cid) polymers. Each nucleotide is a three part molecule consisting of one or more phosphate groups; a five carbon sugar, and a carbon nitrogen ring called a base.Here is a diagram of the '''nucleic acid Guanine''': 
   
[[File:Dna1a.png]]

Note the numbering of the carbon atoms on the  ribose ring
These nucleotides can be linked by their phosphate groups to form either an RNA or a DNA polymer.

===Nucleotide Bases===
There are five Nucleotide bases, based on either a pyramidine or a purine model. 

The purine derivitives have two carbon-nitrogen rings and form the bases adenine and guanine, people should note that carbon 6 is an error with five bounds. Carbon 6 is actually not double bonded to NH2: 
   
[[File:Pur aden gua.png]]

The pyramidine derivitives have one carbon-nitrogen ring and form the bases cytosine, thymine and uracil: 
   
[[File:Pyr cyt thy ura.png]]

The Thymine base appears only in DNA molecules, the Uracil base in RNA molecules.

===Pentose sugars===
The ribose sugar is used in RNA molecules, the Deoxyribose sugar in DNA molecules 
   
[[File:Ribose deoxyribose.png]]

==DNA and RNA Structure== 
===The DNA Molecule===
The DNA molecule arranges itself in the famous double helix, first postulated by Watson and Crick in 1953: 
   
[[File:DNA Overview2.png]]

===DNA Structure===
DNA consists of two chains of DNA polymers linked by Hydrogen bonds. Each chain has either a terminal phosphate or a terminal Ribose group. The end with phosphate group is known as the 3 prime - 3' end, that with the pentose group as the 5 prime - 5' end. This distinction is important when we have a look at DNA and RNA replication.

The chains run in opposite directions, one from 3' to 5', the other from 5' to 3'. 

The following illustration shows how the individual Nucleic Acids link together in a single strand of DNA:
 
[[File:Dna strand3.png]]

In the chain an Adenine base always matches with a Thymine base, and a Guanine base with a Cytosine base.

The following Illustration shows a DNA Strand combined with a reverse strand. They are held together by '''Hydrogen Bonds''' (the dotted lines) between complementary nucleic acids: 
   
[[File:Dna strand.png]]
Note:
*'''Guanine''' ''always'' matches with '''Cytosine'''. 

*'''Adenine''' ''always'' matches with '''Thymine'''.

Remember this match with the mnomic &quot;'''T'''he '''A'''udience '''G'''oes '''C'''razy&quot;

*Thymine and Adenine link with '''two''' hydrogen bonds.
*Guanine and Cytosine link with '''three''' hydrogen bonds.
Here is another short hand method of depicting DNA:

[[File:Dna strand2.png]]

===RNA Structure===
RNA molecules are formed using the Ribose sugar. They do not form into helixes. Another difference is that they do not have Thymine bases, they use Uracil in it's place. They use a DNA template, and are formed from the 5' to the 3' end. Here is a structural look at the DNA helix and an RNA strand: 
   
[[File:Rna syn.png|500px]]

The Nucleic Acids are added one at a time in the tri-phosphate form. First the nucleic acid is matched with its opposite number, then an ester bond is formed between the hydroxyl group at the 3' position and the first phosphate group, cleaving off a pyrophosphate. The energy released by this cleavage powers the reaction.

[[File:Rna syn2.png]]

Again note that the RNA strand is started at the 5' end and works along the DNA template from the 3' end to the 5' end.

There are numerous kinds of RNA
*mRNA which we have just had a look at
*Primer RNA which is important in the process of DNA replication
*Transfer RNA (tRNA) which ferries amino acids to the mRNA strand during the translation process.
*Ribosomal RNA, which forms a large part of the ribosomes

==DNA Replication==
Here we give a simplified overview of DNA replication, emphasizing the chemistry. We will give a much more detailed view when we consider cell reproduction in the Cell Biology section.

When DNA is relicated, the whole chromosome is replicated. As this contains up to 9 ''Billion'' base pairs, if the replication started at one end and then proceeded to the other it would take an inordinate ammount of time. Replication therefore procedes at numerous locations  at the same time. '''Bubbles''' are formed, and replication procedes at both ends of the bubble at '''replication forks'''.

[[File:DNA bubbles.png|400px]]

Nucleoside triphosphates are added on at the 3' end of the replication chain. One of the DNA Polymerases enzymes (δDNA Poly) facilitates the reaction. 
*First the Base pairs with its opposite number in the template chain, forming a hydrogen bond.
*Next the first phosphate bond of the nucleoside triphosphate joins with the hydroxyl group at the 3' carbon.

The energy obtained from cleaving off the last two phosphates powers the reaction.

Both during and after the formation of the replication chain, various enzymes check for accuracy of transcription, and carry out the necessary repairs. This, as well as the numerous activities at the replication fork, and telomere activities at the end of the chain will be looked at in further detail in the section on cell replication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Organic atoms and molecules==
==Water and Solutes==
==Chemical bonds==
there are generally two types of bonds:-

1)intra{within}molecular forces

2)inter{between}molecular forces
  
 
the intramolecular forces,are forces of attraction between atoms in 
a molecule i.e. the force of attraction between atoms that forms 
molecules e.g. ionic and covalent bonding.

the intermolecular forces,are ones between molecules that forms 
substances e.g. van deer waals,dipole-dipole,hydrogen bonds
===ionic bond===
===Covalent Bonds===
===Hydrogen Bonds===
  
  when H is bonded to more electronegative elements (especifically- F2,O2,N2),H carries a partial positive charge
'due to the electronegativity difference' which enable it to bond with the more electronegative element in adjacent 
molecule,thus H acts as a bridge between the more electronegative atoms in adjacent molecule.
  
  H bond can be viewed as special type of permenant dipole-dipole force.

Bridge pattern is useful when a code often changes for an implementation as well as for a use of code. In your application, you should have provider classes and client classes:

Each client class can interact with each provider class. However, if the implementation changes, the method signatures of the Provider interface may change and all the client classes have to change. In the same way, if the client classes need a new interface, we need to rewrite all the providers. The solution is to add a bridge, that is to say a class that will be called by the clients, that contains a reference to the providers and forward the client call to the providers.

In the future, the two interfaces (client/bridge and bridge/provider) may change independently and the bridge may trans-code the call order.

== Examples ==
It's hard to find an example in a library as this pattern is designed for versatile specifications and a library does not change constantly between two versions.

== Cost ==
The cost of this pattern is the same as the adapter. It can be planned at design time but the best way to decide to add it is the experience feedback. Implement it when you have frequently changed an interface in a short time.

=== Creation ===
Its implementation is easy but can be expensive. It depends on the complexity of the interface. The more you have methods, the more it's expensive.

=== Maintenance ===
If you always update the client/bridge interface and the bridge/provider interface the same way, it would be more expensive than if you do not implement the design pattern.

=== Removal ===
This pattern can be easily removed as automatic refactoring operations can easily remove its existence.

== Advices==
* Put the ''bridge'' term in the name of the bridge class to indicate the use of the pattern to the other developers.

== Implementation ==
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Implementation in Java}}
The following [[Java Programming|Java]] (SE 6) program illustrates the bridge pattern.

I think that is great that you are a music education major.  I believe that someday soon we will have to restructure the education system and return art and music to an actual subject again.  Students in the public education system are severly lacking in art, music and physical education.  Art and music is where you find passion and creativity concepts shown very well on your authors page.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:24, 1 June 2009 (UTC)


Hi Sarah, 
Your best friend Ryan Collins here. First off I also am a fan of the Beatles, not necessarily star wars. I agree with you that music is one of the most important things on my life. Your outlook on what a teacher is is great. I believe that is very true. For instance, without teachers would The Beatles been able  to write such beautiful music? Yes the answer is probably yes, but you get my point. I agree with the statement that teachers aren't given enough credit for what it is that we do. I really liked this line &quot;The best educator commands respect without being a tyrant and is not only an authority figure but a friend to his or her students.&quot; I think that describes the teacher student relationship very well.

I once had a convincing discussion that most authors worth their salt are basically just failed musicians and singers at heart. We had the dreams, but we lacked the gusto and instead decided to thrive in the dim lit recesses of existence. Scribbling into coffee stained notepads or drooling on keyboards, we lament the path fate has carved for us– deprived of that lingering dream. What I meant to say is: I'm sure the music lovers on campus have a lot in common with the writers, besides being extremely passionate in our separate areas. And who doesn't love Star Trek, Star Wars(original trilogy) and The Beatles? It'd be like saying you hate air and the notion of breathing.

I agree with you on the importance of teachers, I mean, with the way parents have to work these days kids often spend as much time with their teachers as they do their parental units.  After all, one of the  best ways to rate a country and often predict its level of success in the grand scheme of things is to gauge the education of its citizens. (This theory holds up surprisingly well except for in the case of the U.S, where military prowess seems to do most of the heavy lifting but enough being serious.)  I see you like Say Anything; personally I thought they were a lack luster pop punk band until the lead singer quite literally went insane. I suppose Baseball was a really good album, but then again, he was pretty horribly strung out for that record as well. Staying in an asylum seemed to only do good things for his song writing, I mean he wrote a poppy emo song about a concentration camp. That is excellent on so many levels I can forgive him for using the phrase “krunk with my friends,” later within the same album.  Basically what I’m saying to you is: find a way to drive yourself insane. My recommendation is to spend a few weeks in a sensory deprivation chamber.  If you cannot find a chamber, there’s always getting a friend to weld you inside of an oil barrel, ideally, half filled with water. When released head directly to the nearest recording studio, and thank me in the liner notes. Me and the demons that now writhe beneath your skin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The neuron'''

The Neuron is a fundamental unit in the brain and a specialized cell intended to transmit information to muscle, gland cells and other nerve cells. Depending on the species, the brain could contain anywhere between 1 billion and 100 billion neurons. A neuron consists of dendrites, an axon, a cell body and synaptic terminals. Axons transmit information from the neuron on to other neurons to which it is interconnected. To speed up the transmission of electrical signals along the axon, many axons are covered in a myelin sheath. Dendrites receive information transmitted by the axons of other neurons. Both axons and dendrites partake in specialized contact points called synapses. 

There are 3 main kinds of neurons. '''Motor neurons''' control the activity of muscles and are in control of all forms of behavior. '''Sensory neurons''' are entwined with receptors to detect and also respond to changing attributes of the internal and external environment. For example receptors sensitive to changes in light would subserve the modality of vision, and so on. '''Interneurons''' not only arbitrate simple reflexes but are responsible for highly complex functions of the brain.

==    * 1 Problems With Membership==
I made an addition to the &quot;Problems Recruiting New Membership&quot; section, adding in the problem that the WWU Body Building Club has with keeping in touch with its current members. I added this because I feel like this is the biggest issue regarding the club seeing as how they recently put on their first event; it turned out to be a great success.

I made revisions to the SMASH group section about the struggle of technological advancements and how it effects membership. SMASH is a very popular video game among the youth and Nintendo technology continues to make newer versions because it is so popular. Advancements take time but they are created, especially with the Nintendo Corporation. If the SMASH club continues its run, there will be a newer version of SMASH that is released sometime in the next five years. Although the majority of SMASH club members prefer the original version, technological advancements will capture their interest and the interest of other gamers because the game will be enhanced. This will hopefully convince more people to join the club in the future and keep it alive.


I added an introductory paragraph to this section because it didn't have one before. I felt that it was important to bring up the topics that would be discussed in this section. I also thought it was important to talk about a positive example of a club with a lot of members and good recruitment strategies. 

I added to the introductory paragraph pertaining to problems with membership and goals. I thought that this was necessary as a nice transition into the following paragraphs concerning specific clubs such as Submarine club. 

I added on to the introduction of this page. I thought it did a goo job making a broad statement about the page but thought it would be helpful for readers to know a little more about what they would find. I added examples about problems different clubs could face so the idea would be more clear.

I felt that this section needed an introduction so I added the intro paragraph. I tried to give a general overview of the problems clubs have with membership and what the problems could lead to. I added the paragraph because I felt the page needed a general summary.

I added an introduction to the paragraph about the Scottish Dance Club which tied it in with VOX, another club with the exact same problem.  Then I added a conclusion with a possible solution to the problem, because  felt that made the statement more complete.

I added an introductory paragraph to this section. It explains how membership is a crucial aspect of clubs and how they keep up interest in it. I kept the paragraph general, so it wouldn't dwelve into aspects pertaining to only certain types of clubs. 

          o 1.1 Problems Recruiting New Membership
I added an introduction here becuase I feel that this is an area that every club struggles with and membership is necessary for clubs to function.

I felt that the problems the Hui O' Hawaii club faced in recruiting needed clarification, along with the benefits their tactics could sometimes provide. I added a small section to this effect.

I added this section because the rugby team is totally turning around next year. They have a new head coach now and all the guys are driven towards winning regionals next year.
 
                + 1.1.1 Problems with New Member Auditions/Rehearsal

                + 1.1.2 Problems With Inexperienced New Members
I added a conclusion paragraph to this section because I think it is important to realize that the only way to get experienced members is through teaching the new, inexperienced members. In order to have members who know what they are doing, they have to have patience with the new members.

I revised the opening paragraph to better state the intentions of this section.

I added an ending paragraph to this section that made a generalization that the majority of the clubs can relate to.  This is important because it draws that section to a close.

I made an edit to the last paragraph about the Salsa Club and old members showing off to new members. I edited because I thought the subject needed to be elaborated on and made more general (so it could apply to more than just the Salsa Club). I also tried to make it sound a little less accusatory or the Salsa Club as not all the members are &quot;stuck up.&quot;


          o 1.2 Problems With Variable Membership: Decreases or increase in number of members
I added a intro to this section, because I think that some would be confused on what the possible problems would be. also i tried to sum up some of the possible problems, so that people had an idea of what the next paragraphs would be about. 

I added more clarification as to why the membership is so high at the beginning of the quarter compared to the end of the quarter. I based this analysis on the explanation of the group leader I interviewed.

                + 1.2.1 Problems With Advertising
I added the Cycling to this section because it was an important part of their group and I gave them some ideas on how they could improve with getting their group out into the public. bertscr(b)


I added an introductory paragraph summarizing some of the advertising problems many groups face.

          o 1.3 Problems Scheduling Membership Meetings and Activities
I added the proplems with scheduling and promotion on the bulletin boards around school in all the buildings, and how it affects club attendence and advertising and also how the viking forum

          o 1.4 Problems with meeting attendance
I edited the introduction paragraph on the decrease of people coming to meetings and keeping people interested in clubs at Western. The reason I chose to edit this section was because the  grammar was confusing and unorganized and too brief with explanations. 

I added possible consequences to the example of the Scottish Dance Club because the negative consequences that may have been encountered due to low attendance rate did not seem sufficient. The paragraph only touched on one example of a negative consequence, I added a couple more.

          o 1.5 Problems with members fighting

I reworded and added content to the photography club paragraph in the goals section. The original paragraph was unclear and the wording was kind of confusing.

Added summary of conflict/fighting in clubs. Moved a misplaced summarizing sentence up to &quot;Problems Scheduling Membership Meetings and Activities&quot; where it seemed to belong.

==    * 2 Problems With Leadership==

          o 2.1 Problems Recruiting Leadership

I edited and re-phrase this section because I thought they were using a great strategy to recruiting new members by asking memebers bring in their friends and widely spread on facebook. I felt this strategy can be follow by other clubs on campus, but this strategy does not work when a group of member that has to practice on weekly bases. 

          o 2.2 Problems Passing On Leadership Skills and Experiences

I edited this section because there were two hanging questions at the end of the paragraph that made one group sound inferior to the one being discussed in the paragraph. I felt this was not very professional and deleted one question and added in the answer instead. I explained further on the topic being discussed and made the paragraph more well-rounded (storram)

          o 2.3 Problems Related to Ineffective Leadership
I edited the Creators of Visual Art and Literature section. The name of the club was mistyped and the information provided gave the club a negative feeling. Since the members of the club will be able to see this, I tried to make it sound a bit more professional.(Masseya2)
I wrote in introduction to the section and included the idea of making assistant positions to groom members for future leadership positions. (malonep)

==    * 3 Problems with communication==

I decided to change the section titled, Ineffective types of communication. I made this change because communication is such a broad definition that I felt as if people needed a summary of what it is, so maybe they could fix their ineffective types of communication. I believe that it was the perfect place to put a introduction paragraph because it flowed right into the other paragraphs that students had left already

I added an introduction to this section. Most people see the word communication and look right past it, without thinking twice about how important communication is. I tried to shed some light on the importance of this section.

==    * 4 Problems Related to Operations and Planning==
I added an intro for the entire section of Operations/Planning. I basically just looked at what the overall theme of this section's remarks were and wrote a brief synopsis.
          o 4.1 Problems With Funding
This is a weird discussion page... anyways i added an intro to the page (does that count for the second part of the assignment???) and then added some fundraising struggles of S.H.O.T. also added sub headings for each of the club because it seemed like a lot of people did that in the other sections hopefully thats okay.[[User:Dammara|Dammara]] ([[User talk:Dammara|talk]]) 19:54, 31 May 2009 (UTC) 
I added a paragraph about possible strategies that could help raise money for the club. I also addressed the need for a better organization. ([[User talk:Grossie|talk]])
I added more to the introduction to count for assignment 6 part C [[User:Dammara|Dammara]] ([[User talk:Dammara|talk]]) 20:05, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a definition of what LEAD club was because when I read this section I was unclear of what it really was and I didn't want to have to go searching for a definition and stray away from this page. [[User:Mazicks|Mazicks]] ([[User talk:Mazicks|talk]]) 21:02, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
 
          o 4.2 Problems With Missions and Goals
I edited the Problems with missions and goals section by adding an introduction to it. I think it is important to discuss the relationship between the groups needs compared what their goals are going to be. Even if the goals of the group are just to entertain, this needs to be established to make the group successful.

==    * 5 Problematic Relationships With Other Clubs==

          o 5.1 Problems Interacting With Or Communicating With Another Club

I added an introductory paragraph to this section in order to illustrate the commonly shared necessities of good relations with other organizations.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I edited the meeting place section. I fixed a lower case i to I. I also fixed a sentence and rearranged the words to make it sound better and make more sense.

I edited the introductory paragraph for flow and style.  I feel that it better presents the topic. [[User:Westa8|Westa8]]

I edited the section concerning the slum doctor program and how co hosting has been effective for them because there were many sentences that didn't make sense due to missing words or strange sentence phrasings.

I edited and added to the section concerning co-hosting an event with similar clubs, (dance clubs) [[User:schmera|schmera]]
==          o 2.4 Type of event==
I edited the part where it talks about rugby club. I simply added information about the club hosts games during summer to play against other teams in the region.

I added an introduction paragraph for the section to introduce the different types of events on Western's campus to offer a lead in to the rest of the section. The section goes on to explain individual clubs but I felt that an overall introduction to the section and a generalization of all clubs was beneficial.

==          2.3 Advertising of event==
I edited this section because it didn't really say anything specific of the info fair. It mentions about word of mouth in red square, but I feel mentioning the info fair would also give more detail on ways to advertise events.

I edited the part where a member was trying to explain the difference between the number of events the Croquet Club had compared to the KSA. I added a new introduction with more detail and changed some grammer errors. [[User:Wetlej|Wetlej]] ([[User talk:Wetlej|talk]]) 05:30, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

=    * 2 Volunteer Opportunities=
Added an introductory paragraph to make a more cohesive flow. Summarized volunteer opportunities.
==          o 2.1 Individual==
I added a conclusion paragraph describing the importance of volunteering with examples from myself in order to describe the importance and how it affects others.
==          o 2.2 Group==
I added a conclusion paragraph to the importance of choosing a location, because I felt everyone had posted very good information but there was no ending.

=    * 3 Reason For Events=
==          o 3.1 Recognition==
I clarified what the speakers did for the &quot;Against Civilization&quot; club in this situation.

I clarified ways that the Western Men Against Violence Club did for the community.

==          o 3.3 Fun==
Just added a bit of information about the group's goal of also teaching students about Hawaiian culture.

I edited some grammar and also added a sentence about the meeting that made their cause seem more important and clarified some information a little more.

I included an introductory paragraph for the culture sharing section. I felt this section needed something before examples.


I added a little more information on how the Harry Potter Club advertises for events like the Yule Ball.--[[User:Larson41|Larson41]] ([[User talk:Larson41|talk]]) 16:52, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=    * 1 Need for fundraising=
I simply added an introductory paragraph to this section to provide a little clarity to why fundraising is necessary for the clubs and organizations.

I added an introduction to the fundraising section briefing describing the importance of fundraising and how many clubs go about their fundraising.

I added some more information about the importance of fund raising to make clubs last.

I added a sentence expanding on the importance of fundraising as a way of bonding as a club and making the newer members feel more welcome.

I added a few sentences to one of the paragraphs expanding on why the clubs and organizations fundraise, how they do so, and how they use their budget effectively. 

==          o 1.1 How many fundraisers a year==


==          o 1.2 Why fundraise==
I just expanded on some additional benefits of fundraising. I felt it was important to show how getting adequate funding not only gets the word out about the club, but also allows the club to better complete projects. I also wanted to add how getting funding from the administration has been helpful to SRE as a way to show that there are numerous ways to get funding.

I revised the paragraph about the Hui O’ Hawaii club's fundraising to make it sound more about the club itself, instead of about the club from the anthro. group's perspective. The future Wiki book readers will benefit more if the information on effective strategies is soley about the group itself.

I added a introductory paragraph just to explain the first steps of why fundraising is important and needed. I also added in that each club gets a certain amount of money at the beginning of each year, so some clubs don't necessarily have to fundraise as much as others.

==          o 1.3 Fundraising for events==
I added an introductory paragraph the fundraising for events section because I wanted to make clearer what the section was actually regarding. I first explained why events are important to clubs and then breifly explained how fundraising is related to the events.

==          o 1.4 Is there a need for fundraising==
I made a revision here. I added a concluding paragraph because the title heading was &quot;Is there a need for fundraising&quot; and I was reading though all the posts and came to find out that some clubs don't necessarily need to fundraise. So I then decided to conclude this section saying that yes, there are needs for fundraising, but also that some clubs are just fine with the money given to them by the AS clubs every month.

=    * 2 Types=
I made a revision in the types of fundraising by adding a introductry paragraph explaining how clubs only get so much money from western and have to perform different types of fundraising to be able to have the events they want to be a successful club.

I added a paragraph about grant writing because I feel that it is a very important way for clubs to fund raise. I also made some minor edits to the previous paragraph. 
==          o 2.1 Method==
==          o 2.2 Success==
I added an introduction to the section on successful fundraising because there were several examples listed in this section. The introduction makes it clear that there have been several types of successful fundraising. Now readers will have a better idea of the overall successes clubs have had in the past.

==          o 2.3 Types==
I edited the sailing team portion of the entry to explain what type of fundraising is effective for them and to gomore into depth about some of the benefits that go along with their fundraising.

I added some various types of fundraising that clubs around campus use such as petition signing, poster and visual recognition, and verbal communication with the administration requesting more money. I felt it is necessary to have multiple types of fundraising to maximize effectivness of receiving funds.

=    * 3 Collaborating with another club=
==          o 3.1 Benefits of collaborating==

I added an introduction to this section because it was lacking one.  It now has a brief paragraph at the beginning explaining what the section will cover.

==          o 3.2 What groups usually collaborate together==

Made revisions to ideas referring to WMAV. I felt the part about &quot;like-minded men&quot; was too limited so I mentioned that females join in the club also. I also changed the second to last sentence to make it more appropriate to WMAV. And, of course, some minor edits.


As to the like-minded men change-- I used that phrasing because I was speaking about the Walk A Mile event, and for some reason I was thinking it was a men-only event. Good catch.

=    * 4 Effective Place and Time for fundraising=

I added an introductory paragraph here to discuss the importance and necessity for considering the when and where before fully planning a fundraiser. The when and where can greatly effect the outcome and efficiency of a fundraiser which was the point I wanted to get across while using specific examples. 

==          o 4.1 On Campus==
==          o 4.2 Off Campus==
I think off-campus fundraising can be very useful, and no one had mentioned anything about it yet and i know LEAD used that for their club.

I added a little bit of information about businesses likening to help because it helps their company look good.

I added a specific example of Krispy Kreme Donuts helping with funsraisers.

==          o 4.3 Effective time to have a fundraing event==
==          o 4.4 Effective place for a fundraising event==</text>

=    * 1 Activities that build leadership skills among members=

I wrote an intro for this section because, besides for it being the only section without one, leadership building is an important part of a club's survival, regardless if no one specifically mentioned it. A club must actively train leaders if it wants to be able to effectively operate past a few years.

I added a paragraph to this section because there was no examples of ways to become or improve ones leadership skills, and why these types of activities are important.

I added an example from the Scottish County Dance Club because I thought it was a great way to show how a leader should be chosen, in a natural way. Rebecca slowly gained respect from the members and they grew to listen and trust what she said, the changes she made in any routines etc.

=    * 2 Challenges of Leadership/Communication=
I added to this part of the page as I thought it would outline the positive of the rest of the page's content if the problems of being in a leadership role of an AS club were presented. 
==          o 2.1 Ways to communicate effectively==
I did an intro for this section because I thought it would be a more effective way to start of the section. Also I just felt like it needed an extra something to get the reader interested and ready for the section.

I added a piece about how leadership is the overriding factor that contributes to quality and prompt communication within a given club. Without a leader the club and its members can become very disorganized due to the multiple activities and jobs that each member has. 

I just added some more relevant information to the intro. I stated that it was great to have modern technology give us opportunities to communicate effectively, but it was important that the leaders of clubs actually took the initiative to use this technology to actually communicate effectively on a consistent basis. It just felt like something to add on to the intro because it is also a very important aspect to group communication and leadership. [[User:Kimt7|Kimt7]] ([[User talk:Kimt7|talk]]) 05:37, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I made further revisions to this section because I thought the same ideas could be communicated more concisely while still drawing on the ideas originally presented. 
[[User:Gardnec3|Gardnec3]] ([[User talk:Gardnec3|talk]]) 07:53, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I made revisions to the section discussing how ineffectively technology is for communicating because it got a little blown out of proportion and was a little unrealistic because with the technology we have today communication is most definitely much more far reaching than before. [[User:Moraleg|Moraleg]] ([[User talk:Moraleg|talk]]) 03:01, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

I felt it was important to add a paragraph that concludes the importance of facebook as a communicator, since many groups brought facebook up as a very helpful source of communication.
[[User:Wengerr2|Wengerr2]] ([[User talk:Wengerr2|talk]]) 10:25, 5 June 2009 (UTC)


I added a section to the intro on effective communication about content, since there were some entries (ie sexploration) in that section mentioning the importance of the way content is presented during meetings, and it is a vital part of club communication in general. While I didn't really see any entries discussing the content of general club communications (emails etc), I think it's an aspect of communication worth looking into - now that it's mentioned, maybe someone else can expand upon it. [[User:Kelleya3|Kelleya3]]

==          o 2.2 Working together==
I did the intro to this because i feel like it needed something to start off the section. It is something that many people know about but it needed a transition from one paragraph to another.

I paraphrased what was written before because at some part I was very confused to understand. I wanted to clarify the point that person was making.

D. I added a short edit about the Western Strong Man club because their leadership situation is unique. They only have on real leader and they don't know what to do when she leaves.

I revised the paragraph about Setting Goals and Planning to make it more understandable and clear.

I made a minor edit in this category.  The paragraph talking about the Student Coalition for Immigration Right, the &quot;r&quot; in rights was initially not capitalized and so I changed that.

I added to the content about the uncertain situation posed on the WWU Strongman leadership. I clarified that this club only has one 'active' leader because in reality several students run this club but only one does all the busy work. I also felt that it was important for the purpose of this page that the viewers know that maintaining a club is hard work that often times goes unnoticed.

I helped to summarize that having a strong leader in the group is a good method for group togetherness because if you have a lot of people just saying their ideas then how will you be able to choose which is the best one.

==          o 2.3 Maintaining Membership Diversity==

I've edited the existing paragraph to expand and explain the original ideas that were presented therein. As well, I also added some helpful suggestions for how to effectively implement the strategies mentioned in the original paragraph.


I have further edited this post because I felt that something needed to be added to the introduction to incorporate how this person's statement was relevant to the wiki. I also wanted to make the transition smoother.


I have edited the paragraph by giving an example of how the club works and how do they create a safe place to talk about sex,  also the example I added supports the ideas that were written by the other person. I deleted a sentence because I felt like it didn’t really fit with whatever is being said, and I felt like we didn’t have the right to judge the other clubs since we have never attended them.

I’ve edited the Harry Potter Club paragraph to include more reasons how everyone efficiently and effectively communicating is conducive to running a successful club.

I review this area of topic and realized that there is no summary, so I felt the need to put in a few sentences to sum up the topic.

==          o 2.4 Leadership positions==
I decided to add an opening paragraph to the &quot;Leadership positions&quot; section because it seemed to just dive into the topic without initially summing up the importance of group leaders.

The changes that I made were in regards to the CCF category.  The first edit was rather minor it went from &quot;an so forth&quot; to &quot;and so forth.&quot;  the next edit about CCF was the sentence, &quot;Furthermore, WWU students, Skagit student, and WCC students weekly contribute money to CCF.&quot;  I felt that the change was necessary to clarify who contributes to the club. I have been to the club a few times and know that my information is accurate.


Most of the paragraphs were well written, so the changes I made were minimal. I edited under the Dead Parrots section; with a few run-on sentences I placed a comma or broke it into two sentences to make it flow better.

I made a change to a paragraph about the club I investigated (Women in the Woods). This edit was made in Chapter 6, under the Leadership section. In the original paragraph, the flow didn't really make sense. I felt like the grammer could be changed and more things could be added becuase it was only a short paragraph and some things weren't mentioned. I added input on why when leaders graduate they need to choose a new leader that posses fantatic leadership qualities. Because if a strong leader isn't chosen clubs and their information could be potentially lost. I felt like this was a good contribution becuase if current club leaders at WWU look at our wikibook they will see that choosing a leader that has the same qualities (if not better) than them, then their club will succeed and the legacy will not be lost. (I wasn't sure where to post this the first time around. I accidentally posted it under &quot;My Talk&quot;)

=    * 3 Qualities of strong Leaders=

I added an introductory paragraph for the &quot;Qualities of Strong Leaders&quot; section because it was awkward to just jump right into all the information this section has to offer without having an idea of that the following paragraphs will contain. [[User:Nelso81|Nelso81]] ([[User talk:Nelso81|talk]]) 02:59, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I added the last little bit to this page about being a strong and good leader. I added this specific thing because I believe that what I added is a serious and important quality in a strong leader that I learned in my previous leading experience.

I added a few sentences on the importance of a leader not only being strong, but leaving a lasting impact on those in the group. I felt that the information presented earlier was great, but it needed something about the emotional side of leadership rather then what you see as a result.

==          o 3.1 Organizing meetings==

I personally added a concluding paragraph to this section. The flow of the overall section and the transitions between paragraphs need a bit of work, but I feel that the concluding paragraph brings the Organized Meetings portion of the WikiBook to a nice clear end.


I added a into paragraph to this section. It didn't really have on, it just dove into how a group organizes their meetings. I believe it helps the flow of the section better. I think if someone still needs to do more edits for grade they should throw some transitions in here between paragraphs. (TN)

==          o 3.2 Enthusiasm==
I didn't do any editing in the Ethusiasm section but I DID edit in the goals setting section. In the goals setting section I expanded on it to add completing goals not just setting them. I think it was implied that if you set a goal you should complete it, but it never hurts to be more specific. I also used an example of a goal that a group could set and how they could go about completing their goal.


I added a conclusion paragraph to this section to sum up the importance of enthusiasm in a club as demonstrated by the previous posters.

I added an introduction to this section explaining why enthusiasm was important in a section so that readers would understand that it is necessary.

I expanded on the introduction and fixed grammar to make it more professional and to give a more extensive overview on the importance of enthusiasm.

==          o 3.3 Attitude==

I added a summary to the Attitude section so users would understand what the section was about and understand the examples used.


I decided to change the word choice and the order in what was said. I felt like this brought the points together and was easier to understand.

I made some edits and changes to the first paragraph (second half) of the Attitude section because I felt that more needed to be explained about the description of an effective attitude for a leader. Before, it was just about being positive and not negative but I feel that it is important to note that a leader must be a team player too. I also changed some of the language from what was originally written to make it more sophisticated, less wordy, and clear. 

3.5 Confidentiality 

I added an introduction paragraph to this section because the discussion about Sexploration began without any explanation and seemed sudden. 
I added to this section of the wiki page because I feel that confidentiality is important for clubs. If members are not comfortable with the club or group then they will not attend the club. The clubs need to show that they are open to everyone and accepting of everyone to maximize member size.
I added some thought on the attitude part about optimism and I thought i had to add them just to let others know what could happen if you think too positive. There was a nice description of stuff but adding it what i wrote might have brought up a different thought in their mind.

3.6 Adaptability

I added an introduction paragraph for this section since adaptability could have meant a couple things like adapting the meeting times, club goals, or club events. So I read the paragraph that person wrote on the subject and based it off of what he/she talked about.

=    * 4 Leadership Positions=

I decided to add an opening paragraph to the &quot;Leadership positions&quot; section because it seemed to just dive into the topic without initially summing up the importance of group leaders.

==          o 4.1 Types of Leadership Positions==
I added to the information about the leadership positions available within the KUGS radio station because I felt that there were other more typical leadership roles and that they were not discussed. So I added what positions students can apply for within the radio station and a brief description of those positions duties. [[User:Hedluns|Hedluns]] ([[User talk:Hedluns|talk]]) 04:45, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I added a conclusion to why the WWU Bodybuilding club worked when it came to their leadership so that it flowed more smoothly.

==          o 4.2 Length of Leadership Positions==
==          o 4.3 Passing Down Information and Tasks to New Leaders==
I added an introduction paragraph because there were not any contributions to this page and i felt that the summary of the club i studied would also fit for other clubs as well. In general most of the clubs pick their new leaders in the same way, and i felt that with participant observation all clubs can benefit, and more effectively choose a new leader while passing down important information.

I added a part to the passing down of leaders because the leader of the Photography Club inherited her position, but was left relatively unaware of the clubs practices. She has relied heavily on current members, and has absorbed their information and is quickly becoming a great leader. This is an example of how great leaders do not dictate but work with the group.

==          o 4.4 Distributing Responsibilities and Jobs==

== o 4.5 Sharing Leadership ==

I added an introduction paragraph to this section because I thought it needed something to start off the section before it got into the details of specific clubs and their inner workings. [[User:Winkss|Winkss]] ([[User talk:Winkss|talk]]) 16:40, 4 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

News Media, Politics &amp; Kisha Clubs'''&lt;/big&gt;

== Background ==
Japan has some of the highest circulation of newspapers in the world.  The circulation of Japan's largest daily newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, is greater than that of the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Christian Science
Monitor, and New York Daily News combined. Also, Japan has a literacy rate of over 99% and according to one study over 90% read a daily paper. Japan has the highest per capita newspaper circulation in the world, more than twice that of the US. Still, with these statistics, the public remains uninformed in many situations. The information that gets relayed to the public can sometimes be altered or skewed in order to suit the needs of politicians or corporate commercial gains, even when reporters may have access to such information.  The reason behind this is the Press Club or Kisha Club.

== Kisha Clubs ==

	Kisha Clubs are news gathering organizations that are granted access to privileged resources such as press meetings, press releases, corporate announcements or police debriefings. The meetings or work spaces for the Club members are hosted by different organizations such as the Prime Minister’s office, the police departments, the Diet, ministries, local government, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Japan Business Federation. A member is given access to breaking information on a firsthand basis. In order for a reporter to become a member of a Kisha Club, the news organization that the reporter works for must be a member of the Japan Newspaper Publishers &amp; Editors Association or a body of equal stature. Also, the member must be recommended by at least two press club member organizations of the club the reporter desires to join.   The member must also pay monthly dues to each of the clubs, not exceeding 600 yen per person. Also, because a reporter may be a member of one Kisha Club, it does not mean that reporter will have access to any other Kisha Clubs. For example, in 2001 there was a school massacre in the Osaka prefecture and reporters that were not part of the local police’s press club were denied access to the primary debriefings. After debriefing the local police’s press club members first, the police gave a short debriefing of the incident to the non-member reporters.  In the competitive field of journalism, where time is of the essence, that time can make or break a story.
Today, there are over 300 Kisha Clubs nationwide.  The first club was assembled in 1890 when the Imperial Diet began having discussion sessions.  The media was not allowed access to these meetings or information from these meetings during this time, so the reporters assembled together to put group pressure on the government for admittance and the right to the information revealed in these meetings. The Kisha Clubs resulted from a sort of compromise between the media and the government.  The government told the media what it wanted the public to know and the media relayed the information.

While the Kisha Clubs’ memberships are voluntary, it makes it very difficult to obtain information if one is not a member. Freelance reporters, magazine reporters, web reporters and foreign reporters have limited to no access to the press conferences hosted by the Clubs. The Kisha Club is an institution and system fostered by Japan’s media industry for well over a century in pursuit of the freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the public’s right to know, according to the Kisha Club guidelines, which were set and regulated by Nihon Shinbun Kyokai (NSK) Editorial Affairs Committee and last revised March 9, 2006.  According to the Kisha Club guidelines created by the NSK, the Kisha Clubs operate on five basic principles: &quot;Freedom and Responsibility,&quot; &quot;Accuracy and Fairness,&quot; &quot;Independence and Tolerance,&quot; &quot;Respect for Human Rights&quot; and &quot;Decency and Moderation.&quot;

== Admittance into Kisha Clubs ==
In order to be admitted into a Kisha Club a reporter must follow certain guidelines.  However if a reporter is not a member of the Kisha Club there are certain criteria in which they still may be admitted to an event as an observer, such as having a long standing career with an established news group and an interest in fair reporting, be able to comply with the management of the club and the management’s ideals of media ethics.  In most cases however, the only assurance for admittance to an event is membership. Being admitted as an observer allows a reporter just that, they do not have permission to ask any questions.  Foreign press has fought for many years to attain the same rights and privileges as Kisha Club members. In 2003, the European Commission brought pressure to open media up to foreign reporters by stating “Japan's press club system serves as a trade barrier, excluding foreign correspondents from access to news conferences and briefings.” Just within the last few years foreign media names such as Bloomberg, Associated Press and Reuters have become Kisha Club members of some Tokyo press clubs. Freelance reporters, web reporters and magazine reporters are still banned from Kisha Club events.
	If a reporter is so inclined to be admitted into a Kisha Club, there is always the possibility to offend or misstep over the guidelines. If a reporter reveals off the record information obtained either by government officials or other Club members, that reporter may be banned temporarily from Club access and activities, with his reputation tarnished.  If a reporter fails to abide by a press embargo and prematurely releases a story or a reporter names an informant that asked to be kept confidential, the reporter will have to issue a letter of apology to the Kisha Club or Clubs that he is a member of.  Each club has its own specific way to deal with members’ violations.

== Advantages of Kisha Clubs ==
The Kisha Club system allows government organizations and businesses to instantly get information out to the public. As soon as the information is made available to the reporters, the reporters can make it known to the public, given that there are non press embargoes.  This method also speeds up the process of investigation and writing for the reporters, they don’t have to research the sources or background or even change much of the delivery of the message.  Also, it limits the competitive edge amongst Club reporters because they all have access to exactly the same information at the same time.  Some supporters feel it is a way to ensure high level, quality journalism.

== Disadvantages of Kisha Clubs ==
	There has been much controversy over the idea of Kisha Clubs.  Many people feel they do more harm in relating information to the public than good.  Many feel that it ignores the right of freelance journalism and foreign journalism because it denies access to revelations only made to Kisha Club members, and because these members must comply with guidelines made by the NSK it limits and censors information that is made available to the public.  
	Many critics feel this system encourages friendly relationships between reporters and government officials, lawmakers and corporate officials; which then discourages investigative reporting and creates reluctance from the reporters to question or criticize the information given to the reporters. Many also feel the Kisha Club systems directly relate to violating the public’s right to know.  It is believed that the majority of the Japanese public do not know much about the Kisha Club system, if at all. The system is taboo for most mainstream media, and therefore never mentioned.

== Instances of Controversy ==
One instance of controversy is the funding that the Clubs receive.  The facilities that are available for the Kisha Club members to use are paid for by taxpayers’ money, yet the facilities are not open to the public and are only used for the Club members. This funding is estimated to be about 600 million yen. 
	Yu Terasawa, one of Japan’s most well known investigative freelance journalists, has taken legal action against the Japanese government for being in violation of the right of free press, after he was denied access to a trial of a case that he had been reporting on, his case against the government had eventually reached the Japanese Supreme Court before being dismissed. Terasawa feels that friendly collaborations between government officials and Kisha Clubs promotes lazy journalism, protects personal interests and makes it difficult for freelance journalists, like himself, to inform the public. He feels that his fellow reporters that are members of Kisha Clubs are “sitting in their allocated spaces waiting to be brought a press release to rewrite.”
	In March of 2009, the arrest of an aide of an opposition political leader prompted reports of the defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the upcoming elections. Many of the public felt very differently, but the reports by the media suggested otherwise. Many put blame on the media for not questioning the prosecution for answers, particularly in a prominent time in Japan’s democracy when the country may be changing ruling parties for the first time in over 50 years. “The news media should be watchdogs on authority,” said Yasuhiko Tajima, a journalism professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, “but they act more like authority’s guard dogs.”

{{recipesummary|Vegan recipes|2|60 minutes|2}}


==Ingredients==

* 2 1/4 pounds eggplants 
* 1/2 pound green olives packed in brine, pitted 
* 6 ounces salted capers, rinsed 
* 1 1/4 pounds celery ribs 
* 1 cup tomato sauce (optional) 
* 2/3 pound onions 
* 2/3 pound tomatoes 
* 1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar ]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* Basil 
* 3/8 cup pine nuts 
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* Salt

==Procedure==
# Strip the filaments from the celery sticks and blanch in lightly salted water for five minutes. Drain and cut the celery into bite-size pieces, sauté them in a little oil, and set aside. 
# Wash and dice the eggplant, strain and sprinkle liberally with salt, and let sit for several hours to draw out the bitterness. In the meantime, blanch, peel, seed and chop the tomatoes. 
# Once the eggplant has sat, rinse away the salt and pat the pieces dry. Finely slice the onion and sauté them in olive oil; once they have turned translucent, add the capers, pine nuts, olives, and tomatoes. Continue cooking, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the tomatoes are done, about 15 minutes, and then remove the pot from the fire. 
# While the tomatoes are cooking, heat another pan of oil and fry the eggplant, in batches, to prevent lowering of the frying temperature. When the last batch is done, return the tomato pot to the fire and stir in the eggplant, together with the previously sautéed celery. Cook for several minutes over low flame, stirring gently, then stir in the vinegar and the sugar; when the vinegar has almost completely evaporated, remove the pot from the fire and let it cool. 
# Serve the caponata cold with a garnish of fresh basil. Caponata keeps for several days in the refrigerator.</text>

Extraordinary teachers are usually extraordinary people first, and the majority of the time I've found the best teachers I have had were not extremely academically qualified.

I added an introductory to the communication category to illustrate the importance of communicating with members inside the group during university breaks. I also added ways to communicate. 

In respone to your comment, I changed my comments and put them under &quot;Recruitment&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello!

I loved reading about your goals, so many students seem to just float along happily till they realize it about time to graduate and they need to find a job.  It was refreshing to hear your plans for your future even if they might be in the not so near future.  I spent time working at both the high school and college level and an amazing number of kids aren't planning for the future.  I wish you good luck on your masters progress after undergrad!   And even more good luck on the doctorate program!  At least you have a family member to help show you the ropes as you progress up the educational ladder!  I look forward to working with you!

okay son!

:For what it is worth: The &quot;book&quot; you created, apparently a chicken recipe, was not by any stretch of the imagination a textbook, and Wikibooks is intended to be for textbooks. It used slang, scatological and obscene language, and was as far as I could see intended as humor. There are humor sites on the web in any number of places, perhaps one of them might be more suited to this work. I did mark it for deletion, and will do so again if it reappears, because it does not fit into the format of Wikibooks. Once it was marked, it came to the attention of the site admins, and one of them acted on the deletion request and deleted it.

:Another admin noted your comment on my talk page and removed it; I noted it was removed, read it in the history, and am responding to it here. If you wish to leave further messages on my talk page, please use proper English, and please refrain from being insulting.

:My warning was actually about what you had put on the Reading Room bulletin board, which was also scatological, and irrelevant. I also removed that. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:58, 29 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hindi}}
Nouns in Hindi will fall into one of two genders: masculine and feminine. Many masculine nouns end in the long vowel ''A'' and many feminine nouns end in the long vowel ''I'', but there are exceptions to this rule. For example, ''AdmI,'' meaning &quot;man,&quot; is a masculine noun. ''bhAshA,'' meaning &quot;language,&quot; is a feminine noun.

Nouns in Hindi pluralize in four possible ways:

* For masculine nouns ending in the long ''A'' vowel, ''A'' is changed to ''e.'' (example: ''kamarA'' (room) becomes ''kamare.'')
* Masculine nouns not ending in ''A'' do not change when pluralized. (Example: ''hAth'' (hand).)
* Feminine nouns ending in the long ''I'' vowel shorten the last vowel to a short ''i'' and and add a nasalized ''yA'' (''yANG''). (Example: ''khiRDkI'' (window) becomes ''khiRDkiyANG''.)
* Feminine nouns not ending with the long ''I'' vowel append the nasalized ''e'' vowel (''eNG''). (Example: ''kitAb'' (book) becomes ''kitAbeNG''.)

Pluralized nouns of either gender followed by a positional word or phrase (postposition) always end in the nasalized vowel ''o'' (''oNG''). (The nouns listed above would become ''kamarONG, hAthONG, khiRDkiyONG,'' and ''kitAbONG''.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Ryan,

I was glancing through your article and it looks great!  One correction that should be made is within your learning targets... make them a little more specific. Review the powerpoint from the lecture on learning targets for examples.  When rewriting them, think about your multiple choice questions. Also, make sure to incorporate two application style questions. This also explained in a powerpoint on Blackboard. Please let us know if you have any questions! Have a great day! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 17:23, 10 June 2009 (UTC)



Ryan! You spelled my name wrong! Lol. Some &quot;best friend&quot; you are. With that out of the way; I had no idea that you're an Eagle Scout. That's really impressive. My dad is one, and he's told me all about how hard it is to recieve that honor.
Thanks for the positive feedback on my teaching philosophy. Yours is very good too. I especially like how you point out the differences in the teaching of different subjects; this is something that I think a lot of people don't acknowledge. See you soon, Sarah. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 01:34, 29 May 2009 (UTC)


Hi Ryan! It is really interesting that you are pursuing a degree in Music Education, most of the students I talk to are like me, getting a degree in PreK-3 or PreK-6. I played the flute before in middle school, which was a big difference from the piano and violin, however, it was a fun experience. One day, I would like to learn how to play the clarinet and possibly pick up the flute. Another aspect I liked about your description is that your band director inspired you to a new level of music. When I was in elementary school, one of the best teachers I ever had started my journey to becoming a teacher before I even realized it. It is that kind of inspiration that I hope to pass own to my future students. Your teaching philosophy is very relatable; one of the hardest aspects of teaching is keeping a subject interesting and “fresh” to all students. I have been in many classes where, despite the teacher’s best effort, the subject was geared toward students who really enjoyed the subject, such as math. As I have gotten older and taken many college classes, I have realized that you do not have to like a class in order to do well in it. However, many students realize this too late or do not know how to go about it. One of my goals is to make any subject interesting to all students, so that even if they dislike the subject they can still enjoy the activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">But who would a singer be with out someone to write songs for them? More specifically and more importantly: what would an opera be without a librettist? Thank you for that incredible compliment. I'm also certian that the musicians and writers on campus have a lot in common, and if any of us ventured away from the safety of the buildings where most of our classes are held and our close-knit groups of friends, we'd discover that. Question: what other Star Wars is there other than the original trilogy? I disregard the newer movies as a futile attempt to be any type of partner to the originals. And, to be perfectly honest, I know a few people who don't love the Beatles; and everytime I see them, I question both their sanity and the validity of our friendship. You said you attended a video game convention last year; have you ever been to Comicon? That's something I'd love to attend. Sarah.

I can see the battle lines now, the hordes of scrawny, myopic, near-do-wells clad in armor forged from the history of American letters. A breastplate of Faulkner, a shield of Hemmingway, much verbose blood shall be spilled in our names. Also, it is scientific fact that my true form cannot be photographed. The radiance of my true being eludes all capture, only eyes that can behold the divine can perceive me truly, the most common method used by mortals is peyote. However, in a tight spot massive doses of Nyquil have been effective. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 01:48, 30 May 2009 (UTC)

Hola Hunter!
First of all I admire your dedication to your reading, some interesting authors mentioned. Reading can sometimes take you places and help you escape from reality as well as improve our own perception. It also allows us to distort it depending on what is going in our current lives. My fix personally is art. As far as your educational philosophy I strongly agree and believe in maintaining the student involved and engaged at all times. As you said we as teachers should present the material in the most relevant way possible so that the students grasp the information as best as possible, it is truly the most effective way of teaching.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 16:46, 30 May 2009 (UTC)

Mornin' Hunter,
Great to hear there are more gamers interested in education. What platform/ series are you most fond of? Neil Gaiman is also a favorite of mine. Depending on the level of school you teach I think Stardust would be a fun book to add to the English Arsenal.  Overall I think the world of education needs more people like yourself to vary the prospectives of public education. I teach mathematics so it's a bit harder to &quot;shake&quot; the foundations of the subject in quite the way the English is so malleable. I think it is also important for younger people to get into the field of educations. Being 22 myself, I find that the students are much more responsive to me than say an older teacher they may not be able to relate to. Good luck with the houses!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Through the course of this spring quarter, I have noticed that the Hui O’ Hawaii club has an affectionate atmosphere that no observer can help denying. During the process of assignment six, I felt it necessary to enlighten on a few different subjects that were most important in my opinion. 

The first topic was the recent change in the organization’s leadership method. Due to the new authority, the club has grown closer because the lack of guidance from past leaders allowed the members to grow closer and form a dependant standing. 

The second addition I made involved a small altercation to a fellow colleague’s paragraph as well as a sentence adding to his (or her) thought. I wanted to add their absence at the Fall Info Fair at the beginning of the academic year and how it affected the method of recruitment. 

And finally, I thought the importance of fundraising should be brought up as well. The discussion to purchase a shave-ice machine struck my attention and thought it was a great idea. I used this movement made by the Hui O’ Hawaii club as an example to cover the topic “Why Fundraising?” In this particular instance it provides a great opportunity to make a little extra money for their organization and presents the status of the club to the rest of the Western students—showing off the operation system, energy and liveliness.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Japan's Militarism refers to the ideology of the Empire of Japan that militarism should dominate the political and social life of the nation, and that the strength of the military is equal to the strength of a nation.


== The Birth of Militarism in Japan ==

Ever since Feudal Japan the military compromised of factions, clans of lords that worked similarly to the feudalism in Europe. After the Meiji Restoration Almost all leaders in Japanese society during the Meiji period (whether in the military, politics or business) were ex-samurai or descendants of samurai, and shared a common set of values and outlooks. The early Meiji government viewed Japan as threatened by western imperialism, and one of the prime motivations for the Fukoku Kyohei policy was to strengthen Japan's economic and industrial foundations, so that a strong military could be built to defend Japan against outside powers. It was then when Japan begun its transition to industrialization of the entire country and develop Japan into an industrialized state built around a strong economic, industrial, and militarized state.

The Meiji Restoration period was an immensely hard time for Japan's social and government ebcause of massive revolts against the system. Japan's Emperors after the 1860's were literally bringing Japan into the industrial age as fast as they could to catch up with most western powers even if the people of Japan were lagging behind. The rise of political parties in the late Meiji period was coupled with the rise of secret and semi-secret patriotic societies, such as the Genyōsha (1881) and Kokuryukai (1901), which coupled political activities with paramilitary activities and military intelligence, and supported expansionism overseas as a solution to Japan's domestic issues. During these periods Japan looked abroad to follow other examples around the world to build a great war machine, because of the islands  shortness on raw materials. Japanese ambassadors were sent around to the world to learn, report, and observe how other great western powers had built there military up for this new age of industrialized combat. Most notably was the encounter with the Prussian Army and the advice of Major Jakob Meckel's views on the differences between the German and the French military models. In response to a Japanese request, Prussian Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke selected Meckel.[2] In Japan, Meckel worked closely with future Prime Ministers General Katsura Taro and General Yamagata Aritomo, and with army strategist General Kawakami Soroku. Meckel made numerous recommendations which were implemented, including reorganization of the command structure of the army into divisions and regiments, thus increasing mobility, strengthening the army logistics and transportation structure, with the major army bases connected by railways, establishing artillery and engineering regiments as independent commands, and revising the universal conscription system to abolish virtually all exceptions. A bust of Meckel was sited in front of the Japanese Army Staff College from 1909 through 1945.[3]Although his period in Japan (1885-1888) was relatively short, Meckel had a tremendous impact on the development of the Japanese military. He is credited with having introduced Clauswitz's military theories[4] and the Prussian concept of war games (kriegspiel) in a process of refining tactics.[5] By training some sixty of the highest-ranking Japanese officers of the time in tactics, strategy and organization, he was able to replace the previous influences of the French advisers with his own philosophies.


== Ultra Nationalism ==

During the 19th century, Great Power status was considered dependent on resource-rich colonial empires, both as a source of raw materials for military and industrial production, and international prestige.
Due to the lack of resources in Japanese home islands, raw materials such as iron, oil, and coal largely had to be imported. The idea through the Imperial army was that of nationalism and bringing the idea of Emperor and country first before anyone else. Before the Imperial age of colonialism. Japan's culture and life especially in the feudal age had strong thoughts of ethnocentrism and superiority to other races. These ideas were constantly brought out in training and in the education system through out the Meiji Restoration and into latter half of the 20th century. The birth of Ultra nationalism came into mainstream society which became the fanatic fervor and the loyalty of the people. Imperialist nature was inevitable for Japan as they looked outward into China, Taiwan, and Manchuria for raw materials and resources. 



== Imperialism (National Interests) ==

Japan had been involved in the Asian continent continuously from the First Sino-Japanese War, Boxer Rebellion, Russo-Japanese War, World War I and the Siberian Intervention. During the term of Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi from 1927 to 1929, Japan sent troops three times to China to obstruct Chiang Kai-shek's unification campaign. In June 1928, adventurist officers of the Kwantung Army embarked on unauthorized initiatives to protect Japanese interests in Manchuria, including the assassination of a former ally, warlord Zhang Zuolin, in hopes of sparking a general conflict. The Manchurian Incident of September 1931 did not fail, and it set the stage for the Japanese military takeover of all of Manchuria. Kwangtung Army conspirators blew up a few meters of South Manchurian Railway Company track near Mukden, blamed it on Chinese saboteurs, and used the event as an excuse to invade and seize the vast territory.
In Tokyo one month later, in the Imperial Colors Incident, military figures failed in an attempt to establish a military dictatorship, but again the news was suppressed and the military perpetrators were not punished.
In January 1932, Japanese forces attacked Shanghai in the First Shanghai Incident, waging a three-month undeclared war there before a truce was reached. The civilian government in Tokyo was powerless to prevent these military adventures, and instead of being condemned, the Kwangtung Army's actions enjoyed considerable popular support.
The Japanese Military had major successes in its colonial campaign in its quest for resources. It greatly expanded its own empire and gained a world power status as it steam rolled through out Asia and the Pacific islands. 


== The Ending of Japanese Militarism ==

The war with the United States greatly inhibited movements and outward expansion for Japan and limited them greatly in other campaigns to increase resource production and mobilization. The war with the United States was supposed to be a decisive war that could lead o no longer than 3 years because of faltering supply lines and basic resources. However the war lasted 4 years and the opposite ended up happening to Imperial Japan as it was put on the defensive after the pivotal battle of Midway which turned the tide of the war to the United States. Despite efforts to totally militarize Japanese society during the war, including such measures as the National Service Draft Ordinance and the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, Japanese militarism was completely discredited during the American occupation by the utter failure of Japan's military in World War II. After the surrender of Japan, many of its former military leaders were tried for war crimes before the Tokyo tribunal, its government, educational system revised and had pacifism written into the post-war Constitution of Japan as one of its key tenets.


== Japan Today ==

Today Japan resides as a country of pacifism and peace. Efforts to keep it a pacifist state is a controversial debate in the Japanese Diet. Japan after the war has remained against war, and has put such articles in their own constitution such as Article 9  &quot;is a clause in the National Constitution of Japan that prohibits an act of war by the state. The Constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, immediately following World War II. In its text, the state formally renounces war as a sovereign right and bans settlement of international disputes through the use of force. The article also states that, to accomplish these aims, armed forces with war potential will not be maintained.&quot;

Japan is also a leader in the world for peace and humanity works. Japan today has completely took an opposite stance politically since World War 2 and continues to strive for peace before everything else. It is one of the only countries around the world that proclaims and follows this statement.

      <comment>/* The Kototoi Bridge */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Kototoi Bridge ==
 
Kototoi-Bashi which literally tranlsates into Kototoi Bridge rests on the Sumida River in the heart of Tokyo (Asakusa District) The Kototoi Bridge, dating from 1928, was reconstructed at the location of the bridge which linked two nearby temples -- the Mimeguri-Jinja and the Matsuchiyama-shoden. The Bridge was a vital intersection of crossing into Tokyo back in the mid 1940's and remained a prominent passing lane and hub for the citizens. The Sumida River back then did not have as many bridges that it has today (Seven) and the Kototoi bridge remained one of the most important bridges.

== Historical Significance ==
The Kototoi Bridge remains a constant reminder that few know of and remember in Tokyo society. A monument stands at the head of the bridge to all the fallen civilians that died in the Tokyo Air raid in 1945. The B-29 Super fortress bomber made its first appearance over Tokyo on November 1, 1944 - a single plane flying at 35,000 feet; beyond the reach of the defender's anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. The intruder dropped no bombs. This was strictly a reconnaissance mission. The B-29 Bomber made its effective recon run over Tokyo and thus began the preparations of making the war of attrition on Japan. The most devastating bombing campaign in all of the war in the Pacific. The Tokyo Air Raid started as a high altitude level carpet bombing over the main cities of Japan. Tokyo being one of them, was initially activated by the new Commander, Major-General Curtis Lemay. The high level bombing runs proved to be ineffective in a military standpoint. This was due to the air flow over Japan which caused much of the allies ordinance to miss its primary targets. General Lemay then came up with the idea of using incendiary low level missions at night to cause significant damage and hasten the end of the war. A successful incendiary raid required ideal weather that included dry air and significant wind. Weather reports predicted these conditions over Tokyo on the night of March 9-10, 1945. A force of 334 B-29s was unleashed - each plane stripped of ammunition for its machine guns to allow it to carry more fire-bombs. The lead attackers arrived over the city just after dark and were followed by a procession of death that lasted until dawn. The fires started by the initial raiders could be seen from 150 miles away. The results were devastating: almost 17 square miles of the city were reduced to ashes. Estimates of the number killed range between 80,000 and 200,000, a higher death toll than that produced by the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima or Nagasaki six months later.(http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/tokyo.html) The bombers' primary target was the neighboring industrial district of the city that housed factories, docks and the homes of the workers who supplied the manpower for Japan's war industry. The district hugged Tokyo Bay and was densely-packed with wooden homes lining winding streets that followed random paths - all the ingredients necessary for creating a perfect fire storm.(http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/tokyo.htm)

== Continued... ==

A first hand account of the raid... &quot;Around midnight, the first Superfortresses dropped hundreds of clusters of the incendiary cylinders the people called &quot;Molotov flower baskets,&quot; marking out the target zone with four or five big fires. The planes that followed, flying lower, circled and crisscrossed the area, leaving great rings of fire behind them. Soon other waves came in to drop their incendiaries inside the &quot;marker&quot; circles. Hell could be no hotter.&quot; The ground was set and the order begin immediately and the bombings began laying waste to the ground and buildings of Tokyo. The small wood houses nearby to the factories of Nakijima and Mitsubishi were instantly scorched burning everything inside instantly. Tokyo began to light up as a constant pelting of the city lasted all night and into dawn. The Japanese civil services were completely under manned for a titanic and colossal fires that swept through the city. In the district of Asakusa where the Kototoi bridge was the area of the most civilian casualties. The Kototoi bridge became a frantic bottleneck opening for many Japanese people trying to escape the fiery infernos that were growing rapidly. The Kototoi bridge trapped many people as people from both sides were jammed on the bridge eventually succumbed to suffocation and the fires. Hundreds of people gave up trying to escape and, with or without their precious bundles, crawled into the holes that served as shelters; their charred bodies were found after the raid. Whole families perished in holes they had dug under their wooden houses because shelter space was scarce in those overpopulated hives of the poor; the house would collapse and burn on top of them, braising them in their holes. The Tokyo Air raid remains the worst bombing in the pacific war. The site at the head of the Kototoi bridge remains as a small reminder of what happened on that summer night in Tokyo.


== Kototoi Bridge Today ==
The bridge was remodeled and reconstructed to support heavier traffic especially after the war as it was heavily damaged. Pieces of the old bridge remain at the monument for the Tokyo Air Raid. Kototoi remains one of the busiest commercial bridges still in use and is located where the famous Cherry Blossoms bloom in the spring time. 


== Impact on the Author ==
Kototoi Bridge happened to be on the first day I visited Tokyo. This was a special place to me for the reason that I consider myself a historian and a knowledgeable at least on military issues. The Kototoi was a powerful place for me to stand there as a witness of what happened in the past. Places like the bridge where I know full well that something monumental took place, in this case a major tragedy for one side and collateral damage on the other. This and Hiroshima will remain as a powerful memory and that I'm glad I expeirenced it up close.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook was started by engineers studying at ETH Zurich as part of the course Computational Simulations of Sensory Systems. 
The course combines physiology with an emphasis on the sensory systems, programming and signal processing. There is a plethora of information regarding these topics on the internet and in the literature, but there's a distinct lack of concise texts and books on the fusion of these 3 topics. The world needs a structured and thorough overview of biology and biological systems from an engineering point of view, which is what this book is trying to correct. We will start off with the Visual System, focusing on the biological and physiological aspects, mainly because this will be used in part to grade our performance in the course. The other part being the programming aspects have already been evaluated and graded. It is the authors' wishes that eventually information on physiology/biology, signal processing AND programming shall be added to each of the sensory systems. Also we hope that more sections will be added to extend the book in ways previously unthought of.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While the human brain may make us what we are, our sensory systems are our windows and doors to the world. In fact they are our ONLY windows and doors to the world. So when one of these systems fails, the corresponding part of our world is no longer accessible to us. Recent advances in engineering  have made it possible to replace sensory systems by mechanical and electrical sensors, and to couple those sensors electronically to our nervous system. While to many this may sound futuristic and maybe even a bit scary, it can work magically. For the auditory system, so called “cochlea implants” have given thousands of patients who were completely deaf their hearing back, so that they can interact and communicate freely again with their family and friends. Many research groups are also exploring different approaches to retinal implants, in order to restore vision to the blind. And in 2010 the first patient has been implanted with a “vestibular implant”, to alleviate defects in his balance system.

The wikibook “Sensory Systems” wants to present our sensory systems from an engineering and information processing point of view. On the one hand, this provides some insight in the sometimes spectacular ingenuity and performance of our senses. On the other hand, it provides some understanding of how our senses transduce external information into signals that our central nervous system can work with, and how – and how well - this process can be replaced by technical components.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally speaking, visual systems rely on Electromagnetic (EM) Waves to give an organism more information about its surroundings. This information could be regarding potential mates, dangers and sources of sustenance. Different organisms have different constituents that make up what is referred to as a visual system. A possible general pathway for what goes on in most visual systems can be seen in the following figure:
[[Image:SensoryProcessing.png|center|690px]]

The EM waves are collected by visual system sensory organs and transduced by cells containing pigments that react to EM waves of a certain range of wavelengths. These photosensitive cells will change polarity/voltage when exposed to EM radiation, where the intensity of the EM waves is perceived as brightness, direction is discernible with accuracy based mostly on the complexity of the particular eye construction found in the organism. The complexity of eyes range from something as simple as an eye spot, which is nothing more than a collection of photosensitive cells, to a fully fledged camera eye. If an organism has different types of photosensitive cells, or cells sensitive to different wavelength ranges, the organism would theoretically be able to perceive colour or at the very least colour differences. Polarisation, another property of EM radiation, can be detected by some organisms, with insects and cephalopods having the highest accuracy.

Please note, in this text, the focus has been on using EM waves to see. Granted, some organisms have evolved alternative ways of obtaining sight or at the very least supplementing what they see with extra-sensory information. For example, whales or bats, which use echo-location. This may be seeing in some sense of the definition of the word, but it is not entirely correct. Additionally, vision and visual are words most often associated with EM waves in the visual wavelength range, which is normally defined as the same wavelength limits of human vision. Since some organisms detect EM waves with frequencies below and above that of humans a better definition must be made. We therefore define the visual wavelength range as wavelengths of EM between 300nm and 800nm. This may seem arbitrary to some, but selecting the wrong limits would render parts of some bird's vision as non-vision. Also, with this range of wavelengths, we have defined for example the thermal-vision of certain organisms, like for example snakes as non-vision. Therefore snakes using their pit organs, which is sensitive to EM between 5000nm and 30,000nm (IR), do not &quot;see&quot;, but somehow &quot;feel&quot; from afar. Even if blind specimens have been documented targeting and attacking particular body parts.

Firstly a brief description of different types of visual system sensory organs will be elaborated on, followed by a thorough explanation of the components in human vision, the signal processing of the visual pathway in humans  and finished off with an example of the perceptional outcome due to these stages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are like many of us foreigners, you might have assumed that a homogenous country such as Japan, might not have to manage issues of race and discrimination. Indeed, Japan has a [http://www.indexmundi.com/japan/demographics_profile.html population] of 127,288,416. That is, 99.4% of Japan’s population are Japanese. However, while Japan is predominantly comprised of ethnic Japanese citizens, Japan is a multi-ethnic nation comprised of various other ethnic minority groups such Koreans, Chinese, Taiwanese, Brazilians, Ainu etc. Historically, these ethnic minority groups have had a difficult time living and existing within Japanese society.  Women and sexual minorities are the subject of discriminatory treatment in Japan as well.

Japan is known for being a closed society with tough immigration laws that discourage migration to the country. Racial discrimination and xenophobia do indeed exist in Japan. The law prohibits discrimination on basis of race, gender, disability, language, and social status. Although the government generally enforced these provisions, discrimination against women, ethnic minorities and foreigners remained (Bureau of Democracy, 2009). The effects of discrimination are felt be many racial and minority groups in Japan including the Buraku people, the Ainu, the people of Okinawa, people from former Japanese colonies such as the Koreans, Chinese, and their descendants, other foreigners, and migrant workers who have come from all over Asia (IMADR, 2009).  While there are laws that prohibit racial discrimination, the country’s large populations of Korean, Chinese, and Filipino residents were subject to deeply entrenched societal discrimination (Bureau of Democracy, 2009). 

This discrimination often takes the form of restricted access to housing, education, and employment opportunities. The Human Rights Watch Report also cited a widespread perception among citizens that these Japan born ethnic “foreigners” were responsible for most of the crimes committed in Japan. This mis-perception persists despite empirical data presented by the Ministry of Justice showing that crimes committed by “foreigners” was statistically lower than the crime rates of Japanese citizens. Indigenous peoples such as the Ainu and Okinawans faced the same patterns of discrimination as other ethnic minorities (McNeil, 2006).

Japan is also charged with protecting and preserving the human rights of Japanese women. With respect to the various issues surrounding women’s rights, Japan has generally provided women with the same rights as men. However, despite these efforts problems persist. The law criminalizes all forms of rape, including spousal rape. Although the number of reported rape cases were significantly less than those reported in 2007, there were still 747 reported rape cases during the first half or 2008 (Bureau of Democracy, 2009). 

Domestic violence against women and sexual harassment in the workplace remained problems as well.  In 2007, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare received 15,799 reports of sexual harassment. Laws protecting women from sexual harassment include measures to identify companies that failed to prevent sexual harassment, but does not include tangible, punitive measures to enforce compliance other than publicizing the names of offending companies (MHLW, 2009). Additionally, women in Japan continue to encounter discrimination in employment with women earning less than two thirds of the monthly salary earned by men (MHLW, 2009).

The groping of women in public, particularly in subway cars, continues to be a problem as well. In Japan, more than 4,000 men are arrested each year for groping on public transport (Herbert, 2004). This prompted a number of government interventions such as police crackdowns, increased police presence in subway cars, and the introduction of “women only” carriages during peak hours.

Japan also has challenges regarding the treatment of sexual minorities. Compared to other countries, Japan is more accepting of its sexual minorities. Nevertheless, they face many issues of discrimination because of their chosen lifestyle. Many sexual minorities believe that Japanese society does not accept them as an equal members. According to one study conducted at the University of California San Francisco, sexual minorities experience ostracism as well as bullying via physical, verbal and psychological abuse. Additionally, they face discrimination at school, work, in their personal lives as well as in housing as many landlord refuse to rent to them. 

Sexual minorities do not enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals as same-sex marriages are not allowed. Most sexual minorities choose to keep their sexual preference hidden at work and at school. They feel that to be &quot;out&quot; at school or at work exposes them openly to ridicule and decreased opportunities for employment. Much like Korean residents and other members of the Boraku community, sexual minorities in Japan find it easier to pass themselves off as &quot;normal&quot;.
 
As we have studied and discussed as part of this class, Japan is positioned quite nicely to be the catalyst for great change and a model for other nations, particularly the Asian countries. It’s pacifist Constitution, Article 9, economic position in the World, status as a “World super-power” etc. potentially give Japan a moral foothold to advance ideas and concepts regarding world peace. 

However, like so many other great nations, Japan must continue examining it's domestic human rights policies if they want to preserve their “honorable place in world”.

A '''pastry board''' is a portable surface designed for the mixing, [[Cookbook:Dough#Kneading|kneading]] and rolling of bread and pastry [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]]. It can be made from a variety of materials, each with their own advantages and drawbacks.

'''Acrylic''' boards are inexpensive and the least likely to retain sticky dough. However, they are also less durable than other types and are inappropriate for doughs that require physical striking.

'''Marble''' boards tend to remain cooler than room temperature. This makes dough, especially for pastries, far easier with which to work. These boards tend to be the most expensive and are susceptible to breakage from drops. 

'''Wooden''' boards tend to fall between the other types in regard to cost and performance. Typically made from hardwoods, such as oak, cherry or walnut, these are resilient at a relatively moderate cost. They require chilling for use with lighter pastries.</text>

Aliases include &quot;pS,&quot; &quot;Uncle Sharp&quot; and &quot;Pen.&quot; Pencilsharp may also occasionally refer to Pencilsharp in the third-Pencilsharp. Much care and patience may be required at such times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==
Camera calibration using an algorithm proposed by Tsai. We use it to transform the image coordinates in world coordinates. More information about it can be found in his paper : &quot;An Efficient and Accurate Camera Calibration Technique for 3D Machine Vision&quot;, Roger Y. Tsai, Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Miami Beach, FL, 1986, pages 364-374.&quot; or on this [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgw/TsaiCode.html website]. The calibration code come from this website.

For a deformed image, TSAI is better than a purely linear second order calibration method. However, it is slower, and sometimes, when the camera axis is orthogonal the to setup plan, TSAI method can lead to error in computation and tremendous errors, and even crash of the method.

A good presentation of the parameters can be found [http://www.openvisor.org/faq_calibration.txt here].

This component is different from CalibrationTSAI as it does not compute the parameters and load them from a xml file.

Tools to compute these parameters with matlab/octave are provided in calibrationTools/Matlab_Octave.
The following files can be used:
* computeTsaiCalibrationParameters.m: Compute the Tsai parameters from calibration points coordinates (coplanar calibration)
* TsaiImage2World.m: Transform the image coordinates to world coordinates using the Tsai calibration parameters (It is the same implementation than the one used in this component)
* WriteTSAICalibrationParametersXMLFile.m: Write a Tsai calibration parameters in the right format for the component.
* WriteSwisTrackCalibrationXMLFile.m: Write calibration points to a xml file compatible with swisTrack
* readSwisTrackCalibrationXMLFile.m: Read calibration points from a xml file compatible with swisTrack
* optimizeSx.m: Search for the optimal value of sx for the calibration
* computeError.m: Compute the calibration errors

== Input ==
Particles

== Output ==
Particles

== Parameters ==

=== Calib. Points ===

This file is not mandatory as they are not used to compute the calibration paramters. If provided, the component compute the calibration errors and write them in a log file.
Path the XML file containing the calibration points. The file must have the following format:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;pointlist&gt;
  &lt;points&gt;
    &lt;point&gt;
      &lt;xworld&gt;0.3&lt;/xworld&gt;
      &lt;yworld&gt;0.9&lt;/yworld&gt;
      &lt;ximage&gt;9.8&lt;/ximage&gt;
      &lt;yimage&gt;10.3&lt;/yimage&gt;
    &lt;/point&gt;
    &lt;point&gt;
      &lt;xworld&gt;34.1&lt;/xworld&gt;
      &lt;yworld&gt;7.9&lt;/yworld&gt;
      &lt;ximage&gt;44.3&lt;/ximage&gt;
      &lt;yimage&gt;25.9&lt;/yimage&gt;
    &lt;/point&gt;
  &lt;/points&gt;
&lt;/pointlist&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

More points can be added in the same way as the two points in this example. A minimum of 5 non-collinear points is needed to compute the calibration.

=== Calib. Param. ===
Path the XML file containing the calibration parameters. The file must have the following format:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;calibration&gt;
	&lt;parameters&gt;
		&lt;R&gt;
			&lt;aa&gt;-0.0009487&lt;/aa&gt;

			&lt;bb&gt;-0.00062456&lt;/bb&gt;
			&lt;bc&gt;0.0011873&lt;/bc&gt;
			&lt;ca&gt;-0.00094847&lt;/ca&gt;
			&lt;cb&gt;0.29671&lt;/cb&gt;
			&lt;cc&gt;0.95497&lt;/cc&gt;
		&lt;/R&gt;
		&lt;T&gt;
			&lt;Tx&gt;7.2682&lt;/Tx&gt;
			&lt;Ty&gt;-1.1722&lt;/Ty&gt;
			&lt;Tz&gt;-15.1438&lt;/Tz&gt;
		&lt;/T&gt;
		&lt;C&gt;
			&lt;Cx&gt;516&lt;/Cx&gt;
			&lt;Cy&gt;389&lt;/Cy&gt;
		&lt;/C&gt;
		&lt;dx&gt;
			&lt;value&gt;4.65e-006&lt;/value&gt;
		&lt;/dx&gt;
		&lt;dy&gt;
			&lt;value&gt;4.65e-006&lt;/value&gt;
		&lt;/dy&gt;
		&lt;sx&gt;
			&lt;value&gt;1.042&lt;/value&gt;
		&lt;/sx&gt;
		&lt;k&gt;
			&lt;value&gt;-0.066654&lt;/value&gt;
		&lt;/k&gt;
		&lt;f&gt;
			&lt;value&gt;-0.01293&lt;/value&gt;
		&lt;/f&gt;
	&lt;/parameters&gt;
&lt;/calibration&gt;

Hello Ashley,

Your article looks great! The only part that worries me is your picture.  Is it copyrighted?  Where did you get it?  If you have any questions, please review the powerpoint and send us an email.  Have a great day! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 17:44, 10 June 2009 (UTC)



Hi Ashley! 

I really enjoyed realding about your teching philosophy and the quotes that you added to your page. They were great (and so true). I completely agree that students with special needs should be included in the classroom. When the proper measures are taken, it can be so beneficial for all the students involed. They can all learn so much from one another! It sounds like your experience in the pre-school will really help when you begin teaching. It so great to be in the classroom and spend as much time as you can understanding the children and helping to develop your own set of skills that you can use in the future. I hope you have a succussful semester! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 17:11, 29 May 2009 (UTC)khedl002</text>

Your article looks great! Don't forget to include the answers to your MC questions! :) Let me know if you have any questions! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 17:53, 10 June 2009 (UTC)


Hello Jill,

Our philosophys are very similiar.  I also believe we need to understand that students learn in different way and that this is the key to effective teaching.  From your experience already you know what it takes and I am sure you will be a great teacher.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 03:58, 30 May 2009 (UTC)

Hey Jill,
I am a mother as well. I know how difficult it can be holding down a full time job and trying to maintain housework and everything else. Sometimes it just seems overwhelming don't it? I agree with you about the trust issue.  If a student trusts you then you have something special. Even though I don't plan to teach k-6 I still enjoyed your prespectives on education. Good luck with class and enjoy being an educator.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: crystaline → crystalline using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Vision, or the ability to see depends on visual system sensory organs or eyes. There are many different constructions of eyes, ranging in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism. The different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wave-lengths and have differing degrees of acuity, also they require different processing to make sense of the input and different numbers to work optimally. The ability to detect and decipher EM has proved to be a valuable asset to most forms of life, leading to an increased chance of survival for organisms that utilise it. In environments without sufficient light, or complete lack of it, lifeforms have no added advantage of vision, which ultimately has resulted in atrophy of visual sensory organs with subsequent increased reliance on other senses (e.g. some cave dwelling animals, bats etc.). Interestingly enough, it appears that visual sensory organs are tuned to the optical window, which is defined as the EM wavelengths (between 300nm and 1100nm) that pass through the atmosphere reaching to the ground. This is shown in the figure below. You may notice that there exists other &quot;windows&quot;, an IR window, which explains to some extent the thermal-&quot;vision&quot; of snakes, and a radiofrequency (RF) window, of which no known lifeforms are able to detect.

[[Image:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg|center|700px]]

Through time evolution has yielded many eye constructions, and some of them have evolved multiple times, yielding similarities for organisms that have similar niches. There is one underlying aspect that is essentially identical, regardless of species, or complexity of sensory organ type, the universal usage of light-sensitive proteins called opsins. Without focusing too much on the molecular basis though, the various constructions can be categorised into distinct groups:

* Spot Eyes

* Pit Eyes

* Pinhole Eyes

* Lens Eyes

* Refractive Cornea Eyes

* Reflector Eyes

* Compound Eyes 

The least complicated configuration of eyes enable organisms to simply sense the ambient light, enabling the organism to know whether there is light or not. It is normally simply a collection of photosensitive cells in a cluster in the same spot, thus sometimes referred to as spot eyes, eye spot or stemma. By either adding more angular structures or recessing the spot eyes, an organisms gains access to directional information as well, which is a vital requirement for image formation. These so called pit eyes are by far the most common types of visual sensory organs, and can be found in over 95% of all known species.

[[Image:Nautilus_pompilius_(head).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Pinhole eye]]
Taking this approach to the obvious extreme leads to the pit becoming a cavernous structure, which increases the sharpness of the image, alas at a loss in intensity. In other words, there is a trade-off between intensity or brightness and sharpness. An example of this can be found in the Nautilus, species belonging to the family Nautilidae, organisms considered to be living fossils. They are the only known species that has this type of eye, referred to as the pinhole eye, and it is completely analogous to the pinhole camera or the camera obscura. In addition, like more advanced cameras, Nautili are able to adjust the size of the aperture thereby increasing or decreasing the resolution of the eye at a respective decrease or increase in image brightness. Like the camera, the way to alleviate the intensity/resolution trade-off problem is to include a lens, a structure that focuses the light unto a central area, which most often has a higher density of photo-sensors. By adjusting the shape of the lens and moving it around, and controlling the size of the aperture or pupil, organisms can adapt to different conditions and focus on particular regions of interest in any visual scene. The last upgrade to the various eye constructions already mentioned is the inclusion of a refractive cornea. Eyes with this structure have delegated two thirds of the total optic power of the eye to the high refractive index liquid inside the cornea, enabling very high resolution vision. Most land animals, including humans have eyes of this particular construct. Additionally, many variations of lens structure, lens number, photosensor density, fovea shape, fovea number, pupil shape etc. exists, always, to increase the chances of survival for the organism in question. These variations lead to a varied outward appearance of eyes, even with a single eye construction category. Demonstrating this point, a collection of photographs of animals with the same eye category (refractive cornea eyes) is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;'''Refractive Cornea Eyes'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;table border=0 align=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Hawk_eye.jpg|150 px|thumb|Hawk Eye]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Ewe sheep black and white.jpg||150 px|thumb|Sheep Eye]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Изображение_307.jpg|thumb|150 px|Cat Eye]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Eye_iris.jpg|thumb|150 px|Human Eye]] &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

An alternative to the lens approach called reflector eyes can be found in for example mollusks. Instead of the conventional way of focusing light to a single point in the back of the eye using a lens or a system of lenses, these organisms have mirror like structures inside the chamber of the eye that reflects the light into a central portion, much like a parabola dish. Although there are no known examples of organisms with reflector eyes capable of image formation, at least one species of fish, the spookfish (Dolichopteryx longipes) uses them in combination with &quot;normal&quot; lensed eyes.

[[Image:Volucella_pellucens_head_complete_Richard_Bartz.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Compound eye]]
The last group of eyes, found in insects and crustaceans, is called compound eyes. These eyes consist of a number of functional sub-units called ommatidia, each consisting of a facet, or front surface, a transparent crystalline cone and photo-sensitive cells for detection. In addition each of the ommatidia are separated by pigment cells, ensuring the incoming light is as parallel as possible. The combination of the outputs of each of these ommatidia form a mosaic image, with a resolution proportional to the number of ommatidia units. For example, if humans had compound eyes, the eyes would have covered our entire faces to retain the same resolution.
As a note, there are many types of compound eyes, but delving to deep into this topic is beyond the scope of this text.

Not only the type of eyes vary, but also the number of eyes. As you are well aware of, humans usually have two eyes, spiders on the other hand have a varying number of eyes, with most species having 8. Normally the spiders also have varying sizes of the different pairs of eyes and the differing sizes have different functions. For example, in jumping spiders 2 larger front facing eyes, give the spider excellent visual acuity, which is used mainly to target prey. 6 smaller eyes have much poorer resolution, but helps the spider to avoid potential dangers. Two photographs of the eyes of a jumping spider and the eyes of a wolf spider are shown to demonstrate the variability in the eye topologies of arachnids.

The information on this page was based around CamStudio version 2.5 beta 1.

[[Image:CamStudio_Main_Window.jpg]]

=== What is CamStudio? ===
CamStudio is a free, open source screen recorder for Microsoft Windows.  It is used for saving screen activity to an AVI file, with the option of having the AVI automatically converted into an SWF once the recording is finished.

=== Region ===
This determines which area of the screen will be recorded.

'''Region'''
: With this option set, you have to select the recording area by drawing out a rectangle with the mouse cursor right after starting a new recording session.

'''Fixed Region'''&lt;br&gt;
This allows you to use a rectangle at the given resolution and drag it over the area of the screen to be recorded. Checking &quot;Fixed Top-Left Corner&quot; will record from a set capture area as soon as you press record.
: Fixed Top-Left Corner (left value must be at least 1)
:: An example setting for Center-Screen recording on 1024x768 monitor at 640x480 resolution might be:
::: Left = 200
::: Top = 110
::: Width = 640
::: Height = 480

'''Window'''
: Records the region surrounding the selected window
:: Note that the capture will not follow the window if you move it after recording has started

'''Full Screen'''
: Records the whole screen

=== A Note on Compression formats ===
If you plan on editing your recording later, using lossless codecs is recommended as quality will not decrease after multiple saves.  A downside to this is lossless codecs will usually produce a larger file size then lossy codecs will, this may create problems if you do not have adequate storage space.

=== Video Options ===
[[Image:CamStudio Vid Option defaults.png|thumb|right|the video options]]
'''Compressor:'''
*Key Frames
**A lower Key Frames value will raise the overall file size after recording, but in contrast, setting the keyframe value too high may break seeking and lead to a reduction in video quality.
**note, the &quot;Key Frames&quot; setting here only works with certain codecs, some will bypass this setting entirely

'''Framerates:'''
*Capture Frames Every __ milliseconds
*Playback Rate

To get the Capture Frames value, divide 1000 (1 second = 1000 milliseconds) by the Playback Rate. 

For example:
* By default the playback rate is 20 and the Capture Every is 50, because 1000/20=50.
* A playback rate of 10 would need the Capture Every set to 100, because 1000/10=100. 
* A playback rate of 25 would need the Capture Every set to 40, because 1000/25=40. 
* If you wanted a Playback Rate of 30 frames/second, a good capture rate would be 33, as 1000/30=33.333... 

==== Four things to keep in mind: ====
# A higher framerate will allow for smooth playback, but will also result in a larger file size as more frames will be created.
# CamStudio currently only accepts whole numbers for the options here, any decimal values will simply be ignored (e.g.: if you entered 33.333 for your playback rate, CamStudio will store it as 33).
# If you want to record video and audio at the same time, you will need to have values for the capture and playback rate with a product of exactly 1000 (e.g.: 100 for the capture frames and 10 for the playback as 100*10=1000).  A capture frames value and playback rate that do not multiply wholly into 1000 (such as 33 and 30 mentioned in the example above) will cause the audio and video to become out of sync (33*30=990, not 1000).
#A playback rate much higher than the capture setting is grabbing frames will &quot;speed-up&quot; or time-lapse the video, a lower playback rate will &quot;slowdown&quot; the playback rate

'''Auto Adjust:'''
:You can use this to automatically set the &quot;Capture Frames Every&quot;, &quot;Playback Rate&quot;, and &quot;Key Frames&quot; by dragging the slider.  This will attempt to adjust the 3 values for a &quot;real-time&quot; playback rate, but it will not always give ideal settings.

=== Audio Options ===
[[Image:CamStudio Options Menu.jpg|thumb|right|recording with audio]]
:'''Audio Capture Device:'''
::The computers sound card
:'''Recording Format:'''
::This is base recording format, for voice recording over a microphone, mono is usually fine
:'''Compressed Format:'''
::The format the audio will be compressed into when the recording is finished.  You will want this set to an equal or lower quality to that of your recording format
:'''Interleave Video and Audio:'''

=== Fixing Audio / Video Syncing Issues ===
Some things to try.
*If the recording is unsynched by default, try:
**Options &gt; Audio Options &gt; Audio Options for Microphone &gt; Use MCI Recording
***Keep in mind this will override the chosen audio compression format

*Pausing:
**There has been issues of audio video sync issues when using pause with certain configurations (I have not seen it myself using my config). The reported issue was a partial second delay at the point the recording was paused after the clip is saved.  This causes the audio stream to get ahead of the video.  At worst, if you insist on using pause, use it no more than one or two times within the recording.  Another option would be to simply make multiple recordings and combine the clips (assuming they were recorded with the same settings) inside a video editor.

Make sure the &quot;Capture Frames Every&quot; and &quot;Playback Rate&quot; are set appropriately, see &quot;Video Options&quot; above

=== Testing audio video sync ===
A nice way to test if the audio and video are in sync is to record with an open a text editor (such as notepad) and type letters and numbers, voicing each key press into the microphone.

=== Recording to SWF ===
SWF is one of the Flash file formats making it compatible with many platforms. As mentioned above, CamStudio does not actually record directly to SWF, but instead records to an AVI file first and then converts the AVI into SWF once the recording is finished.  The conversion isn't done with the CamStudio recorder, but with the included SWF producer.  

With CamStudio 2.0 and 2.5, using the recorder's &quot;Record to SWF&quot; option will cause CamStudio to bypass the set video compressor option and record an AVI with the MS Video 1 codec before converting it to SWF.

=== Known Bugs and Limitations ===
'''Installation'''
*&quot;''This application failed to start because MFC71.DLL was not found. Reinstalling the application may fix the problem.''&quot;
** If you receive the above error message and reinstalling does not remedy the issue, try downloading MFC71.dll (found here http://www.camstudio.org/dev) and copying it into the folder where you have CamStudio 2.5 Beta installed (e.g.: &quot;C:\Program Files\CamStudio\&quot;).
** If you still receive the above error message when launching CamStudio, you can try copying the MFC71.dll into your “C:\Windows\System32″ directory then rebooting your computer.

'''Region &gt; Window'''
* When using the &quot;Region &gt; Window&quot; capture setting, the captured area will have 1 extra pixel added to the right and bottom of the capture area.  For example, if the window was 960x720, the captured area would be 961x721.  Although these extra lines can easily be cropped off, this may cause problems with certain video compressor codecs.  A rough work around for this would be to set the window size to be 1 pixel smaller in width and height then that you desire to capture at (e.g., if you wanted 960x720, instead set the window size to 959x719).

'''SWF Producer'''
* Similar to the &quot;Region &gt; Window&quot; bug described above, the SWF Producer will also add an extra pixel to the width and height of videos being converted to SWF.  A workaround is possible through the same means described above, reducing the dimensions to be 1 pixel less than the target resolution.

'''File Size'''
* CamStudio currently cannot create avi files over 2GiB in size.  Files over this size will likely be corrupted and difficult, if not impossible, to recover.

'''Keyboard Shortcuts'''
* It is not currently possible to set just one keyboard shortcut to use with CamStudio. In order use the keyboard shortcuts, all of them must be set to different keys.

Many of these things are addressed [http://camstudio.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=350&amp;page=1#Item_7 here].

I was reviewing your article and you are on the right start! Make sure to include at least 5 sources and maybe more... their are a lot of people the are &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;someone who knows.&quot; Focus on the peer reviewed articles. Let me know if you have any questions! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 17:50, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

Hello John,

I enjoyed reading your &quot;About The Author&quot; Page. It has so many details and information that taught us all a little more about you and your teaching philosophy. Despite the fact that you are obviously much more experienced at teaching that I am, I like the approach you take with the students. I also believe that the more &quot;hands on&quot; you are instructing the more the kids will get involved and learn. It is similar to the techniques I'll be using in my classroom. Since I'll be teaching a foreign language I would like the kids to incorporate themselves in ways like reading poems out loud, maybe even singing in the language, etc. Wish you the best of luck in your new endeavor.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 15:32, 30 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Mellody
I think it's marvelous that you returned to school and plan on teaching.  You'll have something that us young teachers dont...life experience! Since you've already raised three girls, I'm sure you've gained some wisdom (and patience) in the process.  This will prove quite beneficial to you and your students.  I loved your teaching philosophy of LIFE, how true it is.  LIFE is the ultimate teacher!  Good luck on your path to becoming an amazing teacher.  You've proved that it's never too late to make a difference! [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 17:10, 30 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

{{textontop|widthleft=180px|1=[[image:Derailleur Bicycle Drivetrain.svg|thumb|300px|left|Figure1:   A bicycle gear train.   The rear derailleur is shown on the left, below the sprocket cluster.   The front derailleur is shown above the two-ringed chainring assembly on the right.]][[Image:Rear_Derailleur.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2..: Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur]]

'''The rear-derailleur is the gear-changing assembly on the rear wheel of some bicycles; it moves the  bicycle chain from one sprocket to another'''.   

It is cable-operated using a shift control on the handlebar or the front of the frame near the handlebar.   The derailleur allows the rider to choose the ease of pedalling, for example, for hill climbing or a downhill run. For those who take things a bit more seriously, gearing allows the rider to maintain the most economical pedalling rate  regardless of minor changes in terrain. 

Some bicycles have both ''front'' and ''rear'' derailleurs. '''This page concentrates on the ''rear-derailleur'' '''. Front gear changers are  discussed in [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Derailleurs/Front_Derailleur_Adjustment|Front Derailleur Adjustment]].

Because the 'de-railing' of the chain involves ''deflecting'' it, the chain has to be moving at the time. That is to say, ''a derailleur can work only while the rider is pedalling''.}}
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-top:0;&quot;&gt;Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;
To better understand the material that follows, consider the following meanings:
[[image:Typical SRAM RD adjustments.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Figure 3: Typical SRAM derailleur adjustment points.&lt;br&gt;A.   The 'B' adjustment.&lt;br&gt;B and C. The limit adjustments; usually marked as 'H' and 'L'&lt;br&gt;D.  The cable clamp.,&lt;br&gt;E.   The barrel adjuster for cable tension.&lt;br&gt;The exact details for a ''specific'' derailleur can be found in documentation at [http://www.sram.com/en/service/sram/tech_manuals.php '''SRAM docs''']&lt;br&gt;(See Fig.4. for Shimano typicals.)]]
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ''cogs'' on the rear wheel of a bike are often referred to as ''sprockets'', and the ones in the pedal area are called ''chain-rings''. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When there is more than one cog they are arranged in a stack called a ''cluster'' or a ''cogset'' or a ''block''; these are supplied in one of two forms: '''cassettes''', that slide onto a ''freehub'', and '''freewheels''' that are screwed onto threaded hubs. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ''highest'' sprocket in a cluster is the ''small'' one closest to the ''outside'' of the bike, and the ''lowest'' sprocket is the ''largest'' one nearest to the ''inside'' of the bike. These points have meaning for adjustments. Here, ''highest'' means the sprocket that gives the highest gearing to the bicycle, while ''lowest'' gives the easiest pedaling.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top pulley of a rear-derailleur is called the ''guide-pulley''. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lower pulley is called the ''take-up pulley'' or ''tension pulley''. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ''dropout'' is the part of the bike frame that the wheel fits into. It is slotted.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ''hanger'' is the thin mounting plate for the derailleur.   In steel bikes it is often just a part of the frame, but aluminum frames are usually protected against impact damage with a separate bendable hanger.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The derailleur gears are ''shifted'' by changing the length of a ''shift cable'' using the handlebar ''gear shifter''. The steel cable is contained in a reinforced conduit called a ''housing''.   The ends of cable housings are terminated in small parts called ''ferrules'', and these are sometimes fitted into parts of the frame called ''cable-stops''.    
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

The overall gearing of a bike is set by both the choice of front chain-ring and the rear sprocket. Some bikes have only a single chain-ring on the pedal assembly so all of their gear shifting is done on the rear wheel. This page concentrates on that situation. Front derailleur adjustment is discussed [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Derailleurs/Front_Derailleur_Adjustment |here]].

The manufacturer's documentation for a derailleur is by far the best source of information, but when it cannot be found either in the bike handbook or on the internet, refer to the adjacent figures 3 and 4 for typical adjustment points, and the procedures that follow.

==Preliminaries==
[[File:Dahon Jack RD hanger.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A typical rear derailleur hanger.   Notice that although the metal is quite thick, it is made of a fairly soft alloy and bends quite easily.]]
Make sure before carrying out adjustments that the derailleur hanger is not bent and that the derailleur's cage is not twisted.   Each of these cases  can be checked by viewing the bike from the rear where both of the derailleur's pulleys and each selected cog should be in vertical alignment.  In particular the hanger should not appear to be bent inwards toward the wheel.   Both shifting and the smooth running of the chain depend on this alignment, and even a small deviation can upset the normal feeling of the bike.

'''Repairing the hanger:''' On steel bicycles the only option is to straighten the hanger section of the frame.  Aluminum hangers can be straightened if they are not too severely damaged though it is important to keep in mind that aluminum fatigues much more easily than steel. Most bicycle shops will have the proper tool for this [http://www.parktool.com/products/detail.asp?cat=48&amp;item=DAG-2 (the Derailleur Alignment Gauge from Park is recommended)], though it is unlikely that the home mechanic will need one often enough to own his own.   The notion of hanger ''straightness'' in this process is perhaps a misnomer, in that some slight ''bending'' of the hanger may be necessary to satisfy the overall alignment.

'''Replacing the hanger:''' On aluminium bicycles the hanger is a sacrificial piece, designed to bend on impact instead of the expensive derailleur, or even worse, the frame. Unfortunately bicycle frame manufacturers have made numerous designs of hangers over the years, and no bike shop has more than a small fraction of them in stock. However, if the part ''is'' available, (numerous internet suppliers offer stocks of hangers), the replacement is easily done at a bike shop, or even at home, and is no more difficult than the installing of the derailleur itself.   

It may be helpful to note that the adjustment procedures on this page are devised for the most common shift-cable behavior. That is to say, the assumption is that shortening the cable results in moving the rear-derailleur inward, toward the largest sprocket. Other arrangements exist, and for these you should refer to the manufacturer's instructions. 
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

'''Problems following a new shifter installation''', might be the result of a faulty choice of shifter.   This point should be understood before going any further.   A derailleur has an actuation ratio of its own; a given change in cable length gives rise to a given distance traversed across the sprockets, and the reciprocal of this ratio is called the ''shift ratio''.   Similarly, shifters are made for different families of derailleur.    The Shimano rear-derailleurs belong entirely to the 2:1 family whereas many SRAM derailleurs belong to the 1:1 set.   Note that these ''family-ratios'' are not the actual shift ratios, but are just labels, and serve mainly to distinguish SRAM's native set of shifters and derailleurs (1:1) from their Shimano-compatible set of shifters (2:1).   The SRAM shifters that are Shimano-compatible; for example, the series ''Attack'', ''Centera'', ''MRX'', ''MRX Pro'', ''Rocket'', and ''TRX'', are openly advertised for use with Shimano's 1.7 shift-ratio derailleurs; (the 2:1 family).   Obviously, if an MRX (2:1) version of a GripShift were installed instead of the 1:1 version, the shifting would not work.   In actuality, Shimano derailleurs have 1.7 shift ratios while SRAMs' native units have 1.1 ratios.   See [http://www.ctc.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=3946 '''CTC on Rear Shifting'''] for a detailed discussion, and the local Wikibooks page [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Gear-changing_Dimensions|'''Gear-changing Dimensions''']] for other tabulated shifting dimensions. 

'''Chain length adjustment''':   Some shifting problems are not so much a derailleur problem as one of a chain that is too long.   Most manufacturers of derailleurs assume that the chain's length is set to optimum before making any other adjustments:   The procedure is repeated here:
Starting with a ''broken'' chain, and ignoring the derailleur completely, wind the chain tightly around the largest front chainring and the largest rear sprocket.   While holding the two ends tightly so that they overlap, note the length required to make them just meet.   To this length add two half-inch  links.  Feed the chain through the derailleur and connect it for the ideal fit.   Obviously, the length of any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_link '''master link'''] must be taken into account in the total, and when the bike has a rear suspension, it must first be adjusted to its furthest backward reach.    It should be noted that a very small number of derailleurs need the addition of four half-inch links instead of two, so be sure to check the manufacturer's data sheets for your unit.

==Adjustment Summary==
There are three main adjustments for a typical rear-derailleur:  These are;
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The limit stops, high and low, are adjusted, to prevent the chain moving beyond the high and low sprockets in the cluster.   This can be done either before or after a chain is installed.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 'B' adjustment, the body-angle screw, is made to move the upper pulley and chain to a position close to the underside of the largest sprocket.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(220,220,220);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The barrel-adjuster is set to remove any cable slack, so that the cable-pull set by the shifter is the only factor in the operation.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

==Set the Chain Limits==

The 'B' adjustment.&lt;br&gt;B and C. the limit adjustments; usually marked as 'H' and 'L'&lt;br&gt;D.  The cable clamp.,&lt;br&gt;E.   The barrel adjuster for cable tension.&lt;br&gt;   The exact details for a ''specific'' derailleur can be found in online documentation at [http://techdocs.shimano.com/techdocs/index.jsp '''Shimano docs.'''] ]]
As the jockey wheel moves back and forward across the rear cassette to change gears, it could be pushed beyond the intended limits. To avoid this, the limits are set unconditionally, that is to say, independently of anything being done by the cable or the gear-shifter.

On every derailleur will be found a pair of screws, closely-spaced and typically marked as 'H' and 'L', for &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; respectively. These screws are the limit-stop screws.    If not found they can be located in the documentation of the derailleur, or on manufacturer's internet site. Figures 3 and 4 show  typical layouts for these adjustment screws.    

===Prior to Chain and Cabling===
The limits can be ''roughly'' set ''without'' a cable or chain installed, and this method is the one to use when a bike is first being assembled.   It is done by simply pushing the derailleur by hand to the required position. If this method is appropriate, then roughly set the limits as follows:
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''The ''high limit screw'' ''' is adjusted so that the top pulley's center lines up with the outer edge of the smallest sprocket. This is assumed to be the default position for the derailleur when a shifter cable does not impede it.   &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''The ''low limit screw''''' is similarly adjusted, but so that the pulley's center lines up with the center of the largest sprocket in the cluster. If there is a chain installed, the pedals need to be cranked to attain this position, but if there is no chain or shift cable then just push the derailleur into that position and adjust the ''low'' limit until you cannot push the top pulley past the big cog's center line.   
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=left&gt;

The above adjustment is best done with the bike in a repair stand, but at a push could be done with the use of an extra pair of hands.

===After Chain and Cabling===
For each of the two limit adjustments the object is to set the tightest screw setting that can be tolerated without misalignment noises or faulty shifting. At this point the limits are set fairly tightly.   Once again, these adjustments need a repair stand, a helping hand, or some other improvisation to work with the rear wheel off the ground.  To carry out this adjustment when a chain and shift cable are installed, it is best to do it after basic indexing of the gears; this makes sure that it is possible to shift onto the required cogs without misadventure.      First slacken off the ''low'' and ''high'' limit screws by turning them nearly all the way out of their housings, so that initially they have no limiting action.   The adjustment sequence is as follows:

'''Adjust the ''high limit'' ''':
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is a choice, select the ''largest front chain-ring''.  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shift the chain onto the ''smallest rear sprocket'' using the shifter on the handlebar. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then, further shift the chain onto the ''second-smallest sprocket'' by pulling the cable while cranking the pedals. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Release the cable and note whether or not the chain moves cleanly onto the smallest sprocket without misalignment noises. Noises are caused by the chain moving beyond the small cog.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If all is well tighten the ''high limit'' screw by one-quarter turn, and repeat the shifting exercise.    Continue tightening and checking, tightening the screw by one-quarter turn each time, until eventually a point is reached where the adjustment will be ''too tight'', as evidenced by a slight misalignment noise or faulty shifting. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When this fault point is reached, ''unscrew'' the ''high limit'' adjustment by one-quarter turn, to obtain the correct limit setting.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

'''Adjust the ''low limit'' ''':
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is a choice, select the ''middle front chain-ring''.   &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shift the chain onto the ''second-largest rear sprocket'' using the handlebar shifter. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then, shift the chain onto the ''largest sprocket'' by pulling the cable while cranking the pedals. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note whether or not the chain moves cleanly onto the largest sprocket without misalignment noises. Noises are caused by the chain moving beyond the large cog.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If all is well tighten the ''low limit screw'' by one-quarter turn, and repeat the shifting exercise.  Continue tightening and checking, tightening the screw by one-quarter turn each time, until eventually a point is reached where the adjustment will be ''too tight'', as evidenced by a slight misalignment noise or faulty shifting. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When this fault point is reached, ''unscrew'' the ''low limit'' adjustment by one-quarter turn, to obtain the correct limit setting.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

At times these adjustments have a fairly wide adjustment tolerance, and it is difficult to identify an exact point to call the right adjustment.   At these times as long as the shifting for the top and bottom sprockets is clean and noise-free the greater part of the matter will have been solved.

At this point the ''intermediate'' gears ''will'' make a noise. This matter is corrected in the section on indexing.

==Set the Body-angle==
The 'B' screw is otherwise known as the ''body-angle'' adjustment. It is used to move the entire derailleur to a position beneath the sprocket-cluster and close to it. The closer the pulley is to the sprockets the more teeth are engaged with the chain. This reduces wear and tear on both the sprockets and the chain, and in addition tends to make gear shifting more decisive.    

Typical rear-derailleur specifications, for example, for the SRAM SX-4 and its relatives, specify 6mm as the gap to aim for, though these shifters still work well when the setting is a bit wider.

'''This is the 'B' adjustment procedure:'''
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the low and high limits are already set.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move the rear shifter onto the ''largest sprocket''; that is, the smallest shifter number. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locate the 'B' adjustment screw using the bicycle's handbook.  If the handbook is not available then note that the ''body-angle'' screw is one of only three adjustment screws found on a rear-derailleur. The other two are the limit screws mentioned previously. The screw is always located in contact with the lip of the hanger. See Figures 3 and 4. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observe the gap between the derailleur ''guide pulley'' and the bottom of the ''largest sprocket''.  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjust the gap in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications for the derailleur. If the documentation is unavailable then it may be possible to access it on the internet. Failing this, set the gap to about 6mm, or as close as is reasonable without obstruction. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move the shifter through all of the gears to make sure that the sprockets are clear of the guide-pulley in every  position.   The tracking across the cogs in this way will be reasonable provided that the adjacent cog-size steps do not exceed those in the manufacturer's data sheet.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

The B-tension bolt is used to adjust the derailleur to clear the cogs as it transits them during gear shifts.  Usually, if the the largest cog is clear of the cage, the others will be too.   For this reason the adjustment is made in this cage position.

The angle of the lip on the derailleur's hanger, (the angle between the vertical and the face of the lip), sets the ''maximum'' height that can be achieved with the 'B' adjustment screw;  in this case when the adjustment screw is fully withdrawn, then the cage is as high as it can go.   If it happens that the cage cannot be set high enough to meet that specification, it could be a sign that the wrong hanger has been chosen.  

Although the cage height affects the ease of shifting, sometimes there is one gear that is harder to shift into than others. It has been pointed out by some riders that a more conscious effort at removing the tension in the chain before moving forward in the troubled gear can be useful, though a bent hanger should also be suspected.   At other times however, inconsistent shifting is a sign of a non-optimal chain length or a frayed housing end.   These points should be checked before suspecting the cog itself.     

When the ''body-angle'' adjustment is complete, move on to the indexing adjustment.

==Set the Cable Tension==

===Barrel-adjusters=== 
The barrel-adjuster is usually found on the right handlebar or on the derailleur itself, at the point where the shift cable enters the derailleur. See Figure 2 for an example of the latter. In all cases it does not matter ''where'' the adjustment-barrel is located, screwing it in (clockwise) slackens the cable and unscrewing it tightens the cable.     

The gear-shifter moves in discrete steps, and each step is translated by the derailleur into the exact distance (the ''inter-cog spacing'' or ''pitch'') across the sprockets of the cluster.   Thus, moving the shifter one step, regardless of the starting point, will lengthen or shorten the cable by an exact amount. The only bug in this system is the ''residual'' slackness or over-tightness in the cable itself. To see why the barrel-adjuster is needed, consider these two examples.

*If the cable has too much residual slackness when the handlebar shifter is operated, say from the smallest sprocket to the next-smallest, then a part of the resultant cable shortening will be used in ''first'' taking up the cable slack, ''then'' in moving the derailleur. As a result, the shortening is not all available to move the derailleur, and it is unlikely to move far enough to move the chain properly and make a successful gear change.

*Similarly, when the cable is too tight, shifting between say, the largest sprocket and the second largest will result in the shifter lengthening the cable by one unit. Because of the residual over-tension in the cable that tends to move the derailleur inward, not all of the intended lengthening will be available to the derailleur. It will not quite reach far enough.

*In both of the examples above the chain will likely make a noise as it shifts, but if the tension in the cable is not excessive, the chain might still pull itself onto the right sprocket; if the tension in the cable is too high then the chain might rattle somewhere in between the sprockets. 

'''The entire function of the handlebar barrel-adjuster is to remove any ''residual'' slackness or over-tension in the cable so that the ''exact'' lengthening and shortening (indexed shifting) of the cable by the handlebar shifter has no error'''.

===The Shift Cable===
When the barrel-adjuster cannot align the gears within its adjustment range, then the excessive slackness in the cable needs taken up.  Because the barrel-adjuster has quite a wide range, this stage is rarely needed.

A commonly observed test as to whether or not a cable needs ''tightening'' depends on whether the barrel-adjuster can be set to allow changes up and down between the smallest and the next smallest sprockets.   This shift is the one most likely to fail if the cable is too slack so it provides a good rule of thumb.  With the shifter and chain on the smallest sprocket, the process is as follows:
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;width:100%;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screw in the barrel-adjuster(s) fully. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then, unscrew the adjuster by about one full turn. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Undo the pinch bolt on the derailleur to release the cable. It usually needs just a hex wrench. Note where on the pinch bolt the cable was clamped since it is important to reproduce the exact route when it is replaced.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull the cable tight and refasten the pinch bolt. The tightness need not be excessive; just remove all of the slack.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjust the barrel-adjuster for correct indexing as in the above section.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

At times shifting can also be affected by frayed housing-ends or a poor choice of parts.  The cable ferrule on the end of a housing must run freely in the barrel adjuster's end, but some ferrules, especially on ''universal cables'' have been noted to be too big and because they jam, cause the housing to twist when the barrel is adjusted.   At other times exposed housing wires cause inconsistent behavior in shifting. The ''changing'' of a shift cable is explained in [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Cables and Housings|'''Cables and Housings''']] and at  http://www.sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html Sheldon Brown's Derailleur website].

===Adjust the Barrel===
Provided that both of the limits and the 'b'-screw adjustment are adequate, the cable tension can be adjusted with the barrel-adjuster.   Because cables stretch with use, this adjustment might be needed from time to time, other than during a full service. The process is as follows:
&lt;table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10px border=0 style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place the chain onto the smallest rear-sprocket, the one that has the slackest cable, and if there is a choice, the largest front chain-ring.    (Shimano Rapid Rise derailleurs work with the cable at its slackest for the ''largest'' sprocket, so for these untis use the ''largest'' and ''next largest'' for what follows.)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While pedalling, use the gear shifter to change gear to the ''second-smallest sprocket''. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the chain ''falls short'' and does not reach the sprocket then the cable has too much slack; unscrew the barrel-adjuster slightly.   If the chain moves ''too far'' or changes gear by two positions then the cable is too tight; screw in the barrel-adjuster slightly. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(240,240,240);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat this shifting and adjusting until the derailleur moves smoothly backward and forward.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background:rgb(225,225,225);&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shift the gears over the whole range and note whether or not shifting is adequate. The noise from chain-rattle should be reduced to a minimum. Fine-adjust the barrel if necessary to obtain smooth shifting in both directions.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


A troubleshooting table has been included in the next section to consolidate the points made elsewhere in the text, and it contains the main rear-derailleur faults. Such a table is necessarily brief, and is intended to be used together with the descriptive materials in the main text, and not as an alternative to it.

==Troubleshooting==
The first thing to check is that all parts are compatible, especially if you are not familiar with the history of the bicycle. Indexing shifters require that the number of gears on the shifter is the same as the number of gears on the wheel. Different brands of shifters may need to be used with ''matching'' shifters: i.e., Campagnolo must go with Campagnolo. Others makers such as SRAM and Suntour have made shifters that only work with their own rear derailleurs, but also have made other shifters that work with Shimano etc. Shimano shifters are designed to work only with their own products.

Rear derailleurs have a specified maximum capacity and maximum range of teeth, and if these are exceeded, the derailleur may work poorly or not at all. The ''capacity'' describes the extent to which the unit can take-up slack when gears are changed. Also, if the hanger is not the one intended for that unit, then the derailleur may be positioned wrongly for a correct body-angle adjustment. 

The most usual rear derailleur adjustment faults are listed in the table below with suggestions as to their cause and correction, though users are advised to acquaint themselves with their manufacturers' websites for the official line, and with cycling forums for problems that makers tend not to discuss.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Chain jumps outward from small sprocket&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;High gear limit not adjusted&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Tighten high limit screw to bring the top pulley slightly inward&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Chain will not move to small sprocket&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;High gear limit not adjusted&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Slacken high limit screw to bring the top pulley slightly outward&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Chain jumps inward past the largest sprocket toward the spokes&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;a. Low gear limit not adjusted&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;top-padding:10px;&quot;&gt;b.  Derailleur or hanger are bent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;a. Tighten low limit screw to bring the top pulley slightly outward&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;top-padding:10px;&quot;&gt;b. Straighten or replace items&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Shifting is slow&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Top pulley is too far from the sprockets&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Withdraw the 'B'-screw to narrow the gap&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Shifting sounds rough&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Top pulley is too close to the sprockets&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Tighten the 'B'-screw to widen the gap&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Slow shifting onto smallest sprocket&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;a. Cable is too tight&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;top-padding:10px;&quot;&gt;b. Cable is binding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;a. Turn barrel adjuster clockwise&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;top-padding:10px;&quot;&gt;b. Lubricate and check cable for damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Slow shifting onto largest sprocket&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Cable is too slack&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;Turn barrel adjuster anticlockwise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=top&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Chain jumps two gears from smallest sprocket&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Cable is too slack &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Turn barrel adjuster anticlockwise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===Chain Slipping===
There are many possible causes of chain-slipping (at other than a shift), and strictly speaking most are to do with the drive-train in general, rather that just the rear-derailleur.   Various factors combine at any one time towards slipping, and correcting any one of them might reduce the collateral effect enough to cure the problem.   This collateral effect also serves to confuse as to the most likely causes. The common causes are listed here in order of the most practical measures to attempt:
*'''Chain length''':  If the chain length is not optimum then other factors might have more effect.   Adjust the chain length using ''Big-to-Big''  length method outlined in the preliminaries section above.
*''''B' Height adjustment''':   Ajust the rear derailleur's cage height in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.   If the height setting cannot be met, it could be a sign that the wrong  hanger was used.   The angle of the hanger-lip affects this range.
*'''Master Link''':   Make sure that any master link in the chain is right for the task, and use the one recommended by the manufacturer.
*'''Chain width''':   Make sure that the correct chain width is used, and that there are no protruding pins.   Again, use the chain recommended by the manufacturer.
*'''Damaged shift cable housing''':   If the end of a cable housing is badly frayed, with its support wires showing, then the shift cable tension might change intermittently.   
*'''Stiff chain links''':   Observe the chain at the derailleur for any jumping links and manipulate them by hand until they are free.
*'''Worn chain''':   Replace a badly worn chain.   
*'''Worn sprockets''':   Inspect the wear on sprockets especially if the problem happens only in the most used position.

      <comment>/* Where the vision reception occurs – The retina */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We humans are visual creatures, therefore our eyes are complicated with many components. In this chapter, an attempt is made to describe these components, thus giving some insight into the properties and functionality of human vision. 

====Getting inside of the eyeball - Pupil, iris and the lens====

Light rays enter the eye structure through the black aperture or pupil in the front of the eye. 
The black appearance is due to the light being fully absorbed by the tissue inside the eye. Only through this pupil can light enter into the eye which means the amount of incoming light is effectively determined by the size of the pupil. A pigmented sphincter surrounding the pupil functions as the eye's aperture stop. It is the amount of pigment in this iris, that give rise to the various eye colours found in humans.

In addition to this layer of pigment, the iris has 2 layers of ciliary muscles. A circular muscle called the pupillary sphincter in one layer, that contracts to make the pupil smaller. The other layer has a smooth muscle called the pupillary dilator, which contracts to dilate the pupil. The combination of these muscles can thereby dilate/contract the pupil depending on the requirements or conditions of the person. The ciliary muscles are controlled by ciliary zonules, fibres that also change the shape of the lens and hold it in place.

The lens is situated immediately behind the pupil. Its shape and characteristics reveal a similar purpose to that of camera lenses, but they function in slightly different ways. The shape of the lens is adjusted by the pull of the ciliary zonules, which consequently changes the focal length. Together with the cornea, the lens can change the focus, which makes it a very important structure indeed, however only one third of the total optical power of the eye is due to the lens itself. It is also the eye's main filter. Lens fibres make up most of the material for the lense, which are long and thin cells void of most of the cell machinery to promote transparency. Together with water soluble proteins called crystallins, they increase the refractive index of the lens. The fibres also play part in the structure and shape of the lens itself.

====Beamforming in the eye – Cornea and its protecting agent - Sclera====
[[Image:Structure_cornea1.png|thumb|300px|center|Structure of the Cornea]]

The cornea, responsible for the remaining 2/3 of the total optical power of the eye, covers the iris, pupil and lens. It focuses the rays that pass through the iris before they pass through the lens. The cornea is only 0.5mm thick and consists of 5 layers: 
* Epithelium: A layer of epithelial tissue covering the surface of the cornea.
* Bowman's membrane: A thick protective layer composed of strong collagen fibres, that maintain the overall shape of the cornea.
* Stroma: A layer composed of parallel collagen fibrils. This layer makes up 90% of the cornea's thickness.
* Descemet's membrane and Endothelium: Are two layers adjusted to the anterior chamber of the eye filled with aqueous humor fluid produced by the ciliary body. This fluid moisturises the lens, cleans it and maintains the pressure in the eye ball. The chamber, positioned between cornea and iris, contains a trabecular meshwork body through which the fluid is drained out by Schlemm canal, through posterior chamber. 

The surface of the cornea lies under two protective membranes, called the sclera and Tenon’s capsule. Both of these protective layers completely envelop the eyeball. The sclera is built from collagen and elastic fibres, which protect the eye from external damages, this layer also gives rise to the white of the eye. It is pierced by nerves and vessels with the largest hole reserved for the optic nerve. Moreover, it is covered by conjunctiva, which is a clear mucous membrane on the surface of the eyeball. This membrane also lines the inside of the eyelid. It works as a lubricant and, together with the lacrimal gland, it produces tears, that lubricate and protect the eye. The remaining protective layer, the eyelid, also functions to spread this lubricant around.

====Moving the eyes – extra-ocular muscles====

The eyeball is moved by a complicated muscle structure of extra-ocular muscles consisting of four rectus muscles – inferior, medial, lateral and superior and two oblique – inferior and superior. Positioning of these muscles is presented below, along with functions: 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
[[Image:Eyemuscles.png|thumb|400px|Extra-ocular muscles and other some other components around the eye]]
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
1 = Annulus of Zinn  – Muscle Attachment&lt;br&gt;
2 = Superior rectus muscle - Elevation (primary function), intorsion (secondary), adduction (tertiary)&lt;br&gt;
3 = Inferior rectus muscle – Depression (primary), extortion (secondary), adduction (tertiary)&lt;br&gt;
4 = Medial rectus muscle – Adduction (primary)&lt;br&gt;
5 = Lateral rectus muscle – Abduction (primary)&lt;br&gt;
6 = Superior oblique muscle – Intorsion (primary), depression (secondary), abduction (tertiary)&lt;br&gt;
7 = Trochlea of superior oblique - Pulley&lt;br&gt;
8 = Inferior oblique muscle – Extortion (primary), elevation (secondary), abduction (tertiary)&lt;br&gt;
9 = Levator palpebrae superioris muscle – Eyelid Movement&lt;br&gt;
10 = Eyelid&lt;br&gt;
11 = Eyeball&lt;br&gt;
12 = Optic nerve&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As you can see, the extra-ocular muscles (2,3,4,5,6,8) are attached to the sclera of the eyeball and originate in the annulus of Zinn, a fibrous tendon surrounding the optic nerve. A pulley system is created with the trochlea acting as a pulley and the superior oblique muscle as the rope, this is required to redirect the muscle force in the correct way. The remaining extra-ocular muscles have a direct path to the eye and therefore do not form these pulley systems. Using these extra-ocular muscles, the eye can rotate up, down, left, right and alternative movements are possible as a combination of these.

Other movements are also very important for us to be able to see. Vergence movements enable the proper function of binocular vision. Unconscious fast movements called saccades, are essential for people to keep an object in focus. The saccade is a sort of jittery movement performed when the eyes are scanning the visual field, in order to displace the point of fixation slightly. When you follow a moving object with your gaze, your eyes perform what is referred to as smooth pursuit. Additional involuntary movements called nystagmus are caused by signals from the vestibular system, together they make up the vestibulo-ocular reflexes.

The brain stem controls all of the movements of the eyes, with different areas responsible for different movements.
* Pons: Rapid horizontal movements, such as saccades or nystagmus 
* Mesencephalon: Vertical and torsional movements 
* Cerebellum: Fine tuning
* Edinger-Westphal nucleus: Vergence movements

====Where the vision reception occurs – The retina====
[[Image:Filtering_em_eye.png|thumb|400px|center|Filtering of the light performed by the cornea, lens and pigment epithelium]]
Before being transduced, incoming EM passes through the cornea, lens and the macula. These structures also act as filters to reduce unwanted EM, thereby protecting the eye from harmful radiation. The filtering response of each of these elements can be seen in the figure &quot;Filtering of the light performed by cornea, lens and pigment epithelium&quot;. As one may observe, the cornea attenuates the lower wavelengths, leaving the higher wavelengths nearly untouched. The lens blocks around 25% of the EM below 400nm and more than 50% below 430nm. Finally, the pigment ephithelium, the last stage of filtering before the photo-reception, affects around 30% of the EM between 430nm and 500nm.
 
A part of the eye, which marks the transition from non-photosensitive region to photosensitive region, is called the ora serrata. The photosensitive region is referred to as the retina, which is the sensory structure in the back of the eye. The retina consists of multiple layers presented below with millions of photoreceptors called rods and cones, which capture the light rays and convert them into electrical impulses. Transmission of these impulses is nervously initiaed by the ganglion cells and conducted through the optic nerve, the single route by which information leaves the eye.

[[File:Retina layers.svg|thumb|300px|right|Structure of retina including the main cell components: RPE: retinal pigment epithelium; OS: outer segment of the photoreceptor cells; IS: inner segment of the photoreceptor cells; ONL: outer nuclear layer; OPL: outer plexiform layer; INL: inner nuclear layer
IPL: inner plexiform layer; GC: ganglion cell layer; P: pigment epithelium cell; BM: Bruch-Membran; R: rods; C: cones; H: horizontal cell; B: bipolar cell; M: Müller cell; A:amacrine cell; G: ganglion cell; AX: Axon; arrow: Membrane limitans externa.]]

A conceptual illustration of the structure of the retina is shown on the right. As we can see, there are five main cell types: 
* photoreceptor cells 
* horizontal cells 
* bipolar cells 
* amecrine cells 
* ganglion cells 

Photoreceptor cells can be further subdivided into two main types called rods and cones. Cones are much less numerous than rods in most parts of the retina, but there is an enormous aggregation of them in the macula, especially in its central part called the fovea. In this central region, each photo-sensitive cone is connected to one ganglion-cell. In addition, the cones in this region are slightly smaller than the average cone size, meaning you get more cones per area. Because of this ratio, and the high density of cones, this is where we have the highest visual acuity.

[[Image:Density_rods_n_cones.png|thumb|300px|center|Density of rods and cones around the eye]]

There are 3 types of human cones, each of the cones responding to a specific range of wavelengths, because of three types of a pigment called photopsin. Each pigment is sensitive to red, blue or green wavelength of light, so we have blue, green and red cones, also called S-, M- and L-cones for their sensitivity to short-, medium- and long-wavelength respectively. It consists of protein called opsin and a bound chromphore called the reinal. The main building blocks of the cone cell are the synaptic terminal, the inner and outer segments, the interior nucleus and the mitochondria. 

The spectral sensitivities of the 3 types of cones: 
* 1. S-cones absorb short-wave light, i.e. blue-violet light. The maximum absorption wavelength for the S-cones is 420nm
* 2. M-cones absorb blue-green to yellow light. In this case The maximum absorption wavelength is 535nm
* 3. L-cones absorb yellow to red light. The maximum absorption wavelength is 565nm

[[Image:Cone_cell_en.png|thumb|250px|right|Cone cell structure]]

The inner segment contains organelles and the cell's nucleus and organelles. The pigment is located in the outer segment, attached to the membrane as trans-membrane proteins within the invaginations of the cell-membrane that form the membranous disks, which are clearly visible in the figure displaying the basic structure of rod and cone cells. The disks maximize the reception area of the cells. The cone photoreceptors of many vertebrates contain spherical organelles called oil droplets, which are thought to constitute intra-ocular filters which may serve to increase contrast, reduce glare and lessen chromatic aberrations caused by the  mitochondrial size gradient from the periphery to the centres. 

Rods have a structure similar to cones, however they contain the pigment rhodopsin instead, which allows them to detect low-intensity light and makes them 100 times more sensitive than cones. Rhodopsin is the only pigment found in human rods, and it is found on the outer side of the pigment epithelium, which similarly to cones maximizes absorption area by employing a disk structure. Similarly to cones, the synaptic terminal of the cell joins it with a bipolar cell and the inner and outer segments are connected by cilium. 

The pigment rhodopsin absorbs the light between 400-600nm, with a maximum absorption at around 500nm. This wavelength corresponds to greenish-blue light which means blue colours appear more intense in relation to red colours at night.

[[File:Cone-response.svg |thumb|500px|center|The sensitivity of cones and rods across visible EM]]

EM waves with wavelengths outside the range of 400 – 700 nm are not detected by either rods nor cones, which ultimately means they are not visible to human beings.

Horizontal cells occupy the inner nuclear layer of the retina. There are two types of horizontal cells and both types hyper-polarise in response to light i.e. they become more negative. Type A consists of a subtype called HII-H2 which interacts with predominantly S-cones. Type B cells have a subtype called HI-H1, which features a dendrite tree and an axon. The former contacts mostly M- and L-cone cells and the latter rod cells. Contacts with cones are made mainly by prohibitory synapses, while the cells themselves are joined into a network with gap junctions. 

[[Image:Fig_retine.png|thumb|500px|center|Cross-section of the human retina, with bipolar cells indicated in red.]]

Bipolar cells spread single dendrites in the outer plexiform layer and the perikaryon, their cell bodies, are found in the inner nuclear layer. Dendrites interconnect exclusively with cones and rods and we differentiate between one rod bipolar cell and nine or ten cone bipolar cells. These cells branch with amacrine or ganglion cells in the inner plexiform layer using an axon. Rod bipolar cells connect to triad synapses or 18-70 rod cells. Their axons spread around the inner plexiform layer synaptic terminals, which contain ribbon synapses and contact a pair of cell processes in dyad synapses. They are connected to ganglion cells with AII amacrine cell links. 

Amecrine cells can be found in the inner nuclear layer and in the ganglion cell layer of the retina. Occasionally they are found in the inner plexiform layer, where they work as signal modulators. They have been classified as narrow-field, small-field, medium-field or wide-field depending on their size. However, many classifications exist leading to over 40 different types of amecrine cells. 

Ganglion cells are the final transmitters of visual signal from the retina to the brain. The most common ganglion cells in the retina is the midget ganglion cell and the parasol ganglion cell. The signal after having passed through all the retinal layers is passed on to these cells which are the final stage of the retinal processing chain. All the information is collected here forwarded to the retinal nerve fibres and optic nerves. The spot where the ganglion axons fuse to create an optic nerve is called the optic disc. This nerve is built mainly from the retinal ganglion axons and Portort cells. The majority of the axons transmit data to the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is a termination nexus for most parts of the nerve and which forwards the information to the visual cortex. Some ganglion cells also react to light, but because this response is slower than that of rods and cones, it is believed to be related to sensing ambient light levels and adjusting the biological clock.

This is such an important topic. Nontraditional classrooms will be the new way to teach.  As students become more visual learners nontraditional teaching will be more valued than traditional classroom teachers. I liked the article and the way you wrote it. I can see your thought process and see your point of view on this subject.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 00:33, 14 July 2009 (UTC)


This subject was pretty intriguing and appeals to many of my interests in the education field, I was unaware that such positions existed with such frequency to be called &quot;teaching careers.&quot; This article, really helps clear up some of the misconceptions I previously held about the public speakers, or &quot;historical actors&quot; encountered during my years of schooling. I do have a few questions though, about the overall need of such &quot;professionals&quot; in the first place. Teaching as such, should be a dynamic experience as seen in many aspects of adult education and private schools/ training systems. So why then, when such methods are proven to be effective are they not used by &quot;regular&quot; teachers?  I can understand the value of a special speaker- no doubt the change in perspective is valuable, but things like small group sessions, field trips, aspects of entertainment and excitement, these should always be present in the classroom of any educator. When they are not, a tape recorder can fulfill the role of &quot;teaching&quot; just as effectively as a &quot;teacher&quot;, in my opinion.

I found this information on non-traditional teachers to be an interesting subject, one that I plan on looking at as a career. This article gave me some needed information and ideas for the future.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 03:46, 2 July 2009 (UTC) 

This article discusses a teaching style that seams to appeal to a majority of learners. My mother worked as a teacher at a experimental science-based school. They spent most of their time outside of the classroom. In my observations in her classroom, the students really seemed to understand the information being presented because it appealed to their kinesthetic learning style. For instance, they went on hikes to collect different things to bring back to the classroom so they could go over what they picked up. I think students get more out of class if it involves different instructional methods. I really liked the way you seperated the information presented in this article. It is definately something to think about when choosing what type of instructional method you plan to deliver. I used to work at a high school in the English department and the students were studying the Holocaust. We took the students on a field trip to a Holocaust museum and had Holocaust survivors come speak before the students. I could not believe how many questions the students had after the presentation because they were really interested in how the speakers survived.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 18:11, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

This article struck an interest in me immediately.  I am always curious as to what else is out there.  After reading the content, I found the idea intriguing, but perhaps a little unrealistic.  I am not sure how many specialty teaching jobs there are in today's economy.  We are dealing with layoffs, hiring freezes, and budget cuts.  Perhaps the private sector (museums, historical societies, zoos, non-profit groups) are still hiring for these particular positions, but I am sure the salary is not conducive to an affordable, even modest lifestyle.  I think the biggest challenge or the overall goal should be teachers who are traditional classroom teachers and specialty teachers both at the same time.  This is just another good example of how project-based learning can benefit all classrooms.  It is true that a &quot;substitute teacher&quot; or &quot;specialty teacher&quot; could be a breath of fresh air for students; however, the traditional classroom teacher still knows her students better than someone who simply comes to “visit” for the day.  Overall, the article presents a good idea.  I just come from the ideology that I can be both things already in my classroom.

I enjoyed reading the article because it opened my eyes to a world of education that I did not know existed. Through reading this article, I have realized how many other options people who are educated as teachers have. Though, as another reviewer has already pointed out, this career choice may not be the most rewarding in terms of money, I'm sure it is just as fulfilling in terms of enjoyment and interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is an attempt to do a step by step adjustment procedure for the REAR-DERAILLEUR.  

I have made use of one image from the DERAILLEUR ADJUSTMENT page, but have otherwise left that page untouched for the time being.   I did not want to lose any of the description associated with it, while interested parties are trying to resolve the intended structure of the future book.

Is there different enough material on the FRONT-DERAILLEUR to make a separate page?   Thoughts on the matter here would be appreciated.

==Bike Photo Support Needed ==

Good photos are a bit scarce for bike details.   If  there is a keen photographer out there, it would be useful to have some clear photos of basic bike parts.   Also, lock types, locking methods, valve cores, derailleurs, brakes and any number of other items would be useful.   Supreme clarity is the most desirable quality for such things, but so also is the ability to focus-out backgrounds using conventional photography; this gets rid of clutter better than the existing efforts with automatic cameras and phones.  The entire book on bikes needs photo-nerd support.

The existing book will give the incumbent(s) an idea of what is needed to improve it, though it is likely that they will know more themselves.

Comments please...

== html ==

This page contains quite a bit of html, even really unnecessary stuff like h2 tags, and has a lot of table based layout.  I'm a wikipedian, new to wikibooks, so maybe this is normal here, but to me it seems like it makes things more complicated than they need to be.  (I am familiar with both wiki markup and html) Could someone tell me why this was done, and if it was a concious decision?  --[[User:Keithonearth|Keithonearth]] ([[User talk:Keithonearth|talk]]) 08:18, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

==Derailleur Drawing==

I've made a SVG version of the badly pixelated drawing shown in the &quot;Terminology&quot; section, but I can't figure out how to upload it and include it. I've put it at http://dmwit.com/rear_derailleur.svg and will keep it there for at least one year from now. I release it under the same license as the original JPG drawing. Anybody who knows how to transfer it here, please do. [[User:Dmwit|Dmwit]] ([[User talk:Dmwit|talk]]) 05:15, 10 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">HEllo Rebecca...It's great to hear that you will be getting your masters in education.  It sounds like your sister has been a great influence.  My sister is also in education.  Family has always been important when making decisions in my life.  I always need more then one opinion on matters.  CONGRATULATIONS on your wedding in December.  That is very exciting.  Is it going to be Christmas themed?  My friend is slightly obsessed with christmas and she has always planned on having a Christmas wedding. It's hilarious...she always says her center pieces are going to be small Christmas tress decorated. GOOD luck with it all.

I would agree with you that there are many aspects of education that are very important.  I also agree with your statement that special education students need a different learning environment then regular education students.  I would go on to say that there are many students in the regular education atmosphere that need the same circumstances.  I believe that is one of the challenges a teacher faces is addapting to all the needs of each student.  I also do agree that it is important for students to experience many different learning techniques other then lecturing.  I believe group work is always a great choice.

Hi Rebecca!  I really enjoyed reading your page.  I am also working on my Master's Degree, with a focus on pre-k through 6.  I would like to teach 4th, 5th or 6th grade I think they are a great age group.  My educational philosophy is a lot like yours in that I am still developing it.  I hope to learn a lot through this class and develop a stronger philosophy.  [[User:Regs1687|Regs1687]] ([[User talk:Regs1687|talk]]) 03:26, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

== Recent uploads ==

You don't need to upload files to Wikibooks that are on Wikimedia Commons, you can use them directly in the same was as you would any other file e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:blah.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:15, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

: Oops I misread, one of your recent upload said taken off of creative commons, rather than wikimedia commons. Wikibooks needs to know more then that that you got it off of creative commons. Where off of creative commons did you get [{{fullurl:Special:Log/upload|user=Rburt005}} the files]? An exact url would help. Did you actually make the files you uploaded, because your giving credit to yourself, yet you say you got it off of creative commons? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:29, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

: The file you uploaded that you said you got from Wikimedia Commons wasn't there under the same name, was it deleted? More information on that is needed as well --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:40, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

# In large bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour and yeast. Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar and salt together, and add to the dry ingredients. Beat with a mixer for half a minute at a low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes. Then, by hand, mix in enough flour to make a moderately stiff dough.
# Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (8-10 minutes). Cover, let rest for 15 minutes.
# Cut into 12 portions, shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape. Cover, let rise 20 minutes.
# Meanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling. Put 1 tablespoon of sugar in it, mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.
# When the bagels are ready, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water, and cook 7 minutes, turning once. Drain them. Place on a greased baking sheet, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, eat hot or cold.
# Broiling option: For a glossier surface, place raised bagels on an ungreased baking sheet prior to boiling them. Broil them five inches from heat for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes on each side. Then put them into the hot water to be boiled as above. Note: do not bake broiled bagels as long as non-broiled ones, 25 minutes should be long enough.

==Ingredients==

* 400g [[Cookbook:Beef|beef fillet]]
* 90ml extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* small handful pine kernels, for toasting
* 50g [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]], for shaving
* dash of truffle oil, for drizzling (optional)
* salt and black pepper
==Procedure==

# Buy a small piece of the finest quality beef fillet you can afford. Cut the fillet into extremely thin slices - about 2mm.
# Lay a piece of cling film on the work surface, place the sliced beef on top and place another layer of film over. Flatten the slices with the back of a knife.
# Pour a small puddle of olive oil onto a large plate and place a layer of beef over it. Season with the salt and pepper and continue making layers with all the beef.
# Cover the plate with cling film and leave to marinate for half an hour.
# Meanwhile toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan.
# Transfer the beef onto individual plates. Cover with pine nuts, shavings of Parmesan and a dash of truffle oil if you have any.

===Overview===
The goals of respiration are to provide oxygen to the tissues and to remove carbondioxide , to achieve these goals , respiration can be divided into four major functional events , 
1. pulmonary ventilation , 
2, diffusion of oxygen and carbondioxide between the alveoli and the bloods.
3, transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and body fluids to and from the cells  , 
4, regulation of ventilation and other facets of respiration .

== Original Research ==

Y'know, I'm struggling a bit with defining &quot;original&quot; research.  For example, I've got this idea that I think would be a value Wikibooks project in the Religion section. A pre-set list of questions for Protestant Clergy....about their personal doctrines, backgrounds, etc. .....I think this could have value here.  The hitch, though, would be that I (or any other contributor) could not do a'lot of editorializing about the respondents' answers.....we couldn't really draw conclusions or do any armchair psycho-analyzing about why the Episcopal priest believes this thing whereas the Pentecostal pastor believes that thing.....that would really kind of be &quot;research&quot;. The interviewers would take the questions to the clergymen, ask them, record their answers, then publish them here....maybe more like ''journalism'' really. How would the original research policy factor in on something like that??[[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] ([[User talk:Buddpaul|talk]]) 04:37, 19 April 2009 (UTC)

: No worries, Buddapaul. The community has struggled a lot with these, too. Currently, my understanding of community consensus is that we allow content that is verifiable.
: I'm afraid that this book would suffer from several flaws. Firstly, choosing the right number of questions would be extremely difficult, and adding questions would require tracking the former interviewees down to ask them the newer questions. Secondly, choosing the interviewees would similarly be difficult. The main problem I see with this idea is that, as you noted, drawing any conclusions would be extremely difficult and, in my opinion, over the original research line and makes this the wrong venue for an otherwise interesting resource.
: If you're interested in this resource, I would try to contact a church, or some umbrella group that could help you set up a project with a database of questions. That would also allow you to set up features like comments, tags, searches and various other things which the wiki simply isn't designed to do. There you would also find more people to collaborate with; both in developing a good set of questions. Good luck with whatever you choose to do. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:41, 19 April 2009 (UTC)
::Wikiversity accepts totally original researches subject to its policy, such as very original opinions not found elsewhere.--[[User:Jusjih|Jusjih]] ([[User talk:Jusjih|talk]]) 01:04, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
== Can't seem to import ==

I tried importing a couple of pages ([[w:Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[w:Susan Brownell Anthony]]) as requested on [[WB:RFI]], but always got the error &quot;Import failed: Could not open import file&quot;. Anyone know what that's all about? I tried importing [[w:Bracket]] as well but, again, without luck. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:11, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
: Yes.  There are bugs in the import code.  The failure typically manifests itself when the article has a long history.  I have found that if you uncheck the &quot;Copy all history versions for this page&quot; box, it will come right over, minus the edit history :-(  If you want the edit history (or why import?), you can keep trying.  I don't fully understand everything that goes on under the hood, but I have at times attempted an import a hundred times, succeeding on the last attempt.  I have found that success is more likely if I uncheck the box, do the import (no history), then check the box and reimport.  Good luck. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:59, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

== Using templates to store variables ==

Hi,

A slightly complicated query.

I'm writing a wikibook and want to be able to use a particular word multiple times in multiple pages (it is a parameter value for a template, currently the word &quot;text&quot;). However, I'm hoping to be able to store this word in a single place, so that if necessary, I can change it simultaneously on all the pages at once (this is because I'm hoping that wikibooks will, in the future,  implement syntax highlighting of a particular computer language).

I thought the easiest way to do this was to store the word &quot;text&quot; on its own on a single page. I then transcluded this page, rather than using the word itself, whenever necessary. Effectively, I was using the page as a variable to store a single value (&quot;text&quot;) to which I could refer on other pages.

However, my one-word page has just been deleted because it has &quot;no meaningful content&quot;. I could reinstate it, but before doing so, is there a better way to do this?

Cheers [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 14:46, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

:Instead of a normal page, you should probably use a template page with a comment that explains the purpose of the page. (Use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;...&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to make sure that the comment is not included.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:13, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
:Wikibooks already supports syntax highlighting, no need to wait. Example: &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;var foobar;&lt;/source&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:03, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
== Moving image to Commons ==

Is it possible to move image [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Defining_sin_and_cosine.png Defining_sin_and_cosine.png] to the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Commons]? I want to use that image in a portuguese book page, but I think re-uploading it is too rude (and space-consuming). [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 12:14, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

: Yes. Please see [[Help:Uploading files#Move_a_file_to_Wikimedia_Commons]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:16, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks. I guess I did it right - at least it appeared in Portuguese. [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 19:00, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

::: And I've deleted the local copy here. All looks good. Good job. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:35, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

== Leviathan ==

New here, though an old hand on Wikipedia. I've been working on a modern-language version of Thomas Hobbes' 1651 book ''Leviathan''. I'd like to post it here so that I can annotate it. I've formatted it so that every change from the original appears in red. 

Is that something that would be useful here? And is it possible/useful to set it up so that the red words appear in red? --[[User:TheEditrix2|TheEditrix2]] ([[User talk:TheEditrix2|talk]]) 15:16, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

: I'm sure people will find a modern-language version of the book with annotations useful. Perhaps someone studying language literature where that book is required reading. Besides [[WB:AT]] there is no other requirements for what to do for annotated texts. You are free to use whatever style you want, just try to be consistent with the style you choose to adapt. Depending to what extend you plan to develop the text you may also need to be careful to avoid [[WB:OR]] because Wikibooks is not for original works of fiction or for original research. You may also want to see about putting the original version up on [[s:|Wikisource]] as well, if its not there already. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:11, 4 May 2009 (UTC)
== Put citation information at end of book? ==

I hope this questions has not been asked before, but given its relevance, I suspect I am wrong. Is there any way to cite a reference on one page and put the citation information on a separate page? I don't see how to do this with the Cite extension . In more detail, I would like to break up a book into pages (using a combination of a tree organization and a linear organization) and collect all of the references in the text at the end of the book in a References page. This means the reference number on multiples pages would have to correspond to the number of the citation given on the citations page. Also, is there a way to keep references and notes (i.e., non-citation parenthetical comments that go either at the end of a page or at the end of a book) separate? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 16:36, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

: The citation extension isn't used much because of its limitations. Wikibooks focuses more on providing citations or references for books as a whole, rather than for individual sentences or paragraphs like Wikipedia does, so there isn't as much need to preserve reference numbers or to even use them. Usually references are for dead-tree books or other reliable resources that cover the same subject material as the book itself. Like a math book that covers addition, subtraction, multiplication and division would likely include the name, author, ISDN number and a link for math books that also covers addition, subtraction, multiplication and division rather than embedding citations throughout the book and citing websites for addition, other websites for subtraction, yet other websites for multiplication and further ones for division. IOWs references tend to be more general rather than specific. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:04, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

Thanks. While I understand your reasoning, it doesn't really answer my question. Some books simply provide a bibliography at the end of the book without embedded references to the listed  texts. Others provide references within the text. I suppose the approach depends somewhat on the level of the material covered in the book and the book's intended audience. For beginner books the bibliography approach seems prevalent, while for books on more advanced topics or ones intended for an audience who is familiar with the basic concepts but seek advanced treatment, embedded references are common. I agree that the Cite extension doesn't really work well for books (even though that extension is available on wikibooks). I was just wondering if there were ways of citing references in the text and gathering all of the citation information in a References section.

: No there is no automated way to gather all citations from the book and list them on a reference page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:01, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

:: In the print version of the book ( [[Help:Print versions]] ), the Cite extension ( [[Help:Editing#References]], [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Cite/Cite.php Mediawiki: Extension:Cite/Cite.php] ) can automatically gather all the citations from the Wikibook and list them all in a References section at the end of the book. Cite individual paragraphs in the Wikibook using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ... &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags wrapped around the reference to that other source, as normal. Put the {{tl|reflist}} template where you want all the references in one major References section. Wrap any other minor references section, including their {{tl|reflist}} template or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;.

:: Another way to put references on a References page is to put each reference in its own &quot;section&quot; in the References page, and have the relevant paragraph in the Wikibook link to it using a &quot;section anchor&quot; (#) such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Editing#References| Chapayev1919]] or [[Wikibooks:Sandbox#Chapayev1919 | Chapayev1919]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which appears as [[Help:Editing#References| Chapayev1919]] or [[Wikibooks:Sandbox#Chapayev1919 | Chapayev1919]].

== There may be something wrong with the currently installed Wikibooks Cite Extension ==

I am trying to figure out a way to use the Cite Extension to build a book References section (see [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance#Put citation information at end of book?|Previous question]] for some history). It seems to me the obvious way to go about this is to design a template that uses &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but formats things more like a book than a Wikipedia article. So, I began playing around with these tags in my sandboxes. I ran into a problem that is documented in [[Wikipedia:Help:Cite errors#Error messages|Template problems]]. However, the suggested workarounds don't work on Wikibooks. Interestingly, at least one of these works on my local mediawiki based wiki. This is surprising, since the version of MediaWiki and the Cite Extension I am using is behind Wikibooks (My MediaWiki version = 1.14.0, Wikibooks MediaWiki version = 1.15alpha (r48811); My Cite extension version = r44056, Wikibooks Cite extension version = r47190). Should I report this somewhere other than on technical help talk? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 23:53, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

'''Update:''' This isn't a mediawiki bug. After working with a developer on Wikibooks Bugzilla (see bug 18733), the problem seems to be that wikipedia and wikibooks are configured differently. Wikipedia is configured to suppress the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &quot;Cite error: &lt;ref&gt; tags exist, but no &lt;references/&gt; tag was found&quot; &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on all but the main namespace. Wikibooks is not. So, using the Cite extension on Wikibooks does not behave as the extension does on Wikipedia. However, the good news is the developer made a suggestion how to use the Cite extension in a way that works better for books. I am in the process of testing the suggestion (there is still one problem). If I get it working, I will announce it in the appropriate place.

== #tag magic word doesn't seem to work with Cite extension references tag ==

&lt;nowiki&gt;I am attempting to write a template with a parameter GROUP that evaluates to &lt;references /&gt; when GROUP is missing and &lt;references group=value /&gt; when GROUP equals value (i.e., when the template is called with GROUP=value). Since template parameter values can't be used inside extension tags, I have attempted to use the {{#tag: }} magic word. However, it appears it cannot handle &lt;references/&gt;. When I tried {{#if: {{{GROUP|}}} | {{#tag:references group={{{GROUP}}}/ }} | &lt;references /&gt;}} , the &quot;/&quot; goes into the group parameter value if GROUP is defined, i.e., the template returns the error: Unknown extension tag &quot;references group=value/&quot;. When I tried {{#if: {{{GROUP|}}} | {{#tag:references | group={{{GROUP}}} | }} | &lt;references /&gt;, when GROUP is defined I get the error: Cite error: Invalid &lt;references&gt; tag; no input is allowed. Use &lt;references /&gt; (i.e., the {{#tag }} magic word evaluates to &lt;references group=value&gt; &lt;references/&gt; and this is not allowed). Is there a way to expand a template parameter inside &lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 00:18, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

: &quot;group=&quot; is suppose to be a separate argument which you seem to have eventually figured out for yourself. However you than added an empty second argument to the references tag which makes it think you want to do &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references group=&quot;{{{GROUP}}}&quot;&gt; &lt;/references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Remove the second empty argument and it should work. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:{{{group|}}}|{{#tag:references|group={{{group}}}}}|&lt;references/&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. IOWs the problem is with the red part of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#tag:references | group={{{GROUP}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:red;&quot;&gt;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:33, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

&lt;nowiki&gt;Sorry. Your suggestion also does not work. It produces: &lt;references&gt;group=test&lt;/references&gt;, which results in the error I mentioned before: &quot;Cite error: Invalid &lt;references&gt; tag; no input is allowed. Use &lt;references /&gt;&quot;. (Try it yourself. Save &quot;{{#if:{{{GROUP|}}}|{{#tag:references|group={{{GROUP}}}}}|&lt;references/&gt;}}&quot; in a sandbox, say Sandbox1. Then past into Sandbox2 &quot;{{Sandbox1 | GROUP=test}}&quot;.) I think the problem is the Cite extension does not allow the use of the pair &lt;references&gt; &lt;references /&gt;. It only allows &lt;references /&gt;. Similarly, the #tag magic word does not support inserting parameters into &lt;.../&gt; tags&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 14:59, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

: Well than the order must matter, try &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#tag:references&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:red&quot;&gt;{{!}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|group={{{group}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:15, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

Doesn't work either. You second suggestion returns&quot; &lt;nowiki&gt;Invalid &lt;references&gt; tag; parameter &quot;group&quot; is allowed only. Use &lt;references /&gt;, or &lt;references group=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. As I stated in my last comment, #tag doesn't appear to work with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;.../&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. Try it.

This is exactly what I did. I pasted &lt;nowiki&gt; {{#tag:references||GROUP={{{group}}}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; into one of my Sandboxes [[User:Dnessett/Sandboxes/First Sandbox | First Sandbox]] and saved it.

Use &lt;references /&gt;, or &lt;references group=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;&quot; &lt;/nowiki&gt;. When I previewed my Second Sandbox, I get the same error message. I have left these two Sandboxes alone.

== How to use Per-Book Gadget ==

I need to provide a per-book stylesheet containing 2 css style tags for a template that I am writing (which in turn is for a book I am writing - if I ever get back to that). There appears to be a gadget called &quot;per-book&quot; that is available on wikibooks. However, there is no documentation on how to use it. Whiteknight provided a documentation page back in 2007, but never put anything on it. Can anyone tell me how to use this gadget and whether it is appropriate for downloading a per-book stylesheet? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 19:21, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

: The per book gadget uses pages named &lt;tt&gt;MediaWiki:Perbook/&lt;book name&gt;.css&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;MediaWiki:Perbook/&lt;book name&gt;.js&lt;/tt&gt;.

Thanks. There is also a Personal Per-Book gadget. Does that require an administrator to add styles for my own use?

== Name of personal per-book stylesheet page ==

To save wiki foundation server cycles, I am doing my development on a personal wiki. When I have something worth publishing, I will upload it to Wikibooks. Right now I am trying to get the personal per-book gadget to upload a stylesheet for an example I have created for a template I am developing. I have installed the per-book and personal per-book gadgets on my personal wiki and now need to figure out where to put the stylesheet. Following the instructions in [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance#How to use Per-Book Gadget | How to use Per-Book Gadget]], I attempted to create a page for the stylesheet. My username is User:Dnessett. Under it, I created a per_book page and now need to create a &lt;book name&gt;.css page. The &quot;book&quot; is actually a set of examples for the template located in the subtree structure under User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples. So, the personal per-book stylesheet should be named: User:Dnessett/per book/User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples.css. However, when I attempted to create this page, I received the warning: &quot;Warning: There is no skin &quot;Examples&quot;. Remember that custom .css and .js pages use a lowercase title, e.g. User:Foo/monobook.css as opposed to User:Foo/Monobook.css.&quot; This suggests I should create the page User:Dnessett/per book/User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/examples.css. However, before doing this, I thought it best to ask: 1) is &lt;book name&gt; the page name of the top level page in the book&gt;; and 2) if so, and the first letter in &lt;book name&gt; is capitalized, should I use a lower-case or upper case letter in the name of the stylesheet page. In other words, should I ignore the warning and use .../Examples.css or pay attention to the warning and use .../examples.css (I could just try things out, but that has a tendency to create a bunch of pages that I then have to go back and delete). [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 17:23, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

: You should ignore the warning. Yes &lt;book name&gt; is the name of the top level page in the book. If you were trying to customize a book named &quot;Example&quot; which had pages named Example/Page_1 and Example/Page_2, you would use User:Dnessett/per_book/Example.css to effect the styles for Example, Example/Page_1 and Example/Page_2. You should use uppercase for the first character of the book name, casing matters here too. I don't think the gadget really works well with books in the userspace. I think it would be looking for User:Dnessett/per_book/User:Dnessett.css as the name of the book rather than for User:Dnessett/Book/. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:00, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

Doesn't look like anything works.

When I rendered User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples/Example1/References and viewed the HTML source, none of the style tags in the .css pages showed up. Is there any way to see what is happening (i.e., some way to see what the personal per-book gadget is doing)?

: In that case, you need to have the Gadgets Extension installed and you will need to copy over the mediawiki messages used. The only reason I can think of for why its not working is because you didn't copy everything that's needed by the per-book gadget. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:51, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

I have installed the Gadgets extension, but I am not familiar with mediawiki messages. Could you explain (or point me to an explanation) of what I need to copy, where I can find the messages I need and to where I need to copy them? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 14:13, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

: You need to copy [[MediaWiki:Gadget-Perbook]], [[MediaWiki:Gadget-Perbook.js]], [[MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper]], [[MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper.js]], [[MediaWiki:Gadget-predef.js]], and the related lines from [[MediaWiki:Gadgets-definition]] to your wiki under the same names. If you have done everything right you should be able to select the per-book gadgets from the Gadgets tab in your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]]. You will than have to enable it before you will see any effects of the gadget. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:36, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

I did everything you specified when I installed the Gadget extension (BTW, are these files somehow identified as mediawiki messages?). I have also enabled both per-book and personal per-book gadgets in my preferences. The HTML produced by the wiki markup still does not contain the style tags I defined. Some questions: I have not defined a personal per-book .js page, since I don't use it - should I create an empty .js file?; 2) Even though the template isn't fully tested, I could copy it and the examples of its use to Wikibooks and let you take a look. Would doing so be presumptuous, i.e., incorrectly assuming you have the time to look it over? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 15:28, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

'''Update''': Figured out the problem. I had to enable user stylesheets on my local wiki. That is, I had to add: $wgAllowUserCss  = true; to the wiki's LocalSettings.php. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 17:31, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

== Not sure if this is a bug or I misunderstand something ==

I am trying to use a switch statement in a template. At the beginning of the template is an HTML comment. If there is a line break between the comment and the switch reserved word, the template dumps a line break into the transcluded text. I illustrate this as follows. Put the following text into a sandbox (say Sandbox 1) and save the page;

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--Comment--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#switch: note&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | nop&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | note = &lt;ref group=fn name=first&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Now transclude this sandbox text into a header. e.g.

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Header {{Sandbox 1}}==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag pair is separated from &quot;Header&quot; by a line break, which puts the second &quot;==&quot; on the next line and the header doesn't render. However, if you put the following text into Sandbox 1:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--Comment--&gt;{{#switch: note&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | nop&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | note = &lt;ref group=fn name=first&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

everything works fine. For some reason the parser is throwing a line break between the comment and the switch statement if they appear on consecutive lines. Is this defined behavior? If so, is there a way to work around it (other than the obvious tactics of placing the switch on the same line as the comment or putting the comment at the end of the template)?

'''This is definitely a bug'''. After some more testing, it is apparent that there is a bug in the mediawiki template processing logic. A detailed description of the problem is given in the bug report - 18994. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 23:50, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
== Wikibooks cleanup ==

I am mildly concerned about the current condition of Wikibooks.  Don't get me wrong, this is not criticism.  Rather, I am seeking specific policies and rules so that I can begin improving the situation.

# '''Sentence case vs. title case'''
#* I have yet to see a definite consensus.  I'm under the impression that books and their cats. use title, and subjects use sentence.  Personally, the entire idea of case-sensitivity irks me, but here's my question:  is it policy?  It seems to me that every page kinda has its own style.
# '''Bookshelves'''
#* I don't know exactly where, but I thought I saw something saying that bookshelves are deprecated, use subjects instead.  Why are they still here?  Can't we delete them, or at least remove all links to them?  Also, what is a [[Wikibooks:Computing department|''department'']]?  It looks like a bunch of bookshelves to me.
# '''Naming convention'''
#* Should colons be eliminated from names?  If so, why don't the old names get deleted?
# '''Subject pages'''
#* Why exactly is there a difference between subjects and categories?  Is there a difference between putting {{tlx|Subject|Chemistry}} and [[:Category:Chemistry]] at the bottom of a book?  I'm under the impression that every book must be categorized/subject'd and all subpages go in the book's unique category.  The whole Subjects system seems a little messy to me.
#* Of particular concern to me are [[Subject:Mathematics]] and [[Subject:Programming]]/[[Subject:Programming language]].  These pages will show you a glimpse of my confusion.  Aside from the casing/naming issues, I show you these pages because I think anyone would have a really hard time finding the book they want from these subject pages.
#* There are many books (stubs, mostly) for tests.  For instance, [[IB Chemistry]] and [[AP Chemistry]].  Should they go under [[Subject:Standard Curricula]] or [[Subject:Chemistry]] or both?
#* Why is there [[Subject:Literature]] and [[Subject:Language and literature]]?
#* Let's say there is a book called Forth Programming.  Should it go under [[Subject:Programming]], [[Subject:Computer science]], [[Subject:Programming language]], Subject:Interpreted language, or some combination of these?  Also, what if, eventually, there are several books written about Forth, just like we have now for C++.  Would we have to create Subject:Forth, and recategorize all related books?
#* Another example:  Should I put [[Swedish]], [[Finnish]] and [[Norwegian]] under a new subject page Subject:Scandinavian languages, or just leave it in the European languages subject?
# '''Featured books'''
#* [[Zine making]] or maybe [[Zine Making]] is a featured book.  Yet, I have never seen it on the front page, or on the featured book page.  Did it's author lie about the featured book status, or is Zine Making out of sight for a reason?
#* [[High School Mathematics Extensions]].  Take a peek.  It's very disorganized, somewhat incomplete, inconsistent in style and organization, etc. etc. etc.  Also, it violates naming convention.  Several subpages are directly in the main namespace, starting with HSE in the title, no slashes or hierarchy.  I think I saw colons in a few page names, but maybe it was a different book.
#** I haven't &quot;been bold&quot; and fixed it because of my above question: does the old, NC-violating page get deleted?

The list goes on.  These aren't really specific concerns, but rather an expression of my general confusion towards the organization of the entire project.

Whew, that's a lot!  Again, I'm not criticizing.  These are all issues that I would be happy to take on.  The problem is that I don't know what the actual rules are.  I'm clueless.  So, I would appreciate some concrete policies so that I can begin.  I don't want to, for example, recategorize a hundred pages only to discover that I did it wrong and made a mess and wasted my time.  &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr. '''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 22:59, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
:'''On #1''': It would seem that official policy is title case, or at least that's what I took away when I consulted [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]].  I won't speak to community consensus, though.  '''On #4''': I've been trying to eliminate all pages in [[Special:UncategorizedPages]] and the difference I see between &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subject|Blah}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is that the former puts the book into a category of its own name and the names to the right of the pipe are additional categories it will be filed in.  Using the former I would see &quot;Subjects: BookNameAsCategoryName | Blah&quot; at the bottom of the page which link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:BookNameAsCategoryName]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  That's just the Subject template versus the Category namespace.  Looking at the Subject namespace versus the Category namespace, your point that [[:Subject:Chemistry]] and [[:Category:Chemistry]] are different was a surprise to me until I looked into things further.  I was thinking Subject was a pseudonym for Category, like File and Image because of the label that shows up on the bottom of a page that has been filed into a category.  But I see that they are indeed different.  Looking at the code, adding a page to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Chemistry]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will get it to show up on the Subject page under Chemistry books.  Any pages in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Chemistry]] and [[Category:Books with print version]] show up in the respective section on the right of the Subject page.  Same with books in [[Category:Chemistry]] and [[Category: Books with PDF version]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  On [[Wikibooks:Card_Catalog_Office]] there are options to browse by Subject and browse by Category.  Browsing by Subject presents the user with a prettier layout, yet the pages listed on a Subject page are not in alphabetical order, yet those on a Category page are.  Those on a Category page are in alphabetical order, but you can't see which have printed and PDF versions and which are featured books.  Don't know if I added to the confusion or cleared things up, but that's my take as a newer user of Wikibooks. [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] ([[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]) 00:04, 24 April 2009 (UTC)
:: Thank you for your reply (and your efforts to help).  I was once going to try categorizing the [[Special:UncategorizedPages]], but this underlines my concern.  What if, Adrignola, you spend hours and hours categorizing hundreds of pages.  Then, we decide that some categories need their names changed to/from title case.  Now you just wasted all of that effort because many pages will need recategorization.  That's why I haven't done much to help clean up.  I'm waiting for official decisions to determine ''exactly'' how things should be done.  Then, we can be confident that our efforts won't be wasted.

:: Also, what if ''you'' categorize books one way, and ''I'' categorize another.  Then Wikibooks will be inconsistent.  So, I'm looking for a &quot;plan of attack&quot; that everyone can agree on before I spend too much time on stuff like this.  &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr. '''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 00:43, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

::: Having a consistent categorization scheme that has community consensus would be nice. I think people do end up often times working against each other when categorizing pages. If you look at [[Wikibooks talk:Categories]] you can see that there has even been issues in the past on whether Wikibooks should even require that pages be categorized. However I think most people do agree that categorizing pages and books is helpful. From time to time this discussion comes up. From time to time I try to work on [[Wikibooks:Categories]] to make it better in hopes addressing specific issues and in hopes that eventually there will be something people can agree too. I think it does a good job of explaining what the general idea is. There are still some things like what the casing should be for categories, should categories use singular or plural case, etc. In an ideal world books would use more descriptive names and there wouldn't be any conflict with subject names, but often times books simply use the name of the subject. I think using sentence case for categories is a good way to avoid conflict with book categories in most cases. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:04, 24 April 2009 (UTC)


::: You're right about the waste it would be to categorize incorrectly.  I'll stick to only putting subpages that are in [[Special:UncategorizedPages]] into categories equal to their book name until this is figured out.  I did further analysis of your points to come to that decision and I'll share my thoughts below.
:::*'''#1:''' I see that the contents of the Subjects pages borrow from a category coded into them.  Along the lines of your comments on casing, I see that [[:Subject:Fine Arts]] draws content from [[:Category:Fine arts]].  I see on [[:Subject_talk:Major Subjects]] that there is debate on the casing that seems to lean toward sentence case for categories/subjects (yet [[:Subject:Major Subjects]] is title case...).  ''It would be nice, in my mind, if whatever is decided on, the categories and subjects match each others' case.''
:::*'''#2:''' You're right about the bookshelves.  [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] (among others) redirects to [[Wikibooks:Departments]].  Browsing by subject, category, Dewey Decimal, and Library of Congress all appear on [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], but no browsing by bookshelf.  ''It would appear that bookshelves are no longer used.''
:::*'''#4:''' Trying to decipher the organization I found, for example, that [[:Category:Languages]] goes like this: Main page &gt; Wikibooks &gt; Books by subject &gt; Languages.  On the other hand, [[:Category:Humanities]] goes like this: Main page &gt; Humanities.  Yet both are on the same level in [[:Subject:Major Subjects]].  ''There is no clear root level.''  To take another example, [[:Category:Vedic Mathematics]] is directly in [[:Category:Mathematics]] but [[Vedic Mathematics]] is in [[:Subject:Calculation]] which is in [[:Subject:Mathematics]].  To top it off, [[:Category:Calculation]], which is where [[:Subject:Calculation]] gets its content isn't filed anywhere.  ''So the structure of the categories isn't matching the structure of the subjects or vice versa.''
:::*'''#5:''' On [[High School Mathematics Extensions]], it appears that it only shows up on [[Wikibooks:Featured_books]] because someone has manually added it to that page.  It is not in the [[:Category:Featured book]].  As for why [[Zine Making]] doesn't show up on the front page when it is in [[:Category:Featured book]], it looks like the [[Template:Goodbook/Zine Making]] needs a blurb/image and then should be listed on [[Wikibooks:Featured_books/Templates]] under the relevant section instead of the &quot;Needs blurb, image, or improvement&quot; section.   [[:Category:Featured book]], &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Goodbook/Book Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and placement in &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Main_Page_featured_books}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; seem to be the three steps necessary. --- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] ([[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]) 06:19, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

:::: Thank you for helping us organize our books.
:::: I wish the answers to all your questions were all clearly explained on some &quot;guideline&quot; page. If you do figure them out, could you help us write such a guideline page? Or at least tweak [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], [[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]], and [[Wikibooks:Categories]] to make things more clear to the next person who tries to help us organize our books?
:::: ''There is no clear root level.'' The root category is [[Special:Categories]]. ''So the structure of the categories isn't matching the structure of the subjects or vice versa.'' And how is that a problem? Have you considered that maybe the two structures don't need to match up? maybe we don't need to organize our books into a strict hierarchy, since [http://www.communitywiki.org/en/HierarchyConsideredHarmful hierarchy can be considered harmful] ?
:::: Thank you again for helping future readers find books more easily.
:::: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:09, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

::::: Those 3 pages have been tweaked recently in an attempt to make things more clear to the next person who tries to help. Special:Categories isn't a category let alone the root category. It just lists all categories that something in it, even if that category hasn't been created yet. With some recent changes [[:Category:Categories]] could be considered the root category now. There has been some attempts to eliminate confusion about which category is the root category. I would agree there isn't a need for subject pages and categories to match exactly structurally, but some consistency between the two can't hurt. Like if subject A is considered related to subject B, then the same could be considered true for the categories, even if how the categories relate might be more defined or more degrees apart. I also agree that thinking of the category system as a hierarchy can be harmful. I like to think of the category system as more like a web or matrix rather than as a hierarchy. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:20, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

== Layman's Guide to Cellular Automata ==

The module on [[Cellular Automata]] is geared towards a mathematical, academic approach; I'd like to start putting together a module that everyone can enjoy with little mathematical background. The existing text also solely focuses on 1-dimensional CAs, I'd like to briefly touch on them but mostly focus on 2D and 3D versions that people can wrap their eyes around, and mainly generate interest to the point where readers may want to start looking into the deeper mathematical aspects. If it's successful I may spearhead a similar project on fractals.

A few points of discussion before I start the module, though:
*The name: Just looking for general opinions on it
*Some minor discussion of math is necessary in places, what level of math education should this require/target?

[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 22:09, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

Can you do the discussion in 8th grade math?

:I don't know what standard others use for Laymen, but my father who was a teacher always suggested aiming at a grade 8 audience.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 05:20, 9 May 2009 (UTC)
::Grade 8 is the standard for adult readers outside their area of expertise. If you're writing for mathematicians a grade 8 level would be insulting, but for adults who don't specialize in math it'll be a good level and that generalizes to most areas. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:13, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

:::Sounds like a good plan then. My own mathematical expertise isn't much beyond calculus so discussing it on that level would be a stretch for me, and as I mentioned the primary purpose is to get people interested if they otherwise wouldn't be. A minor technical consideration: It may be better to demonstrate some concepts interactively, say through an applet of some sort. Many of the concepts are definitely best expressed animated; apng support isn't too widespread yet so it will probably use a good number of animated gifs as well (or perhaps some script trickery to use an apng where supported, and a gif where not, although this is already sounding a little too complicated). A bit of set theory wouldn't be entirely out of place either, so I may include an introduction to that as it applies here. (Even elementary coverage of set theory and logic has been, in my opinion, sadly lacking in public education during my lifetime, and deserves a place in any curriculum that also introduces algebra and geometry.)

== Introduction to Biological Systems and Soft Condensed Matter ==

Hi!

I recently uploaded a book based on partial notes from a course, and will be uploading the rest in the following weeks as the course proceeds. The course itself is at the graduate/advanced undergraduate level and mostly based on a few standard textbooks, so it is certainly not original research. Also, the notes are laid out more or less in a book style rather than a learning project/teaching resource style, though they're less detailed than a good textbook. I therefore thought this was a better venue than Wikiversity. Several students in the course have agreed to add their own sections on specific topics, and I'm hoping that it will grow further.

Please take a look and tell me what you think, I would appreciate any advice and comments you may have - this is my first attempt at such a thing. I have a few specific questions/comments you may be able to help with as well:

* I'm writing the notes in Lyx, which provides LaTeX output. I'm converting this with a python script called latex2wiki, which works pretty well for the most part, but has many bugs which I found myself repairing either manually or with vim text macros. If there's a better/easier way (and if this seems to catch on), I have several other courses I could upload.
* Also, I don't see any way to synchronize the document between the two formats, especially as some LaTeX features are not supported by mediawiki. This is unfortunate since for PDF output, LaTeX is vastly superior. It seems like some people (for instance the book on LaTeX, which naturally couldn't be typeset by anything else) are synchronizing formats - is this done manually?
* One specific example is footnotes, which of course don't mean much in the absence of pages. I dislike endnotes, though, and have made a template for sidenotes. I would welcome better ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Sandra!

I really enjoyed reading your About Me section! I know what you mean about the &quot;light bulb&quot;.. I recently got a job working in a preschool and decided that I wanted to pursue my Masters PreK-6. By the way, there is nothing wrong with being an &quot;older&quot; student.. you're right, you probably have more experience and are better prepared! :)
I also agree about your philosophy of being an &quot;active&quot; teacher. I think that when learning is fun and interesting, students will learn more. Diversity is very important, but teachers should also be prepared to assess individual strengths and weaknesses so that all students have the opportunity to be successful!
I hope you have a wonderful semester and good luck in the future! [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 20:27, 31 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==High level design==

[[Image:Different subsystems .PNG|right|thumb|600px|Figure 1: A graphical overview of the different subsystems and their cooperation.]]

RoboCup Team Wiki decides to divide the design process in following subsystems:

* Localization system: localization of the position of the robot itself, the ball, the team robots, the robots of the opponent, the borders of the soccer field, the teammate goal and the opponent goal.

* Soccer skills system: move (“run”), intercept, dribble, kick, pass.

* Battery autonomy system: provides the soccer robot with the energy to be competitive during a full game.

* Communication system: talk to each other to deliver an assist, a pass … 

* Strategy system: “when the others are attacking, I stay as a defender” …

Each subsystem becomes the responsibility of a group of people, mostly specialist.  The “strategy system” for example is awarded to the “strategy team”, a group of software engineers.  It can be seen that some subsystems are overlapping different groups: a good pass needs good skills but also good communication and localization … It is clear that a good cooperation of the different groups is a must.  A graphical overview of the different subsystems and their cooperation is given in Figure 1.

There can arise a situation likes following: “Soccer Robot Wiki 1” is in possession of the ball and is located near the teammate goal.  The strategy system of this robot decides it is best, considering the position of the robot and the long distance to the goal of the opponent, to give a pass to another team soccer robot.  The localization system of this robot search a team player to pass the ball to but notices that all his team players are located rather backwards on the own field half.  Accordingly the strategy system of “Soccer Robot Wiki 1” commands the communication system to send a message to the team robot that is the closest to the goal of the opponent telling that he should go deep.  From this moment, “Soccer Robot Wiki 1” waits until an answer.  “Soccer Robot Wiki 2”, who receives this message by his communication system, transmits this message to his strategy system.  The strategy system commands the soccer skill system to go deep.  After being close enough to the goal to score, but also in a position reachable for “Soccer Robot Wiki 1” (a combination of the work of the localization system and the strategy system), “Soccer Robot Wiki 2” sends a message back to “Soccer Robot Wiki 1” that he is ready to receive the pass.  The communication system of “Soccer Robot Wiki 1” receives this message and delivers this to his strategy system which commands the soccer skill system to pass.  In meanwhile, “Soccer Robot Wiki 2” has to sent a message to all the other team robots (except “Soccer Robot Wiki 1”) that he is going for the ball.  This is done to prevent the situation where all the robots go for the ball and the teammate goal is undefended.  The battery autonomy system is an overlapping system that makes sure that all the other systems have enough energy to work properly and this during the full game.  Keep in mind, this is a very complex cycle with just one pass  as output … More information about the strategy behind this kind of decisions can be found in next chapter.

[[Image:Different teams of RoboCup Team Wiki.PNG|right|thumb|600px|Figure 2: An overview of the different teams of RoboCup Team Wiki with the corresponding number of members(#).]]

To garantuee the above mentioned cooperation between the different teams, an integration manager is appointed.  The integration manager is a generalist with a broad technical knowledge, able to “see the total picture” and make one coherent system from different components.  Every team also needs a public relations (PR) manager to promote the team and make the necesarry arrangements to compete in the different tournaments.  An overview of the different teams of RoboCup Team Wiki with the corresponding number of members  (#) is given in Figure 2.

Although RoboCup Team Wiki has come up with a rather complete list of requirements, as shown in previous chapter, there are still some ''[[w:Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Characteristics_and_design_criteria|design criteria]]'' they need to take in account.  The different teams of RoboCup Team Wiki made up following design criteria:
 
* Focused functionality: The RoboCup Team Wiki project is optimized for autonomously playing soccer.

* Energy consumption: The soccer robot runs on batteries and needs a battery autonomy of a full game, so it is important that the energy consumption is low.

* Shocks and vibrations: The soccer robots must survive dynamic loads (being hit by another soccer robot or by the ball).

*EMC: Every team has a wireless communication network connecting all the soccer robots of one specific team.  Every team uses the same ether for this wireless communication which can generate EMC problems.

* Space constraints: The size of the soccer robot is bounded by regulations of the competition.

* Safety: the soccer robots should be predictable after a failure instead being uncontrollable (there are spectators!) by implementing some degree of redundancy and/or failure modes.

* Communication: The RoboCup Team Wiki has to communicate with each other to function as a team (instead of 6 single individuals).

* Dependability by redundancy: as already mentioned before, there is a strong need of redundancy (hardware and software).

* Robustness: Each soccer robot will be exposed to shocks and vibrations.

* Regulations: RoboCup Team Wiki is bounded by regulations.

* User interface: RoboCup Team Wiki uses a system, implemented on the team computer, to log and save the communications and following actions of their soccer robots (see chapter 6 “The competition” for more information on such a system: the MDP2Logger system of the CoPS Stuttgart team).  It is preferable that this system has a good and clear user interface.

* Maintenance: The soccer robots should be constructed in such a way that maintenance is possible during the competition (servicing).
  
* Cost: There are a lot of hidden costs because the team members work for free.  The components of the soccer robots , travel costs, promotional materials … are not for free though and should not exceed the given budget.
 
* Producibility: To allow sudden changes and servicing during the tournament, easy producibility is preferable.
  
* Life time: To keep the cost under control it is important that the soccer robots (their components) have a long life time.  It is preferable to reuse as many components as possible every new design-year to prevent restarting from scratch every year and lower the cost.  Subsequently, the components have to survive a sufficient long time, so life time is also a design criteria to keep in mind.

* Intelligence: The soccer robots should posses a form of intelligence necesarry to act autonomously.

The four last mentioned design criteria have a relatively low importance for RoboCup Team Wiki, but for the People 
Move Company on the other hand they are very important.  To illustrate the clear difference in design constraints, Table
1 presents design criteria and the corresponding rate of importance for different embedded control systems (or system
of systems).

At this stage, the company that builds the peoplemover is trying to translate their design criteria into requirements that can be added to their product requirements.  Vague requirements as life time, energy consumption, cost … will be expressed numerically.  This step does not apply to RoboCup Team Wiki because criteria such as performance are engineered according to the rule “try to make the team of soccer robots as performant as possible on the time given”.


==Detailed design==

Until this stage of the design process, the Soccer Robot can be seen as a “black box”.  The only things that mattered up to this moment were “what the soccer robot should be able to do”.  The designers have specified how the soccer robot should respond to certain inputs.  The soccer robot, for instance, should perform soccer skills (output) after having received signals from his visualization system (input).  How these inputs get changed into mentioned outputs was unanswered, until now …


===Architecture===

Each robot of RoboCup Team Wiki is a combination of hardware components and software programs.  The line between hardware and software is often very thin, so it is up to the designer to decide which functions will be implemented in software and which in hardware.  An example is a controller, which can be implemented in software just as in hardware components.  Mostly the low level functions are implemented in hardware and the high level functions on the other hand are implemented in software.  RoboCup Team Wiki makes following classification:

Low level functions: HARDWARE (HW)
* Soccer skills: move, kick, pass, ball control and handling

* Localization: sensors

* Battery autonomy



High level functions: SOFTWARE (SW)
* Localization: processing

* Strategy

* Communication


===Localization system===

As mentioned before, each soccer robot should be able to (based on the distinguishing in colours) recognize the position of:

* Itself
* Team soccer robots
* Soccer robots from the opponent
* The borders of the field
* The teammate goal
* The opponent goal
* The ball

The localization system is, as already mentioned before, a combination of hardware and software.  The hardware components are sensors, necessary to actually “see” (cf. human eyes).  To process the signals of these sensors, there is the need for CPU power (cf. human brains).


'''''Hardware'''''

The sensors used for the localization system can be of different types:

* Vision: omnidirectional vision camera
* ''[[w:Odometry|Odometry]]'': rotary encoder on each wheel
* ''[[w:Laser|Laser]]''
* ''[[w:Accelerometer|Accelerometers]]''
* ''[[w:Global Positioning System|GPS]]''
* Electronic compass
* ''[[w:Radar|Radar]]''
* ''[[w:Sonar|Sonar]]''
* Infrared distance measurement

Mark there is always the need for a vision system able to distinguish colors: an omnidirectional vision camera.  Most teams use a rather simple single view vision camera and equip it with an omnivision mirror, which also generates a 3D (color) image of the environment.  This image is the input for the image processing software (see next chapter).

The vision system can be assisted by one (or more) of above mentioned systems.  A robot only equipped with an odometry system for instance, is not able to determine its start position, which is needed because the odometry system works relatively.  When the start position is retrieved with another system, the odometry system will be able to determine the robot position, the teammate goal, the opponent goal and the borders of the field at any time.  The system however is not able to recognize the (position of the) ball or other players.  The system can be helpful to act as a back up system or assist the vision camera (sensor fusion).  An electronic compass can be added to determine the orientation of the field.  A laser is able to recognize other object and estimate the distance to this object.  A little GPS network can be built and used by the soccer robot to locate itsself and a radar or sonar can be used to locate other objects.  To estimate the distance to an object, an infrared distance measurement system can be used.


RoboCup Team Wiki decides to equip its soccer robots with an omnivision system, consisting of one camera and an omnivision mirror, an electronic compass and an odometry system.


'''''Software''''' 

Each of the above mentioned hardware components requires software to process its data.  RoboCup Team Wiki uses image processing software to assist the omnidirectional vision system.  The image processing software should continuously calculate the position, speed and direction of the robot.  It should also determine the position of the teammate goal, the borders of the field,the opponent goal and the position, speed and direction of the other soccer robots and the ball.  To find these objects and track them to retrieve their speed and direction, the robot should be able to distinguish and recognize the different colours each of these objects have.  To make sure the soccer robot recognizes the wanted object, a shape recognition feature can also be added.

RoboCup Team Wiki choses to use colour recognition and shape recognition to find above mentioned objects.  The borders of the field are retrieved by“white-line detection”, as shown in Figure ... To locate the own position a ''[[w:Monte_Carlo_localization|Monte Carlo Localization method]]'' is used based on the distance to the field lines.  An automatic colour calibration algorithm is also integrated.

For different reasons, the possibility exists that the soccer robot suddenly loses the position of an object.  When the ball is moving to fast for instance or when a recognized soccer robot disappears behind another one.  A position predicting algorithm is used to predict the position of the missing object, based on the information of the last recorded position.
The vision system is also responsible for determining which path the robot should take to go to the wanted location.  The path is not very often a straight line between the current position of the robot and the destination location, because other robots might block the way.  The software calculating the optimal way to the destination location is imbedded in the “Strategy system”, as shown further in this text.

===Soccer skills system===

The soccer skills system can be subdivided in following different systems:

* Platform
* Motion device
* Kicking/Passing device
* Ball handling device


'''''The platform'''''

As a start, there is the need for a platform to build the three last mentioned devices on.  The platform of the robot (also called frame or chassis) has to be strong, but also light.  After all, a lighter robot is faster and more flexible.  RoboCup Team Wiki uses a CAD software program to develop a platform.  A lot of effort is taken to make sure the platform is designed in such a way that all the other components can be mounted easily and fast.  It is also preferable to place the several modules at a relative low position in the robot, which lowers the center of gravity.  A  relative low center of gravity prevents the soccer robot from falling over too easily.


'''''The motion device'''''

The above mentioned platform will be equipped with a number of wheels to create motion.  The teams use three or four omni-direction wheels driven by a same number of DC motors (and servo amplifiers).  Shock absorbers can be installed on each wheel so make sure that the robot can move smoothly.  A maximum speed of 2 m/s can be reached (TKU team for MSL).  


'''''The motion control system'''''

The strategy system calculates the path the robot has to follow to reach its destination without hitting other objects.  This open-loop control system is not reliable due to (different) frictional forces of the wheels, slip …  while moving around.  For all these reasons it is necessary to use a controller with a feedback to feed the different DC motors with the correct control signals in order to move correctly through the desired path.


'''''The kicking device'''''

Each soccer robot has to be equipped with a kicking device to perform following actions:

* A straight, flat shot (on goal)
* A ground pass
* A lob pass/shot

Especially the last two actions should be adjustable in kick power and thus the force/speed of the ball.  The kick power of the ground pass or lob pass for example depends on the distance to the other robot.  Another advantage of an adjustable shot is to vary the power of a lob shot on goal on the distance of the robot to the goal.


There is a number of possible kicking device configurations:


* Electromechanical solenoid: A metallic plunjer (iron core) is moved via a magnetic field generated by a current flowing through a coil. The plunjer is connected to a “metallic leg” to pass/kick the ball. The solenoid is powered by a capacitor (350 V, 4.7 mF – TechUnited) which is charged using the main batteries.  The time the capacitor discharges over the coil can be adjusted, which makes it possible to vary the end speed of the solenoid and subsequently the launch speed of the ball.  To be able to perform a ground pass/shot but also a lob pass/shot the teams create inventive constructions.  The metallic leg for example can be composed out of an inner leg and an outer leg.  The inner leg produces a straight, flat pass/shot.  Activating the inner and the outer leg (which have a curved, foot-like shape) creates a lob pass/shot.  Another possibility to perform different passes/shots is the usage of different pistons.  This configuration is able to perform several types of shots by planning which piston is activated and when.  Even a diagonal ground pass is possible with this device, namely by activating one of the side pistons and the central piston.  A straight pass/shot is possible by activating both side pistons simultaneously.  To perform a lob pass/shot there is still the need for an adjustment as shown in the first system.
The advantages of an electromechanical solenoid kicking device are the high response speed, the easy control and the possibility for kick power adjustment (different currents generate different powers of shooting).  The high current and the high weight are the main disadvantages.
* Pneumatic kicking device: pressed air is stored in a reservoir and can be controlled by an electric valve.
* Fluidic muscle kicking device.
* Spring kicking device: a spring is charged, subsequently locked and released when needed.


'''''The ball handling device'''''

The ball handling device should perform following tasks:

* Prevent the ball form dropping during dribbling, turning, and slowing down.
* Make the position of the ball with respect to the robot adjustable (special kicks)
* Make it possible to drive backwards while still possessing the ball

During all moves, the ball should keep rolling.

Different constructions can be (and have been) invented for accomplishing above mentioned tasks.  The mechanism designed by TechUnited for example consists of two levers with a wheel attached to the end.  DC motors are used to actuate these wheels and the velocities of these wheels are measured by tachometers.  The levers can rotate around fixed points of the robot while two potentiometers measure the angles of the levers.  By rotating the wheels on the end of the levers inward the ball is pulled into the levers of the robot.  A rotation of the wheels while the soccer robot is moving around keeps the ball rolling.  It is also possible to predefine a preferred distance from the ball to the front of the robot, which corresponds to certain preferred angles of the two levers.  If the levers are bending forward or backward a position error is introduced.  These positions errors are controlled towards zero by adjusting the velocities of the wheels and hereby guaranteeing the preferred position of the ball relative to the robot.


===Battery autonomy system===

Each robot is equipped with a battery (pack) to produce enough power for all the modules on board.  The TechUnited team for example uses two Makita 24 V, 3.3 Ah batteries.  The power of the TKU team for MSL  is supplied by rechargeable batteries of 1.3 V to produce 12V after the series-parallel connection.  In times where robots are continuously becoming faster and more powerful, there is the constant need for high-energetic and efficient batteries.  It is also preferable that the batteries are light and small for obvious reasons.


===Communication system===

To allow the soccer robots to work together in a team there is the need for a reliable and fast communication network to share information.  Communication is in a distributed multi agent system one of the most important components of the system.  There are different possible designs of the communication network:

* Server – client: Each client (occer robot) transmits all the collected data (position of the robot itself, ball, goal, team players, opponents …) to a central server.  The server, implemented with the strategy system, combines these data and sends the appropriate commands back to the different clients.  Note that the individual soccer robots are not equipped with a full strategy system (they only have a path optimizing function) and just need to follow commands.
* Client – client (P2P): Each client transmits all the collected data to every other robot (by wireless LAN for example).  Subsequently the strategy system, implemented on every client, calculates for every client the appropriate action to do.  A simple FiFo principle can be used by which every robot handles the messages received from every other team robot in order of reception.  To improve the speed and reliability of the communication network an event based communication architecture can be used.  Hereby the receiver instantly gets the message when collected without any delay (real time ability).

The communication between different modules of the soccer robot can for example be done by Ethernet, USB and FireWire (IEEE1394).


===Strategy system===

The strategy system of the RoboCup team is mostly based on a role pattern (attacker, defender, dribble-robot, ball-passer …).  In the beginning all robots are equal and during the game the robots individually select their own role based on prescribed conditions.  This selection is controlled by the strategy system.  Being in possession of the ball and close to the goal of the opponent for example is a condition for becoming “attacker”.  The conditions are checked for all role patterns and the pattern which is the best in the given situation is selected.  Roles are always changed in a manner that there are no sudden changes in roles (a role never changes from attacker to defender).  Mostly the attacker is the dominator and decides which robot must cooperate and how to do this.  Subsequently the attacker/dominator commands all the other robots to defend the teammate goal.

The strategy system is also responsible for determining the optimal path (with obstacle avoidance ) to the destination.  TKU team for MSL of RoboCup for example uses a Fuzzy Controller to analyze the best way of obstacle avoidance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''''ALL ABOUT ME'''''

My name is jnemo001, well that's been my identity for the eight years I've been in school.  I live &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;in Hampton, VA and have been here for ten years.  I have three children which is why it has taken me so long to graduate, which I will hopefully be doing this fall.  O.K. my fourteen year old is reading over my shoulder and wants me to write that he does not like being refered to as a child.  So I have two children and one teenager who knows all.  

I am not sure when I realized that I wanted to be a teacher but I have held many jobs where I ended up running the training for the company.  I guess I have always been able to help others understand a concept or to see another persons point of view.  I connect well with children and would love the opportunity to share my knowledge.  I have struggled with the decision of what grade level to teach.  When I started school I wanted to work with young children but then my son entered school and I spent some time in his classrooms and realized that all children do not behave equally.  So I have decided that third or fourth grade would be perfect for me.  I love transition ages and for me around fourth grade children stop being &quot;little kids&quot; and become a little more responsible.  This of course is just my opinion based on my experiences.
     

'''''MY PERSONAL'' PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION'''

I have to say that I have never sat down and thought out a philosophy of teaching or considered the different classroom problems.  I always considered that as a teacher it would be my job to teach each student the necessary information for that grade level and beyond if possible.  If there was a student who needed to be taught differently than I would do what I could to accomodate that student whether it was a language barrier, special needs, or &quot;at-risk&quot; students which I can only assume means students who are at risk of falling behind or falling out of the system.  I have always believed that everyone deserves equal treatment in that everyone deserves to have the same opportunities in life.  I am not as naive to believe that everyone feels this way and I know it is easier to but people into catagories and seperate them into &quot;like&quot; groups than taking extra time to ensure their success. For example; if I had a few students in the class who were &quot;at-risk&quot; or special needs or spoke another language, I think with good organization and time management that these students could be given the extra attention they need to complete assignments or understand concepts.  I have never been in the classroom as a teacher but I am someone who has always gone the extra mile (to use a cliche) to acomplish my goals. 

I envision my future classroom would be more group assignments than lecture.  After a certain point in all lectures people stop listening.  My classroom would have to be engaging and interactive.  I would like to be able to motivate the students to learn concepts.  When a subject is interesting it is more easily learned.

I would like to comment on one question that my opinion may change on but I have felt strongly about for many years.  Should we have a national curriculum?  I always thought that what I learned in school was learned by everyone.  '''Until I move to Virginia'''. &lt;big&gt;'''I do not want to offend anybody.&lt;/big&gt;''' The concepts that my son learned in one grade are concepts that my niece who lives in NY and is the same age learned a year earlier.  She is ahead in almost every subject.  I have half-sister who is also in the same grade as my son (I know) she lives in NJ and is at the smae level as my niece but again ahead of my son.  Now my son is pretty smart and his father and I have an active interest in his education but not everyone has that and I can see students falling behind or moving to another state and not being able to catch up.  This can be devastating to the mindset of a student.  So I think there should be a national curriculum with room for community reflection.  The students should learn about the history of their state and city they live in but they should also be able to transfer to another school in another state and still be on target.  We shouldn't lower standards to make ourselves look good that's insulting to the students.  We should make ourselves look good by doing what is necessary to educate every student.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I too am not your “traditional” student (I have 12 years on you) and agree with your philosophy that it is never too late to do anything.  There is nothing wrong with a 10 year plan it is getting you where you want to be. Raising kids is a full time job, plus going to school, let me say GOOD JOB! I like your list of important qualities of a teacher, I will keep them in mind when it is my time to teach. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 01:18, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

Hey! Yeah, I got excited when I saw you on the screen the first class. haha. I took weaving again last semester, and was blessed to be given a 32&quot; loom with boxes and boxes of thread, so I'm in weaving heaven! I am taking 3 education classes this semester, this was the first one to start the next 2 start in a few weeks. I am taking a tutorial class in the fall for drawing with Heather and am very excited about it! I am also taking sculpture, because they wouldn't let my second weaving class count for 3d credits!? I'm still not really sure why ... are you almost finished with classes? [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 17:52, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Holly.  You were in my weaving class 2 semesters ago before I had my baby.  Are you going to take anymore weaving?  I have a tutorial all this summer.  I'm excited!  

My teaching philosophy also is to make class fun.  A class doesn't have to be boring and slow to make the students learn.  There are so many things you can do to make it exciting!  I know for art it's a little easier than...say...ALGEBRA...but a teacher can get creative in any setting and add elements that are going to make individuals ''want'' to come to class!  

Take care and see you on the big screen!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Causality and Efficacy==
It refutes against the arguments that the universe is timeless, or that it came into being through some massive coincidence–or accident.

:&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; is created ''ex nihilo'' by &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt;, if:
:#&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; causes &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; to exist
:#&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; does not cause &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; to exist by transforming some other material stuff.&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;i&gt;creatio ex nihilo&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;creation out of nothing&quot;)
*&lt;i&gt;ex nihilo nihil fit&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;out of nothing, nothing it becomes&quot;)
*&lt;i&gt;creatio ex materia&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;creation out of material&quot; [e.g. primordial matter])
*&lt;i&gt;creatio ex deo&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;creation out of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;&quot;).

The most important classical theories in cosmological and cosmogony philosophy is &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;. In causality and efficacy, we discuss the linear relationship between one event to the next subsequent event, by which the subsequent event is understood as a consequence of the initial previous event. It is purely by empirical definition that causality is self-evident in human nature and inside our basic levels of logic, reasoning, and intellect; whereas no one cannot reject: &quot;for every &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt;, initially there must always be a &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|The &lt;b&gt;cause&lt;/b&gt; is anything that is responsible for any event, change, motion, or action.
The event change, motion, or action that became the result–due to the &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;–is known as the &lt;b&gt;effect&lt;/b&gt;.
|}

===Empirical Premise===
For every event/change/motion—which is the effect—must be subjected to a cause, whether it is the initial cause or the prior cause. Therefore, every effect must be caused by another effect/prior cause, and the earlier effect must in turn be a result of another effect/prior cause, and so on. Further, we conclude that there is an initial cause. The initial cause must be entirely the uncaused cause which primarily causes its contingents to be set into motion, producing changes, and/or establishing the event(s); it is the primary mover (initial cause) which causes the effect (or contingent cause) without itself being subjected to any movement, change, and/or event. This primary mover/initial cause may also be known as the starting point of all causes. The primary mover/initial cause is to be considered by definition as the &lt;i&gt;Uncaused Absolute&lt;/i&gt;.

====Principles of Cause and Effect====
# ''Prior to Effect'': For every cause, there must always be an effect; The cause must be prior to the effect, true either temporally or logically.
# ''Similar to Effect'': Every effect is less than the cause; The effect must be similar, or have relationship to its cause.

====Laws of Cause and Effect====
* The initial cause must be an ''uncaused'' cause.
* Only the contingent (dependent, finite), is result of an effect.
* The cause (initial or contingent) has a determining principle, or sufficient reason that initiates the (subsequent or similar) effect.
* Effects must be ultimately dependent to their cause to have an 'existing' condition, an actuality.
* The existing condition of the effect can equate as a different (contingent) cause but not the initial, or prior cause.
* The initial cause is greater than the effect (or contingent cause); every effect (or contingent cause) is less than the initial/prior cause.
* The effect (or contingent cause) must be analogically similar to the initial/prior cause.

===Theo-Philosophical Arguments===
====Self-Caused====
The first option is that the universe caused itself to exist.  Yet this is logically impossible.  According to Thomas Aquinas, “There is no case known (nor indeed is it possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself, because in that case it would be prior to itself, which is impossible.”[9]  If the universe had a beginning, and it caused itself into existence, then there is an example in cosmological history in which nothing caused something.  John Locke wrote, “This being of all absurdities the greatest, to imagine that pure nothing, the perfect negation and absence of all beings, should ever produce any real existence.”[10]  To believe that nothing could cause something to exist is unreasonable and illogical.

====Uncaused====
The second option is that the universe is &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;caused.  Even without a very close look at this option it seems unlikely.  Everything that one can observe within the universe is in submission to the principle of causation.  Would not the whole have the same attributes as the parts?  Geisler writes, “Either the whole universe is equal to all its parts or else it is more than all its parts.  If it is equal to them, then it too needs a cause.”[11]  If this is true, then it eliminates the possibility that the universe is a self-caused entity made up of smaller interdependent entities.

One can imagine a system of interdependent entities, without a sustaining cause.  However, a simple illustration demonstrates the difficulty of such a proposition.  A single playing card taken from a deck of cards cannot stand alone at a forty-five degree angle.  It can only do so if it is glued to a surface, or supported by some other object.  It is possible that one could lean two cards on each other, facing each other.  What was not possible on its own, is now possible as the two lean on each other, causing each other to stand.  Each card is contingent on the other card to keep it from falling.  Yet, someone had to place those cards into position on a stable surface so that they could stand.  Even if a valid argument could be set forth that demonstrated a universe of many contingent parts without a sustaining cause, a universe without a first cause is not possible.[12]

Is it possible that there is something in the whole universe that is greater than the sum of its parts?  Geisler writes, The sum of many dependent parts will never equal more than a dependent whole, no matter how big it is.  Only if the universe is more than all its effects, can it be uncaused and necessary.  But to claim that there is a something more, uncaused and necessary on which everything in the universe is dependent is to claim exactly what the theist means by a Necessary Being on which all contingent beings depend for their existence.[13] The conclusion must be made that the universe cannot be uncaused.  Every observable entity within the universe is in submission to the principle of causation.  The only way the whole could be uncaused is if it has always existed and is, therefore, infinitely old.  This is only possible if an infinite series of causes exists in cosmic history.

====Infinite Regress====
The third option is that there is an infinite series of causes. This is a common position for non-theistic scientists and philosophers today.  Matter or energy would have existed throughout all of time, without a first cause. Stephen Hawking theorizes that the universe has been forever expanding and contracting. The universe is not singular, but a series of multiple histories.[14]          Others, like George Gamow, envision an extremely dense mass that gave birth to specific atoms, either in an explosion like the Big Bang, or gradually over time.[15] Neither of the proposed views gives an adequate explanation of how something could exist forever in history without having a first cause. Both universes have change. Change requires a cause. What set Hawking’s universe in motion for its perpetual expansion and contraction?  What caused Gamow’s dense mass to exist? And if it had existed forever, what caused the change within it to begin the expansion? Perhaps these brilliant men lost sight on the logic of causation in all of their mathematical formulas and physical theories.
  
An infinite regress in time is not possible because one would never arrive at the present.  There must have been a first cause to start everything.  An infinite series is possible in the abstract, mathematical world. A potential infinite series is also possible in the future.  But one will never arrive there, because there would always be more moments to traverse.  According to Geisler, “Such a series, however, would not be actually infinite but only potentially infinite.  That is, it would never be complete, always being capable of having one more added to the series.”[16]  It is not possible for finite matter, limited to time, to traverse an actual infinite series in time.  Therefore, it is not possible for matter to exist forever in past history.

====Primum Movens====
It has been demonstrated that the universe cannot be self-caused, uncaused, or part of an infinite series of causes.  This leaves only one other option—that the universe came into existence as a result of the First Cause.  This cause must be a necessary, powerful, eternal being. Aquinas points out that “if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause.”[17]  Without a first cause there is no ultimate effect.  An infinite series of causes obviously has no first cause. Furthermore, if an infinite number of causes exist, one would expect to see an infinite number of effects.  However, no one can demonstrate that this is true.  In fact, the opposite seems to be the case. Therefore, an infinite regress of causes is logically impossible.

===Argument===
The argument has several forms, the basic first-cause argument runs as follows:

====Kalām Cosmology Argument====
&lt;b&gt;دَلِل ألْحُدوث كَلام&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;(dalil al-huduth kalām)&lt;/i&gt;
The Kalām cosmological argument is a variation of the cosmological argument that argues for the existence of a First Cause for the universe. Its origins can be traced to medieval Jewish, Christian and Muslim thinkers, but most directly to Islamic theologians of the Kalām tradition.[1] Its historic proponents include John Philoponus,[2] Al-Kindi,[3] Saadia Gaon,[4] Al-Ghazali,[5] and St. Bonaventure.[6] A prominent contemporary Western proponent is William Lane Craig.[7]

The basic premise of all of these is that something caused the Universe to begin to exist, and this First Cause must be God. It is also applied by the Spiritist doctrine as the main argument for the existence of God.

The Kalām argument was named after the Kalām tradition of Islamic discursive philosophy through which it was first formulated. In Arabic, the word Kalām means &quot;words, discussion, discourse.&quot;

The cosmological argument was first introduced by Aristotle and later refined by Al-Kindi, Al-Ghazali (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes).[8] In Western Europe, it was adopted by the Christian theologian and Saint of the Roman Catholic Church, Thomas Aquinas. Another form of this argument is based on the concept of a prime-mover; this Aristotelian form of the argument was also propounded by Averroes. The premise is that every motion must be caused by another motion, and the earlier motion must in turn be a result of another motion and so on. The conclusion thus follows that there must be an initial prime-mover, a mover that could cause motion without any other mover. One of the earliest formations of the Kalām argument comes from Al-Ghazzali, who wrote, &quot;Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning.&quot;[1]

Two kinds of Islamic perspectives may be considered with regard to the cosmological argument. A positive Aristotelian response strongly supporting the argument and a negative response which is quite critical of it. Among the Aristotelian thinkers are Al-Kindi, and Averroes. In contrast Al-Ghazzali and Muhammad Iqbal[9] may be seen as being in opposition to this sort of an argument.

#Everything that has a beginning has a cause.
#The universe has a beginning.
#The universe must have a cause.
#The cause must be prior to the effect.

The Kalām cosmological argument:[10]
Everything that has a beginning of its existence has a cause of its existence;
*The universe has a beginning of its existence;

Therefore:

*The universe has a cause of its existence.

Conceptual analysis of what it means to be the cause of the universe then aims to establish some of the theologically significant properties of this being.&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Every event must have a cause, and each cause must in turn have its own cause, and so forth. Hence, there must either be an infinite regress of causes or there must be a starting point or first cause. Al-Kindi (as Aristotle) rejected the notion of an infinite regress and insisted that there must be a first cause, and the first cause must be God.

Another form of this argument is based on the concept of a prime-mover (This is the Aristotelian form of the argument also propounded by Averroes). The premise is that: every motion must be caused by another motion, and the earlier motion must in turn be a result of another motion and so on. The conclusion thus follows that there must be an initial prime-mover, a mover that could cause motion without any other mover.

It is possible to prove God’s existence by understanding the concept of being as being and building on first principles of knowledge. “From the principle of causality or finality we can conclude to the existence of God; from principles of negation and eminence, we can conclude to the simplicity and eternity of God; from the principle of causality and analogy, we can conclude to the fact that God has intellect, a will, and so forth.”[1] Natural theology can give certain and necessary knowledge of God because it is built on certain undeniable first principle of knowledge. There are several philosophical arguments that have been around for many centuries regarding the existence of God. Of these, the cosmological argument is considered by many proponents of theism as the most important. The cosmological argument is often divided into two separate presentations—the horizontal or kalam cosmological argument and the vertical cosmological argument. The difference is made in whether one is arguing how the universe came to be (kalam), or how the universe continues to be (verticle). Though several forms of the argument do overlap, for the purpose of this paper, the kalam cosmological argument will be presented in a form similar to that of Saint Thomas Aquinas’ argument from efficient causality.

There are two Islamic perspectives with regard to the cosmological argument. A positive Aristotelian response strongly supporting the argument with thinkers such as Al-Kindi, and Averroes. And a negative response which is quite critical of it with thinkers such as Al-Ghazzali and Iqbal which may be seen as being in opposition to this sort of an argument.

Al-Kindi is one of the many major and first Islamic philosophers who attempt to introduce an argument for the existence of God based upon purely empirical premises. In fact, his chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his On First Philosophy.[11]

He presents four different versions of this argument, all are variation of the cosmological argument which require a cause.

The first argument revolves around the principle of determination (tarjjih), that is prior to the existence of the universe it was equally likely for it to exist or not to exist. The fact that it exists implies that it required a determining principle which would cause its existence to prevail over non-existence. This principle of determination is God.[12]

This is similar to Leibniz’s principle of sufficient reason[13][14] Leibniz argues that everything in the world is contingent that it may or may not have existed. Something will not exist unless there is a reason for its existence. This rests on his premise that the actual world is the best possible world, as such we can account for everything in it as being there for a specific reason. But the universe as a whole, requires a further reason for existence, and that reason for Leibniz is God.

A second argument of his draws its inspiration from Islamic and Aristotelian sciences. He argues that only God is indivisible, and everything other than God is in some way composite or multiple. Kindi describes his concept of God, he has no matter, no form, no quantity, no quality, no relation; nor is He qualified by any of the remaining categories (al-maqulat). He has no genus, no differentia, no species, no proprium, no accident. He is immutable… He is, therefore, absolute oneness, nothing but oneness (wahdah). Everything else must be multiple.[15]

This for Kindi was a crucial distinction upon which he rested some of his main arguments for God’s existence. In Kindi’s theory only God’s oneness is necessary whereas that of all others is contingent upon God. Hence all other beings single or multiple must emanate from the ultimate essential being. In addition this first being must be uncaused, since it is the cause of everything else.[16]

The material world cannot exist ad infinitum because of the impossibility of an actual infinite (a concept borrowed from Aristotle). The material world can also not be &quot;eo ipso&quot; eternal, because of the impossibility of an infinite duration of time, since the existence of time is contingent upon the existence of bodies and motion, which have been shown to be finite. As such the world requires a creator, or rather a generator (mudhith) in Kindi’s scheme, who could generate the world ex nihilo.[17]

The third and fourth arguments he presents are similar versions of the first cause argument, and hence are subject to the same criticisms that apply to any cosmological argument. These criticisms come not only from Western scholars but also Islamic ones. Al-Ghazzali is unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Kindi. In response to them he writes: &quot;According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.&quot; [18]

Ghazzali thought that it is at least theoretically possible for there to be an infinite regress, and that there is nothing that necessitates a first-cause simply by pure deductive reason. He thus undermines one of the essential premises of the first-cause argument.

Al-Kindi's argument has been taken up by some contemporary Western philosophers and dubbed the Kalam Cosmological Argument. Among its chief proponents today is Dr. William Craig.[19] It proposes to show (contrary to what Ghazzali thought) that the universe must have necessarily had a beginning. A contrast is drawn between two concepts, the “potential infinite” and an “actual infinite.”

====Contemporary argument====
[[William Lane Craig]] has formulated the argument as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig 1994: 92&quot;&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig 1994]]: 92&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
*The universe began to exist.
*Therefore, the universe has a cause.

With two sub-sets of arguments.

'''The first sub-set of arguments:'''

Argument based on the impossibility of an actual infinite:

#An actual infinite cannot exist.
#An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.
#Therefore, an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.

'''The second sub-set of arguments:'''

Argument based on the impossibility of the formation of an actual infinite by successive addition:

#A collection formed by successive addition cannot be an actual infinite.
#The temporal series of past events is a collection formed by successive addition.
#Therefore, the temporal series of past events cannot be actually infinite.

====Discussion====
Craig argues that the first premise is supported most strongly by intuition, but also by experience. He asserts that it is &quot;intuitively obvious,&quot; based on the &quot;metaphysical intuition that something cannot come into being from nothing,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig 2007&quot;&gt;[[#CrgCP|Craig 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and doubts that anyone could sincerely deny it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig 1994: 92&quot;/&gt; Additionally, he claims it is affirmed by interaction with the physical world. If it were false, he states, it would be impossible to explain why things do not pop into existence uncaused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig 2007&quot;/&gt;

The second premise is often supported by philosophical arguments and scientific verification for the finitude of the past.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig 1994]]: 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Craig claims that the number of past events cannot be infinite, meaning that the universe must be finite and therefore must have begun to exist. He also cites the [[Big Bang]] theory as evidence for the second premise. Craig interprets the [[Big Bang]] as the temporal beginning of the universe, and discounts the [[Cyclic model]], vacuum fluctuation models, and the [[Hartle-Hawking state]] model which suggest otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig 1994]]: 100-116&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument concludes, often through a process of elimination, that the cause of the universe must be a personal, uncaused, beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, enormously powerful, and enormously intelligent being,&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgLU|Craig 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is God.

====Argumentation====

&lt;ref name=Morriston&gt;[http://www.philoonline.org/library/morriston_5_1.html &quot;Creation ex Nihilo and the Big Bang&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract: William Lane Craig claims that the doctrine of creation ex nihilo is strongly supported by the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. In the present paper, I critically examine Craig’s arguments for this claim. I conclude that they are unsuccessful, and that the Big Bang theory provides no support for the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. Even if it is granted that the universe had a “first cause,” there is no reason to think that this cause created the universe out of nothing. As far as the Big Bang theory is concerned, the cause of the universe might have been what Adolf Grünbaum has called a “transformative cause”—a cause that shaped something that was “already there.”

:When God began to create the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a mighty wind swept over the face of the waters. Genesis 1:1–2

We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory; and there we have no reason to trust our common methods of argument, or to think that our usual analogies and probabilities have any authority. Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.

As Adolf Grünbaum has pointed out, many familiar causes are “transformative” in character. When a person makes something, he makes it out of something.1 He transforms a pre-existent material into something else (the effect). The carpenter cuts the wood and fits it together so as to make a house, the potter shapes and bakes his clay so as to make a pot, and so on. 

Genesis 1 can be read as saying that God did something of this sort with the “formless void”—shaping it in a step-by-step process that led to sky and earth and sea. But according to the traditional Christian interpretation, this is not the whole story. If there was a First Stuff (a “formless void,” perhaps) out of which God made the universe, then he must have made that too. And inasmuch as it is the First Stuff, he did not make it out of any other stuff. He created it ex nihilo.

The traditional Christian doctrine of creation has often been stated in Aristotelian terms: God is the efficient cause of the universe. No doubt God had something definite in mind when he created (the formal cause), and no doubt he had his reasons for creating (the final cause)—but there was no material cause—no “stuff” that God worked with in the very first act of creation.

But we don’t need Aristotle’s Four Causes to explain what is meant by creation ex nihilo. For present purposes I shall adopt the following definition: 

x is created ex nihilo by y if and only if i) y causes x to exist, and ii) y does not cause x to exist by transforming some other material stuff.2

For convenience and stylistic variation, I shall continue to use the Aristotelian expression, “material cause,” to refer to whatever underlying material stuff is altered by a “transformative cause.”

Now suppose, for the sake of argument, that the universe was caused to exist by a very powerful person. Why isn’t this person a “transformative cause?” Why not suppose that there is a material cause? Why do Christians insist that God must have created the universe ex nihilo?

Although there is little scriptural support for this traditional doctrine,3 there are obvious theological motives. Philosophically minded Christians have long held God to be, not just the greatest being who happens to exist, but the Greatest Conceivable Being. A God who could not create without shaping a pre-existent material stuff would be limited by the nature of that stuff—he could create only what his stock of materials permits. Such a God would not be the Greatest Conceivable Being since one can consistently conceive of a God whose power is not limited in this way.

In recent years, however, some Christian philosophers have suggested that purely scientific and philosophical considerations show that the universe was not made out of anything. William Lane Craig, in particular, has argued that creation ex nihilo is strongly supported by the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. Craig gives at least two different arguments for this conclusion. The first depends on the supposed “infinite density” of the initial singularity, the second on the claim that there was no time prior to the initial singularity.

Grünbaum, on the other hand, has forcefully argued that creation ex nihilo does not follow from any reasonable interpretation of the claim that the universe has a cause. Causes of the sort that are acknowledged in everyday experience and in scientific explanations either do not involve conscious agency, or, if they do, they also involve the transformation of some pre-existing material. In neither case do we have the sort of cause envisaged by classical theism. So even if one were to grant the premise that everything (including the beginning of the universe) has a cause, it would not follow that the universe was created ex nihilo.4 

In the present paper, I shall show that neither of Craig’s “Big Bang” arguments is successful in refuting Grünbaum’s contention, or in establishing a link between the Big Bang theory and creation ex nihilo. Even if it is granted that the universe was created by a very powerful person, the Big Bang theory provides no support for the further claim that this person created the universe out of nothing. As far as the Big Bang theory is concerned, the creation of the universe might have consisted in the transformation of something else. And even if God is the cause of the Big Bang, his first creative act might have consisted in the shaping of something that he did not create.

===The First Argument===

In an article with the title, “Philosophical and Scientific Pointers to Creation ex Nihilo,” Craig argues that the Big Bang theory entails creation ex nihilo. The “staggering implication” of what is known about the expansion of the universe, he says, is that “at some point in the past, the entire known universe was contracted down to a single point. . . .”5 As we go back in time, we reach “a point at which . . . the universe was ‘shrunk down to nothing at all.’” And this, Craig insists, shows that the universe was created out of nothing.

This event that marked the beginning of the universe becomes all the more amazing when one reflects on the fact that a state of “infinite density” is synonymous with “nothing.” There can be no object that possesses infinite density, for if it had any size at all, it would not be infinitely dense. . . . Thus, what the Big Bang model requires is that the universe had a beginning and was created out of nothing.6 

The argument can be conveniently outlined as follows:

1. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe “began with a great explosion from a state of infinite density.”7 

2. “There can be no object” having “infinite density.”

3.  So, “‘infinite density’ is synonymous with ‘nothing.’”

4. Therefore, the Big Bang theory “requires” that “the universe had a beginning and was created out of nothing.”

This argument of Craig’s need not detain us for long. There are at least three quite obvious—and decisive—objections to it.

(i) In the first place, “infinite density” is not synonymous with “nothing,” and the “initial singularity” that figures in Craig’s statement of the Big Bang theory8 is not simply nothing at all. A mere nothing could not begin expanding, as the infinitely dense “point universe”9 is supposed to have done. And even if it lacks spatial and temporal spread, the initial singularity would have other properties—for example, that of “being a point.” It would therefore be a quite remarkable something, and not a mere nothing. So, step 3 is obviously false.

(ii) In the second place, (3) does not follow from (2). No one would suppose that it follows from the fact that there can be no round squares, that “round square” is synonymous with “nothing.” But neither should anyone suppose it follows from the fact (assuming it is a fact) that there can be no infinitely dense objects, that “infinite density” is synonymous with “nothing.” 

(iii) Something interesting does follow from (2), however. If no object can have infinite density, then the universe was never in a state of infinite density, and the interpretation of the Big Bang that figures in step 1 of the argument is false. It seems, then, that Craig must either scrap this way of describing what the Big Bang theory says, or else relax his strictures against infinite density. Either way, this particular argument for creation ex nihilo is unsound.

Nowadays, few Big Bang theorists would say that there ever was a “point universe” or a “state of infinite density.”10 It is true that on the standard Big Bang model, the “geometry” of the continuing expansion is such that, as we trace its history backwards in time, the diameter of the universe continually decreases—gradually approaching a limit of zero. But having a diameter of zero can be thought of as an ideal limit, rather than as the state of anything that once actually existed.

As we approach this limit, however, we have no theory that enables us to draw reliable inferences about the behavior of the universe. It is well known that general relativity breaks down prior to 10-43 seconds (or “Planck time,” as it is called), and that quantum effects then become significant. What is needed is a theory that somehow “incorporates the principles of both general relativity and quantum theory.”11 Until such a theory emerges, all claims about the earliest stage in the history of the universe remain in the category of sheer speculation.12 
The Second Argument

In “The Ultimate Question of Origins: God and the Beginning of the Universe,” Craig explains the relation between creation ex nihilo and the Big Bang theory in a rather different way. 

The standard Big Bang model . . . describes a universe which is not eternal in the past, but which came into being a finite time ago. Moreover—and this deserves underscoring—the origin it posits is an absolute origin ex nihilo. For not only all matter and energy, but space and time themselves come into being at the initial cosmic singularity. . . . On such a model the universe originates ex nihilo in the sense that at the initial singularity it is true that There is no earlier space-time point or it is false that Something existed prior to the singularity.13

In this passage, Craig does not equate the “initial cosmic singularity” with “nothing.” What he says instead is that nothing preceded the initial singularity in time, and this is supposed to show that it came into existence ex nihilo. If it was created—and Craig, of course, believes he can show that it was created by a timeless person—then it must have been created out of nothing. In that case, it has an efficient, but not a material, cause. The Creator did not make the initial singularity by transforming a pre-existent material stuff. He couldn’t have, since there was no time prior to creation.

This argument can be conveniently summarized as follows:

5. The initial singularity exists at the earliest point of space-time.

6. There is no time prior to the earliest point in space-time.

7. Therefore, there was nothing temporally prior to the initial singularity.

8. So, the initial singularity must have come into existence out of nothing.

9. If, therefore, the initial singularity was created, it must have been created out of nothing.

There are at least two problems with this argument. The first is that the Big Bang theory does not entail the truth of premise 6. Even it is granted that the space-time of our universe begins at (or shortly “after”) the initial singularity, it does not follow that time begins then. 

To see this, suppose that God created the initial singularity, but that he did a lot of other things first. Maybe he created other universes (with their own “space-times”)—or perhaps he just thought things over for a while prior to creating the universe. As Craig himself has suggested in one of his responses to Grünbaum, God might have “counted up” to creation.

. . . [S]uppose that God led up to creation by counting, “1, 2, 3, . . ., fiat lux!” In that case the series of mental events alone is sufficient to establish a temporal succession prior to the commencement of physical time at t = 0. There would be a sort of metaphysical time based on the succession of contents of consciousness in God's mind prior to the inception of physical time. Thus, it is meaningful to speak both of the cause of the Big Bang and of the beginning of the universe.14

In view of the way Craig characterizes the Big Bang theory, perhaps the “count” in his thought experiment should go like this: “1, 2, 3, . . ., Let there be an infinitely dense particle!”15 Space-time begins when (or shortly after) God says, “Let there be an infinitely dense particle!” In this imaginary scenario, the creation of space-time takes place within a more fundamental kind of time—a kind of time that is perfectly conceivable independently of the existence of our universe. Craig refers to it as “metaphysical time.” 

What is the nature of metaphysical time? According to Craig, it is tensed, dynamic, and non-relative. There is an ever changing fact of the matter about which events are future, which present, and which past. Future events become present, present events become past, and past events sink further and further into the past. 

We have just seen that a temporal series of purely mental events, coming into existence and passing away in metaphysical time prior to the beginning of the universe, is possible. But there also does not seem to be any a priori bar to the possibility of a temporal series of non-mental events occurring prior to the beginning of our space-time. If he had wished to do so, God could have created a whole series of universes, each with its own history and its own special laws, prior to creating ours.

Craig, of course, thinks that any such temporal series must have a beginning. He offers a pair of well-known (and controversial) a priori arguments against the possibility of a beginningless series of events, and he also argues that the ultimate cause of the very first event in metaphysical time must be a timeless person. I will not reproduce or challenge any of these arguments here.16 I shall assume, for the sake of argument, that metaphysical time has a beginning. What is important in the context of this paper is that such a beginning need not coincide with the beginning of space-time.

If, as Craig explicitly acknowledges, God could have created metaphysical time long before creating the space-time of our universe, it follows that there could have been something temporally prior to the earliest point in space-time (t = 0), and premise 6 of Craig’s argument for creation ex nihilo would then be false. Premise 6 may be true anyway—metaphysical time and space-time could have begun together. But since the Big Bang theory says nothing about metaphysical time, Craig cannot consistently appeal to that theory to show that this is so.

If this were the only thing wrong with Craig’s argument, it might seem easy enough for him to produce an argument for the same conclusion without relying on the disputed premise 6. If, as Craig holds, metaphysical time must have a beginning, then whenever that beginning occurs—whether before or at t=0—there is no time prior to it. And in either case, I believe Craig would say that something comes into existence out of nothing.

It is only fair to point out, however, that the Big Bang theory would contribute nothing to such an argument. More importantly, perhaps, the revised argument would not establish that the universe (or any part thereof) was created ex nihilo, but only that something or other was. Even if Craig’s a priori arguments against the possibility of an infinite past were successful, they would not enable him to show that the heavens and the earth were created out of nothing.

Leaving this point aside, let us ask how Craig’s argument fares if it is assumed that the first moment of metaphysical time coincides with t=0 in space-time. It seems to me that this still doesn’t give us “origination ex nihilo.” What follows from step 7 of the argument is only that the universe didn’t emerge from something that existed at a time earlier than t=0—not that it wasn’t made out of anything at all. To get from (7) to (8), we need an additional premise:

71/2. If there was nothing temporally prior to the initial singularity, then it must have come into existence out of nothing.

Unfortunately, it is not at all clear that (71/2) is true. Even if we accept Craig’s contention that the universe was caused by a timeless and personal God, why should we join him in supposing that God is the only being who exists outside time? Why could there not also have been a timeless “stuff” out of which God “formed” the universe? If God had created the singularity out of something timeless, then it would not have come out of nothing even though there was nothing temporally prior to it, and (71/2) would be false. It seems, then, that the beginning of the universe could have had a material cause even if there is no time prior to the beginning of the universe

I believe the reason Craig doesn’t take this possibility into account is that he equates the possibility of a material cause of the universe with the possibility that matter/energy plays a certain role in creation. Assuming that matter/energy is itself created, it can hardly be among the causes of creation. And since matter/energy has temporal duration, it also follows that the material cause (if any) of the universe cannot be timeless.

That this is how Craig thinks about the possibility of a material cause of the universe can be seen in his recent discussion of “vacuum fluctuation” models of the origin of the universe.

Still, insofar as vacuum fluctuation models render it plausible that the universe lacks a material cause, they are of service to theism. . . . There is no reason that the theist could not explain creation ex nihilo by saying that the sum total of the matter/energy in the universe is zero and thus God in creating the universe required no material substratum.17

Craig here assumes that matter/energy is the only possible “material substratum” for creation. If, prior to the Big Bang, the sum total of matter/energy were zero (as Craig apparently believes is postulated by a vacuum fluctuation model of creation18), Craig thinks this would support his claim that the universe was created out of nothing. And since, as he has also argued, matter/energy is never “quiescent,”19 it also follows that there could not be a timeless material cause.

But why suppose that matter/energy is the only possible “stuff” out of which God might have made the universe? It’s true that we don’t seem to be acquainted with any timeless “stuffs” that could have played this role. But we don’t encounter any timeless persons either, and Craig has no trouble with that idea. Indeed, he thinks that the need for an efficient cause of the beginning of the whole temporal order forces him to postulate one. So why should there not also have been a timeless material “stuff” for God to work with?

Craig has claimed that it is obvious—so obvious that no honest and rational person could fail to agree—that nothing can begin to exist without a cause.20 But as far as I can see, the need for a material cause is exactly on a par with the need for an efficient cause. To see this, consider the following “stories” that might be offered to explain the coming into existence of a house.

Story 1. There was no lumber, no nails, no bricks, no mortar, no building materials of any kind. But there was a builder. One day, the builder said, “Five, four, three, two, one, Let there be a house!” And there was a house.

Story 2. There was no builder, but there were lumber, nails, bricks, mortar, and other necessary building materials. One day, these materials spontaneously organized themselves into the shape of a house.

I do not see that Story 1 is in any way superior to Story 2. Both stories are incompatible with our experience of the way the world works. Both are deeply counter-intuitive. The fact is that a house needs both an efficient and a material cause.

Admittedly, the universe is not a house. But as far as I can see, the universe is at least as much (or as little) in need of a material as of an efficient cause. Let us suppose, then, that Craig is right in thinking that the causes (if any) of the universe would have to be timeless. And let us suppose further that he is right in thinking that—although we have never encountered a timeless person—we must postulate one as the efficient cause of the universe. Why, then, would it not be equally appropriate to postulate a timeless material cause?

I do not have a candidate for the timeless material cause of the universe. The only “stuffs” with which we are familiar are this-worldly materials, all of which exist in time. But it is equally true that the only persons with which we are familiar are this-worldly persons, and all of them exist in time. My question, then, seems perfectly reasonable. If we follow Craig in postulating a timeless person as the efficient cause of the whole natural order, why should we not also postulate a timeless “stuff” as the material cause of the universe?

It might occur to someone to object that the material cause of the universe couldn’t be timeless because it is a part or an aspect of the universe, and because every such part or aspect is temporal. The material cause of the universe (if there were one) wouldn’t just disappear after creation. It would remain within the physical universe—as the stuff of which it continues to be “made.” If there were a material cause of the universe, it would necessarily have temporal duration.

Perhaps. But even if this is so, it is not an adequate defense of Craig’s position. For it fails to demonstrate a clear difference with respect to temporality between a timeless efficient cause and a timeless material cause. Craig, it will be recalled, holds that the efficient cause of the universe is timeless only sans the universe. When God created the universe, Craig thinks that he also placed himself within time. Assuming that this makes sense, we may ask why God could not also have placed a timeless material cause within time (and the universe). The “stuff” of which the universe is made would then be timeless sans the universe. But when he created a universe with a beginning in time, we may suppose that God put this same “stuff” into time. At the point of creation, so to speak, both the material and the efficient cause of the universe enter time.

I hasten to assure the reader that my purpose here is not to recommend such a doctrine of creation. I claim only that, given what is known about the Big Bang, creation out of an unknown timeless stuff is not less likely than creation by an equally unknown timeless person. 

When I say that creation out of some timeless stuff is not less likely than creation ex nihilo, I do not mean to suggest that either possibility is especially likely. My own humble and admittedly non-expert view is that since almost everything connected with the Big Bang theory is highly speculative, it would be a grave mistake to draw from it any firm conclusions about the cause(s) of the Big Bang. Deriving any conclusion from the Big Bang theory about the truth or falsity of classical theism is premature at best.

But this is not all. Those who support Craig’s argument believe that the universe requires an efficient cause, but that it is not, and does not need to be, made out of anything. I believe my argument shows that this position is not sustainable. Either our commonsense intuitions about ordinary intra-mundane cases of causation can reasonably be applied to the beginning of the universe, or they cannot be. If they can be, then creation out of some uncreated “stuff” may actually be quite a lot more likely than creation ex nihilo! In our experience of the world, after all, the making of enduring things always involves the transformation of some pre-existent material.21 So, if commonsense intuitions are to be relied upon here, creation ex nihilo is out. If, on the other hand, our commonsense intuitions about causation cannot reasonably be applied to the beginning of the universe,22 then our epistemic situation does not allow us to draw any conclusion whatever about the existence or nature of a first cause. Either way, Craig’s Big Bang argument for creation ex nihilo lacks cogency.

A wise philosopher once said, 

Though the chain of arguments . . . were ever so logical, there must arise a strong suspicion, if not an absolute assurance, that it has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties, when it leads to conclusions so extraordinary, and so remote from common life and experience. We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory; and there we have no reason to trust our common methods of argument, or to think that our usual analogies and probabilities have any authority. Our line is too short to fathom such abysses.23

Hume’s target in this remarkable passage was Malebranche’s claim that God is “the sole and immediate cause of every event which appears in nature.” But I think these eloquent words are well adapted to the present context as well. They provide a quite accurate description our epistemic situation with respect to creation ex nihilo and the Big Bang theory. Here too, I think some philosophers have gotten themselves pretty far into “fairy land.” Here too, “our common methods of argument” fail to settle all the hard questions we are capable of asking. 

In the last analysis, we simply do not have enough to go on to say what the causes (efficient or material) of the beginning of the universe are likely to be. Certainly, the Big Bang theory does not settle the issue in favor of creation ex nihilo. Even if time and the universe began together, they may, for all we can tell, have been created by an unknown efficient cause out of an equally unknown material “stuff.” The best course may well be to suspend judgment about all of these bizarre possibilities.24

3. The claim that God created out of nothing is not well supported by Genesis 1. Readings of verse 1 range from “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . .” to “When God began to create the heavens and the earth . . .” Neither reading entails creation ex nihilo. Both are consistent with the view that God made the heavens and the earth out of something that was already there when God “began to create,” and the second reading is at least consistent with the view that the “formless void” was the stuff out of which God made the earth.

Only G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه و تعالى is indivisible, and everything other than G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه و تعالى is in some way composite or multiple. G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه و تعالى has no matter, no quantity, no quality, no form, no relation; nor is G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; qualified by any of the remaining categories.
&quot;He has no genus, no differentia, no species, no proprium, no accident.  He is immutable… He is, therefore, absolute oneness, nothing but oneness (&lt;i&gt;wahdah&lt;/i&gt;).  Everything else must be multiple.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sharif, M. M. A History of Muslim Philosophy.  Wiesbaden:  Harrassowitz, 1966, pp. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in order that something may exist, substance must exist. But nothing can exist merely as a substance; it must have accidental forms (&lt;i&gt;a‘rad&lt;/i&gt;).

:For instance, {{quote|1)A cat cannot exist unless it has some colour, while it cannot have colour unless it has quantity or some kind of magnitude. At once, then we have the first three categories: substance, quality and quantity, which are the intrinsic determinations of all objects.&lt;br&gt;2)The cat is equal or unequal in size to other substances; in other words, it stands in some relation to other objects.&lt;br&gt;3) The cat must exist at a certain period of time and in a certain place; must have a certain position or posture; and must possess (or be in) a state of comfort or discomfort. Again, all material substances as belonging to a cosmic system both act and a reacted upon.|}}

Only the oneness of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه و تعالى is necessary whereas that of all others is contingent upon G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;.  Hence all other beings single or multiple must emanate from the ultimate essential being.   In addition this first being must be uncaused, since it is the cause of everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Fakhry, Majid ''A History of Islamic Philosophy''. New York : Columbia University Press : Longman, 1983, pp. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The material world cannot exist ad infinitum because of the impossibility of an actual infinite (a concept borrowed from Aristotle).   The material world can also not be &quot;eo ipso&quot; eternal, because of the impossibility of an infinite duration of time, since the existence of time is contingent upon the existence of bodies and motion, which have been shown to be finite.  As such the world requires a creator, or rather a generator (mudhith) in Kindi’s scheme, who could generate the world ex nihilo.&lt;ref&gt;Fakhry, Majid ''A History of Islamic Philosophy''.  New York : Columbia University Press : Longman, 1983, pp. 74-78&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Objections and criticism===

The argument has been criticized [26] by such philosophers as J. L. Mackie, Graham Oppy, and Quentin Smith, and physicists Paul Davies and Victor Stenger.

Stenger has argued that quantum mechanics dis-confirms the first premise of the argument, that is, that something can not come into being from nothing. He postulates that such naturally occurring quantum events are exceptions to this premise, like the Casimir effect and radioactive decay. Craig responds to this in two different ways: (1) the indeterministic origination of virtual particles in the quantum vacuum is not true creatio ex nihilo (creation from nothing) since the vacuum contains a sea of fluctuating energy, empty space, and is governed by physical laws; none of which is &quot;nothing.&quot; (2) Craig states that the interpretations to which Stenger appeals are indeterministic interpretations which are one of many interpretations, some of which are wholly deterministic and none of which is actually known to be true. Thus, Craig rejects this as a refutation of premise one. However, Stenger continues that &quot;...Craig is thereby admitting that the &quot;cause&quot; in his first premise could be...something not predetermined. By allowing probabilistic cause, he destroys his own case for a predetermined creation.&quot;[27]

Ghazzali thought that it is at least theoretically possible for there to be an infinite regress, and that there is nothing that necessitates a first-cause simply by pure deductive reason. He thus disputes one of the essential premises of the first-cause argument.

Muhammad Iqbal also rejects the argument stating, “Logically speaking, then, the movement from the finite to the infinite as embodied in the cosmological argument is quite illegitimate; and the argument fails in total.” For Iqbal the concept of the first uncaused cause is absurd, he continues: &quot;It is, however, obvious that a finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds.&quot;[28]. That is a misunderstanding of the argument however. First developed by Aristotle, the argument itself necessitates an Unmoved Mover as an infinite regress is possible. In addition, Christopher Martin in his book Thomas Aquinas: God and Explanations, explains that to postulate an infinite number of causes does not serve as an answer to the cosmological question. He uses the analogy of a broom, whereby making the handle longer will not cause the broom to sweep[29]. In addition, John Frame through the the work of Bas Van Fraassen in “Presupposition, Implication, and Self-Reference” indicates that logically, a First Cause is imperative in making the very concept of causality intelligible

Kant also rejects any cosmological proof on the grounds that it is nothing more than an ontological proof in disguise. He argued that any necessary object’s essence must involve existence, hence reason alone can define such a being, and the argument becomes quite similar to the ontological one in form, devoid of any empirical premises.[30].

Another objection comes from the B-theory of time. On a B-theory of time, the universe doesn't come into being, it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block. [31] According to Craig, the Kalām cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time.

According to McTaggart, there are two distinct modes in which all events can be ordered in time. In the first mode, events are ordered by way of the non-relational singular predicates &quot;is past&quot;, &quot;is present&quot; and &quot;is future.&quot; When we speak of time in this way, we are speaking in terms of a series of positions which run from the remote past through the recent past to the present, and from the present through the near future all the way to the remote future. The essential characteristic of this descriptive modality is that one must think of the series of temporal positions as being in continual transformation, in the sense that an event is first part of the future, then part of the present, and then past. Moreover, the assertions made according to this modality imply the temporal perspective of the person who utters them. This is the A-series of temporal events.

From a second point of view, one can order events according to a different series of temporal positions by way of two-term relations which are asymmetric, irreflexive and transitive: &quot;comes before&quot; (or precedes) and &quot;comes after&quot; (or follows). This is the B-series, and the philosophy which says all truths about time can be reduced to B-series statements is the B-theory of time.

The logic and the linguistic expression of the two series are radically different. The first is tensed and the second is tenseless. For example, the assertion &quot;today it is raining&quot; is a tensional assertion because it depends on the temporal perspective—the present—of the person who utters it, while the assertion &quot;It rains on 15 June 1996&quot; is non-tensional because it does not so depend. From the point of view of their truth-values, the two propositions are identical (both true or both false) if the first assertion is made on June 15, 1996. The non-temporal relation of precedence between two events, say &quot;E precedes F&quot;, does not change over time (excluding from this discussion the issue of the relativity of temporal order of causally disconnected events in the theory of relativity). On the other hand, the character of being &quot;past, present or future&quot; of the events &quot;E&quot; or &quot;F&quot; does change with time. In the image of McTaggart the passage of time consists in the fact that terms ever further in the future pass into the present...or that the present advances toward terms ever farther in the future. If we assume the first point of view, we speak as if the B-series slides along a fixed A-series. If we assume the second point of view, we speak as if the A-series slides along a fixed B-series.
Relation to other ideas in the philosophy of time

There are two principle varieties of the A-theory, presentism and the growing block universe.[1] Both assume an objective present, but presentism assumes that only present objects exist, while the growing block universe assumes both present and past objects exist, but not future ones. Ideas that assume no objective present, like the B-theory, include eternalism and four-dimensionalism.

==The Words of God==
Since God سبحانه وتعالى created the universe in consonance with the Torah's requirements, logic demanded that the Torah descend to earth where ordinary human beings could carry out its precepts literally.
:''&quot;Through the Words of God the heavens were made.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Psalms 33:6]&lt;/sup&gt;

Heaven and earth and all their fullness became the clothing for the 'Word of God', which infuses Creation, and without which the world could not continue to exist.

&quot;You shall not steal&quot;–has a spiritual dimension that is above human comprehension, but if that was all it meant, then God سبحانه وتعالى would not have created a physical world filled with animal temptations and larcenous instincts.  Had He been concerned only with angelic concepts of honor, then He would not have created flesh and blood with the blend of harmony and friction, love and resentment that makes the relationship between humans simultaneously beautiful and chaotic.  Moses عليه السلام convinced the angels that the physical universe translated the Torah into its material manifestation, that only people could carry out God's Will, and that only with the Torah could they do so.

The Heavens and earth and all their fullness became the accoutrement for the Word of God which permeates His Creation; and without with the world, as we know it, could not continue to exist. We can conclude that God's divine word took physical form.

===Basic principles of Kalam===

Some of the basic principles of the Jewish Kalam are as follow (Stroumsa 2003). See also Rambam's characterization of the principles below.

*Observation of the natural world reveals the existence of a Creator
*The world/universe must have been created ex nihilo rather than from preexisting matter
*The Creator is absolutely different (opposite) from anything in the created world
*The Creator is a perfect unity, with no division
*Human moral criteria can be applied to God. To say God is &quot;wise&quot; or God is &quot;good&quot; is to apply those terms meaningfully, and their meaning is related to the mundane meaning of those terms (cf. Rambam)

Rambam's characterization---Rambam refers repeatedly to the Mutakallimūn (Kalam philosophers) in his Guide to the Perplexed. Some examples of his characterization of Kalamic thought can be found at the end of Book I (Chapters 73–76), see also Wolfson (1967). The translation which follows is from Pines (1963):

As for that scanty bit of argument (kalam) regarding the notion of the unity of God and regarding what depends on this notion, which you will find in the writings of some Gaonim and in those of the Qaraites, the subject matter of this argument was taken over by them from the Mutakallimūn of Islam and that this bit is very scanty indeed if compared to what Islam has compiled on this subject. Also it has so happened that Islam first began to take this road owing to a certain sect, namely, the Mutazila, from whom our co-religionists took over certain things walking upon the road the Mutazila had taken. After a certain time another sect arose in Islam, namely, the Ashariyya, among whom other opinions arose. You will not find any of these latter opinions among our co-religionists. This was not because they preferred the first opinion to the second, but because it so happened that they had taken over and adopted the first opinion and considered it a matter proven by demonstration

Rambam continues in that section to provide a history of Kalamic thought, its sources and subsequent development, and then proceeds to condemn a certain laxity of thought to be found in this philosophical school. In particular, Rambam takes strong issue with the Kalamic proof of God's existence and unity from the Creation of the World in time. While Rambam himself does regard the world as having been created ex nihilo (rather than being eternally existing, as Aristotle would have it; see GP, Book II Chapter 25, for example), Rambam also considers this proposition as being far from obvious, and in all likelihood not susceptible to proof. He thus regards the Kalamic approach as starting from a position of convenience rather than from an irrefutable premise, and their methodology as being entirely tainted by their eagerness to produce certain results which support their prior beliefs.

Additionally he considers their premises to &quot;run counter to the nature of existence that is perceived.&quot; He writes that &quot;every one of their premises, with few exceptions, is contradicted by what is perceived of the nature of that which exists, so that doubts come up with regard to them.&quot; However, it can be noted below, that in many cases the Kalamists were indeed more prescient than Rambam himself in their beliefs regarding the discrete nature of matter, existence of vacuum, and other physical characteristics of the natural world.
Principles of Kalam according to Rambam

In Book I Chapter 73, Rambam presents the 12 premises of the Mutakallimūn, and disputes most of them. The premises are, in brief, as follow:

*Existence of atoms: The world is composed of small particles which are not divisible, and which have no identifying essential properties (only accidents).
*Existence of vacuum: There exist certain spaces which are devoid of all substance and material.
*Time is discrete: Time is made up of fundamental instants which are not themselves subject to further division.
*Every body is subject to accidents: Any body must have either an accident (non-essential feature) or its opposite. A body cannot be without accidents.
*These accidents exist in the atom.
*An atom has one-instant duration: An atom does not persist (its accidents do not persist) more than one moment of time. God must repeatedly create these accidents at each time instant, or they permanently go out of existence.
*Accidents in bodies also do not persist and must be recreated. This and the previous principle constitute a denial of causality.
*Only substance and accident exist: Bodies differ only in regard to their accidents.
*Accidents subsist in a common substratum: An accident cannot subsist in another accident.
*Any state of affairs which can be imagined is admissible in intellectual argument.
*All kinds of infinity are impossible.
*The senses may be in error: The senses should not be trusted in matters of demonstration.

Not all of these principles were elements of the Jewish Kalam as practiced by particular thinkers. For example (Wolfson 1967), atomism was a principle embraced by Karaites but not by the Geonim or later Karaites. Wolfson considers it doubtful whether any Jewish thinkers ever embraced the denial of causality.

==Qabbalah==
The Kabbalah is a group of works which present mystical interpretations of the Jewish holy books, known as Tanakh, which consist of the Torah (5 books of Moses), Novim (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings). 

The literal meaning of the term Kabbalah refers to the act of transmitting secret knowledge, and as with all forms of mysticism, Kabbalah explores the secret or hidden meanings of the universe. 

However, because these aspects of the universe are so complicated and difficult to understand, the authors of Kabbalistic works rely heavily on symbols and analogies to make their point. 

One way of distinguishing the symbolic from the literal is by knowing which ideas are acceptable and which are taboo. For example, one book describes God's physical proportions in great detail; however, an important belief in Judaism is that God is completely incorporeal, and thus these measurements are really symbols for God's power. 

Other basic tenets of Judaism are that God is indivisible, eternal and has alone complete authority over the universe; there are no intermediaries between God and Man; and God is the creator of the universe and all men.

As mentioned earlier, mystics of all cultures attempt to explain how the universe works and why. Unlike rationalists who explore the physical aspects of the universe, the mystics try to understand the spiritual aspects.

The Kabbalistic view of the universe is much different from that held by most Western scientists. First of all, the &quot;true&quot; universe consists of the En Sof (literally the infinite or the incomprehensible), which is the spiritual universe. The spiritual universe is inseparable from God, and has no beginning and no end (unlike the physical universe). God has many characteristics, but they can be logically separated into ten groupings. When these characteristics are all present in a particular &quot;region,&quot; that region is perfect. However, God has several times removed certain characteristics from a point in the En Sof (the act is called tzimtzum, contraction) thus creating a point of imperfection wherein a physical universe can exist.

Our current universe is not believed to be the first, but it may be the longest-lived. It was created by removing Law from a point and filling the &quot;vacuum&quot; with Kindness. This was necessary for it was God's desire to give Man free will or the power to decide good or evil, and this would not be possible if Divine Law permeated the universe. The act of creation itself was accomplished through ten emanations (esher sephirot in Hebrew).... First, Keter (Crown) was emanated as a projection of En Sof into the physical universe. From this sphere of emanation came Khokhmah (Intelligence), called the father sphere, and Binah (Wisdom), the mother sphere. The remaining seven spheres come from Wisdom, and represent each of the seven days of Creation.&lt;br&gt;
The six &quot;active&quot; spheres are: 
#) Khesed (Kindness) also known as Gedulah (Greatness), 
#) Din (Law) or Gevurah (Power) or Pakhad (Fear), 
#) Tiferet (Beauty) or Rokhmim (Mercy), 
#) Netzakh (Victory or Endurance), 
#) Hod (Glory or Majesty), and 
#) Yesod (Foundation) or Tzaddik (Righteousness). 
The last sphere, which represents the physical universe, is Malkhut (Kingdom), also called Knesset Yisroel (Community of Israel) or Shekhinah (God's female aspect). The variety of names for some of the emanations reflect the multitude of ways one can interpret God's characteristics.

It should be noted that these spheres are inseparable. They merge, divide, reflect and act as catalysts for one another, and have different amounts of influence at any particular time or place. Some mystics have gone into great detail to explain the various influences the emanations have on each other. From a fantasy role-playing game standpoint, these spheres of emanation are the root of magic. Knowing the relative influence of the spheres [one can tell] the future, and exercising any control over the spheres will influence future events.

The spheres themselves are often grouped in various ways, such as by triangles or columns. To view the tree of emanations (Hebrew: ''Etz Khayim'') as triangles, imagine the top nine spheres as one triangle pointing up over two triangles pointing down. For this interpretation, neither Crown nor Kingdom are used, as they represent the spiritual and physical universes, respectively. The top triangle consists of Intelligence, Wisdom and ''Da'at'' (Knowledge, or a combination of Intelligence and Wisdom). Knowledge is the external or more physical aspect of the Crown, and is often placed directly between Intelligence and Wisdom and beneath Crown. These top three spheres are more intertwined and interdependent than any other combination of spheres. Sometimes Crown is referred to as &quot;the knowledge,&quot; Intelligence as &quot;that which knows,&quot; and Wisdom as &quot;the thing known.&quot; Thus it is not surprising that the first triad is known as the Intellectual triad, or the brain of the tree of emanations.

The second triangle consists of Kindness, Law and Beauty, and is called the moral triad. As mentioned earlier, the current physical universe is believed to have been created by an act of both Law and Kindness. These two characteristics are viewed as the archetypes of the duality of good versus evil, where Kindness is good and (unrestrained) Law is evil, but many of the mystics who developed this principle further borrowed heavily from the Zoroastrians, and thus their ideas tend to be inconsistent with the other philosophies of Judaism. This triad also defines the three columns of the tree of emanations, these being the right side (Intelligence, Kindness and Victory) which signifies mercy, the left side (Wisdom, Law and Glory) which signifies judgement, and the center (Crown, Beauty, Foundation and Kingdom) which mediates.

The third triangle is known as the natural triad. It contains Victory, Glory and Foundation. This triad is seen as baser or more physical than the others due to its proximity to Kingdom, which represents the physical universe.

The ten emanations are seen as the means by which the universe was created and maintained. They are occasionally represented as a wheel with Beauty in the center, or as ten concentric circles which either begin or end with Crown. There are also ten &quot;intangible&quot; spheres, a shadow of the tree of emanations, which consists of 1) Rom (Height), 2) Mizrakh (East), 3) Tzofun (North), 4) Tove (Good), 5) Ra (Evil), 6) Reysheet (First, 7) Durem (South), 8) Mariv (West), 9) Akhrit (Last), and 10) Takhat (Depth). The relationships of the spheres of emanation, particularly in their tree structure, is constantly referenced or alluded to in mystical works, as we shall see.

The physical universe itself is composed of four worlds, which are not planets, and correspond to the four stages of Creation. These stages are another aspect of the creation process and do not conflict with the six phases or &quot;days&quot; of Creation listed in the beginning of the Torah.&lt;br&gt;
The four worlds, and their related stages of creation, are: 
#) Olam HaAtzilut (World of Emanation), which represents the archetypal ten emanations and the creation of primeval light; 
#) Olam HaBeriah (World of Creation), which contains the Divine Throne and symbolizes the spiritual universe apart from God, and Man's divine &quot;spark&quot;; 
#) Olam HaYetzirah (World of Formation), wherein reside the angels and men's souls, and symbolizes the concept within creation of individual existence (i.e., number, measure and form) as opposed to archetypes or ideas; and 
#) Olam HaAsiyah (World of Activity) which is the material universe.

There are many theories concerning the relationship of these four worlds to the ten emanations. In one, the four worlds are all part of what we call the physical universe, and thus they reside below the emanations, which are more spiritual in nature. Another theory states that there is a set of ten emanations within each of the worlds, and while the names and positions of the emanations within each tree stays the same, their inter-relationships within each tree does not. Yet another view has each of the first three worlds associated with the three triangles mentioned earlier, and the fourth world identified with the emanation Kingdom.

Judaism was the first religion to conceive of time as linear: the physical universe has a beginning, a life-span, and an end. Yet in Kabbalah some cycles are mentioned. Of course there is the seasonal cycle, the most important seasons being Spring (the time of planting) and Autumn (the time of harvest). Spring is associated with Kindness, for it represents the re-birth of nature. It is also the time when the Jews celebrate Pesakh (Passover), which commemorates God's Kindness in intervening to free the Jewish slaves of Egypt more than 3500 years ago, even though they had not shown themselves worthy. Autumn, on the other hand, is associated with Law, for it is then that one reaps what one has sown, and the Jews observe Rosh Hashonah (Spiritual New Year) when God judges men and determines their fates for the coming year. It has been postulated that the world was conceived in Autumn, and that this was when Law was removed from the supernal point which was to become the physical universe; and the world was created in Spring, when Kindness moved in to fill the &quot;vacuum.&quot;

Yet another theory postulates cycles occurring on a much grander scale. In this theory, one of God's days is 1000 of our years. His week is 7000 years, and His jubilee is 50,000 years. Each of the seven creative spheres (all but the Intellectual triad) dominates a week, and the interpretation of the Torah changes with each week. Thus the time of the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) was dominated by Kindness, but Moses' receiving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai marked the beginning of the week controlled by Law. This conveniently explains why the early Jews did not have to follow all of the various restrictions in the Bible (particularly the dietary laws), and expresses the hope that in the future these rules will be less harsh. After each of the spheres has had its week, the Messianic Age begins and all souls are forgiven. There is then a millennium of reshaping, in which a new physical universe is created complete with a new set of souls and the process starts over. The number of cycles, while limited, is not known.

An important principle in Jewish mysticism is the power contained in letters, words, names and especially in the Torah. While the Jews did not invent the alphabet, they were one of the first people to use it and even to this day tend to be obsessed with it. Each letter was originally a symbol for the first sound in that word. In addition, the Semitic alphabets also serve as numerals. Thus was established the principle of secret meanings behind each letter.

The Kabbalistic view of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet is that they represent the 22 &quot;gates&quot; or &quot;pathways&quot; between the ten spheres of emanation. Thus letters can be used to &quot;enter&quot; or understand the emanations.... It should be noted that since there are only ten emanations, Knowledge should be ignored (alternatively, Crown could be ignored and Knowledge take its place).

The 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are also linked to different parts of the universe, parts of Man, or other symbols. The Hebrew alphabet is often divided into three classes: the three mother letters, the seven double letters and the twelve single letters. The mother letters each correspond to a different element (Earth was not considered an element by most Kabbalists), as well as the three triangles of the tree of emanations. The double letters each represent a different day of the week, facial orifice, direction, noble metal and heavenly body (only five planets were known then). Each single letter represents a different sign of the Zodiac, month, complex direction, ancient Israelite tribe and stone in the breast plate of the High Priest. [See Appendix]

One line of mysticism, called Gematria, interchanges letters based on order of numeric value. For example, the tetragrammaton is sometimes spelled with the letters which come directly after the true letters. Another example is that since the name of the demon Ashmodai (Asmodeous in Latin) has a numeric value of 355, which is the same as Pharoah, it is believed that Ashmodai is a king of demons. Many similar associations between words or phrases have been found by [Kabbalists]. In addition, sometimes the values of the lettes cycle around from 1 to 9 and then back to 1 again, or the value of the letters' names spelled out is used, or the values of the letters are squared and then compared to the value of a word whose letter values were not squared. Of course this form of mystical analysis requires fluency in Hebrew. Hebrew has a special advantage over many other alphabets in that the frequency of use varies little from letter to letter.

The main use that Gematria is put to by Kabbalists is understanding the hidden meanings of the Torah. The Torah is perceived by Jews as Man's interpretation of God's blue-print for the universe. Because of Man's and his language's inherent inability to grasp the complicated secrets of the universe, many details were hidden in the words transmitted to Moses at Mt. Sinai. Thus the words themselves, as well as the &lt;i&gt;ta'amim&lt;/i&gt; (musical symbols), &lt;i&gt;nekudot&lt;/i&gt; (vowels), &lt;i&gt;Tagim&lt;/i&gt; (seriphs), and &lt;i&gt;Otyot&lt;/i&gt; (letters) all contain hidden meanings. The anagram PARDES (literately: &quot;orchard&quot;, but translated into Latin as paradise) was used to describe this principle. Every phrase, word, letter or stroke has four meanings: &lt;i&gt;poshit&lt;/i&gt; (simple), &lt;i&gt;remel&lt;/i&gt; (hint), &lt;i&gt;drash (concept) and &lt;i&gt;sod&lt;/i&gt; (secret). The mystics were, of course, more interested in the latter meaning.

It is believed that the ''spiritual'' Torah (i.e. not translated into any human language) existed before the created universe. Some even state that the physical universe was created to give life to the Torah. As mentioned earlier, it has been postulated that the Torah changes every cosmic week. This change has been described as the re-assembling of the letters of the holy books, and thus their numerical values would remain unchanged.

Names are of particular importance in Judaism, especially those of the Deity. It is often held that the entire Torah is simply one long name of God. Most names, however, are much shorter, and thus often refer to only one aspect or view of God. Probably the best known name of God is the tetragrammaton, represented in English as YHVH (because the printing of certain holy names on anything which may be destroyed is considered blasphemous, all names given here are transliterated...). This name is often mistranslated as Yahweh or Jehovah. Neither of these translations are really Jewish, for YHVH is not pronounced in Hebrew (the word HaShem, meaning &quot;the name,&quot; or in prayer Adonai is substituted instead). The tetragrammaton is often linked to the ten emanations as follows: the serif of the yod is Crown and its body is Intelligence; the first heh is Wisdom; the vov, which has the numerical value of six, stands for the next six spheres; and the second heh is Kingdom.

Another system used by Kabbalists links a different name of God to each sphere. Thus Crown is EHYH, pronounced Ehyeh, which refers to being, and Intelligence is linked to YH (Yah), a simple name for God. The name spelled YHVH but pronounced Elohim is linked to Wisdom, and stands for the emanations. Kindness's name is ELHI (Elohai), literally &quot;my God.&quot; The name EL is also associated with Kindness, and is often appended to the names of angels to signify their service to God. Another misunderstood name is ELHIM (Elohim), which is linked to the Law. The name itself refers to God as the unifying force behind the universe's multplicities, but it is often mistakenly interpreted as a symbol for multiplicities within God Himself. The tetragrammaton is placed in the middle of the tree of emanations with Beauty. Victory is symbolized by the name YHVH TzBAOTh (Tzeva'ot) and its counterpart Glory by ELHIM TzBAOTh; Tzava'ot refers to the angels as a group or army. Both the names EL KhY (El Khai) &quot;living God&quot; and ShDI (Shaddai) &quot;the all-powerful&quot; are associated with Foundation, and Kingdom's name is ADONI (Adonai), which means &quot;my Lord.&quot;

The names just mentioned are recognized as God's names by all Jews. Several others, however, were introduced by Kabbalists and have meanings only to them. Four of these are known as the names of 45, 52, 63, and 72. All of these spell out the letters in the tetragrammaton in different ways, and the numbers refer to the total numeric value of the letters in each name. Another popular name consists of 42 letters and is often used in charms. Its pronunciation is uncertain.

A major area of Kabbalistic magic consists of amulets and seals. It is important to note that these terms are used differently by Jews than by others. The term amulet refers not to a container of a demon's soul but rather to an enchanted item bearing various names of God and of angels in an attempt to bring their desired characteristics into play. For example, an amulet for protection in child birth will often bear the names of the three angels who once captured the demon-Queen Lilith, who swore she would kill all human children. On the other hand, a seal of a particular angel or demon can be used to gain some (but not absolute) control over them. In the case of angels it is possible that they comply with the wishes of the seal-bearer out of respect for their knowledge, as evidenced by their writing of the seal, and not because the seal itself holds power.

Amulets can be designed in a variety of ways to appeal to the beings listed thereon. One of the simplest is the magic triangle.... Sometimes an entire passage from the Bible is taken and each word is placed in a magic triangle. It is also possible to select a word whose meaning changes as one lops off or adds on letters. A famous example of this principle is one version of the golem story where the word emet (truth) was written on the golem's forehead, and in order to deactivate it the first letter was taken off so that it read met (corpse).

Another, more complicated construct is the magic square. In its most straightforward form, the magic square contains a name and switches the positions of the letters.... A more complicated version involves the use of different words and names so that no matter which direction one reads, there is a word or name....

Popular among later mystics were amulets in the shape of a hexagram, also known as mogen David (shield of David). A few centuries ago this became the symbol of Judaism, replacing the more complicated menorah, or seven branched candelabra, which is now believed to be what King David really did have painted on his shield! The hexagram symbolized (1) protection from the six directions (north, south, east, west, up and down); (2) a man's body (head, two arms, two legs, and either soul or female aspect), and (3) Heaven. The latter association is [somewhat] complicated. The word for Heaven in Hebrew is Shamayim, while the Hebrew for fire and water are esh and mayim. Thus it is believed that Heaven is made of fire and water. The alchemical symbol for fire is a triangle, and water's symbol is an upside-down triangle, and if they are super-imposed on each other one has a hexagram. These amulets are commonly found with the names Dovid Melekh (King David), Mogen Ben-Dovid (shield of the son of David, i.e., the messiah), and Yerushayalem (Jerusalem).

Other amulets are drawn in various shapes (especially hands or menorahs) and contain names, words or combinations of the letters of a particular biblical passage.

In the Middle Ages no distinction was made between devices of protection and holy items. In order to fulfill the commandment &quot;... these words, which I command thee this day... thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes, and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house and upon thy gates&quot; (Deut. VI, 6-9), Jews place boxes containing this passage on their door posts (called mezuzah) and in morning prayers place smaller boxes on their left arm and forehead (called tefilin). It was often believed during Medieval times that these devices warded off demons, and so Jews often wrote additional names and symbols upon the parchment containing the biblical passage. This belief was held by many Christians as well, for they called the tefilin phylacterys, Greek for amulet, and often tried to purchase these protection from the Jews!

Three groups of beings mentioned most often in Kabbalistic works are angels, demons, and souls. Belief in a soul is probably the oldest religious idea, dating back 10,000 years or more. Jews believe in three souls, each successively more spiritual. At the top of this hierarchy is the neshomah (lit. life or spirit), which is linked with the intellectual triad of the spheres of emanation. It is believe by some that these souls never leave Heaven, but move closer to God as their associated humans become more pious, and move away from God when the human breaks commandments. Next is the ru'akh (lit. air), related to the moral triad, and responsible for sentience. After the body dies, the ru'akh stays on Earth for between a week and a year, and then goes to Heaven. The lowest form of soul, which even the animals have, is nefesh (lit. breath), which stays on Earth and haunts the location of its body's death. It is connected with the natural triad of spheres.

At the time of Creation, only a limited number of souls were made. Their purpose is to reunify God's characteristics within the physical universe, and they do so only by fulfilling the 613 mitzvot (commandments) of the Bible (the souls of Gentiles are not required to fulfill some of the commandments which are unique to the Jewish religion). Those souls which do not succeed perform gilgul (transmigration) and reappear in a body of a human infant. If a soul has but one commandment left to fulfill, it may become an ibur, which means that it takes temporary possession of the body of one who is in a position to fulfill that commandment. On the other hand, a soul which is very wicked may be banished from God's presence altogether, and in order to become corporeal, take possession of another's body by force (generally while that person is ill) and is known as dibbuk. When this occurs, the victim must undergo an exorcism, and in order to prevent the evil soul's regaining control, the victim's name is changed, since names are external reflections of one's soul.

It is believed that the original souls are complete, i.e., both male and female. These two sections split when they incarnate, but if the corresponding humans find and marry each other they will have a perfect marriage. It should not be assumed, however, that a male soul always takes a male body and a female soul a female body. If the genders are mixed then some imbalances occur, and the body is usually barren or impotent. If, however, a man with a female soul weds a woman with a male soul, then procreation is possible. The institution of marriage itself is seen as an important part of the soul's work, for the union of the two people and their souls is analagous to the unifying of God's characteristics as well as the unifying aspect of God (Elohim).

Death is usually interpreted as a natural and necessary part of life. There are, however, two forms of death with supernatural implications. One is known as the Kiss of Death, whereby God rewards those who are extremely wise (as in Moses) or those who are so pious that they have completed the 613 commandments in an unusually short time (this explains the demise of certain sages). Opposite to this form of death is karet, whereby one's soul is removed by the Angel of Death as punishment for grave sins.

Another form of unnatural death is that of sorcery, or biting off more knowledge than one can chew. It is difficult to say whether this form of death is bad or good, for the soul is liberated from the body by the knowledge which has just been learned, similar to the Kiss of Death except that it is enacted from below instead of above. On the other hand, the Talmud and other works forbid the teaching of mystical works to any younger than a certain age, usually between 20 and 40, in order to prevent this form of demise.

The goal of the Kabbalah is to obtain a complete understanding of God, the universe and their inter-relationships. It strives to achieve this understanding through the use of symbols and analogies, particularly the Jewish holy books. These symbols and ideas are useful to fantasy role-playing games and fantastic literature as a source of magical concepts. Rejuvenating old ideas through new uses has long been a means of keeping a genre alive, healthy and growing. The Jewish Kabbalah can and should be used to expand the horizons of the fantasy role-playing game and modern fantasy in general.

====The Zohar====
The Zohar, which is the foundational work in the literature of Jewish mystical thought–''Qabbala''–contains a discussion of the nature of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى, the origin and structure of the universe, and the nature of the &quot;inner-self,&quot; which is perceived as the spirit, or soul (Arabic: ''nafs'' | Hebrew: ''nefeš''). It's commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah and scriptural interpretations, as well as material on Jewish mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. 

In terms of Jewish mysticism in the Qabbala, the &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; is an overarching symbol equating with the top sephirot of ''Keter'' (&quot;Crown&quot;), which is situated between ''Chokmah'' (&quot;Wisdom/Conception&quot;) and ''Binah'' (&quot;Understanding&quot;), and it sits above ''Tiphereth'' (&quot;Adornment&quot;), and is usually given three paths, or connections, to ''Chokmah'', ''Tiferet'', and ''Binah''. Keter is so sublime and described as absolute compassion, it is considered &quot;the most hidden of all hidden things&quot;, and is completely incomprehensible and ineffable to man. 

The first Sephirah is called the Crown, since a crown is worn above the head. The Crown therefore refers to things that are above the mind's abilities of comprehension. All of the other Sephirot are likened to the body which starts with the head and wends its way down into action. But the crown of a king lies above the head and connects the concept of &quot;monarchy&quot;, which is abstract and intangible, with the tangible and concrete head of the king. 

This first Sefirah represents the primal stirrings of intent in the [[Ein Soph]], or the arousal of desire to come forth into the varied life of being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar&quot;/&gt; But in this sense, although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself, and is therefore called 'Nothing', 'The Hidden Light', 'The air that cannot be grasped'. Being desire to bring the world into being, Keter is absolute compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Names of God in Judaism|name of God]] associated with Keter is [[Ehyeh_asher_ehyeh|Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh]] (Hebrew: אהיה אשר אהיה), the name through which he revealed himself to Moses from the burning bush.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It is from the name Ehyeh that all kinds of sustenance emanate, coming from the source, which is the infinite&quot;.

Keter, although being the highest Sephirah of its world, receives from the Sephirah of [[Malkuth]] of the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|domain]] above it (see [[Sephirot]]). The uppermost Keter sits below no other Sephirah, although it is below [[Ein Soph|Or Ein Soph]] which is the source of all Sephirot.

[[Da'at]] and Keter are the same Sephirah from two different aspects. From one aspect this Sephirah is referred to Keter and from another aspect it is referred to as Da'at. Therefore when Da'at is counted then Keter is not counted and when Keter is counted Da'at is not counted{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

====The School in Lurianic thought====

Isaac Luria introduced three central themes into kabbalistic thought (also known as ''Lurianic Kabbalah''), Tzimtzum, Shevirat HaKelim (the shattering of the vessels), and Tikkun (repair). These three are a group of interrelated, and continuing, processes. Tzimzum describes the first step in the process by which God began the process of creation by withdrawing his own essence from an area, creating an area in which creation could begin. Shevirat HaKelim describes how, after the Tzimtzum, God created the vessels (HaKelim) in the empty space, and how when God began to pour his Light into the vessels they were not strong enough to hold the power of God's Light and shattered (Shevirat). The third step, Tikkun, is the process of gathering together, and raising, the sparks of God's Light that were carried down with the shards of the shattered vessels.[2]

Since Tzimtzum is connected to the concept of exile, and Tikkun is connected to the need to repair the problems of the world of human existence, Luria unites the cosmology of Kabbalah with the practice of Jewish ethics, and makes ethics and traditional Jewish religious observance the means by which God allows humans to complete and perfect the material world through living the precepts of a traditional Jewish life.[3]
Inherent paradox

A commonly held [4] understanding in Kabbalah is that the concept of Tzimtzum contains a built-in paradox, requiring that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent.

On the one hand, if the &quot;Infinite&quot; did not restrict itself, then nothing could exist—everything would be overwhelmed by God's totality. Thus existence requires God's transcendence, as above.

On the other hand, God continuously maintains the existence of, and is thus not absent from, the created universe. &quot;The Divine life-force which brings all creatures into existence must constantly be present within them... were this life-force to forsake any created being for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation...&quot; [5]. This understanding is supported by various biblical teachings: &quot;You have made the heaven... the earth and all that is on it... and You give life to them all&quot; (Nehemiah 9:6); &quot;All the earth is filled with God's Glory&quot; (Numbers 14:21); &quot;God's Glory fills the world&quot; (Isaiah 6:3). Creation therefore requires God's immanence.

Rabbi Nachman of Breslav discusses this inherent paradox as follows:
“ 	Only in the future will it be possible to understand the Tzimtzum that brought the 'Empty Space' into being, for we have to say of it two contradictory things... [1] the Empty Space came about through the Tzimtzum, where, as it were, He 'limited' His Godliness and contracted it from there, and it is as though in that place there is no Godliness... [2] the absolute truth is that Godliness must nevertheless be present there, for certainly nothing can exist without His giving it life. (Likkutei Moharan I, 64:1) 	”

This paradox is strengthened by reference to the closely related doctrine of divine simplicity, which holds that God is absolutely simple, containing no element of form or structure whatsoever. This gives rise to two difficulties. Firstly, according to this doctrine, it is impossible for God to shrink or expand (physically or metaphorically)—an obvious contradiction to the above. Secondly, according to this doctrine, if God's creative will is present, then He must be present in total—whereas the Tzimtzum, on the other hand, results in, and requires, a &quot;partial Presence&quot; as above.

The paradox has an additional aspect, in that the Tzimtzum results in a perception of the world being imperfect despite God's omniperfect Presence being everywhere. As a result, some Kabbalists saw the Tzimtzum as a cosmic illusion.
Chabad view

In Chabad Hassidism, on the other hand, the concept of Tzimtzum is understood as not meant to be interpreted literally, but rather to refer to the manner in which God impresses His presence upon the consciousness of finite reality [2]: thus tzimtzum is not only seen as being a real process but is also seen as a doctrine that every person is able, and indeed required, to understand and meditate upon.

In the Chabad view, the function of the Tzimtzum was &quot;to conceal from created beings the activating force within them, enabling them to exist as tangible entities, instead of being utterly nullified within their source&quot; [6]. The tzimtzum produced the required &quot;vacated space&quot; (chalal panui חלל פנוי, chalal חלל), devoid of direct awareness of God's presence.

Here Chassidut sheds light on the concept of Tzimtzum via the analogy of a person and his speech. (The source of this analogy is essentially Genesis Chapter 1, where God &quot;spoke&quot; to create heaven and earth.):

In order to communicate, a person must put aside all that he knows, all his experiences, and all that he is, and say only one thing (&quot;the contraction&quot;). This is especially the case when we speak of an educator, whose level of mind and understanding is almost completely removed and incomparable to his student, that has to &quot;find&quot; an idea that is simple enough to convey to the student. However, when he goes through this process and now is choosing to express himself through this particular utterance, he has not in any way lost or forgotten all the knowledge of who he really is (&quot;thus the contraction is not a literal contraction&quot;).

(Furthermore, the one who hears his words also has the full revelation of who that person is when he hears those words, though he may not realize it. If the listener understood the language and was sensitive enough, he would be able to pull out from those words everything there is to know about the person.)

So too, God chose to express Himself through this world with all of its limitations. However, this does not mean, as pantheism posits, that God is limited to this particular form, or that God has &quot;forgotten&quot; all He can do. He still &quot;remembers what He really is&quot;, meaning that He remains always in His infinite essence, but is choosing to reveal only this particular aspect of Himself. The act of Tzimtzum is thus how God &quot;puts aside&quot; His infinite light, and allows for an &quot;empty space&quot;, void of any indication of the Divine Presence. He then can reveal a limited finite aspect of his light (namely our imperfect, finite reality).

(As clarified before, if man were spiritually sensitive enough, we would be able to see how God is truly giving us a full revelation of His infinite self through the medium of this world. To a listener who does not understand the language being spoken, the letters are &quot;empty&quot; of any revelation of the person. In the analogue this means that the world looks to us to be &quot;empty&quot; of Godly revelation. Kaballah and Chassidus, however, teaches one how to meditate in order to be able to understand God's &quot;language&quot; so that one can see the Godly revelation in every aspect of creation.)

Therefore, no paradox exists. The finite Godly light that is immanent within the universe, constantly creating and vivifying it, is only a &quot;faint glimmer of a glimmer of a glimmer&quot; (Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, Chapter 20) of God's infinite, transcendent light that has been completely concealed by tzimtzum. (See also Dovber Schneuri, Ner Mitzva Vetorah Or, Kehot Publication Society. ISBN 0-8266-5496-7.)
Vilna Gaon's view

The Gaon held that tzimtzum was not literal, however, the &quot;upper unity&quot;, the fact that the universe is only illusory, and that tzimtzum was only figurative, was not perceptible, or even really understandable, to those not fully initiated in the mysteries of Kabbalah.[7][8]

The Leshem articulates this view clearly (and claims that not only is it the opinion of the Vilna Gaon, but also is the straightforward and simple reading of Luria and is the only true understanding).

He writes:
''“I have also seen some very strange things in the words of some contemporary kabbalists who explain things deeply. They say that all of existence is only an illusion and appearance, and does not truly exist. This is to say that the ein sof didn’t change at all in itself and its necessary true existence and it is now still exactly the same as it was before creation, and there is no space empty of Him, as is known (see Nefesh Ha-Chaim Shaar 3). Therefore they said that in truth there is no reality to existence at all, and all the worlds are only an illusion and appearance, just as it says in the verse “in the hands of the prophets I will appear” (Hoshea 12: 11). They said that the world and humanity have no real existence, and their entire reality is only an appearance. We perceive ourselves as if we are in a world, and we perceive ourselves with our senses, and we perceive the world with our senses. It turns out [according to this opinion] that all of existence of humanity and the world is only 
a perception and not in true reality, for it is impossible for anything to exist in true reality, since He fills all the worlds…. How strange and bitter is it to say such a thing. Woe to us from such an opinion. They don’t think and they don’t see that with such opinions they are destroying the truth of the entire Torah….[9]&quot;''

However, the Gaon and the Leshem held that tzimtzum only took place in God's Will (Ratzon), but that it is impossible to say anything at all about God Himself (Atzmut). Thus, they did not actually believe in a literal Tzimtzum in God's Essence.[citation needed] Luria's Etz Chaim itself, however, in the First Shaar, is ambivalent: in one place it speaks of a literal tzimtzum in God's Essence and Self, then it changes a few lines later to a tzimtzum in the Divine Light (an emanated, hence created and not part of God's Self, energy).[citation needed]

==Time==

physics in theoretical science

The B-theory of time is a term, given to one of two positions taken by theorists, in the philosophy of time. The labels, A-theory and B-theory, are derived from the analysis of time and change developed by Cambridge philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart in The Unreality of Time, in which events are ordered via a tensed A-series or a tenseless B-series.

Events (or 'times'), McTaggart observed, may be characterized in two distinct, but related, ways. On the one hand they can be characterized as past, present or future, normally indicated in natural languages such as English by the verbal inflection of tenses or auxiliary adverbial modifiers. Alternatively events may be described as earlier than, simultaneous with, or later than others. Philosophers are divided as to whether the tensed or tenseless mode of expressing temporal fact is fundamental. Those who (like Arthur Prior[1]) take the tensed notions associated with the past, present and future to be the irreducible foundations of temporality and our conceptions of temporal fact, are called A-theorists (or presentists). A-theorists deny that past, present and future are equally real, and maintain that the future is not fixed and determinate like the past. Those who wish to eliminate all talk of past, present and future in favour of a tenseless ordering of events are called B-theorists. B-theorists (such as D.H. Mellor[2] and J.J.C. Smart[3]) believe that the past, the present, and the future are equally real.

The past, the present and the future feature vary differently in deliberation and reflection. We remember the past and anticipate the future, for example, but not vice versa. B-theorists maintain that the fact that we know much less about the future simply reflects an epistemological difference between the future and the past: the future is no less real than the past; we just know less about it (Mellor 1998). A view was held, for example by Quine and Putnam that physical theories such as special relativity, and latterly Quantum mechanics provide the B-theory with compelling support. [4] [5]

A-theorists on the other hand believe that a satisfactory account of time must acknowledge a fundamental metaphysical difference between past, present and future (Prior 2003). The difference between A-theorists and B-theorists is often described as a dispute about temporal passage or 'becoming'. B-theorists argue that this notion embodies serious confusion about time, while many A-theorists argue that in rejecting temporal 'becoming', B-theorists reject time's most vital and distinctive characteristic. It is common (though not universal) to identify A-theorists' views with belief in temporal passage.

It is also common (though not universal) for B-theorists to be four-dimensionalists, that is, to believe that objects are extended in time as well as in space and therefore have temporal as well as spatial parts. This is sometimes called a time-slice ontology (Clark, 1978).

The debate between A-theorists and B-theorists is a continuation of a metaphysical dispute reaching back to the ancient Greek philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides. Parmenides thought that reality is timeless and unchanging. Heraclitus, in contrast, believed that the world is a process of ceaseless change, flux and decay. Reality for Heraclitus is dynamic and ephemeral. Indeed the world is so fleeting, according to Heraclitus, that it is impossible to step twice into the same river. The metaphysical issues that continue to divide A-theorists and B-theorists concern the reality of the past, the reality of the future, and the ontological status of the present.

===space-time===

Building from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of spacetime have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the philosophy of physics. The following is a short list of topics.
The relativity of simultaneity

According to special relativity each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the Rietdijk-Putnam argument to demonstrate that relativity predicts a block universe in which events are fixed in four dimensions.

===Invariance vs. covariance===

Bringing to bear the lessons of the absolutism/relationalism debate with the powerful mathematical tools invented in the 19th and 20th century, Michael Friedman draws a distinction between invariance upon mathematical transformation and covariance upon transformation.

Invariance, or symmetry, applies to objects, i.e. the symmetry group of a space-time theory designates what features of objects are invariant, or absolute, and which are dynamical, or variable.

Covariance applies to formulations of theories, i.e. the covariance group designates in which range of coordinate systems the laws of physics hold.

This distinction can be illustrated by revisiting Leibniz's thought experiment, in which the universe is shifted over five feet. In this example the position of an object is seen not to be a property of that object, i.e. location is not invariant. Similarly, the covariance group for classical mechanics will be any coordinate systems that are obtained from one another by shifts in position as well as other translations allowed by a Galilean transformation.

In the classical case, the invariance, or symmetry, group and the covariance group coincide, but, interestingly enough, they part ways in relativistic physics. The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects. The formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations. As such the covariance group of the general theory of relativity is just the covariance group of every theory.

===Historical frameworks===

A further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language.

In these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a manifold paired with vector spaces, the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed.

For example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position, but not special positions. Galilean space and time has absolute acceleration, but not absolute position or velocity.
Holes

With the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether or not spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime substantivalism, offered by John Earman is known as the &quot;hole argument&quot;.

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function d as the identity function over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small neighbourhood H belonging to M. Over H d comes to differ from identity by a smooth function.

With use of this function d we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying d to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time t=0, where t is a time function created by a foliation of spacetime, but differ after t=0.

These considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism.

===The direction of time===

The problem of the direction of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant.[8] Glasses can fall and break, however shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.

===The causation solution===

One solution to this problem takes a metaphysical view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of causation. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effect that is our perception. We feel we can't affect the past and can affect the future because we can't affect the past and can affect the future.

There are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others.

However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features:- i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of &amp; what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other.

The application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general.

===The thermodynamics solution===
The second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics.

The answer from classical thermodynamics states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time-reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the second law of thermodynamics states that the net entropy of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together.

But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.

Current thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy.
The laws solution

A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.[citation needed]

One recent proponent of the laws solution is Tim Maudlin who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: &quot;[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past&quot; [ibid, 2010 edition, p. 108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.
The flow of time

The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart. In this paper McTaggart proposes two &quot;temporal series&quot;. The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other. The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than.

McTaggart, in his paper The Unreality of Time, argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it.

Building from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart's arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.

==Theology==
===Apophatic theology===
Apophatic theology (from Greek ἀπόφασις from ἀπόφημι – apophēmi, &quot;to deny&quot;)—also known as negative theology or via negativa (Latin for &quot;negative way&quot;)—is a theology that attempts to describe God, the Divine Good, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God.[1] It stands in contrast with cataphatic theology.

In brief, negative theology is an attempt to achieve unity with the Divine Good through discernment, gaining knowledge of what God is not (apophasis), rather than by describing what God is. The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which focuses on a spontaneous or cultivated individual experience of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception, an experience often unmediated by the structures of traditional organized religion or the conditioned role-playing and learned defensive behavior of the outer man.

Cataphatic (sometimes spelled kataphatic) theology is the expressing of God or the divine through positive terminology. This is in contrast to defining God or the divine in what God is not, which is referred to as negative or apophatic theology. The word cataphatic itself is formed from two Greek words, &quot;cata&quot; meaning to descend and &quot;phatos&quot; meaning to speak. Thus, to combine them translates the word roughly as &quot;to bring God down in such a way so as to speak of him.&quot;[1]

To speak of God or the divine cataphatically is thought by some to be by its nature a form of limiting to God or divine. This was one of the core tenets of the works of St Dionysus the Aeropagite. By defining what God or the divine is we limit the unlimited as Saint Dionysus outlined in his works. A kataphatic way to express God would be that God is love. The apophatic way would be to state that God is not hate (although such description can be accused of the same dualism). Or to say that God is not love, as he transcends even our notion of love. Ultimately, one would come to remove even the notion of the Trinity, or of saying that God is one, because The Divine is above numberhood. That God is beyond all duality because God contains within Godself all things and that God is beyond all things. The apophatic way as taught by Saint Dionysus was to remove any conceptual understanding of God that could become all-encompassing, since in its limitedness that concept would begin to force the fallen understanding of mankind onto the absolute and divine.
===Divine Simplicity===

In theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts. The general idea of divine simplicity can be stated in this way: the being of God is identical to the &quot;attributes&quot; of God. In other words, such characteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the heyday of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' Enneads as the Simplex [1].

====In Christian thought====

In Christian theism (to be accurate &quot;Classical theism&quot;), God is simple, not composite, not made up of thing upon thing. In other words, the characteristics of God are not parts of God that together make up God. Because God is simple, God is those characteristics; for example, God does not have goodness, but simply is goodness. For typical Christian theologians, divine simplicity does not entail that the attributes of God are indistinguishable to thought. It is no contradiction of the doctrine to say, for example, that God is both just and merciful. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, in whose system of thought the idea of divine simplicity is central, wrote in Summa Theologica that because God is infinitely simple, God can only appear to the finite mind as infinitely complex.[citation needed]

Theologians holding the doctrine of simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of God by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it. Thus, in quantitative or spatial terms, God is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces, present in entirety everywhere, if in fact present anywhere. In terms of essences, God is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter, or body and soul, or mind and act, and so on: if distinctions are made when speaking of God's attributes, they are distinctions of the &quot;modes&quot; of God's being, rather than real or essential divisions. And so, in terms of subjects and accidents, as in the phrase &quot;goodness of God&quot;, divine simplicity allows that there is a conceptual distinction between the person of God and the personal attribute of goodness, but the doctrine disallows that God's identity or &quot;character&quot; is dependent upon goodness, and at the same time the doctrine dictates that it is impossible to consider the goodness in which God participates separately from the goodness which God is.

Furthermore, according to some, if as creatures our concepts are all drawn from the creation, it follows from this and divine simplicity that God's attributes can only be spoken of by analogy — since it is not true of any created thing that its properties are identical to its being. Consequently, when Christian Scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity, when it says that God is good for example, it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech. Since God's essence is inexpressible; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to God who simply is goodness, because humanity is a complex being composed by God &quot;in the image and likeness of God&quot;. The doctrine aides, then, in interpreting the Scriptures so as to avoid paradox—as when Scripture says, for example, that the creation is &quot;very good&quot;, and also that &quot;none is good but God alone&quot;—since only God is goodness, while nevertheless humanity is created in the likeness of goodness (and the likeness is necessarily imperfect in humanity, unless that person is also God). This doctrine also helps keep trinitarianism from drifting into tritheism, which is the belief in three different gods: the persons of God are not parts or essential differences, but are rather the way in which the one God exists personally.

The doctrine has been criticized by some Christian theologians, including Alvin Plantinga, who in his essay Does God Have a Nature? calls it &quot;a dark saying indeed.&quot;[2] Plantinga's criticism is based on his interpretation of Aquinas's discussion of it, from which he concludes that if God is identical with properties of God such as goodness etc., then God is a property; and a property is not a person. Plantinga concludes that divine simplicity does not do justice to the personal nature of the Christian God.[3]

====In Jewish thought====

In Jewish philosophy and in Jewish mysticism Divine Simplicity is addressed via discussion of the attributes (תארים) of God, particularly by Jewish philosophers within the Muslim sphere of influence such as Saadia Gaon, Bahya ibn Paquda, Yehuda Halevi, and Maimonides, as well by Raabad III in Provence.

Some identify Divine simplicity as a corollary of Divine Creation: &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1). God, as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property (and hence an absolute unity); see Negative theology.

For others, conversely, the axiom of Divine Unity (see Shema Yisrael) informs the understanding of Divine Simplicity. Bahya ibn Paquda (Duties of the Heart 1:8) points out that God's Oneness is &quot;true oneness&quot; (האחד האמת) as opposed to merely &quot;circumstantial oneness&quot; (האחד המקרי). He develops this idea to show that an entity which is truly one must be free of properties and thus indescribable - and unlike anything else. (Additionally such an entity would be absolutely unsubject to change, as well as utterly independent and the root of everything.) [1]

The implication - of either approach - is so strong that the two concepts are often presented as synonymous: &quot;God is not two or more entities, but a single entity of a oneness even more single and unique than any single thing in creation… He cannot be sub-divided into different parts — therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one. It is a positive commandment to know this, for it is written (Deuteronomy 6:4) '…the Lord is our God, the Lord is one'.&quot; (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Mada 1:7.)

Despite its apparent simplicity, this concept is recognised as raising many difficulties. In particular, insofar as God's simplicity does not allow for any structure — even conceptually — Divine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy.

On the one hand, God is absolutely simple, containing no element of form or structure, as above.

On the other hand, it is understood that God's essence contains every possible element of perfection: &quot;The First Foundation is to believe in the existence of the Creator, blessed be He. This means that there exists a Being that is perfect (complete) in all ways and He is the cause of all else that exists.&quot; (Maimonides 13 principles of faith, First Principle).

The resultant paradox is famously articulated by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (Derekh Hashem I:1:5), describing the dichotomy as arising out of our inability to comprehend the idea of absolute unity:
“God’s existence is absolutely simple, without combinations or additions of any kind. All perfections are found in Him in a perfectly simple manner. However, God does not entail separate domains — even though in truth there exist in God qualities which, within us, are separate… Indeed the true nature of His essence is that it is a single attribute, (yet) one that intrinsically encompasses everything that could be considered perfection. All perfection therefore exists in God, not as something added on to His existence, but as an integral part of His intrinsic identity… This is a concept that is very far from our ability to grasp and imagine…”

The Kabbalists address this paradox by explaining that “God created a spiritual dimension… [through which God] interacts with the Universe... It is this dimension which makes it possible for us to speak of God’s multifaceted relationship to the universe without violating the basic principle of His unity and simplicity” (Aryeh Kaplan, Innerspace). The Kabbalistic approach is explained in various Chassidic writings; see for example, Shaar Hayichud, below, for a detailed discussion.

===free will===

====Overview of the antinomy====

The theological doctrine of divine foreknowledge is often alleged to be in conflict with free will, particularly in Calvinistic circles. For if God knows exactly what will happen (right down to every choice a person makes) it would seem the &quot;freedom&quot; of these choices is called into question.[1]

This problem is related to the Aristotelian problem of the sea battle: tomorrow either there will or will not be a sea battle. According to the Law of excluded middle, there seems to be two options. If there will be sea battle, then it seems that it was true even yesterday that there would be one. Thus it is necessary that the sea battle will occur . If there won't be one, then by similar reasoning, it is necessary that it won't occur.[2] This means that the future, whatever it is, is completely fixed by past truths—true propositions about the future (i.e. we reach a deterministic conclusion: things could not have been any other way).

However, some philosophers follow William of Ockham in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.[3] Some philosophers follow Philo of Alexandria, a philosopher known for his homocentrism, in holding that free will is a feature of a human's soul, and thus that non-human animals lack free will.[4]
Common defenses

Jewish philosophy stresses that free will is a product of the intrinsic human soul, using the word neshama (from the Hebrew rootn.sh.m. or .נ.ש.מ meaning &quot;breath&quot;), but the ability to make a free choice is through Yechida (from Hebrew word &quot;yachid&quot;, יחיד, singular), the part of the soul that is united with God, the only being that is not hindered by or dependent on cause and effect (thus, freedom of will does not belong to the realm of the physical reality, and inability of natural philosophy to account for it is expected).

In Islam the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's &quot;jabr,&quot; or divine commanding power. al-Ash'ari developed an &quot;acquisition&quot; or &quot;dual-agency&quot; form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine jabr were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant Ash'ari position.[5] In Shia Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward predestination is challenged by most theologists.[6] Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. All actions taken by man's free will are said to be counted on the Day of Judgement because they are his/her own and not God's.

The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.[7] As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because &quot;the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free.&quot;[8] Alvin Plantinga's &quot;free will defense&quot; is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and evil are consistent.[9]
In Christian thought

====History of Calvinist–Arminian debate====

In Christian theology, God is described as omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent; a notion which some people, Christians and non-Christians alike, believe implies that not only has God always known what choices individuals will make tomorrow, but has actually determined those choices. That is, they believe, by virtue of his foreknowledge he knows what will influence individual choices, and by virtue of his omnipotence he controls those factors. This becomes especially important for the doctrines relating to salvation and predestination.
In Arminianism

Christians influenced by Jacobus Arminius, such as Methodists, believe that while God is all-knowning and always knows what choices each person will make, he still gives them the ability to choose (or not choose) everything, regardless of whether there are any internal or external factors contributing to that choice. Like John Calvin, Arminius affirmed total depravity, but Arminius believed that only prevenient grace allowed men to choose salvation:

Concerning grace and free will, this is what I teach according to the Scriptures and orthodox consent: Free will is unable to begin or to perfect any true and spiritual good, without grace.... This grace [prœvenit] goes before, accompanies, and follows; it excites, assists, operates that we will, and co operates lest we will in vain.[10]

Prevenient grace is divine grace which precedes human decision. It exists prior to and without reference to anything humans may have done. As humans are corrupted by the effects of sin, prevenient grace allows persons to engage their God-given free will to choose the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ or to reject that salvific offer.

Thomas Jay Oord offers perhaps the most cogent free will theology presupposing prevenient grace. What he calls &quot;essential kenosis&quot; says God acts preveniently to give freedom/agency to all creatures. This gift comes from God's eternal essence, and is therefore necessary. God remains free in choosing how to love, but the fact that God loves and therefore gives freedom/agency to others is a necessary part of what it means to be divine.
In Lutheranism

[11] Lutherans believe that although humans have free will concerning civil righteousness, they cannot work spiritual righteousness without the Holy Spirit, since righteousness in the heart cannot be wrought in the absence of the Holy Spirit.[12] In other words, humanity is free to choose and act in every regard except for the choice of salvation.

Lutherans teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly &quot;good,&quot; are not capable of doing works that satisfy God's justice.[13] Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and sinful motives.[14]

Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom.[15][16] Consequently, people are saddled with original sin, born sinful and unable to avoid committing sinful acts.[17] For Lutherans, original sin is the &quot;chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins.&quot;[18]

According to Lutherans, God preserves his creation, in doing so cooperates with everything that happens, and guides the universe.[19] While God cooperates with both good and evil deeds, with evil deeds he does so only inasmuch as they are deeds, but not with the evil in them. God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect.[20] Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.[21]

Lutherans believe that the elect are predestined to salvation.[22] Lutherans believe Christians should be assured that they are among the predestined.[23] Lutherans believe that all who trust in Jesus alone can be certain of their salvation, for it is in Christ's work and his promises in which their certainty lies.[24] According to Lutheranism, the central final hope of the Christian is &quot;the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting&quot; as confessed in the Apostles' Creed rather than predestination. Conversion or regeneration in the strict sense of the term is the work of divine grace[25] and power[26] by which man, born of the flesh,[27] and void of all power to think,[28] to will,[29] or to do[30] any good thing, and dead in sin[31] is, through the gospel and holy baptism,[32] taken[33] from a state of sin and spiritual death under God's wrath[34] into a state of spiritual life of faith and grace,[35] rendered able to will and to do what is spiritually good[36] and, especially, led to accept the benefits of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.[37]

Lutherans disagree with those that make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Lutherans reject the Calvinist doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. Like both Calvinist camps, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in that &quot;the natural [that is, corrupted and divinely unrenewed] powers of man cannot do anything or help towards salvation&quot; (Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71), and Lutherans go further along the same lines as the Free Grace advocates to say that the recipient of saving grace need not cooperate with it. Hence, Lutherans believe that a true Christian (that is, a genuine recipient of saving grace) can lose his or her salvation, &quot;[b]ut the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work... [but that these persons] wilfully turn away...&quot; (Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. xi, par. 42). Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.[38] Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.[39]
In Calvinism

Calvinist Protestants embrace the idea that God chose who would be saved and who would be not saved prior to the creation. They quote Ephesians 1:4 &quot;For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight&quot; and also 2:8 &quot;For it is by grace you are saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.&quot; One of the strongest defenders of this theological point of view was the American Puritan preacher and theologian Jonathan Edwards.

Edwards believed that indeterminism was incompatible with individual dependence on God and hence with his sovereignty. He reasoned that if individuals' responses to God's grace are contra-causally free, then their salvation depends partly on them and therefore God's sovereignty is not &quot;absolute and universal.&quot; Edwards' book Freedom of the Will defends theological determinism. In this book, Edwards attempts to show that libertarianism is incoherent. For example, he argues that by 'self-determination' the libertarian must mean either that one's actions including one's acts of willing are preceded by an act of free will or that one's acts of will lack sufficient causes. The first leads to an infinite regress while the second implies that acts of will happen accidentally and hence can't make someone &quot;better or worse, any more than a tree is better than other trees because it oftener happens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale; or a rock more vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have happened oftener to crawl over it.&quot; [40]

It should not be thought that this view completely denies freedom of choice, however. It claims that man is free to act on his strongest moral impulse and volition, which is externally determined, but is not free to act contrary to them, or to alter them. Proponents, such as John L. Girardeau, have indicated their belief that moral neutrality is impossible; that even if it were possible, and one were equally inclined to contrary options, one could make no choice at all; that if one is inclined, however slightly, toward one option, then that person will necessarily choose that one over any others.

Some non-Calvinist Christians attempt a reconciliation of the dual concepts of predestination and free will by pointing to the situation of God as Christ. In taking the form of a man, a necessary element of this process was that Jesus Christ lived the existence of a mortal. When Jesus was born he was not born with the omniscient power of God the Creator, but with the mind of a human child - yet he was still God in essence. The precedent this creates is that God is able to will the abandonment of His knowledge, or ignore knowledge, while remaining fully God. Thus it is not inconceivable that although omniscience demands that God knows what the future holds for individuals, it is within his power to deny this knowledge in order to preserve individual free will. Other theologians argue that the Calvinist-Edwardsean view suggests that if all human volitions are predetermined by God, then all actions dictated by fallen will of man necessarily satisfy His sovereign decree. Hence, it is impossible to act outside of God's perfect will, a conclusion some non-Calvinists claim poses a serious problem for ethics and moral theology.

An early proposal toward such a reconciliation states that God is, in fact, not aware of future events, but rather, being eternal, He is outside time, and sees the past, present, and future as one whole creation. Consequently, it is not as though God would know &quot;in advance&quot; that Jeffrey Dahmer would become guilty of homicide years prior to the event as an example, but that He was aware of it from all eternity, viewing all time as a single present. This was the view offered by Boëthius in Book V of the Consolation of Philosophy.

Calvinist theologian Loraine Boettner argued that the doctrine of divine foreknowledge does not escape the alleged problems of divine foreordination. He wrote that &quot;what God foreknows must, in the very nature of the case, be as fixed and certain as what is foreordained; and if one is inconsistent with the free agency of man, the other is also. Foreordination renders the events certain, while foreknowledge presupposes that they are certain.&quot;[8] Some Christian theologians, feeling the bite of this argument, have opted to limit the doctrine of foreknowledge if not do away with it altogether, thus forming a new school of thought, similar to Socinianism and process theology, called open theism.

====In Catholicism====

Theologians of the Catholic Church universally embrace the idea of free will, but generally do not view free will as existing apart from or in contradiction to grace. St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas wrote extensively on free will, with Augustine focusing on the importance of free will in his responses to the Manichaeans, and also on the limitations of a concept of unlimited free will as denial of grace, in his refutations of Pelagius.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church suggests that &quot;Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will&quot;.[42] It goes on to say that &quot;God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. &quot;God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him.&quot;&quot;[43] The section concludes with the role that grace plays, &quot;By the working of grace the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world.&quot;[44]

Catholic Christianity views on free will and grace are often contrasted with predestination in Reformed Protestant Christianity, especially after the Counter-Reformation, but in understanding differing conceptions of free will it is just as important to understand the differing conceptions of the nature of God, focusing on the idea that God can be all-powerful and all-knowing even while people continue to exercise free will, because God does not exist in time.

Edward Schillebeeckx in his book:&quot;Mensen als verhaal van God&quot; states, &quot;Daring to call human beings to life creatively is from God's perspective a vote of confidence in humankind and in its history, without any condition being placed on human beings or any guarantee being asked of them. The creation of human beings is a blank check for which God alone is a guarantor. By creating human beings with their own finite and free will, God voluntarily renounces power. That makes [God] to a high degree dependent on human beings and vulnerable.&quot;[45] Schillebeeckx’s claim that this view of God's power as &quot;non-authoritarian, vulnerable, even helpless&quot; should serve as a model for how ministerial authority is to be exercised in the church.[46] (Church: The Human Story of God, 221; Mensen als verhaal van God, 239) is intended as a critique of an authoritarian exercise of leadership by those in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. That model of ministerial authority, particularly in the English translation, is problematic, especially for women, who have been characterized as &quot;vulnerable&quot; and even at times &quot;helpless,&quot; and who are prevented structurally from exercising authority in relation to word and sacrament. A more adequate expression of Jesus' exercise of authority is reflected in Schillebeeckx's citation from Aquinas: &quot;The power and rule of Christ over human beings is exercised by truth, justice and above all love.&quot; (III Sent., d. 13, q. 2; ST III, q. 8 and q. 59, a. 4).]
In Eastern Christianity
Oriental Orthodox

The concept of free will is also very important in the Oriental Orthodox Churches, especially in the Coptic affiliated ones. As in Judaism, free will is regarded as axiomatic. Everyone is regarded as having a free choice as to in what measure he or she will follow his or her conscience or arrogance, these two having been appointed for each individual. The more one follows one's conscience, the more it brings one good results, and the more one follows one's arrogance, the more it brings one bad results. Following only one's arrogance is sometimes likened to the dangers of falling into a pit while walking in pitch darkness, without the light of conscience to illuminate the path. Very similar doctrines have also found written expression in the Dead Sea Scrolls &quot;Manual of Discipline&quot;, and in some religious texts possessed by the Beta Israel Jews of Ethiopia.
Eastern Orthodox

Eastern Orthodox Church holds a view different from the Calvinist, Arminian, and Lutheran ones. The difference is in the interpretation of the Original sin, where the Eastern Orthodox do not believe in Total depravity. The Orthodox do not accept the Pelagian view that the original sin did not damage human nature, they accept that the human nature is depraved, but not totally, and they avoid calling it &quot;depraved&quot; preferring &quot;fallen nature&quot;.

Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. The first who defined this teaching was John Cassian, 4th century Church Father, and a pupil of John Chrysostom, and all Eastern Fathers accept it. He taught that &quot;Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God&quot;, and that &quot;Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.&quot;.

Some Orthodox use the parable of a drowning man to plainly illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, pulls him up, saving him, and the man, if he wants to be saved, must hold on tightly to the rope; explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself, and that man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

Dostoevsky (an Eastern Orthodox Christian) the novelist suggested many arguments for and against free will. Famous arguments are the Grand Inquisitor, Notes from Underground and the argument that suicide, if chosen out of the irrational, was validation of freewill (see Kirilov in the Demons) novel. As for the argument presented in The Brothers Karamazov's section &quot;The Rebellion&quot; that the suffering of innocents was not worth the price of freewill, Dostoevsky appears to propose the idea of Apocatastasis as one possible rational solution.

====Roman Catholic teaching====

Illustrating as it does that the human part in salvation (represented by holding on to the rope) must be preceded and accompanied by grace (represented by the casting and drawing of the rope), the image of the drowning man holding on to the rope cast and drawn by his rescuer corresponds closely to Catholic teaching, which holds that God, who &quot;destined us in love to be his sons&quot; and &quot;to be conformed to the image of his Son&quot;,[47] includes in his eternal plan of &quot;predestination&quot; each person's free response to his grace.[48]

The Catholic Church holds to the teaching that &quot;by free will, (the human person) is capable of directing himself toward his true good … man is endowed with freedom, an outstanding manifestation of the divine image'.&quot;[49] Man has free will either to accept or reject the grace of God, so that for salvation &quot;there is a kind of interplay, or synergy, between human freedom and divine grace&quot;.[50] &quot;Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent: 'When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God's sight' (Council of Trent).&quot;[51]

God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration.[52] For Catholics, therefore, human cooperation with grace is essential.[53] When God establishes his eternal plan of 'predestination', he includes in it each person's free response to his grace, whether it is positive or negative: &quot;In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place&quot; (Acts 4:27-28).[54]

The initiative comes from God,[55] but it demands a free response from man: &quot;God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration&quot;.[52] &quot;Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life.&quot;;[56] Orthodox criticism of Catholic doctrine

Orthodox theologian Vladimir Lossky has stated that the teaching of John Cassian, who in the East is considered a witness to tradition, but who &quot;was unable to make himself correctly understood&quot;, &quot;was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West&quot;.[57] Where the Catholic Church defends the concept of faith and free will these are questioned in the East by the conclusions of the Second Council of Orange. This council is not accepted by the Eastern churches and the Catholic Church's use[not in citation given][58] of describing their position and St Cassian as Semi-Pelagian is also rejected.[59]

Although the Roman Catholic Church explicitly teaches that &quot;original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants&quot;,[60] some Eastern Orthodox nevertheless claim that Roman Catholicism professes the teaching, which they attribute to Saint Augustine, that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt of Adam's sin.[61][62]
Differences of view between Catholic and Orthodox Churches

Various Roman Catholic theologians identify Cassian as a teacher of the Semi-Pelagian heresy which was condemned by the Council of Orange.[63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71] While the Orthodox do not apply the term Semi-Pelagian to their theology, they criticize the Catholics for rejecting Cassian whom they accept as fully orthodox,[72] and for holding that human consent to God's justifying action is itself an effect of grace,[73] a position shared by Eastern Orthodox theologian Georges Florovsky, who says that the Eastern Orthodox Church &quot;always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation&quot;, rejecting instead the Calvinist idea of irresistible grace.[74]

Recently, some Catholic theologians have argued that Cassian's writings should not be considered Semi-Pelagian.[citation needed] And scholars of other denominations too have concluded that Cassian's thought &quot;is not Semi-Pelagian&quot;,[75] and that he instead taught that &quot;salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace&quot;[75] and held that &quot;God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' - even faith.&quot;[76]

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. Once baptised the experience of his salvation and relationship with God is called theosis. Mankind has free will to accept or reject the grace of God. Rejection of the gifts of God is called blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (gifts of grace, faith, life).[77][78] The first who defined this teaching was John Cassian, 4th-century Church Father, and a pupil of John Chrysostom, and all Eastern Fathers accept it. He taught that &quot;Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God&quot;, and that &quot;Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.&quot;.[citation needed]

Some Orthodox use the parable of a drowning man to plainly illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, pulls him up, saving him, and the man. If he wants to be saved, man must hold on tightly to the rope. Explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself. That man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation. As God does not predestine persons to eternal life, rather because he is God, he can see who will ultimately choose or not choose to follow him.
In the LDS (Mormon) Church
Main article: Agency (LDS Church)

Mormons or Latter-day Saints, believe that God has given all humans the gift of moral agency. Moral agency includes free will and agency. Proper exercise of unfettered choice leads to the ultimate goal of returning to God's presence. Having the choice to do right or wrong was important, because God wants a society of a certain type—those that comply with eternal laws. Before this Earth was created, this dispute over agency rose to the level that there was a &quot;war in heaven.&quot; Lucifer (who favored no agency) and his followers were cast out of heaven for rebelling against God's will. Many Mormon leaders have also taught that the battle in Heaven over agency is now being carried out on earth[citation needed], where dictators, influenced by Satan, fight against freedom (or free agency) in governments contrary to the will of God.

Mormons also believe in a limited form of foreordination — not in deterministic, unalterable decrees, but rather in callings from God for individuals to perform specific missions in mortality. Those who are foreordained can reject the foreordination, either outright or by transgressing the laws of God and becoming unworthy to fulfill the call.
In the New Church

The New Church, or Swedenborgianism, teaches that every person has complete freedom to choose heaven or hell. Emanuel Swedenborg, upon whose writings the New Church is founded, argued that if God is love itself, people must have free will. If God is love itself, then He desires no harm to come to anyone: and so it is impossible that he would predestine anyone to hell. On the other hand, if God is love itself, then He must love things outside of Himself; and if people do not have the freedom to choose evil, they are simply extensions of God, and He cannot love them as something outside of Himself. In addition, Swedenborg argues that if a person does not have free will to choose goodness and faith, then all of the commandments in the Bible to love God and the neighbor are worthless, since no one can choose to do them - and it is impossible that a God who is love itself and wisdom itself would give impossible commandments.
====Other views====

Free will is also a point of debate among both sides of the Christian communist theory. Because some Christians interpret the Bible as advocating that the ideal form of society is communism,[citation needed] opponents of this theory maintain that the establishment of a large-scale communist system would infringe upon the free will of individuals by denying them the freedom to make certain decisions for themselves.[citation needed] Christian communists adamantly oppose this by arguing that free will has and always will be limited to some extent by human laws.[citation needed]

====In Jewish thought====

The belief in free will (Hebrew: bechirah chofshit בחירה חפשית, bechirah בחירה) is axiomatic in Jewish thought, and is closely linked with the concept of reward and punishment, based on the Torah itself: &quot;I [God] have set before you life and death, blessing and curse: therefore choose life&quot; ( Deuteronomy 30:19).

Free will is therefore discussed at length in Jewish philosophy, firstly as regards God's purpose in creation, and secondly as regards the closely related, resultant, paradox. The topic is also often discussed in connection with Negative theology, Divine simplicity and Divine Providence, as well as Jewish principles of faith in general.

====Free will and creation====

The traditional teaching regarding the purpose of creation, particularly as influenced by Jewish mysticism, is that &quot;This world is like a corridor to the World to Come&quot; (Pirkei Avoth 4:16). &quot;Man was created for the sole purpose of rejoicing in God, and deriving pleasure from the splendor of His Presence… The place where this joy may truly be derived is the World to Come, which was expressly created to provide for it; but the path to the object of our desires is this world...&quot; (Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, Mesillat Yesharim, Ch.1). Free will is thus required by God's justice, “otherwise, Man would not be given or denied good for actions over which he had no control” [9].

It is further understood that in order for Man to have true free choice, he must not only have inner free will, but also an environment in which a choice between obedience and disobedience exists. God thus created the world such that both good and evil can operate freely [10]; this is the meaning of the Rabbinic maxim, &quot;All is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven&quot; (Talmud, Berachot 33b).
The paradox of free will

In Rabbinic literature, there is much discussion as to the apparent contradiction between God's omniscience and free will. The representative view is that &quot;Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given&quot; (Rabbi Akiva, Pirkei Avoth 3:15). Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a paradox, beyond our understanding.
“The Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows everything that will happen before it has happened. So does He know whether a particular person will be righteous or wicked, or not? If He does know, then it will be impossible for that person not to be righteous. If He knows that he will be righteous but that it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know everything that He has created. ...[T]he Holy One, Blessed Be He, does not have any temperaments and is outside such realms, unlike people, whose selves and temperaments are two separate things. God and His temperaments are one, and God's existence is beyond the comprehension of Man… [Thus] we do not have the capabilities to comprehend how the Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows all creations and events. [Nevertheless] know without doubt that people do what they want without the Holy One, Blessed Be He, forcing or decreeing upon them to do so... It has been said because of this that a man is judged according to all his actions. (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Teshuva 5:5 [79]) 	”

The paradox is explained, but not resolved, by observing that God exists outside of time, and therefore, his knowledge of the future is exactly the same as his knowledge of the past and present. Just as his knowledge of the past does not interfere with man's free will, neither does his knowledge of the future [11]. This distinction, between foreknowledge and predestination, is in fact discussed by Maimonides' critic Abraham ibn Daud; see Hasagat HaRABaD ad loc.

(One analogy here is that of time travel. The time traveller, having returned from the future, knows in advance what x will do, but while he knows what x will do, that knowledge does not cause x to do so: x had free will, even while the time traveller had foreknowledge; see [12]. However, one objection raised against this analogy – and ibn Daud’s distinction – is that if x truly has free will, he may choose to act otherwise when the event in question comes to pass, and therefore the time traveller (or God) merely has knowledge of a possible event: even having seen the event, there is no way to know with certainty what x will do; see the view of Gersonides below. Further, the presence of the time traveller, may have had some chaotic effect on x's circumstances and choice, absent when the event comes to pass in the present.)

=====Alternate approaches=====

Although the above discussion of the paradox represents the majority Rabbinic view, there are several major thinkers who resolve the issue by explicitly excluding human action from divine foreknowledge.

Both Saadia Gaon and Judah ha-Levi hold that &quot;the decisions of man precede God's knowledge&quot; [13]. Gersonides holds that God knows, beforehand, the choices open to each individual, but does not know which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make. Isaiah Horowitz takes the view that God cannot know which moral choices people will make, but that, nevertheless, this does not impair His perfection.

In line with this thinking, the teaching from Pirkei Avoth above, is then to be read as: &quot;Everything is observed (while - and no matter where - it happens), and (since the actor is unaware of being observed) free will is given &quot;.[80]


====In Kabbalistic thought====

The existence of free will, and the paradox above (as addressed by either approach), is closely linked to the concept of Tzimtzum. Tzimtzum entails the idea that God &quot;constricted&quot; his infinite essence, to allow for the existence of a &quot;conceptual space&quot; in which a finite, independent world could exist. This &quot;constriction&quot; made free will possible, and hence the potential to earn the World to Come.

Further, according to the first approach, it is understood that the Free-will Omniscience paradox provides a temporal parallel to the paradox inherent within Tzimtzum. In granting free will, God has somehow &quot;constricted&quot; his foreknowledge, to allow for Man's independent action; He thus has foreknowledge and yet free will exists. In the case of Tzimtzum, God has &quot;constricted&quot; his essence to allow for Man's independent existence; He is thus immanent and yet transcendent.
In Islamic thought
See also: Predestination in Islam

Disputes about free will in Islam began with the Mu'tazili vs Hanbali disputes,[81] with the Mu'tazili arguing that humans had &quot;qadar,&quot; the capacity to do right or wrong, and thus deserved the reward or punishment they received, whereas Hanbali insisted on God's &quot;jabr,&quot; or total power and initiative in managing all events.[82] Schools that developed around earlier thinkers such as Abu Hanifa and al-Ash'ari searched for ways to explain how both human qadar, and divine jabr could be asserted at the same time. Ash'ari develops a &quot;dual agency&quot; or &quot;acquisition&quot; account of free will in which every human action has two distinct agents. God creates the possibility of a human action with his divine jabr, but then the human follows through and &quot;acquires&quot; the act, making it theirs and taking responsibility for it using their human qadar.[83]

===In Jewish belief===
God is defined as the Creator of the universe: &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1); similarly, &quot;I am God, I make all things&quot; (Isaiah 44:24). God, as Creator, is by definition separate from the physical universe and thus exists outside of space and time. God is therefore absolutely different from anything else, and, as above, is in consequence held to be totally unknowable. It is for this reason that we cannot make any direct statements about God. (See Tzimtzum (צמצום): the notion that God &quot;contracted&quot; his infinite and indescribable essence in order to allow for a &quot;conceptual space&quot; in which a finite, independent world could exist.) [18]

Bahya ibn Paquda shows that our inability to describe God is similarly related to the fact of His absolute unity. God, as the entity which is &quot;truly One&quot; (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and indescribable; see Divine simplicity. This idea is developed fully in later Jewish philosophy, especially in the thought of the medieval rationalists such as Maimonides and Samuel ibn Tibbon.

It is understood that although we cannot describe God directly (מצד עצמו) it is possible to describe Him indirectly via His attributes (תארים). The “negative attributes” (תארים שוללים) relate to God Himself, and specify what He is not. The “attributes of action” (תארים מצד פעולותיו), on the other hand, do not describe God directly, rather His interaction with creation [2]. Maimonides was perhaps the first Jewish Thinker to explicitly articulate this doctrine (see also Tanya Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8):
“ 	God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive attribute... still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute whatever. The negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe... When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living — it is not dead; ...it is the first — its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will — it is not feeble or ignorant; He is One — there are not more Gods than one… Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself — and not of His actions — the negation of the opposite. (The Guide for the Perplexed, 1:58) 	”

In line with this formulation, attributes commonly used in describing God in rabbinic literature, in fact refer to the &quot;negative attributes&quot; — omniscience, for example, refers to non-ignorance; omnipotence to non-impotence; unity to non-plurality, eternity to non-temporality. Examples of the “attributes of action” are God as creator, revealer, redeemer, mighty and merciful [3]. Similarly, God’s perfection is generally considered an attribute of action. Joseph Albo (Ikkarim 2:24) points out that there are a number of attributes that fall under both categories simultaneously. Note that the various Names of God in Judaism, generally, correspond to the “attributes of action” — in that they represent God as he is known. The exceptions are the Tetragrammaton (Y-H-W-H) and the closely related &quot;I Am the One I Am&quot; (אהיה אשר אהיה — Exodus 3:13–14), both of which refer to God in his &quot;negative attributes&quot;, as absolutely independent and uncreated; see &quot;Names of God in Judaism&quot;.

Since two approaches are used to speak of God, there are times when these may conflict, giving rise to paradoxes in Jewish philosophy. In these cases, two descriptions of the same phenomenon appear contradictory, whereas, in fact, the difference is merely one of perspective: one description takes the viewpoint of the &quot;attributes of action&quot; and the other, of the &quot;negative attributes&quot;. See the paradoxes described under free will, Divine simplicity and Tzimtzum.

===metaphyics in theology===
According to al-Kindi, the goal of metaphysics is the knowledge of God. For this reason, he does make a clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.[12]

Central to al-Kindi's understanding of metaphysics is God's absolute oneness, which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God (and therefore not shared with anything else). By this he means that while we may think of any existent thing as being &quot;one&quot;, it is in fact both &quot;one&quot; and many&quot;. For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say &quot;I see an elephant&quot;, by which he means &quot;I see one elephant&quot;, but the term 'elephant' refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever. Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated to anything else, cannot be said about God.[31][32]

In addition to absolute oneness, al-Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts as both a final and efficient cause. Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed as a result of God's existence &quot;overflowing&quot;, which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as the agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him.[33] The key idea here is that God &quot;acts&quot; through created intermediaries, which in turn &quot;act&quot; on one another - through a chain of cause and effect - to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not &quot;act&quot; at all, they are merely a conduit for God's own action.[30] This is especially significant in the development of Islamic philosophy, as it portrayed the &quot;first cause&quot; and &quot;unmoved mover&quot; of Aristotelian philosophy as compatible with the concept of God according to Islamic revelation.[34]

Al-Kindi theorized that there was a separate, incorporeal and universal intellect (known as the &quot;First Intellect&quot;). It was the first of God's creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation. Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance, it was also crucial to al-Kindi's epistemology, which was influenced by Platonic realism.[35]

According to Plato, everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain universal forms in the heavenly realm. These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species, quality or relation, which apply to all physical objects and beings. For example, a red apple has the quality of &quot;redness&quot; derived from the appropriate universal. However, al-Kindi says that human intellects are only potentially able to comprehend these. This potential is actualized by the First Intellect, which is perpetually thinking about all of the universals. He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception. In other words, an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances. According to him, this will only yield an inferior &quot;sensible form&quot;, and not the universal form which we desire. The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect.[36]

The analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it. Therefore he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's &quot;acquired intellect&quot; and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.[37]

===Metaphysics and cosmology===

In contrast to al-Kindi, who considered the subject of metaphysics to be God, al-Farabi believed that it was concerned primarily with being qua being (that is, being in of itself), and this is related to God only to the extent that God is a principle of absolute being. Al-Kindi's view was, however, a common misconception regarding Greek philosophy amongst Muslim intellectuals at the time, and it was for this reason that Avicenna remarked that he did not understand Aristotle's Metaphysics properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-Farabi.[47]

Al-Farabi's cosmology is essentially based upon three pillars: Aristotelian metaphysics of causation, highly developed Plotinian emanational cosmology and the Ptolemaic astronomy.[48] In his model, the universe is viewed as a number of concentric circles; the outermost sphere or &quot;first heaven&quot;, the sphere of fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and finally, the Moon. At the centre of these concentric circles is the sub-lunar realm which contains the material world.[49] Each of these circles represent the domain of the secondary intelligences (symbolized by the celestial bodies themselves), which act as causal intermediaries between the First Cause (in this case, God) and the material world. Furthermore these are said to have emanated from God, who is both their formal and efficient cause. This departs radically from the view of Aristotle, who considered God to be solely a formal cause for the movement of the spheres, but by doing so it renders the model more compatible with the ideas of the theologians.[49]

The process of emanation begins (metaphysically, not temporally) with the First Cause, whose principal activity is self-contemplation. And it is this intellectual activity that underlies its role in the creation of the universe. The First Cause, by thinking of itself, &quot;overflows&quot; and the incorporeal entity of the second intellect &quot;emanates&quot; from it. Like its predecessor, the second intellect also thinks about itself, and thereby brings its celestial sphere (in this case, the sphere of fixed stars) into being, but in addition to this it must also contemplate upon the First Cause, and this causes the &quot;emanation&quot; of the next intellect. The cascade of emanation continues until it reaches the tenth intellect, beneath which is the material world. And as each intellect must contemplate both itself and an increasing number of predecessors, each succeeding level of existence becomes more and more complex. It should be noted that this process is based upon necessity as opposed to will. In other words, God does not have a choice whether or not to create the universe, but by virtue of His own existence, He causes it to be. This view also suggests that the universe is eternal, and both of these points were criticized by al-Ghazzali in his attack on the philosophers[50][51]

In his discussion of the First Cause (or God), al-Farabi relies heavily on negative theology. He says that it cannot be known by intellectual means, such as dialectical division or definition, because the terms used in these processes to define a thing constitute its substance. Therefore if one was to define the First Cause, each of the terms used would actually constitute a part of its substance and therefore behave as a cause for its existence, which is impossible as the First Cause is uncaused; it exists without being caused. Equally, he says it cannot be known according to genus and differentia, as its substance and existence are different from all others, and therefore it has no category to which it belongs. If this were the case, then it would not be the First Cause, because something would be prior in existence to it, which is also impossible. This would suggest that the more philosophically simple a thing is, the more perfect it is. And based on this observation, Adamson says it is possible to see the entire hierarchy of al-Farabi's cosmology according to classification into genus and species. Each succeeding level in this structure has as its principal qualities multiplicity and deficiency, and it is this ever-increasing complexity that typifies the material world.[52]
Epistemology and eschatology

Human beings are unique in al-Farabi's vision of the universe because they stand between two worlds: the &quot;higher&quot;, immaterial world of the celestial intellects and universal intelligibles, and the &quot;lower&quot;, material world of generation and decay; they inhabit a physical body, and so belong to the &quot;lower&quot; world, but they also have a rational capacity, which connects them to the &quot;higher&quot; realm. Each level of existence in al-Farabi's cosmology is characterized by its movement towards perfection, which is to become like the First Cause; a perfect intellect. Human perfection (or &quot;happiness&quot;), then, is equated with constant intellection and contemplation.[53]

Al-Farabi divides intellect into four categories: potential, actual, acquired and the Agent. The first three are the different states of the human intellect and the fourth is the Tenth Intellect (the moon) in his emanational cosmology. The potential intellect represents the capacity to think, which is shared by all human beings, and the actual intellect is an intellect engaged in the act of thinking. By thinking, al-Farabi means abstracting universal intelligibles from the sensory forms of objects which have been apprehended and retained in the individual's imagination.[54]

This motion from potentiality to actuality requires the Agent Intellect to act upon the retained sensory forms; just as the Sun illuminates the physical world to allow us to see, the Agent Intellect illuminates the world of intelligibles to allow us to think.[55] This illumination removes all accident (such as time, place, quality) and physicality from them, converting them into primary intelligibles, which are logical principles such as &quot;the whole is greater than the part&quot;. The human intellect, by its act of intellection, passes from potentiality to actuality, and as it gradually comprehends these intelligibles, it is identified with them (as according to Aristotle, by knowing something, the intellect becomes like it).[56] Because the Agent Intellect knows all of the intelligibles, this means that when the human intellect knows all of them, it becomes associated with the Agent Intellect's perfection and is known as the acquired Intellect.[57]

While this process seems mechanical, leaving little room for human choice or volition, Reisman says that al-Farabi is committed to human voluntarism.[56] This takes place when man, based on the knowledge he has acquired, decides whether to direct himself towards virtuous or unvirtuous activities, and thereby decides whether or not to seek true happiness. And it is by choosing what is ethical and contemplating about what constitutes the nature of ethics, that the actual intellect can become &quot;like&quot; the active intellect, thereby attaining perfection. It is only by this process that a human soul may survive death, and live on in the afterlife.[55][58]

According to al-Farabi, the afterlife is not the personal experience commonly conceived of by religious traditions such as Islam and Christianity. Any individual or distinguishing features of the soul are annihilated after the death of the body; only the rational faculty survives (and then, only if it has attained perfection), which becomes one with all other rational souls within the agent intellect and enters a realm of pure intelligence.[57] Henry Corbin compares this eschatology with that of the Ismaili Neo-Platonists, for whom this process initiated the next grand cycle of the universe.[59] However, Deborah Black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-Farabi, as later thinkers such as Ibn Tufayl, Averroes and Ibn Bajjah would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, which has been lost to modern experts.[57]

==Theosophy==
===Philosophy of Wujūd===

The Arabic-English dictionary defines ''wujūd'' (وجود) as presence, appearance; attendance; visiting

====Ibn Arabi====

Ibn Arabi is most often characterized in Islamic texts as the originator of the doctrine of wahdat al-wujud, however, this expression is not found in his works and the first who employed this term was perhaps, in fact, the Andalusian mystical thinker Ibn Sabin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|S.H. Nasr]] (2006), ''Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy'', State University of New York Press, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Although he frequently makes statements that approximate it, it cannot be claimed that &quot;Oneness of Being&quot; is a sufficient description of his ontology, since he affirms the &quot;manyness of reality&quot; with equal vigor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Imaginal worlds, William Chittick(1994), pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his view, wujūd is the unknowable and inaccessible ground of everything that exists.  God alone is true wujūd, while all things dwell in nonexistence, so also wujūd alone is nondelimited (mutlaq), while everything else is constrained, confined, and constricted. Wujūd is the absolute, infinite, nondelimited reality of God, while all others remain relative, finite, and delimited.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Imaginal worlds, William Chittick(1994), pg.53&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since wujūd is nondelimited, it is totally different from everything else. Whatever exists and can be known or grasped is a delimitation and definition, a constriction of the unlimited, a finite object accessible to a finite subject. In the same way, wujūd's self-consciousness is nondelimited, while every other consciousness is constrained and confined. But we need to be careful in asserting wujūd's nondelimitation. This must not be understood to mean that wujūd is different and only different from every delimitation. The Shaykh is quick to point out that wujūd's nondelimitation demands that it be able to assume every delimitation. If wujūd could not become delimited, it would be limited by its own nondelimitation. Thus &quot;He possesses nondelimitation in delimitation&quot; Or, &quot;God possesses nondelimited wujūd, but no delimitation prevents delimitation. Rather, He possesses all delimitations, so He is nondelimited delimitation, since no single delimitation rather than another rules over Him.... Hence nothing is to be attributed to Him in preference to anything else&quot; . Wujūd must have the power of assuming every delimitation on pain of being limited by those delimitations that it cannot assume. At the same time, it transcends the forms by which it becomes delimited and remains untouched by their constraints.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

Only He who possesses Being in Himself (wujûd dhâtî) and whose Being is His very essence (wujûduhu 'ayn dhâtihi), merits the name of Being. Only God can be like that.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/unityofbeing.html Souad Hakim - Unity of Being in Ibn 'Arabî&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the highest level, wujūd is the absolute and nondelimited reality of God, the &quot;Necessary Being&quot; (wājib al-wujūd) that cannot not exist. In this sense, wujūd designates the Essence of God or of the Real (dhāt al-haqq), the only reality that is real in every respect. On lower levels, wujūd is the underlying substance of &quot;everything other than God&quot; (mā siwā Allāh)—which is how Ibn Arabi and others define the &quot;cosmos&quot; or &quot;universe&quot; (al-'ālam). Hence, in a secondary meaning, the term wujūd is used as shorthand to refer to the whole cosmos, to everything that exists. It can also be employed to refer to the existence of each and every thing that is found in the universe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; 

God's 'names' (asma') or 'attributes' (sifat), on the other hand, are the relationships which can be discerned between the Essence and the cosmos. They are known to God because he knows every object of knowledge, but they are not existent entities or ontological qualities, for this would imply plurality in the godhead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H022 Ibn al-'Arabi, Muhyi al-Din (1164-1240)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the creatures, Being is not part of their essence.  So a creature does not own its being, that it can never be independent in itself . In this sense, the created does not deserve the attribution of Being. Only God is Being, and all the rest is in reality a possibility (imkân), a relative, possible non-existence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Ibn 'Arabî used the term &quot;effusion&quot; (fayd) to denote the act of creation. His writings contain expressions which show different stages of creation, a distinction merely logical and not actual. The following gives details about his vision of creation in three stages: the Most Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-aqdas), the Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-muqaddas) and the Perpetual Effusion (al-fayd al-mustamirr).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Wahdat-ul-Wujood spread through the teachings of the [[Sufi]]s like Qunyawi, Jandi, Tilimsani, Qayshari, Jami etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present(2006), pg76&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with the ''Hamah Ust'' ([[Persian Language|Persian]] meaning &quot;He is the only one&quot;) philosophy in [[South Asia]].  Sachal Sarmast and Bulleh Shah two Sufi poets from [[Pakistan]], were also ardent followers of Wahdat-ul-Wujood.

Today, some Sufi Orders, notably the Bektashi sect and the non-traditional sects of Universal Sufism, place much emphasis on the concept of wahdat-ul-wujood.

Tashkeek or gradation is closely associated with Sadrian interpretation of wahdat al-wujud. According to this school, not only there is gradation of existence that stand in a vast hierarchical chain of being (maratib al-wujud) from floor (farsh) to divine throne (arsh), but the wujud of each existent ''maahiya'' is nothing but a grade of the single reality of wujud whose source is God, the absolute being (al-wujud al-mutlaq). What differentiates the wujud of different existents is nothing but wujud in different degrees of strength and weakness. The universe is nothing but different degrees of strengths and weaknesses of wujud, ranging from intense degree of wujud of arch-angelic realities, to the dim wujud of lowly dust from which adam was made.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present, pg 78&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of the concept====
Some Muslims, including both Sufis and Salafis, have made comparisons between wahdat ul-wujood and Pantheism, the concept that all is God.  This criticism has come both from Salafis and from Sufis as well.

Some, however, will counter that the two concepts differ in that wahdat ul-wujood states that God and the universe aren't identical.&lt;ref&gt;Tehqiq ul Haq fi Kalamat ul Haq a book by Pir Meher Ali Shah&lt;/ref&gt;  They hold real existence to be for God only and the universe to have no existence on its own (without God).

Some Salafis criticize the concept of wahdat al-wujud on the grounds that it was a product of Arab interaction with Hindu philosophy, and is not a purely Islamic concept. However, this is highly improbable simply because Muslims did not begin their interactions with the Hindus of India until the 12th century whereas prominent Sufis had already openly published some of their writings as early as the 6th century, including Al-Hallaj, Dhul-Nun al-Misri, and so on. Although Salafis cite similarities with Kabbalah as a criticism, even a cursory study of the history of Kabbalah would indicate that the formulation of Kabbalah was based on Sufi doctrines as espoused through secret publications by the Brethren of Purity. For example, Brethren of Purity discussed the doctrine of emanations which mention there being eight sephiroth, whereas in Kabbalah it is mentioned that there are ten sephiroth. However, the writings of the Brethren of Purity did not reach the Jews until during the time of the Muslim rule of Spain and the time of the Crusades. Before then however such doctrines already existed and were well established.

Some Sufis, such as Ahmad Sirhindi ''(Mujaddid Alif Sani)'', have criticised wahdat ul-wujood. Ahmad Sirhindi wrote about the sayings that universe has no existence of its own and is a shadow of the existence of the necessary being. He also wrote that one should discern the existence of universe from the absolute and that the absolute does not exist because of existence but because of his essence.&lt;ref&gt;Maktoobat Rabbaniyah&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories===
This list of categories given in the &lt;i&gt;al-Qatighuriyas wa Tubiqa&lt;/i&gt; is not exhaustive or final.

*'''[[w:Substance theory|Substance]]'''
(Greek: ''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;ousia&lt;/span&gt;'', essence or substance |Arabic ''jauhar, q.v.'').&lt;ref&gt;Note that while Aristotle's use of ''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;ousia&lt;/span&gt;'' is ambiguous between 'essence' and substance' there is a close link between them. See his [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Substance'' is that which cannot be predicated of anything or be said to be in anything. Hence, ''this particular man'' or ''that particular tree'' are substances. Later in the text, Aristotle calls these particulars “primary substances”, to distinguish them from ''secondary substances'', which are universals and ''can'' be predicated. Hence, Socrates is a primary substance, while man is a secondary substance. ''Man'' is predicated of Socrates, and therefore all that is predicated of man is predicated of Socrates.

*'''[[w:Quantity|Quantity]]'''
&lt;i&gt;kamm&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;poson&lt;/span&gt;'', how much). This is the extension of an object, and may be either [[wiktionary:Discrete|discrete]] or [[wiktionary:Continuous|continuous]].  Further, its parts may or may not have relative positions to each other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, of the infinite and the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text.  It is of great importance in the development of mathematical ideas in the medieval and late Scholastic period. Examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time. quality (kaif, q.v.)

*'''[[w:Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]'''
&lt;i&gt;kaif&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;poion&lt;/span&gt;'', of what kind or quality). This determination characterizes the nature of an object. Examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.

*'''[[w:Finitary relation|Relation]]'''
&lt;i&gt;’idafah&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;pros ti&lt;/span&gt;'', toward something). This is the way one object may be related to another. Examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.

*'''[[w:Place (mathematics)|Place]]'''
&lt;i&gt;aina&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;pou&lt;/span&gt;'', where). Position in relation to the surrounding environment. Examples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum.

*'''[[w:Time|Spatial–Temporal]]'''
&lt;i&gt;mata&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.; (Greek: ''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;pote&lt;/span&gt;'', when). Position in relation to the course of events. Examples: yesterday, last year.

*'''[[w:Human position|Situation (or Position)]]'''
&lt;i&gt;wad‘&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.) (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;keisthai&lt;/span&gt;'', to lie). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an action: ''‘Lying’, ‘sitting’, ‘standing’.'' Thus ''position'' may be taken as the end point for the corresponding action. The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the relative position of the parts of an object (usually a living object), given that the position of the parts is inseparable from the state of rest implied. Others read: posture, attitude.

*'''State of condition'''
&lt;i&gt;jiddah&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;echein&lt;/span&gt;'', to have, to be, in a state or condition). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an affection (i.e. being acted on): ''‘shod’, ‘armed’.'' The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the determination arising from the physical accoutrements of an object: one's shoes, one's arms, etc. Traditionally, this category is also called a ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;habitus&lt;/span&gt;'' (from Latin ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;habere&lt;/span&gt;'', to have).

*'''Possession'''
&lt;i&gt;lahu&lt;/i&gt;, q.v.;

*'''[[w:Action (philosophy)|Action]]'''
&lt;i&gt;fi‘l&lt;/i&gt;, also called &lt;i&gt;yaf‘al&lt;/i&gt;; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;poiein&lt;/span&gt;'', to make or do). The production of change in some other object (or in the agent itself &lt;i&gt;qua&lt;/i&gt; other).

*'''[[w:Affection (philosophy)|Affection/Passion]]'''
&lt;i&gt;’inf‘al&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;anf‘il&lt;/i&gt;; (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;paschein&lt;/span&gt;'', to suffer or undergo). The reception of change from some other object (or from the affected object itself ''qua'' other). Aristotle's name ''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;paschein&lt;/span&gt;'' for this category has traditionally been translated into English as &quot;affection&quot; and &quot;passion&quot; (also &quot;passivity&quot;), easily misinterpreted to refer only or mainly to [[w:affection|affection as an emotion]] or to [[w:passion (emotion)|emotional passion]].  For action he gave the example, ''‘to lance’, ‘to cauterize’;'' for affection, ''‘to be lanced’, ‘to be cauterized.’'' His examples make clear that action is to affection as the active voice is to the passive voice — as ''acting'' is to ''being acted on''.

==misc. info==

The Qur'an itself contains a very rich vocabulary that relates to the phenomena study of nature, such verbs as &lt;i&gt;yarâ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;yafqahûn&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;yataḏhakkarûn&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ya'qilûn&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ya'lamûn&lt;/i&gt;; they are used in different verses with different meanings. It alludes to the level and depth of understanding the phenomena of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Bucaille. ''&quot;La Bible, le Coran et la Science: Les Écritures Saintes examinées à la lumière des connaissances modernes. (Seghers, 1976). Pocket 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Which is implicit in the Creation teachings in the Qur'an and traditional Torah. There is not just one level of knowing, or one particular type of science of nature, but many that range from simple observation that is related to 'seeing' (''ruˀyâˀ''), to include intellect (''taˁaqqul''), and the in-depth knowledge of the essence of things (&lt;i&gt;ˁilm&lt;/i&gt;). However, we as humans begin to lose sense of reality of our Creator, moreover, by all the works of humanity—clothing, computers and electronics, appliances, buildings and infrastructure—the commodities and luxuries that separate us from the harsh, unforgiving environment; before all of that, they did not exist, at least in their fashionable forms.

===Documentary Hypothesis===

It has been by ancient Judaeo-Islamic tradition that according to the account given in the Exodus narrative, Moshe received the ''Torah'', or &quot;Instructions/Law&quot;, atop Mount Sinai. Modern biblical scholars today, however, have become convinced that the theory of authorship is not tenable and that the five books of the traditional Torah are not the single work of any man, and certainly not of Moshe. Rather, they are carefully edited compilation of material from a number of sources. Although the theory of multiple authorship of the Torah dates only from the eighteenth-nineteenth century from the attempt to reconcile inconsistencies in the biblical text, becoming later known as the Documentary Hypothesis. It was held that the traditional Torah was derived from originally independent, parallel and complete narratives, which were subsequently combined into the current form by a series of redactors, or editors. Biblical scholars, using source criticism, eventually arrived at the theory that the Torah was composed of selections woven together from separate, at times inconsistent, sources, each originally a complete and independent document.

Within the context of Judaeo-Christian scriptures, from what is inscribed in the Torah, only brevity of events concerns the 'Six Days of Creation', in which 'Man' becomes the pinnacle of creation, Decreed by G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; H&lt;small&gt;IMSELF&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى, let alone the events that chronologically unfold from Adam to Noah عليهم السلام
The manuscripts, according to those that have most carefully studied the ''Torah'', the period of primeval history—particularly the antediluvian era—are primarily based on four primary documentary sources: the &lt;u&gt;Jahwist&lt;/u&gt; source &lt;b&gt;(J)&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;u&gt;Elohist&lt;/u&gt; source &lt;b&gt;(E)&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;u&gt;Deuteronomist&lt;/u&gt; &lt;b&gt;(D)&lt;/b&gt;, and the &lt;u&gt;Priestly&lt;/u&gt; source &lt;b&gt;(P)&lt;/b&gt;.

Being compiled by scribal editors (redactors), the documents threaded the different strands together producing the final form of the ''Torah'', circa 450 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;: first &lt;b&gt;JE&lt;/b&gt;, then &lt;b&gt;JED&lt;/b&gt;, and finally &lt;b&gt;JEDP&lt;/b&gt;.

[[File:Documentary Hypothesis Sources Distribution English.png|thumb|center|400px|Distribution of materials of ''Jahwist'', ''Elohist'', and ''Priestly'' sources, as well as the ''Redactors'' contribution in the first four books.]]

====''J''-strand====
:&lt;u&gt;Written circa 950 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt; in the southern Kingdom of Judah.&lt;/u&gt;
The ''J''-document, the oldest source of the manuscripts inscribed, contains dramatic, yet historical importance to Hebrew history, dating back to the B'nei Ysra'el, and the latter tribe of Yehuda. The text that are inscribed within the ''J''-document may have been written down early as ca. 700 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;, before reaching its present form some time before ca. 950 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;, perhaps when Assyria–from its base in the Tigris-Euphrates valley (modern Iraq)–was the strongest kingdom in western Asia. Even before Assyria became powerful, the culture of the Tigris-Euphrates dominated western Asia, even as far back as ca. 3,400 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;, when the Sumerians (who lived in the region prior to the latter, the Assyrians) reinvented writing in the postdiluvian age. The Sumerian legends and their theories of the creation of the Universe, and of early history spread to all the surrounding people, exerting strong influence.

====''E''-strand====
:&lt;u&gt;Written circa 850 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt; in the northern Kingdom of Israel.&lt;/u&gt;

====''D''-strand====
:&lt;u&gt;Written circa 600 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt; in Jerusalem during a period of religious reform.&lt;/u&gt;

====''P''-strand====
:&lt;u&gt;Written circa 500 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt; by Aaronic priests in exile in Babylon.&lt;/u&gt;
The ''P''-document was compiled during the time when the people of Judah (the &quot;Jewish&quot;) were in captivity in the Tigris-Euphrates region from circa 600–500 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;. At that time, the dominant tribe of the region was the Chaldeans, and their capital was in Babylon, so that the ''P''-document picked up what we might call Chaldean or Babylonian views of cosmic history—striking parallelism between the Babylonian creation myth prescribed in the ancient Akkadian ''Enûma Eliš'' clay cuneiforms—which in turn were based on nearly three thousand years of thought dating back to the Sumerians.

--------------------------

The period of primeval history based in the traditional Torah illustrates two accounts, according to two different strands of documents contained therein: the J-document and the P-document.

the culture of the Tigris-Euphrates dominated western Asia, even as far back as 3400 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;, when the Sumerians, who were living in the area at that time, invented writing. The Sumerian legends and their theories of the creation of the Universe and of early history spread to all surrounding societies, exerting a strong influence throughout Mesopotamia.

The P-document, or ''Priestly'' strand, was compiled and introduced into a single form during the time when the Tribe of Judah (of B'nei Ysrael [Children of Israel]), commonly known as the Jewish people, were during bondage and captivity (known as the Babylonian captivity) in the Tigris-Euphrates region (modern day Iraq) in the sixth century &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;. At this time, the dominant tribe of the region was the Chaldeans, and their capital was in Babylon; the P-document has been greatly influenced by the Chaldean or Babylonian views of cosmic history, which were based off the Sumerians concept and thought nearly dating three thousand years prior.

The J-document, or ''Jawhist'' strand, is somewhat more archaic in views than that of the P-strand, which it contains dramatic historical legends that were current among the people of ancient Israel (before the first major diaspora), which the tales were written down and reached their present form some time before 700 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;; this was before the period when Assyria–from its base in the Tigris-Euphrates valley–became the strongest kingdom in western Asia.

These two documents were combined by reverent editors and redactors whom threaded and stitched the two strands together. Sometime around 500 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;, the first eleven chapters of the 'Book of Bereishit (Genesis)' reached its final form by the time Tribe of Judah returned back to ''Eretz Ysrael'' (Land of Israel) from Babylonian exile, it is copied in every traditional ''Torah'' today. All through the first eleven chapters of the Book of Genesis (Bereishit), there is a strong tinge of the Sumerian/Babylonian creation myth that is unmistakable in the both threads.

====1st Book of Moses====
Syllable-word frequency pattern analysis, using the chi-square test, identifies significant differences within Genesis chapters  1-4, 6-9, 12-13, 16-21, 26, 28, 30-33, 39 and 41-43.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houk, Genesis&quot;/&gt;

The statistical results are interpreted to suggest that to an extended composition by an initial ''Jahweh''-writer (&lt;small&gt;J&lt;/small&gt;2-4, 6-8, 12-13, 16) four other ''Jahweh''-writers successively added &lt;small&gt;J&lt;/small&gt;18-19, &lt;small&gt;J&lt;/small&gt;26, &lt;small&gt;J&lt;/small&gt;28-33 and &lt;small&gt;J&lt;/small&gt;39-43.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houk, Genesis&quot;/&gt;

In a second major stage of development an ''Elohim''-writer expanded chapters 2-3 (using the dual divine name as a distinctive  introductory signature mark), wrote chapters 20-21 and enhanced the stories in chapters 7-8, 28, 31, 33. A second ''Elohim''-writer added the punishments in  3.14-19, enhanced chapters 30-32 and expanded the Joseph story of ch. 41.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houk, Genesis&quot;/&gt;

Finally, a first ''Priestly''-writer composed 1.1-2.3 to introduce a third major  version of Genesis and also enhanced chapters 6-8. A second P writer added 1.11, 22, 28-30 and ch. 9, a third ''Priestly''-writer composed ch. 17 and a fourth ''Priestly''-writer edited the narratives of chapters 12-36.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houk, Genesis&quot;/&gt;
-------------------------------------------
The analysis argues against the explanation of Genesis as consisting of layers of tradition; against the thesis that the primeval and patriarchal stories as written were developed separately; and against the use of redactors who combined sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houk, Genesis&quot;&gt;

==?date of creation?==
Various Biblical scholars have made every effort to deduce its date by using various statements found in the Torah and Bible as indirect evidence. However, none has came up with the answer as precisely of one another.  Though many rabbis attempted this calculation, it was that of Rabbi Yossi ben Halafta who declared that the day Creation began on Monday, 7th of October, 3761 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;. It has gained much currency that it became the acclaimed as the origin of the modern Hebrew calendar. Other Jewish scholars had placed 25th of September, 3760 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt; as the date of Creation.

James Ussher, the Anglican archbishop of Armagh, Ireland, decided in 1654, that on the other hand, the date of Creation took place at 9:00 &lt;small&gt;A.M.&lt;/small&gt;, on the 23rd of October, 4004 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;. Even other calculations have put the Creation date as far back as 5509 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;. Thus, so far, the estimates have placed the age of the heavens and the earth, from Biblical data, that about 5700–7500 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt;. The weight of scientific evidence is that Earth, and the solar system generally, came into being into their approximate form about 4.6-billion years ago; the Universe as it seems, about 15-billion years ago. The mere agreement between the Bible and science loses of its value in terms of discrepancy.

==Six Days of Creation==

:&lt;big&gt;בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ &lt;i&gt;&quot;In the beginning of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s creating—the heavens and the earth.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===The Day of One===

The first day of creation has intrigued Jewish and Islamic scholars for thousands of years. 

Abraham ibn Ezra comments: 
:When G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى created ''Darkness'', he didn't bring into existence as if it were an 'absence of light', He created it but for a specific type of creation, such as the revelations made by Prophet Isaiah عليه السلام:
:&lt;big&gt;אני יהוה עשה כל־אלה...יוצר אור ובורא חשך&lt;/big&gt; ''&quot;Forming light and creating darkness..I am the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; [that] does all these.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;''—[Yeshayahu 45:7]&lt;/sup&gt;

:&lt;big&gt;וַיֹּ֥אמֶר  אֱלֹהִ֖ים  יְהִ֣י  אֹ֑ור  וַֽיְהִי־  אֹֽור׃&lt;/big&gt; ''&quot;G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; said, &quot;Let there be light,&quot; and there was light; and אלהים separated between the light and the darkness.&quot;''.&lt;sup&gt;—[Genesis 1:3]&lt;/sup&gt;

To conclude that it should not mingled with the darkness, but should function independently. Other sources also uphold a mysticism view, which the Midrash states accordingly that the original light was of an intense spirituality and G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى ''saw'' that the wicked were unworthy of enjoying it.  Therefore, he separated it from the rest of the universe and set it aside for the use of the righteous in the Olam Haba. It was an implication that patches of light and darkness were intermixed with one another during its initial point-of-origin. Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, also renown Jewish scholar and philosopher, held onto this view, which he stated that &quot;... they functioned in a mixture&quot;. 

:''&quot;All praise and thanks are Allâh’s, Who (Alone) created the heavens and the earth, and originated the darkness and the light; yet those who disbelieve hold others as equal with their Lord.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-An’âm:1]&lt;/sup&gt;

:''&quot;Elohim אלהים called to the light: Day, and to the darkness He called: Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.''&lt;sup&gt;—[Bereishyt 1:5]&lt;/sup&gt;

:''&quot;God summoned the light and appointed it for duty by day, and He summoned the darkness and appointed it for duty by night.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Pesachim 2a]&lt;/sup&gt;

The completion of the First Day of Creation.  Scriptures uses the cardinal number אֶתָר to signify, ''&lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt;'' day, instead of the ordinal number רִאשׁוֹן, ''&lt;u&gt;first&lt;/u&gt;'' day, to indicate the Oneness of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s سبحانه وتعالى essence.  Because in the Masoretic text, it is also rendered as ''&quot;...the day of the One and Only&quot;''.


&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Anbiyâ':164]—'''&lt;/small&gt;In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, the ships that roam the ocean for the benefit of the people, the water that G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; sends down from the sky to revive dead land and to spread in it all kinds of creatures, the manipulation of the winds, and the clouds that are placed between the sky and the earth, there are sufficient proofs for people who understand.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Adh-Dhâriyât:47]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We constructed the sky with our hands, and we will continue to expand it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Hajj:47]—'''&lt;/small&gt;They challenge you to bring retribution, and G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; never fails to fulfill His prophecy. A day of your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; is like a thousand of your years.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Ma'ârij:3-4]—'''&lt;/small&gt;From G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;; Possessor of the highest Height. • The angels, with their reports, climb to Him in a day that equals fifty thousand years.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Fussilat:11]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Then He turned to the sky, when it was still gas, and said to it, and to the earth, &quot;Come into existence, willingly or unwillingly.&quot; They said, &quot;We come willingly.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

===A Second Day===

Until this day, God سبحانه وتعالى was the ''only'' spiritual being in existence, for the angels were not created until the second day.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt; The heavens had been created on the first day, but they were still in a state of flux.
:''&quot;Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day and in all that Allâh الله has created in the heavens and the earth are Ayât (proofs, signs, evidences, lessons, verses, revelations, etc.) for those people who keep their duty to Allâh الله, and fear Him much.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Yûnus:6]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:6'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it (that it may shall) separate between water and water.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

On the second day, at the Decree of God, the firmament could be reasoned as it solidified, creating a ''division'' between the waters above and the waters below.

It also can be thought as a ''separation'' beyond our reason, as mentioned is this verse, it is wholly spiritual, extraterrestrial aspects of Creation and the tangible world that is within the province of Man [which would include even the furthest reaches of our solar system].&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;  

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:7'''&lt;/sub&gt; So Elohim אלהים made the firmament (or ''expanse''), and it separated between the water which was-were beneath (below) the firmament (and) from the waters which was-were above the firmament. And it so.''&lt;/big&gt;

The verses in their literal sense do not require such an explanation. Those who understand the explanation are forbidden to reveal it. For those of us who do not understand, [it is forbidden to speculate about the unknown]. The implication is clear that the &quot;firmament&quot; and the &quot;upper and lower waters&quot; are among the mysteries of Creation that are either unknowable to Man or must be limited to those qualities to know them.

:Maimonides states:&lt;br&gt;
::''&quot;Do not expect me to write anything about [the creation of the second day] since Scripture itself did not elaborate [any further] upon it...&quot;''

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:8'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים called the firmament Sky—''&lt;/big&gt;

Jewish Scholars and philosophers ''Ibn Ezra'','' Malbim'', and ''R' Hirsch'', discussed the meaning of the word 'firmament'.  Generally, they commented that since there is no solid dome encircling dome, the term refers to the atmosphere that encircles earth.

As we look at today, it comes to direct proven reference of the ozone layer that surrounds the earth, protecting it from the harmful radiation that is omitting in space.  Uniquely, the Noble Qur'an makes mention of the 'protected roof [layer]', during the His Decree in  creating the earth.
:''&quot;And We have made the heaven a roof, a safe and well guarded.  Yet they turn away from the signs ''[i.e. sun, moon, winds, clouds, etc.]''.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Anbiyah':32]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''—And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.''&lt;/big&gt;

:''&quot;Then He completed and finished their creation as seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Fussilat:12]&lt;/sup&gt;

This is the only 'Day' that isn't mentioned בִּי טוֹב, ''&quot;...it was good.&quot;''. This term is commonly used only for a finished creation, such as the ''waters'' in this case.  Throughout the narrative, the term ''&quot;that it was good&quot;'' means that the creation of the item under discussion was &lt;u&gt;completed&lt;/u&gt;.  Thus, for example, the light is described as 'good', because of its existence and function were final.  It wasn't until the third day did God سبحانه وتعالى say that the ''waters'' were good.

----------
To the dimensions of height, width, length and time the Kabbalists have added the dimension of spirituality. In the positive spiritual direction are the seven heavens. Farthest from Earth is Araboth, which contains uncreated objects and is the permanent residence of men's souls. It is associated with the emanation Greatness (Kindness). Makhon, the second heaven, contains the precipitants rain, snow, hail, fog, and dew. Makhon is presided over by Moses the Law Giver and the emanation Law, and emits a lightning bolt into Ma'on, the third heaven, presided over by Father Abraham who alters the bolt into four &quot;rays of foundation&quot; corresponding to the four spheres of emanations along the central axis and are colored black, white, red and green. The third heaven is filled with harmonizing lights and sounds that sing praises to God, and is symbolized by the emanation Beauty. Above this is Zebhul, a spiritual Jerusalem corresponding to the emanation Victory which is the positive aspect of cosmic power. In this city is a tabernacle, personified by Metatrone, with Michael as high priest, surrounded by the souls of martyrs. There is also a heavenly tribunal of seven lights. The fifth heaven is called Shekhakim and is associated with Glory. It contains millstones whch grind manna for the righteous and is presided over by Jacob and the twelve heads of the Israelite tribes. It is surrounded by a river of fire wherein reside the angels of destruction, and this river is held back by a colorless light of monotheism, which is fueled by prayers from below and projected out from Shekhakim as an archetypal alphabet of 22 colors. Next is Rakiya, the firmament. Symbolized by the emanation Foundation, this heaven supports the heavenly bodies, which are endowed with divine knowledge. The lowest heaven is called Vilon (lit. veil), which shields the heavens during he day and &quot;rolls&quot; down each night. It is associated with the Kingdom, is the main source [of] prophetic visions, and is presided over by Joseph, the interpreter of dreams.

Below the Earth spiritually are seven abysses, known as Gehenna, Death's Shadow, Death's Gate, Filth, Destructive Whirlpools, Place of Perdition and Sheol. Interpretations on these vary considerably; however, it is generally held that they are made up of tohu (impure earth), bohu (impure water), and darkness (opposite of fire).

Associated with the heavens, and perhaps above them, are the seven hekhalot (palaces) in the merkavah (Divine Chariot). The seventh palace leads to the Throne of God, symbolized by sapphire and emerald. Here the souls of mystics travel outside of their bodies and rise up to the Veil of God. The veil is not physical, for God has no physical form; it is a symbol for the limitations of Man's comprehension of God.

These palaces are dangerous, and the mystics who travel them must carry with them the seals of the two angels designated for each gate to show to the eight angels who guard each of the seven entrance ways. Those that do not have the proper seals are said to be swept away in a fiery tornado. The sixth palace is particularly hazardous, for it is made of sparkling marble, and if the traveller mistakes it for water the angels chastise and punish him for his ignorance.

-----
The demons, called sheydim (violent ones), mazikim (destructive ones), and ru'akhim (spirits). It has been postulated that demons come either from the left-hand side of the tree of emanations, called Sitra Akhar (the other side), or from a perverted opposite of the tree of emanations, composed of impore kelifot (shells) instead of spheres. It is widely held that Lilith is the Queen of demons, and that she was created for Adam as his wife. However, it was found that two separately created individuals were incompatible, so she flew off (she has wings) and God created Eve from Adam's rib. Lilith never forgave Adam, however, and she seeks revenge by killing infants and women during and shortly after child birth. Lilith is associated with the Kingdom in the tree of impurity.

The physical make-up and attitudes of the demons differs greatly, though they are all mortal. Some are quite physical but also cold and can become invisible; these are said to be the offspring of Adam and Lilith, and they carry on the tradition by mating only with humans. Others are said to be formless spirits, made solely of fire and air, and feed on incense and flames. The latter are particularly useful to witches, for black magic can be learned from them. Those demons who have wings are said to live in the upper atmosphere and &quot;speak&quot; with the Princes of the Zodiac, and therefore know in advance what will be.

The main king of the demons is Som, also known as Samael (lit. blind to God), who is associated with the equivalent of the emanation Glory in the sinister tree of emanations. He is quite evil, often committing the sins of adultery and murder. However, it should be noted that not all demons or demon kings are evil. They, like Man, have both good and evil inclinations, called yetzer tove and yetzer ra, respectively. The best known example is Ashmodai, who studies Torah with God. While he is still rather mischievous, he has perfect foresight and is generally beneficial.

Different from both men and demons are the m'lakhim (angels). The term m'lakh literally means messenger, and the angels are the servants of God. Unlike demons and men, angels have no free will, tend to specialize in their functions, and can assume both spiritual and physical forms. It is believed by some mystics that the gods of the pagan religions were actually angels.

Angels can take on a variety of physical forms. The Torah often mentions angels who take the form of men, and Ezekial describes ofanim, angels in the shape of wheels. In addition to these there are serafim with six wings, symbolized by fire or snakes and serve as God's messengers; cherubim who are part human, lion and bull, and accompany God; and khayot (lit. living things) who surround God on His throne.

The four archangels, associated with the khayot, are Michael (lit. who is like unto God), Raphael (lit. God has healed), Gabriel (lit. strength in God), and Oriel (lit. light of God). Though interpretations vary, these four correspond to the different Greek elements, directions, colors, precious metals and worlds. Michael, made of snow, is the angel of south, gold, fire, World of Emanations, red and symbolized by the lion. Oriel is the angel of east, copper, air, World of Creation, yellow and symbolized by the eagle. He is also known as the angel of mercy, and is believed to have taken the form of a lion and accepted offerings made to God. Rapheal is the angel associated with west, iron, earth, World of Formation, green, symbolized by the ox, and is the angel of healing. Last and in no way least is Gabriel, whose symbols are north, silver, water, World of Activity, blue and man. Gabriel is an avenging angel, made of fire and responsible for the destruction of Sodom and the taken of the souls of kings when their time has come.

Many angels serve as guards for spiritual places and the heavens, while others have specific tasks. The angel Sandalfon weaves a crown for God out of the prayers of the faithful. The infamous Satan (lit. adversary) points out the faults of Man to God, and encourages their punishment or extermination. The angel Samael, sometimes identified as the demon Som, is the main angel of death. The angel primarily responsible for the revealing of secret knowledge is called Raziel (lit. mysteries of God), and the heavenly scribe is Metatrone (lit. in Hebrew, keeper of the watch; in Greek, behind the throne).

There are also angels who guard over and personify the different nations. The Kabbalists believe that there are 70 nations, each descended from a particular son, grandson or great-grandson of Noah (the nations which existed previously were wiped out in the Great Flood). Whatever activities occur on Earth between nations are preceded by similar activities in Heaven between the respective guardian angels. Michael is the guardian of the Jews, and often intervenes on their behalf. Satan, on the other hand, is the guardian angel of Rome, for the Roman Empire was the agent of the Diaspora (exile), which is widely held to have been imposed on the Jews as punishment for their infidelity to God.

One work divides the angels into two categories: the angels in God's name, led by Totarkhiel, and the angels of God's countenance, lead by Suriyah. [See Appendix]

===A Third Day===
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:9'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Let the water beneath the firmament be gathered into one area, and let the dry land appear.&quot;  And it so.''&lt;/big&gt;

''Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer'' commented that, scarcely had God Himself سبحانه وتعالى uttered the words, ''&quot;Let the waters...be gathered&quot;'' when mountains and hills appeared, and the waters collected in the deep-lying valleys. But the water threatened to flood the earth until He forced it back into the seabed, walling in the sea with sand.

This aspect of God's activity means that He determines the proper limits—to Creation itself, and to an individual human being's resources and sufferings.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Zohar]''&lt;/sup&gt; The concept of God Himself سبحانه وتعالى as determining what is sufficient and setting limits is alluded to in His Name ''Shaddai'', from the word רַּי, meaning ''&quot;enough, sufficient&quot;''.  As Talmudic literature puts it: מִי שֶׁאָמַר לְעוֹלָמוֹ רַּי ''&quot;He Who said to His World, 'It is enough!'&quot;''

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:10'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים called the dry land Earth, and the gathering waters He called Seas. And Elohim אלהים saw that this was good.''&lt;/big&gt;

The word &quot;Earth&quot; is from the word רצה ''desire'', i.e. it was desired to do God's Will. God began by creating one rock; and it rushed to expand, in order to fulfill His desire.
:''&quot;And the earth We have spread out, and have placed therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein all kinds of things in due proportion.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Hijr:19]&lt;/sup&gt;

Both ''Rashi'' and ''Maimonides'' agree that the earth had been created on the first day, but it was neither visible nor dry until the waters were commanded to assemble in their designated areas.
:''&quot;And We have placed on the earth firm mountains, lest it should shake with them, and We placed therein broad highways for them to pass through, that they may be guided.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Anbiyâ’:31]&lt;/sup&gt;

The ''waters'' did not receive recognition by God سبحانه وتعالى that it were too indeed–good. ''Resisei Layla'' comments, it was because strife began on the second day. The waters were created on this day, symbolizing ''strife'', which occurs when the bonds that unite people are broken.  Schism and dispute cannot be called good.

''Rabbeinu Bachya'' also comments that because the creation of the angels and the firmament, though momentous, was not the prime purpose of Creation. Rather, the prime purpose of Creation is the &quot;lower world,&quot; the world where Man does his work by bringing God's plan to fruition. Only when Man's interests are served do the heavens and the heavenly beings justify their existence.
:''&quot;...the Righteous are greater than the ministering angels.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;''—[Sandhedrin 93a]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:11'''&lt;/sub&gt; And Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Let the earth sprout vegetation: seed-bearing plants, fruit trees of every kind on earth that bears fruit with the seed in it.&quot; And it was so.''&lt;/big&gt;

:''&quot;A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Yâ-Sîn:33]&lt;/sup&gt;

By the third day of Creation, the earth already has an atmosphere, plus land that is already to be inhabited by mankind and of the other living. On this day, He commanded that the vegetation should grow its own seed within itself, so that it could be planted elsewhere.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;

:''&quot;It is He Who sends down water (rain) from the skies, and with it We bring up forth green vegetation of all kinds, and out of it We bring forth green stalks (crops), and out of it We bring up forth thick clustered grain.  And out of the date-palm and its spathe(or sheaths) (come) forth clusters of dates hanging low and near, and (then there are) gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety and taste).  Look at their fruits  and (feast your eyes) when they begin to bear, and the ripeness thereof. Verily, in these things there are signs for a people who believe.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-An'âm:99]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:12'''&lt;/sub&gt; –The earth brought forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it.  And Elohim אלהים saw that this was good.''&lt;/big&gt;

The Talmudic sage ''Rav Assi'' noted the apparent contradiction between this verse and the Torah's statement that nothing had grown prior to the creation of Adam {Gen  2:5}. He explains that the herbs began to grow on the third day, as they had been commanded, but stopped before they broke through the soil. It remained for Adam to pray for them, whereupon rain fell (or a mist came upon the ground) and the growth was completed. This teaches that God سبحانه وتعالى longs for the prayers of the righteous.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Chullin 60b]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:13'''&lt;/sub&gt; And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.''&lt;/big&gt;

Up to now, the entire earth was submerged under water. On the third day, God سبحانه وتعالى decreed boundaries for water, making way for the development of land, vegetation, animal life, and ultimately, Man.
----

===A Fourth Day===
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:14'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים said, &quot;There shall be luminaries in the firmament in the heaven to separate between the day and the night; and they shall serve as (omens) [i.e. ''signs''], and for (defining) festivals, and days and years;—''&lt;/big&gt;

The creations of the first three days and those of the next three days parallel and complement one another.  Light was created on the first day, and the luminaries were then created from it, which were then set in place on the fourth.
:''&quot;It is He who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. Allâh الله did not create these but in truth.  He explains the Ayât (proofs, signs, evidences, lessons, verses, revelations, etc.) in detail for a people who have knowledge.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Yûnus:5]&lt;/sup&gt;
The luminaries are signs of God's greatness in many ways, the heavenly bodies are constant reminders of His omnipotence.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:15'''&lt;/sub&gt; —and they shall serve as luminaries in the firmament of the heaven to shine upon the earth.&quot; And it was so.''&lt;/big&gt;

It is believed that the celestial bodies were formed from these clouds of hot gases and particles of dust, some merged and became stars, others into gas planets.  Whatever other metallic and rocky ingredients that God سبحانه وتعالى required to create earth, and other planets, He too gathered them and formed them into being.

:''&quot;The He rose over toward the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: “Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.” They both said: “We come willingly.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Fussilat:11]&lt;/sup&gt;

In the physical universe, hot gases and dust are literately in the form of ''smoke''—substance of gaseous material that exists within our universe, which we know as interstellar gas clouds, or ''nebulas''.

====Sun and moon====
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:16'''&lt;/sub&gt; And Elohim אלהים made the two great luminaries, the greater luminary to dominate the day and the lesser luminary to dominated the night;—''&lt;/big&gt;

The word ''&quot;greater&quot;'' should not be taken literately to size, or proportion. Obviously the stars are much greater in size than the moon. Instead, the 'luminaries' are described as &quot;great&quot; in relation to the luminosity, or intensity of their brightness. Hence the moon is much closer than the stars, its light appears more illuminated than theirs. The greatness of the sun is that it is a ''source'' of light, while the moon is small because it can only reflect what it receives from the sun.

The concept of great and small offers a homiletical insight—for a growing child is the recipient of wisdom and training from parents and teachers. We pray that the infant will grow up to become an independent source of greatness, who will enlighten others.

&lt;big&gt;''—and the stars.''&lt;/big&gt;
:''&quot;And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Hijr:16]&lt;/sup&gt;

God سبحانه وتعالى had (or ''planned to–'') created the stars on the first day, but hadn't been set until fourth day—to serve mankind.
:''&quot;It is He Who set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea.  We have (indeed) explained in detail Our Ayât [proofs, signs, evidences, lessons, verses, revelations, etc.] for a people who know.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-An’am:97]&lt;/sup&gt;

The Qur'an speaks about the stars are not only used for its luminance, but they also serve the purpose to drive away the devils.
:''&quot;And indeed We have (also) adorned the nearest heaven with lamps (stars), and We have made such lamps as missiles to drive away the Shayâtîn (devils), and have prepared for the torment of the blazing Fire.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Mulk:5]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:17'''&lt;/sub&gt; And Elohim אלהים set them in the firmament of the heaven to give them light upon the earth,—''&lt;/big&gt;

Then by the command of God سبحانه وتعالى, all the stars within the universe (including the sun) were placed within its own spot, according to the Will of God; they first 'illuminated' for the first time. Although light was already created, He didn't assign ''light'' to anything, it was still in a dimensionless state—until the fourth day.

God سبحانه وتعالى commands all the celestial bodies in the universe to go about its course, or orbit. They sometimes diverge from their natural course to comply with His Will, as when the sun stopped for Prophet Joshua  عليه السلام.
:''&quot;And He it is who has created the night and day, and the sun and the moon (and all the celestial bodies) swim along, in each rounded course (orbit).&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Anbiyâ’:33]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:18'''&lt;/sub&gt; —to dominate by day and by night, and to separate between the light and the darkness.''&lt;/big&gt;

This verse defines the functions between the two luminaries. Their dominion consists of causing a distinction between the darkness and the light. The great luminary, the sun, will dominate by day and its light will be everywhere–even in places where its ''direct'' rays do not reach. The smaller luminary, the moon, will dominate by night–although it will do no more than relieve the darkness.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Maimonides]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:19'''&lt;/sub&gt; And there was evening and there was a morning, a fourth day.''&lt;/big&gt;

The luminaries, which had been created on the first day, were set in place on the fourth.  Indeed, all the potentials of heaven and earth were created on the first day but each was set in place on the day when it was so commanded.
------

===A Fifth Day===
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:20'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Let the waters teem with teeming living creatures, and fowl that fly about over the earth across the expanse of the heavens.&quot;''&lt;/big&gt;

The earth was full of marine and bird life.

God سبحانه وتعالى gave the seas the power to produce marine life, whereupon the waters became filled with living beings. Thereafter, the marine creatures would procreate naturally, through the powers granted by God's Blessing to be fruitful and multiply.

The term ''&quot;teeming&quot;'' refers to any living creature that does not rise from the ground.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:21'''&lt;/sub&gt; And Elohim אלהים created the great sea-giants and every living being that creeps, with which the waters teemed after their kinds; and all winged fowl of every kind. And God saw that it was good.''&lt;/big&gt;

''Arbarbanel'' comments that the term, ''&quot;And God created...,&quot;'' refers to something preternatural. During the first day it was referred to Creation from a total vacuum.; here, it refers to the huge size of some of the marine life; and, the last time it was used, it refers to the Creation of Man, intelligent life form that God has imagined.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:22'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים blessed them, saying, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas; but the fowl shall increase the earth. &lt;sub&gt;'''1:23'''&lt;/sub&gt; And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.''&lt;/big&gt;

These creatures needed a special blessing because so many intentionally reduced in number—hunted down [i.e. fished out] and eaten. The land animals that were created on the sixth day needed such a blessing too, but God سبحانه وتعالى did not bestow a blessing on them, so as not to include the serpent—which was destined to be cursed much later.

Had not God سبحانه وتعالى added וּרְבוּ, ''&quot;...and multiply,&quot;'' each creature would only produce one offspring—''multiply'' adds multiple births to the blessing, so each would bring forth many.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt; In this context, the phrase is as blessing that the creatures would have the capacity to populate the earth. Later, with relation to Man, it was also a commandment that he engage in procreation.

-------
A variety of creatures are mentioned in mystical works. There is adne hasadeh, a [man-like] creature with an umbilical cord attached to the ground. These beings die when their umbilical cords are cut, and are probably a symbol for how Man's ultimate ancestor is the Earth (even today's scientists believe that life started from chemicals in the ground). Another strange creature is the barnacle goose, which grows on trees using its bill as a stem until it finally breaks off and flies away. The shamir is a tiny worm which splits even the hardest rocks, and the takhash is a type of unicorn which is spiritually clean (kosher). Among the largest animals are the leviathon, king of the fishes; ZiZ, the largest of all birds (rocs); and the behemoth or reem, which are fantastically huge oxen. These oxen are so large that their hoofbeats cause earthquakes. The female of the species always gives birth to a male and female set of twins, and both parents die in the reproductive process, for if there ever were more than two behemoth at the same time, the other species would be placed in jeopardy. Other animal myths developed along the same lines or were adopted from other cultures.. Se'irim or satyrs are goat demons, basisks and cockatrices can kill all but weasels with a touch or a glance, the rahab or tannim is an evil dragon, and a werewolf is a sorcerer incognito.




------

===The Sixth Day===

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:24'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Let the earth bring forth living creatures, each according to its kind: animal, and creeping being, and beast of the land each according to its kind.&quot; And it was so.''&lt;/big&gt;

The term, ''&quot;bring forth&quot;'', implies that a concealed, dormant presence was being brought into existence.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Ahavas Yonasan]''&lt;/sup&gt;  The potential for everything was created on the first day; it was necessary only to ''bring them forth''.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;

These were independently living, breathing beings, capable of reproducing their own species...The term could also include any living thing not specifically mentioned, as for example, ''germs''.&lt;sup&gt;''—[R' Munk]''&lt;/sup&gt;

The singular form that is implied in: ''&quot;...according to its kind:...&quot;''; God سبحانه وتعالى endowed each of the species with whatever senses and faculties it required to thrive&lt;sup&gt;''—[Sforno]''&lt;/sup&gt;, and endowed each with its own peculiar nature and instincts.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Minchah Belulah]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:25'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים made the beast of the earth according to its kind, and the animal according to its kind, and every creeping being of the ground according to its kind. And Elohim אלהים saw that it was good.''&lt;/big&gt;

The expression of approval, ''&quot;...that it was good.&quot;'', also applies to a facet of Creation after it was complete. Animal, vegetable, and mineral existence were complete and good as soon they were created, because they had neither the ability nor the requirement to develop themselves further.  Man, however, is in a different category. His creation, which is about to be recounted, is not followed by a similar declaration of approval, because Man's creation is never complete; he must always strive to better himself and his world.

====Man and Woman====
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:26'''&lt;/sub&gt; And Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Let us make Man in our image, after our likeness. They shall rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and over the animal, the whole earth, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&quot;''&lt;/big&gt;

The preamble, ''&quot;'Let us make Man...,'&quot;'' indicates that Man was created with great deliberation and wisdom. God did not say, ''&quot;Let the earth bring forth...,&quot;'' as He did with other creatures; instead, Man was brought into being with the deepest involvement of Divine Providence and wisdom.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Abarbanel]''&lt;/sup&gt;

:''Targum Yonasam'' paraphrases: ''&quot;And God said to the ministering angels who had been created on the second day of Creation to the world, 'Let us make Man.'&quot;''

According to the Midrash, when Moses عليه السلام wrote the Torah and came to this verse (''let '''us''' make''), which is in the plural and implies that there is more than one Creator, he said: 
:''&quot;Sovereign of the Universe! Why do You thus furnish a pretext for heretics to maintain that there is a plurality of divinities?&quot;''&lt;br&gt;
::''&quot;Write!&quot;'' God replied. ''&quot;Whoever wishes to err will err...Instead, let them learn from their Creator Who created all, yet when He came to create Man He took council with the ministering angels.&quot;''

Regarding the creation of Man, God سبحانه وتعالى tells the angels that He is creating man. The angels questioned Him why would he create such a being that might cause destruction and bloodshed upon the earth. He replies that only He alone would understand the purpose of creating Man.
:''&quot;Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.&quot; '' They said: ''&quot;Will You place therein (man) and shed blood, while we (angels) glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You.&quot;'' He said: ''&quot;I know that which you do not know.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Baqarah:30]&lt;/sup&gt;

Thus, God سبحانه وتعالى taught that one should always consult others before embarking upon major new initiatives, and He was not deterred by the possibility that some might choose to find a sacrilegious implication in the verse. The implication of God's response, ''&quot;Whoever &lt;u&gt;wishes&lt;/u&gt; to err,&quot;'' is that one who sincerely seeks the truth will see it; one who looks for an excuse to blaspheme will find it.

And the text, ''&quot;...in our image,&quot;'', i.e. in Our Mold, meaning that God prepared the mold with which He would now shape man. To include, ''&quot;..., after our likeness.&quot;'' Referring to the power of understanding and intellect.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;

:''&quot;And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. –And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: 'I am going to create a man (Adamah) from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Hijr:26,28]&lt;/sup&gt;

God سبحانه وتعالى created the human body from the earth and from water combined, producing a clay; hence, the human body is made up of 70-75% water:
:''&quot;And it is He Who has created man from water, and has appointed for him kindred by blood, and kindred by marriage. And your Lord is Ever All-Powerful (to do what He wills).&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—''[Al-Furqân:54]''&lt;/sup&gt;

Also, illustrating the procreation of the human race...
:''&quot;Verily, We have created man from ''Nuftah'' ''[i.e. ''nuftatul amshajthe''–mixed discharges of sperm and egg intermingled]'' of man and woman, in order to try (test) him: so We made him hearer and seer. –Verily, We have showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Qiyamâh:2-3]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:27'''&lt;/sub&gt; So Elohim אלהים created Man in His image, in the image of Elohim אלהים He created him; male and female He created them.''&lt;/big&gt;

Just as Man is unique, so the manner of his creation was unique and exalted. Throughout the chapter of B'reishis (Genesis), God سبحانه وتعالى brought all things into being with an utterance of His Word, but He created Man with His own hands as it were.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:28'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים blessed them and Elohim אלהים said to them, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea, the bird of the sky, and every living thing that moves on the earth.&quot;''&lt;/big&gt;

In accordance with the Divine command, the world is to be inhabited...One who neglects this has abrogated a positive commandment, incurring great punishment, because he thereby demonstrates that he does not wish to comply with the Divine will to populate the world.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Sefer HaChinuch]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:29'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים said, &quot;Behold, I have given to you all herbage yielding seed that is on the surface of the entire earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit; it shall be yours for food—''&lt;/big&gt;

These verses together indicate that Man and beast shared the same herbal diet; Man was instructed &quot;...not to devour the flesh and consume the blood&quot; of the animals–eating them was strictly forbidden at that time. Such permission was granted to Noah, only after the Flood.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Sanhedrin 59b]''&lt;/sup&gt;

Curious mystery on the human anatomy: our appendices is considered an ''useless'' organ. It is a long thought that it once served as a secondary stomach used to help process the enzymes from the vegetation, essential for the human body to metabolize the protein into amino acids, and thenceforth–much similar to a cow, which has four stomachs used to digest its main food source for its body's needs; to include its nourishment from its milk through productive milk glands.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:30'''&lt;/sub&gt; —And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to everything that moves on the earth, within which there is a living soul, every green herb is for food.&quot; And it was so.''&lt;/big&gt;

The climax of the physical creation is at hand. Animal life was created first, and then Man, the being whose performance for good and ill would determine the destiny of the universe. This sequence implies that God سبحانه وتعالى was telling Adam, in effect, &quot;...the complete world is now in your hands. Your task is to make it function properly.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''1:31'''&lt;/sub&gt; And Elohim אלהים saw that He had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening and there was a morning, the sixth day.''&lt;/big&gt;

Maimonides comments on the text, ''&quot;...and behold it was very good.&quot;'' –Everything was fit for its purpose and able to act accordingly.

The Torah declares that Creation in its entirely was not only ''good'', as the individual components were described above, but it was ''very'' good. Something may be good in isolation, but not when it is combined with other things. God's work, however, are good in themselves and also with others.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Vilna Gaon]''&lt;/sup&gt; The components of Creation are even better in combination than they are individually.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Meshech Chochmah]''&lt;/sup&gt;

Even things that seem to be evil—such as suffering, death, temptation—appear to be only when viewed in isolation, but in total context of existence they can be seen as good, even ''very good''. If we could but perceive at one glance the entire picture of God's management of intertwining events, we would agree with this verdict.&lt;sup&gt;—''[R' Hirsch]''&lt;/sup&gt;

In other words, we see all the chaos in the world as an act of evil, but since everything is at the disposal of God's Will—it is He afterward causing all these catastrophe of events that are taking place—it is He Who only knows the good of what comes in the world.

The definite article ה, ''the'', before the word שִׁשִּׁי, ''sixth'', indicates that this day is distinguished from the other days of Creation, because this is the one in which all His productive work was completed.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Chizkuni]''&lt;/sup&gt;

:The word, ''Day'', is ''youm'', it is understood to be a long period of time—an era or eon—that a  &quot;six day&quot; creation may be viewed as six distinct ''periods'', or ''eons''.

''Rashi'' cites the Midrash that the application of distinction–the ''sixth day''–alludes to the sixth of the month Sivan, when the Torah would be given. It was because of that auspicious day that the world was created.

The verses that mention, ''&quot;six days&quot;'' , appears several other times in the Qur'an, each denoting a different measurement of time. Therefore, it can be interpreted by the description, the length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period. 

In one case, the measure of a day is equated with 50,000 years:
:''&quot;The angels and the Angel Gabriel ascends to Him in Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Ma'ârij:4]&lt;/sup&gt;

In another, one day is equal to a thousand years:
:''&quot;And they ask you to hasten on the torment!  And Allâh الله fails not His Promise.  And verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Hajj:47]&lt;/sup&gt;

Very interesting that we may consider this a scientific fact due to the ''warping'' of time in the universe.  Albert Einstein had strongly made an issue about his ''Theory of Relativity'', that time isn't constant.

===The Sabbath===
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:1'''&lt;/sub&gt; Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and all their array.''&lt;/big&gt;

The Sabbath is introduced with the declaration that the work of heaven and earth were complete, and that they stand before us in their final intended state of harmonious perfection. Then God سبحانه وتعالى proclaimed His Sabbath.

According to the Midrash, the term, ''&quot;..were finished,..&quot;'' homiletically relates to בִּלָּיוֹן, ''longing'', and בְּלִי, ''utensil''.  Heaven and earth and God Himself سبحانه وتعالى longed for the coming of the Sabbath, which would infuse the world with holiness.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Tzor HaMor]''&lt;/sup&gt; And the universe was created to serve as a tool for the service of God سبحانه وتعالى, a task that was compete with the advent of the Sabbath.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Sfas Emes]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:2'''&lt;/sub&gt; By the seventh day Elohim אלהים completed His work which He had done, and He abstained on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.''&lt;/big&gt;
:''&quot;He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then rose over the Throne. He knows that goes into the earth, and what comes forth from it, what descends  from the heaven, and what ascends thereto. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allâh الله is All-Seer of what you do.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Hadîd:4]&lt;/sup&gt;

After completing the Creation, God settled Himself upon the Throne to oversee His Work. There is no contradiction, but the meaning of ''rest'' is someone should not misinterpret.  God rested from ''physical'' creation, but He created the spiritual universe that comes into ''being'' every Sabbath. The world of the Sabbath is far above that of the six days it succeeds, but they are not separate from one another.

God سبحانه وتعالى  is never &quot;done&quot; with His Work–the process of Creation is ever-extant, it continues non-stop.  Each new child who is born, every seed that sprouts into a new sapling, every rain drop that falls from sky, every atom that bears its elemental structure, plays in part of the ongoing process of God's Creation.
:''&quot;We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;—[Qâf:38]&lt;/sup&gt;

The bridge between the mundane and the sacred, between the weekdays and the Sabbath, is Man. Adam and Eve were created last, just before the Sabbath, because Man has the intelligence and wisdom to bring the holiness of the Sabbath into the activities of the workweek.  Of all the creatures of the universe, only Man can ''create'' holiness. Angels ''are'' holy, but they are static, unchanging. They cannot improve themselves or the world. Only Man can do both.

The Sabbath is God's seal, and Man is the one who must impress it upon God's universe; indeed, Man's activities transform the universe from an apparently aimless amalgamation of matter into the mirror of God's Will.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:3'''&lt;/sub&gt; Elohim אלהים blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it He abstained from all His work which Elohim אלהים created to make.''&lt;/big&gt;

The Sabbath is a day saturated with purpose.  The Torah states that God سبحانه وتعالى sanctified it ''because on it He abstained from all His work'', implying that the essence of the day is to commemorate cessation from work, but in the very next phrase, the Torah says ''to make'', implying that accomplishment was simultaneous with rest.

===Adam and Eve===
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:4'''&lt;/sub&gt; These are the products of the heaven and the earth when they were created on the day that YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים made earth and heaven—''&lt;/big&gt; 

This is the first mention of the Hebrew four-letter 'Name of God', the Tetragrammaton '''י'''-'''ה'''-'''ו'''-'''ה''' (''YHWH''). This is also the proper 'Name of God'. In respect for its intense holiness, it is not pronounced as it is spelled. In Jewish scriptures, while in prayer or when reciting a verse, His Name is pronounced ''Adonay''. Otherwise,  it is referred to as ''H&lt;small&gt;ASHEM&lt;/small&gt;'', or 'The Name'.

The first account of Creation &lt;small&gt;[see ''1 B'reishis (Genesis 1)'']&lt;/small&gt;, God سبحانه وتعالى created the World exclusively with the Attribute of Justice [''Elohim'' אלהים], because the ideal state is for Man to be judged according to his deeds, without a need for special mercy.  God سبحانه وتعالى knew that Man cannot survive without His Mercy and Forbearance. Therefore He added the Name יהוה to signify ''mercy'', to teach that He would temper justice with compassion.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi ''to 1:1'']''&lt;/sup&gt;

:The Name יהוה denotes His Attribute of Mercy, also which signifies the Eternity of God سبحانه وتعالى, because its letters are also those of the words, הָיָה הוֶה וְיִהְיֶה, ''He was, is, and will be''. In the words of Maimonides's fourth principle of faith, God سبحانه وتعالى &quot;is the very first and the very last.&quot; Which also reflects the Greek phrase, τὸ Α καὶ τὸ Ω, ''I am the Alpha and the Omega'', in the Book of Revelations of the New Testament.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Revelations 1:8]''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, الأول, ''al-Awwal'', and الأخر, ''al-Akhir'', literally rendered as &quot;the First&quot;, and &quot;the Last&quot;, appears in the Qur'an.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Al-Ḥadīd:3]''&lt;/sup&gt; Everything in the created universe must have a moment when it came into existence, but God سبحانه وتعالى is infinite.; He transcends time. In recognition of this concept, the Tetragrammaton is often translated, the &quot;Eternal One&quot;.

The Creation of Man that was narrated in the first Chapter of B'reishis (Genesis) was to be described in a very brief and sketchy detail because God سبحانه وتعالى did not intend for Man to understand the entire process of Creation–it's beyond human capacity–but to recognize that He  is the Creator.&lt;sup&gt;''—[B'chor Shor]''&lt;/big&gt;

The Torah reverts to elaborating on the narrative by focusing on events of that which led to the emergence of Man.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Akeidas Yitzochok]''&lt;/big&gt;

This narrative leads to the incident of the Tree of Life and Tree of Knowledge, it begins by describing how plant life came about.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Radak]''&lt;/big&gt;

According to the Midrash, the letters of the phrase, בהבראם ''&quot;..when they were created..&quot;'', can also be arranged to spell באברהם, meaning that God سبحانه وتعالى created the world ''for the sake of Abraham''.  Abraham ليه السلام was the epitome of kindness, one of the pillars of the world.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Zohar]''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:5'''&lt;/sub&gt; —now all the trees of the field were not yet on the earth and all the herb of the field had not sprouted, for YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים had not sent rain upon the earth and there was no man to work the soil.''&lt;/big&gt;

He had not sent rain because ''there was no man to work the soil'', and no one to recognize the utility of rain. But when Adam was created, he recognized its importance for the world. He prayed, and rain fell, causing the trees and vegetation to spring forth.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/big&gt;

Plant life has already been created and was waiting just below the surface for Adam to pray &lt;small&gt;[see: First Account—Third Day (§1:12)]&lt;/small&gt;. This demonstrates a basic article of faith: God provides what Man needs, but it is up to Man to pray and otherwise carry out his spiritual responsibilities. As the Talmudic Sages say regarding the Matriarchs: Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah were each, by nature, incapable of bearing children. God created them that way because He knew that they and their husbands would pray for children, and God سبحانه وتعالى desires the prayers of the righteous.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:6'''&lt;/sub&gt; A mist ascended from the earth and watered the whole surface of the soil.''&lt;/big&gt;

Allegorically, before the ''Great Deluge [Flood]'', rain did not fall upon the face of the earth, but instead, a mist moistened the vegetation, by the whim of Adam's prayers to God سبحانه وتعالى. It is perceived to be likened to the dew saturating the ground which one would find in the morning. Earth was a tropical utopia with warm and pleasant climate all-year round.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:7'''&lt;/sub&gt;―And YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים formed the man of dust from the ground, and He blew into his nostrils the soul of life; and man became a living being.''&lt;/big&gt;

These verses describe the preliminary steps of Adam's creation: God caused the deep to rise, forming the low-flying clouds, filled with water to moisten the dust—into a manner of clay—from which Adam was created. It is similar to a kneader who first pours in water and then kneads the dough. Here, too: First, He ''watered the soil'' &lt;small&gt;[B'res 2:6]&lt;/small&gt;, and then He ''formed Man''. God thus made Man out of both lower [earthly] and upper [heavenly] matter: his body from the ground and his soul from the spirit, created by the Decree of God سبحانه وتعالى.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Rashi]''&lt;/sup&gt;

:In the words of the ''Zohar'':
:&quot;One who blows, blows within himself,&quot; indicating that Man's soul is part of God's essence, as it were. This soul made Man ''a living being'', which Talmudic philosopher ''Onkelos'' defines as a ''speaking spirit''. Accordingly, the life that is unique to Man and which only  God سبحانه وتعالى could &quot;blow&quot; into him is the rational soul that inclines the power of intelligent speech. This is what elevates a human above animal life: the ability, and therefore the responsibility, to use his intelligence in God's service.

God سبحانه وتعالى commanded the angels to bow down before Adam, but Lucifer [Satan] refused to do so and disobeyed Him.
:''And (remember) when We said to the angels: &quot;Prostrate yourselves before Adam.&quot; And they prostrated except ''Iblîs'' [Shaitân], he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allâh).''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Baqarah:34]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:8'''&lt;/sub&gt; YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים planted a garden in Eden, to the east, and placed therein the man whom He had formed.''&lt;/big&gt;

First the Torah describes the Garden, which was created especially for Man; then, in verse 15, it resumes the story of Adam and Eve.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Or HaChaim]''&lt;/sup&gt; God سبحانه وتعالى formed Adam outside the garden so that he would see the world of thorns and thistles; only did God سبحانه وتعالى lead him into the garden, so that he would see the alternatives before he was given his ''first'' commandment.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Chizkuni]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:9'''&lt;/sub&gt; And YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים caused to sprout from the ground every tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food; also the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.''&lt;/big&gt;

As Adam and Eve were originally created, their natural impulse was to do 'good'. Although they knew in the abstract that there was such a thing as ''sin''. it was not something they craved. The tree that of which was forbidden by God سبحانه وتعالى embodied both a ''mixture'' of good and evil—for that reason it bears its name, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  They both brought evil into themselves and made it part of their nature, which also the nature of Man. From then on, Man was born with evil impulses, such as greed, selfishness, and lust for whatever suits his developing appetite. Through study, thought, and self-discipline, he must harness his base nature and desires, and implant into himself a desire for good and an abomination of evil.

It may also refer to a Man's impure ability to choose what is apparently sweet [''good''], even though it is harmful to him; and to reject what is evidently bitter [''bad''], even when it is truly beneficial.&lt;sup&gt;—''[Sforno]''&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:10'''&lt;/sub&gt; A river issues forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it is divided and becomes four headwaters. &lt;sub&gt;'''2:11'''&lt;/sub&gt; The name of the first is Pishon, the one that encircles the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.  &lt;sub&gt;'''2:12'''&lt;/sub&gt; The gold of that land is good; the bedolach is there, and the shoham stone.''&lt;/big&gt;

הַבְּרלת Bedolach is a gem that is identified as either crystal, according to ''Rashi'', or pearl, cited by ''Ibn Ezra''.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:13'''&lt;/sub&gt; The name of the second river is Gihon, the one that encircles the whole land of Cush. &lt;sub&gt;'''2:14'''&lt;/sub&gt; The name of the third river is Hiddekel, the one that flows toward the east of Assyria; and the fourth river is the Euphrates. ''&lt;/big&gt;

===Man in the Garden===
&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:15'''&lt;/sub&gt; YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden, to work it and to guard it. &lt;sub&gt;'''2:16'''&lt;/sub&gt; And YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים commanded the man, saying &quot;Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely;—''&lt;/big&gt;

Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden ''to work and to guard it.'' The Midrash interprets this indirectly, since the Torah mentioned above that the trees in the garden grew of their own accord and the river provided the necessary irrigation. Rather, Adam was to work the garden through the study of Torah and the performance of positive commandments, and to guard it by refraining from forbidden activities.&lt;small&gt;—''[Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer]''&lt;/small&gt;

This means that Man's task in this world is to serve God سبحانه وتعالى. If he does that, then his material needs will be satisfied, as Adam's were in Eden in the beginning, for to think that only physical exertion can bring success is to believe in an illusion. 

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:17'''&lt;/sub&gt; —but of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, you must not eat thereof; for on the day you eat of it, you shall surely die.&quot;''&lt;/big&gt;

In other words, it is believed that God سبحانه وتعالى was generally stating,
:...on that day the evil impulses of jealousy, lust, and honor will be aroused within you, making it impossible for you to attain the goal of complete spirituality as long as you are still on earth. Thus, eternal life will be an intolerable burden for you.&lt;small&gt;—''[Malbim]''&lt;/small&gt;

Since Adam lived to the age of 930, it is clear that he was not to die as soon as ate the fruit. Rather, he would become ''subject'' to death, whereas if he had never sinned, his holiness would have kept him alive forever.
:''And We said: &quot;O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as where you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the ''Zâlimûn'' (wrong-doers).''&lt;sup&gt;—[Al-Baqarah:35]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:18'''&lt;/sub&gt; YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים said, &quot;It is not good that man be alone; I will make him a helper corresponding to him.&quot;''&lt;/big&gt;

God سبحانه وتعالى knew that Adam needed a companion. Her purpose was not for reproduction, for Adam had been created with that function. Rather, God سبحانه وتعالى wanted Adam to have the companionship, support, and challenge that is present in good marriages, and He wanted the children who would be born to Adam and his future mate to be reared by both a father and a mother. The needs for such assets in human life are too obvious to require elaboration.

עֵזֶר בְּנֶגְרּוּ—''A helper corresponding to him'' [lit. ''a helper against him'']. If the man is worth, the woman will be a ''helper''; if he is unworthy, she will be against him.&lt;sup&gt;''—[Yevamos 63a]''&lt;/sup&gt; Many have noted that the ideal marriage is not necessarily one of which the couple maintain total agreements in all matters. Often it is the wife's responsibility to oppose her husband and prevent him from acting foolishly, or to help him achieve a common course by questioning, criticizing, and discussing issues pertaining to her husband. Thus, the verse means literally that there are at times a wife can ''best'' be a helper by being beneficially against him. Similarly to the issue discerning Prophet Abraham عليه السلام ,in which God سبحانه وتعالى advised him to listen to the wisdom of his spouse.&lt;sup&gt;''[see ''21 B'reishis:12'']&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:19'''&lt;/sub&gt; Now, YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים had formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man called each living creature, that remained its name. ''&lt;/big&gt;

Before creating Adam's helpmate, G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى brought all the creatures to him so that he could see for himself that none was suited to his needs, and ''he'' would ask for a companion. Then he would appreciate his newly fashioned mate and not take her for granted. However, as each creature was brought to Adam, he did not quintessentially ''name'' the animals accordingly to their kind and quality; by names (''asmâˀ''), it is not simply a convenient convention, or ''understanding''. God سبحانه وتعالى then told the angels to also name each one accordingly, such as Adam as successfully done. It displayed human's capacity of intellect endowed by G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى, the power of knowledge in contrast the angels has no capacity. It was because Adam had the ability to reflect upon the creatures nature, and their role alongside their essential reality, given in the total scheme of the universe. It was to prove that the earth and everything contained within universe is for the ''purpose'' of Man. The names had a profound significance that expressed their mission. Adam had the power to recognize the essence of every animal and name it accordingly. It is this knowledge that humans have higher status over angels, because it can range from knowledge of the most outward aspect of the reality of an object, to its most exalted, or inward, aspect as it resides in G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; Himself. Human knowledge cannot of course encompass all things, it relates a spiritual and physical connection to nature and earth, our primal knowledge that G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى has instilled into humankind. As the angels were not ideally created for that particular purpose, they therefore wouldn't possess the ability to known the names and therefore impossible for angels to recognize their essential reality.
:''And He taught Adam all the names (of everything), then He showed them [the ''animals''] to the angels and said, &quot;Tell me the names of these if you are truthful.&quot;  —They (angels) said: &quot;Glorified are You we have no knowledge except what you have taught us.  Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;''—[Al-Baqarah:31–32]''&lt;/sup&gt;

According to the Principle of Adequation, the faculties of the knower must be adequate to the object to be known. Humans has been created in such manner that there exists within him a hierarchy of inherent power and ability ranging from the outward senses, to the highest level of intellect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasr Science&quot;/&gt; Humans are able to know all levels of reality, from the lowly sand pepple, to the O&lt;small&gt;NE&lt;/small&gt;, the Absolute, to Whom has created the Heavens and the Earth and everything in between. It is the instilled capacity withing humans to know the created order–not only on the level of physical reality–but also on all levels of existence reaching ultimately to the Divine; it is an unique ability that the angels clearly do not possess. However, due to having this insight, he realized that none of them corresponded to his essence, socially and intellectually.
:''&quot;And the man assigned names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field; but as for man, he did not find a helper corresponding to him.&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;''—[B'reishit 2:20]''&lt;/sup&gt;


-------------

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:21'''&lt;/sub&gt; So YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים cast a deep sleep upon the man and he slept; and He took one of his sides and He filled in flesh in its place. &lt;sub&gt;'''2:22'''&lt;/sub&gt; Then YHWH Elohim יהוה אלהים fashioned the side that He had taken from the man into a woman, and He brought her to the man.''&lt;/big&gt;

Unlike man's, the woman's body was not taken from the earth. God built one side of man into woman—so that the single human being became two, thereby demonstrating irrefutably the equality of man and woman.&lt;small&gt;—''[R' Hirsch]''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:23'''&lt;/sub&gt; And the man said, &quot;This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called Woman, for from man was she taken.&quot;''&lt;/big&gt;

Adam named her gender ''Ishah'' [Woman], because she was taken from ''Ish'' [Man]; left unanswered, however, is why Man is called ''Ish''.  Either the name derives from ''eish'' or fire [אֵשׁ ''or'' אִישׁ], because Man is unique among all living beings in the characteristics symbolized by fire: verve and enthusiasm, lust and initiative. These characteristics enable Man to achieve dominance, attain wisdom, and develop culture. But the same fire can cause the mass destruction that has marred humanity almost since the beginning of time. Controlled and directed, that fire can created spiritual kingdoms that surpass the angels.

:The presence of Godliness in human beings is expressed by the letters that are added to their names: a י in the name אִישׁ and a ה in the name of אִשָּׁה. Those two letters spell the Divine Name יָהּ—because God سبحانه وتعالى must be present in the union of a man and wife. If they allow Him in, their union is Godly; if not, they are left with אֵשׁ, a destructive ''fire'', that will not only harm their own relationship, but may well unleash a conflagration that will harm all around them.

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:24'''&lt;/sub&gt; Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife—''&lt;/big&gt;

This doesn't imply that a man should not continue to serve or honor his parents, only a ''physical'' separation; that his attachment to his wife should be so strong that he will move out of his parents' house and establish a new home with her.&lt;small&gt;—''[R' Hirsch; R' Meyuchas]''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'' —and they shall become one flesh.''&lt;/big&gt;

Let him cling to his wife and to none other, because man and wife are in reality one flesh, as they were at the beginning of Creation (''Tur''). But that can happen only if they also become one mind, one heart, one soul...and if they subordinate all their strength and effort to the service of God سبحانه وتعالى.&lt;small&gt;—''[R' Hirsch]''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;'''2:25'''&lt;/sub&gt; They were both naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed.''&lt;/big&gt;

This is an indication of the purity of Adam and Eve. People are ashamed of their nakedness because they associate vileness and lust with their genitals. But not Adam and Eve.

They used all their organs [''sexual'' organs] exclusively to do God's Will, not to satisfy their personal desires. To them, even cohabitation was as innocent as eating and drinking, so they had no reason to cover their bodies.&lt;small&gt;—''[Sforno]''&lt;/small&gt;

-----------------

But what we ''do'' know is that Adam and Ḥawwâ (Eve)—the forerunners of humanity had the mission of bringing about the fulfillment of Creation by carrying out G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s commandments. They failed, and were driven to exile. The mission did not change, however, only the condition in which it would be carried out. G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى punished the transgressors, but through His Mercy and Compassion, He did not discard them. They were given to lesson of repentance; indeed, the concept of repentance is a prerequisite to our very existence, because we plainly cannot survive without G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s Oft-Forgiveness and Grace. This is the major lesson that we must take from the Creation narrations in the texts: Humans [Man and Woman] may sin, but are given the potential and opportunity to come back, and G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; سبحانه وتعالى allows us the opportunity and inspiration to do so.

===The Re-creation (Gap) Theory===
[[File:Re-creation (Gap) Theory.png|450px|thumb|right|&lt;big&gt;'''View 1:''' Re-creation (Gap) Theory&lt;/big&gt;]]
This argument maintains the view of the original creation of the earth&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:1&quot;&gt;In the beginning of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s creating the heavens and the earth…—&lt;small&gt;'''[B'reshit 1:1]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the fall of ha-Satan&lt;ref&gt;How are you fallen from Heaven, O Shining One, son of Dawn! How are you felled to earth, O vanquisher of nations! • Once you thought in your heart, &quot;I will climb to the sky; Higher than the stars of God I will set my throne. I will sit in the mount of assembly, On the summit of Zaphon: I will mount the back of a cloud—I will match the Most High!&quot; • Instead, you are brought down to Sheol, to the bottom of the Pit.—&lt;small&gt;'''[Isaiah 14:12–15]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a result of ha-Satan's fall&lt;ref&gt;…Thus said the Lord G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and flawless beauty. • You were in Eden, the garden of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;; every precious stone was your adornment:… • I created you as a cherub with outstretched shielding wings; and you resided on G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s holy mountain; you walked among stones of fire. • You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until wrongdoing was found in you. • By your far-flung commerce you were filled with lawlessness and you sinned. So I have struck you down from the mountain of G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;, and I have destroyed you, O shielding cherub, from among the stones of fire. • You grew haughty because of your beauty, you debased your wisdom for the sake of your splendor; I have cast you to the ground, I have made you an object for kings to stare at. • By the greatness of your guilt, through the dishonesty of your trading, you desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire issue from you, and it has devoured you; I have reduced you to ashes on the ground, in the sight of all who behold you. • All who knew you among the peoples are appalled at your doom. You have become a horror and have ceased to be, forever.—&lt;small&gt;'''[Ezekiel 28:12–19]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, the earth lost its original state of beauty and bliss, and is found in a state of chaos&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:1&quot;/&gt;.

It also views that ha-Satan's fall is the 'gap' explained, between the verses contained in the first chapter of ''B'reshit'', verse 1 and 2&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:2&quot;&gt;—when the earth was astonishingly empty, with darkness upon the surface of the deep, and the Divine Presence hovered upon the surface of the waters,…—&lt;small&gt;'''[B'reshit 1:2]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the Torah.

It however must explain the time period contained within the gap thereof, to help harmonize the creation account with modern scientific theory{{ref|reference_name_B|b}}.

===Initial Chaos Theory===
[[File:Initial Chaos Theory.png|250px|thumb|right|&lt;big&gt;'''View 2:''' Initial Chaos Theory&lt;/big&gt;]]

This argument briefly holds that the accounts portrayed in ''B'reshit'' (or ''Genesis''), verse 1,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:1&quot;/&gt; would be an 'independent' introductory statement, set aside differently from verse 2.  Verse 2 would describe the state of the initial creation as unformed and unfilled&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:2&quot;/&gt;.

In other words, the universe is like untouched potter's clay, before the sculptor begins to fashion it.

The creation is not in an evil state, as the result of catastrophic fall, but merely in its initial unformed state, like a lump of clay in the potter's hands.

Verse 3  of the first chapter of ''B'reshit'', and the following, begin to describe G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s working and fashioning of the mass, transforming it from &quot;chaos to cosmos&quot;.{{ref|reference_name_C|c}}

===Procreation Chaos Theory===
[[File:Procreation Chaos Theory.png|325px|thumb|right|&lt;big&gt;'''View 3:''' Procreation Chaos Theory&lt;/big&gt;]]

This argument holds the view that verse 1&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:1&quot;/&gt; is understood either as a 'dependent' clause (&quot;When G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; began to create...&quot;) or as an 'independent' introductory summary statement (&quot;In the beginning G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; created...&quot;).

The creation account summarized in verse 1, begins in verse 2&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen 1:2&quot;/&gt;. This &quot;creation&quot; is not ''ex nihilo'', but out of the stuff existing in verse 2. Where this comes from is not explained in these verses.

In effect, this view holds that the chaotic state does not occur between verses 1 and 2, but before verse 1 of an unspecified time. The absolute origin of matter is, then, not the subject of the &quot;creation&quot; account of the first chapter of ''B'reshit'' (or ''Genesis''), but only the relative beginning of the world and civilization as we know it today.{{ref|reference_name_B|b}}

==Dimensional Time &amp; the Cosmos==
&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-An'am:73]—'''&lt;/small&gt;He is the One who created the heavens and the earth, truthfully. Whenever He says, &quot;Be,&quot; it is. His word is the absolute truth.

&lt;small&gt;'''[Adh-Dhâriyât:47]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We constructed the sky with our hands, and we will continue to expand it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Hajj:47]—'''&lt;/small&gt;They challenge you to bring retribution, and G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; never fails to fulfill His prophecy. A day of your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; is like a thousand of your years.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Ma'ârij:3-4]—'''&lt;/small&gt;From G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;; Possessor of the highest Height. • The angels, with their reports, climb to Him in a day that equals fifty thousand years.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Fussilat:11]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Then He turned to the sky, when it was still gas, and said to it, and to the earth, &quot;Come into existence, willingly or unwillingly.&quot; They said, &quot;We come willingly.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Isrâ:44]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Glorifying Him are the seven universes, the earth, and everyone in them. There is nothing that does not glorify Him, but you do not understand their glorification. He is Clement, Forgiver.&lt;br&gt;

Thus, the evolutionists will be shown on the Day of Judgment that life did not just ''evolve'' on the planet because of its particular circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; The commands flow among them. This is to let you know that G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; is Omnipotent, and that G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; is fully aware of all things.&lt;br&gt;

The night overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently, and the sun, the moon, and the stars are committed to serve by His command. Absolutely, He controls all creation and all commands.

The provision of food, water, and oxygen for the earth's inhabitants had to be precisely calculated and arranged.&lt;/ref&gt;—and His (earthly) domain&lt;ref&gt;{Also translated as} &quot;His Throne&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; was completely covered with water&lt;ref&gt;[11:7] The earth was initially covered with water.

The Arabic for ''He rolls'' (Yukawwir) is derived from the Arabic word for ''ball'' (Kurah). Since the Earth is not exactly round, a specific reference to its shape is given in 79:30. The Quran is replete with scientific information that became known to us centuries after the revelation of the Quran. (See Appendix 20).&lt;/ref&gt; He committed the sun and the moon, each running for a finite period. Absolutely, He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Ra'ad:2]—'''&lt;/small&gt;G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; is the One who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see, then assumed all authority. He committed the sun and the moon, each running (in its orbit) for a predetermined period. He controls all things, and explains the revelations, that you may attain certainty about meeting your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;.

&lt;small&gt;'''[Ibrâhîm:33]—'''&lt;/small&gt;He has committed the sun and the moon in your service, continuously. He has committed the night and the day to serve you.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[An-Naḥl:12]—'''&lt;/small&gt;And He commits, in your service, the night and the day, as well as the sun and the moon. Also, the stars are committed by His command. These are (sufficient) proofs for people who understand.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Anbiyâ:33]—'''&lt;/small&gt;And He is the One who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each floating in its own orbit.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-‘Ankabût:61]—'''&lt;/small&gt;If you ask them, &quot;Who created the heavens and the earth, and put the sun and the moon in your service,&quot; they will say, &quot;G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;.&quot; Why then did they deviate?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Luqman:29]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Do you not realize that G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night, and that He has committed the sun and the moon in your service, each running in its orbit for a specific life span, and that G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; is fully Cognizant of everything you do?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Mala'ikah/Fâṭir:13]—'''&lt;/small&gt;He merges the night into the day, and merges the day into the night. He has committed the sun and the moon to run for a predetermined period of time. Such is G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;; to Him belongs all kingship. Any idols you set up beside Him do not possess as much as a seed's shell.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Ya-Sîn:39]—'''&lt;/small&gt;The moon we designed to appear in stages, until it becomes like an old curved sheath.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Ya-Sîn:40]—'''&lt;/small&gt;The sun is never to catch up with the moon - the night and the day never deviate - each of them is floating in its own orbit.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Inshiqaq:18]—'''&lt;/small&gt;And the moon and its phases.&lt;br&gt;

===Rebellion of Iblîs (ha-Shayṭān)===
&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Baqarah:30]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Recall that your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; said to the angels, &quot;I am placing a representative vicegerent on Earth.&quot; They said, &quot;Will You place therein one who will spread evil therein and shed blood, while we sing Your praises, glorify You, and uphold Your absolute authority?&quot; He said, &quot;I know what you do not know.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Baqarah:34]—'''&lt;/small&gt;When we said to the angels, &quot;Fall prostrate before Adam,&quot; they fell prostrate, except ha-Shayṭān; he refused, was too arrogant, and a disbeliever.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-A'arâf:11–18]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We created you, then we shaped you, then we said to the angels, &quot;Fall prostrate before Adam.&quot; They fell prostrate, except Iblîs; he was not with the prostrators. • He said, &quot;What prevented you from prostrating when I ordered you?&quot; He said, &quot;I am better than he; You created me from fire, and created him from mud.&quot; • He said, &quot;Therefore, you must go down, for you are not to be arrogant here. Get out; you are debased.&quot; • He said, &quot;Grant me a respite, until the Day of Resurrection.&quot; • He said, &quot;You are granted a respite.&quot; • He said, &quot;Since You have willed that I go astray,&lt;ref&gt;[7:16] ha-Shayṭān is a proven liar, and so are his constituents (see ''2:36'', ''6:22–23'', &amp; ''7:20–22'').&lt;/ref&gt; I will skulk for them on Your straight path. • &quot;I will come to them from before them, and from behind them, and from their right, and from their left, and You will find that most of them are unappreciative.&quot; • He said, &quot;Get out therefrom, despised and defeated. Those among them who follow you, I will fill Hell with you all.&lt;br&gt;
ta&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Isrâ/Bani Isra'il:61–65]—'''&lt;/small&gt;When we said to the angels, &quot;Fall prostrate before Adam,&quot; they fell prostrate, except ha-Shayṭān. He said, &quot;Shall I prostrate to one You created from mud?&quot; • He said, &quot;Since You have honored him over me, if You respite me till the Day of Resurrection, I will possess all his descendants, except a few.&quot; • He said, &quot;Then go; you and those who follow you will end up in Hell as your requital; an equitable requital. • &quot;You may entice them with your voice, and mobilize all your forces and all your men against them, and share in their money and children, and promise them. Anything the devil promises is no more than an illusion. • &quot;As for My servants, you have no power over them.&quot; Your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; suffices as an advocate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Kahf:50]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We said to the angels, &quot;Fall prostrate before Adam.&quot; They fell prostrate, except ha-Shayṭān. He became a jinn, for he disobeyed the order of His L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[18:50] When the great feud in the heavenly society took place, all host of heaven became classified into angels, jinns, and humans.&lt;/ref&gt; Will you choose him and his descendants as lords instead of Me, even though they are your enemies? What a miserable substitute!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Tâ-Hâ:115–116]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We tested Adam in the past, but he forgot, and we found him indecisive.&lt;ref&gt;[20:115] When ha-Shayṭān challenged G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s absolute authority, you and I did not make a firm stand against ha-Shayṭān. G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; is giving us a chance, on this earth, to redeem ourselves by denouncing ha-Shayṭān and upholding G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s absolute authority.&lt;/ref&gt; •  Recall that we said to the angels, &quot;Fall prostrate before Adam.&quot; They fell prostrate, except ha-Shayṭān; he refused.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Hijr:30–43]—'''&lt;/small&gt;The angels fell prostrate; all of them, • except Iblîs (ha-Shayṭān). He refused to be with the prostrators. • He said, &quot;O Iblîs (ha-Shayṭān), why are you not with the prostrators?&quot; • He said, &quot;I am not to prostrate before a human being, whom You created from aged mud, like the potter's clay.&quot; • He said, &quot;Therefore, you must get out; you are banished. • &quot;You have incurred My condemnation until the Day of Judgment.&quot; • He said, &quot;My L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;, respite me until the day they are resurrected.&quot; • He said, &quot;You are respited. • &quot;Until the specified day and time.&quot; • He said, &quot;My L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;, since You have willed that I go astray, I will surely entice them on earth; I will send them all astray. • &quot;Except those among Your worshipers who are devoted absolutely to You alone.&quot; • He said, &quot;This is a law that is inviolable. • &quot;You have no power over My servants. You only have power over the strayers who follow you. • &quot;And Hell awaits them all.&lt;br&gt;

==Adamic Period; Adam and Eve==
&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Hijr:26]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We created the human being from aged mud, like the potter's clay.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Hijr:28–29]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; said to the angels, &quot;I am creating a human being from aged mud, like the potter's clay. • &quot;Once I perfect him, and blow into him from My spirit, you shall fall prostrate before him.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Sâd:67–69]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Say, &quot;Here is awesome news.• &quot;That you are totally oblivious to. • &quot;I had no knowledge previously, about the feud in the High Society.&lt;ref&gt;[38:69] The feud in the High Society was triggered by ha-Satan's challenge to G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s absolute authority. This is definitely the most important event in the history of the human race. We failed to make a firm stand regarding G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;'s absolute authority. This life represents the third and final chance to redeem ourselves (See the Introduction and Appendix 7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Sâd:70–72]—'''&lt;/small&gt;&quot;I am inspired that my sole mission is to deliver the warnings to you.&quot; • Your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; said to the angels, &quot;I am creating a human being from clay. • &quot;Once I design him, and blow into him from My spirit, you shall fall prostrate before him.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Baqarah:31–33]—'''&lt;/small&gt;He taught Adam all the names then presented them to the angels, saying, &quot;Give me the names of these, if you are right.&quot; • They said, &quot;Be You glorified, we have no knowledge, except that which You have taught us.  You are the Omniscient, Most Wise.&quot; • He said, &quot;O Adam, tell them their names.&quot; When he told them their names, He said, &quot;Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? I know what you declare, and what you conceal.&quot;&lt;br&gt; 

===Garden of Eden===
&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Baqarah:34–38]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We said, &quot;O Adam, live with your wife in Paradise, and eat therefrom generously, as you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you sin.&quot; • But the devil duped them, and caused their eviction therefrom. We said, &quot;Go down as enemies of one another. On Earth shall be your habitation and provision for awhile.&quot; • Then, Adam received from his L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; words, whereby He redeemed him. He is the Redeemer, Most Merciful. • We said, &quot;Go down therefrom, all of you. When guidance comes to you from Me, those who follow My guidance will have no fear, nor will they grieve.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-A'arâf:19–25]—'''&lt;/small&gt;&quot;As for you, Adam, dwell with your wife in Paradise, and eat therefrom as you please, but do not approach this one tree, lest you fall in sin.&quot; • The devil whispered to them, in order to reveal their bodies, which were invisible to them. He said, &quot;Your L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; did not forbid you from this tree, except to prevent you from becoming angels, and from attaining eternal existence.&quot; • He swore to them, &quot;I am giving you good advice.&quot; • He thus duped them with lies. As soon as they tasted the tree, their bodies became visible to them, and they tried to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. Their L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; called upon them: &quot;Did I not enjoin you from that tree, and warn you that the devil is your most ardent enemy?&quot; • They said, &quot;Our L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;, we have wronged our souls, and unless You forgive us and have mercy on us, we will be losers.&quot; • He said, &quot;Go down as enemies of one another. On earth shall be your habitation and provision for awhile.&quot; • He said, &quot;On it you will live, on it you will die, and from it you will be brought out.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''[Tâ-Hâ:117–123]—'''&lt;/small&gt;We then said, &quot;O Adam, this is an enemy of you and your wife. Do not let him evict you from Paradise, lest you become miserable. • &quot;You are guaranteed never to hunger therein, nor go unsheltered. • &quot;Nor will you thirst therein, nor suffer from any heat.&quot; • But the devil whispered to him, saying, &quot;O Adam, let me show you the tree of eternity and unending kingship.&quot; • They ate from it, whereupon their bodies became visible to them, and they tried to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. Adam thus disobeyed his L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;, and fell. • Subsequently, his L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; chose him, redeemed him, and guided him. • He said, &quot;Go down therefrom, all of you. You are enemies of one another. When guidance comes to you from Me, anyone who follows My guidance will not go astray, nor suffer any misery.&lt;br&gt;

===Post-Exilic Period===
====Cain and Abel====
&lt;small&gt;'''[Al-Ma'ida 27–31]—'''&lt;/small&gt;Recite for them the true history of Adam's two sons. They made an offering, and it was accepted from one of them, but not from the other. He said, &quot;I will surely kill you.&quot; He said, &quot;G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; accepts only from the righteous. • &quot;If you extend your hand to kill me, I am not extending my hand to kill you. For I reverence G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt;, L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; of the universe. • &quot;I want you, not me, to bear my sin and your sin, then you end up with the dwellers of Hell. Such is the requital for the transgressors.&quot; • His ego provoked him into killing his brother. He killed him, and ended up with the losers. • G&lt;small&gt;OD&lt;/small&gt; then sent a raven to scratch the soil, to teach him how to bury his brother's corpse. He said, &quot;Woe to me; I failed to be as intelligent as this raven, and bury my brother's corpse.&quot; He became ridden with remorse.&lt;br&gt;

===Bibliography===
Herschel. Hershel, Abraham J. “The Prophets.” 4th Ed.; Harper &amp; Row, 1962.
Preface and Introduction. The book reflects mostly on the divine pathos, loosely considered the ‘emotions’ of the Divine (deity). This essay adopts conclusions from Herschel’s Preface and Introduction, and stresses lightly on the pathos.  The author [essay] has some minor distinctive disagreements of Herschel’s definition and usage of pathos, although the essay does not cover the difference of opinion of the author and Herschel, the author solely sets apart the concepts of pathos in the manner of discussion.
 
JPS. “Hebrew-English Tanakh”. 2nd Ed.; Jewish Publication Society (JPS), 1917, 1999.
The Traditional Hebrew Text and the ‘New JPS Translation’. The author utilizes the JPS for academic reasons of the Masoretic text, for the reader’s intention of maintaining easy understanding. Special cases may occur where the author [essay] will translate the Hebrew text by personal knowledge of Classical Hebrew—author feels that the pertaining verses of the JPS Tanakh may have slight inaccurate translation in the rendered Masoretic meaning. Author’s intention is to imply certain phrases and/or words to be translated as accurate to English meaning as possible without hindering the true meaning of the Semitic trilateral root.

Greek NT. Word Study: Greek-English New Testament. &quot;Greek New Testament&quot;, 3rd. Ed.; United Bibles Societies, 1966, 1983

I came across this book and see that it has been tagged for merging with [[Algebra]] and [[Linear Algebra]].  Yet, looking through every page that is linked to from the main book page, every page is a stub and so there is no content to merge, period.  If the topics in this book will be covered by [[Algebra]] or [[Linear Algebra]], then the book appears to be redundant.--- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] ([[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]) 22:38, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''.  Not only is it a stub, but the sections &quot;Ellipses&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Hyperbolas&quot; are actually topics of [[Conic Sections]], so the book's planned contents are inappropriate.  &quot;Matrices&quot; belongs only in [[Linear Algebra]], and all of the &quot;Functions&quot; belong in an introductory [[Algebra]].  Furthermore, there's no difference in scope/audience/difficulty between [[Algebra 2]] and [[Algebra]], so there's no need for another book.  Basically, [[Algebra 2]] is worthless.  --&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 23:05, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' Just because schools traditionally split the teaching of Algebra into 2 years does not mean we should have two different textbooks on what is a single subject. Since the book's creation in 2007, it has remained a barren husk of no use whatsoever. Let us get rid of it.

[[Image:Marywollstonecraft.jpg|right|thumb|John Opie, ''Mary Wollstonecraft,'' (c. 1797)]]'''Mary Wollstonecraft''' (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was an eighteenth-century British writer, philosopher, and feminist. During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for ''[[Feminism/A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.

Among the general public and specifically among feminists, Wollstonecraft's life has received much more attention than her writing because of her unconventional and often tumultuous personal relationships. After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement; they had one daughter, Mary Godwin (later Mary Shelley), who would go on to author ''Frankenstein''. Wollstonecraft died at the age of thirty-eight due to complications from childbirth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts.

After Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published a memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding [[Feminism/Philosophers|feminist philosophers]], and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.

==Early life==
Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 9, 17, 24, 27; Sunstein, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 1; Tomalin, 19; Wardle, 6; Sunstein, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 45–57; Tomalin, 34–43; Wardle, 27–30; Sunstein, 80-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft's early life. The first was with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden's father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft reveled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: &quot;I have formed romantic notions of friendship…I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In some of Wollstonecraft's letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Todd, 72–75; Tomalin, 18–21; Sunstein, 22-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and more important friendship was with Fanny Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 22–24; Tomalin, 25–27; Wardle, 10–11; Sunstein, 39-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787)). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, 12–18; Sunstein 51-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, 20; Sunstein, 73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters, and Blood set up a school together in Newington Green, a Dissenting community. Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband, Hugh Skeys, took her to Europe to improve her health, which had always been precarious.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 62; Wardle, 30–32; Sunstein, 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the change of surroundings Blood's health further  deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 68–69; Tomalin, 52ff; Wardle, 43–45; Sunstein, 103-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 54–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Blood's death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' (1788).&lt;ref&gt;See Wardle, chapter 2, for autobiographical elements of ''Mary''; see Sunstein, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The first of a new genus&quot;==
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft Original Stories from Real Life copy 1 object 1 - Look what a fine morning it is.jpg|thumb|left|Frontispiece to the 1791 edition of ''Original Stories from Real Life'' (engraved by William Blake)]]

After Blood's death, Wollstonecraft's friends helped her obtain a position as governess to the daughters of the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Todd, 106–7; Tomalin, 66; 79–80; Sunstein, 127-28.&lt;/ref&gt; the children found her an inspiring instructor; Margaret King would later say she &quot;had freed her mind from all superstitions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Wollstonecraft's experiences during this year would make their way into her only children's book, ''Original Stories from Real Life'' (1788).&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 64–88; Wardle, 60ff; Sunstein, 160-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' entitled &quot;Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune&quot;—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become &quot;the first of a new genus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''The Collected Letters'', 139; see also Sunstein, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson, found a place to live and work to support herself.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 123; Tomalin, 91–92; Wardle, 80–82; Sunstein, 151-55.&lt;/ref&gt; She learned French and German and translated texts,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably ''Of the Importance of Religious Opinions'' by Jacques Necker and ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'' by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson's periodical, the ''Analytical Review''. Wollstonecraft's intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson's famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were both disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 89–109; Wardle, 92–94; 128; Sunstein, 171-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in London, Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist Henry Fuseli, even though he was already married. She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, &quot;the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuseli's wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 197–98; Tomalin 151–52; Wardle, 171–73; 76–77; Sunstein, 220-22.&lt;/ref&gt; After Fuseli's rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent ''Vindication of the Rights of Men'' (1790). She had written the ''Rights of Men'' in response to Edmund Burke's conservative critique of the French Revolution in ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790) and it made her famous overnight. She was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose ''Rights of Man'' (1791) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in ''Rights of Men'' in ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' (1792), her most famous and influential work.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==France and Gilbert Imlay==
[[Image:Jacques_Bertaux_-_Prise_du_palais_des_Tuileries_-_1793_.jpg|thumb|right|10th of August, attack on the Tuileries Palace; French revolutionary violence spreads]]

Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before Louis XVI was guillotined. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 214–15; Tomalin, 156–82; Wardle, 179–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Having just written the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French revolution she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man. While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the ''Rights of Woman'', Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 232–36; Tomalin, 185–86; Wardle, 185–88; Sunstein, 235-45.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant, and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child, [[Fanny Imlay|Fanny]], naming her after perhaps her closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 218; Wardle, 202–3; Sunstein, 256-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend: &quot;My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman&quot; (emphasis hers).&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Wardle, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to write avidly despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at [[Le Havre]] in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'', which was published in London in December 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 211–219; Wardle, 206–14; Sunstein, 254-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the political situation worsened, Britain [[First Coalition|declared war]] on France, placing all British citizens in France in considerable danger. To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay registered her as his wife in 1793, even though they were not married.&lt;ref&gt;St Clair, 160; Wardle, 192–93; Sunstein, 262-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined. (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned.) After she left France, she continued to refer to herself as &quot;Mrs Imlay&quot;, even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to Le Havre where she went to give birth to her child, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances—alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Chapter 25; Tomalin, 220–31; Wardle, 215ff; Sunstein, 262ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and William Godwin==
Seeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with [[laudanum]], but Imlay saved her life (although it is unclear how).&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 286–87; Wardle, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in [[Scandinavia]], trying to recoup some of his losses. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark|Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'' in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 225–31; Wardle, 226–44; Sunstein, 277-90.&lt;/ref&gt; When she returned to England and came to the full realization that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let my wrongs sleep with me! Soon, very soon, I shall be at peace. When you receive this, my burning head will be cold. . . . I shall plunge into the Thames where there is least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek. God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure. Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''The Collected Letters'', 326.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Northcote]], ''[[William Godwin]],'' oil on canvas, 1802, the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]]]
She then went out on a rainy night and &quot;to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour&quot; before jumping into the [[River Thames]], but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 355–56; Tomalin, 232–36; Wardle, 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, &quot;I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson's]] circle again, in particular with [[Mary Hays]], [[Elizabeth Inchbald]], and [[Sarah Siddons]] through [[William Godwin]]. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 164–69; Tomalin, 245–70; Wardle, 268ff; Sunstein, 314-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin had read her ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' and later wrote that &quot;If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Godwin95&quot;/&gt; Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise ''[[Political Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 172–74; Tomalin, 271–73; Sunstein, 330-35.&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses, known as The Polygon, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein has printed several of these letters in order so that the reader can follow Wollstonecraft and Godwin's conversation (321ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though tragically brief, relationship.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 173; Wardle, 286–92; Sunstein, 335-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and Godwin's ''Memoirs''==
[[Image:GodwinMemoirs.jpg|right|thumb|[[William Godwin|Godwin's]] ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798)]]

On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, [[Mary Shelley|Mary]]. Although the delivery seemed to go well initially, the [[placenta]] broke apart during the birth and became infected, a common occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of [[sepsis|septicaemia]] on 10 September.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 450–56; Tomalin, 275–83; Wardle, 302–306; Sunstein, 342-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend [[Thomas Holcroft]], &quot;I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in C. Kegan Paul, ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/godwin/friends/toc.html William Godwin: His Friends and Contemporaries]'', London: Henry S. King and Co. (1876).  Retrieved on 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at [[St Pancras Old Church|Old Saint Pancras Churchyard]], and a memorial to her was constructed there, though both her and Godwin's remains were later moved to [[Bournemouth]]. Her tombstone reads, &quot;Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'': Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 457.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In January 1798 Godwin published his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft's illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 182–88; Tomalin, 289–97; Sunstein, 349-51; Sapiro, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Robert Southey]] accused him of &quot;the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked&quot; and vicious satires such as ''[[The Unsex'd Females]]'' were published.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey to William Taylor, 1 July 1804. ''A Memoir of the Life and Writings of William Taylor of Norwich''. Ed. J. W. Robberds. 2 vols. London: John Murray (1824) 1:504.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's ''Memoirs'' portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious skeptic than her own writings suggest.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 273-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as &quot;Wollstonecraft and Fuseli&quot; by British poet [[Robert Browning]] and that by [[William Roscoe]] which includes the lines:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Hard was thy fate in all the scenes of life
:As daughter, sister, mother, friend, and wife;
:But harder still, thy fate in death we own,
:Thus mourn'd by Godwin with a heart of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sapiro, 273.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy==
Wollstonecraft has had what scholar Cora Kaplan labels a &quot;curious&quot; legacy: &quot;for an author-activist adept in many genres… up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, &quot;Wollstonecraft's reception&quot;, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; After the devastating effect of Godwin's ''Memoirs'', Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for a century; she was pilloried by such writers as [[Maria Edgeworth]], who patterned the &quot;freakish&quot; Harriet Freke in ''[[Belinda (Edgeworth novel)|Belinda]]'' (1801) after Wollstonecraft. Other novelists such as [[Mary Hays]], [[Charlotte Turner Smith]], [[Fanny Burney]], and [[Jane West]] created similar figures, all to teach a &quot;moral lesson&quot; to their readers.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 131–32.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar Virginia Sapiro makes clear, few read Wollstonecraft's works during the nineteenth century as &quot;her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[Lucretia Mott]], an early American feminist, seems to have been influenced by Wollstonecraft's works.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 276-77.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sapiro, &quot;there is little indication that anyone who played a key role in women's history or feminism, other than Lucretia Mott, read Wollstonecraft's work seriously after her death until the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the modern [[feminist movement]], however, women as politically dissimilar from each other as [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Emma Goldman]] embraced Wollstonecraft's life story and celebrated her &quot;experiments in living&quot;, as Woolf termed them in a famous essay.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. &quot;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c2/chapter13.html The Four Figures]&quot;. (updated 4 June 2004) Retrieved on 11 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many, however, continued to decry Wollstonecraft's lifestyle and her works were still ignored.

With the emergence of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft's works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her &quot;passionate life in &lt;!--not opposition--&gt;[[wikt:apposition|apposition]]&lt;!--not opposition--&gt; to [her] radical and rationalist agenda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, &quot;Wollstonecraft's reception&quot;, 254; Sapiro, 278-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft was seen as a paradoxical yet intriguing figure who did not adhere to the 1970s version of feminism—&quot;the personal is the political&quot;. In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described her as much more a creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft's thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as [[sensibility]], economics, and political theory.

Wollstonecraft's work has also had an effect on feminism outside the academy in recent years. [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a political writer and [[List_of_former_Muslims#Part_of_an_unorganized_religion_or_no_religion|former Muslim]] who is [[Criticism_of_Islam#Contemporary_critics_of_Islam|critical of Islam]] in general and [[Women and Islam|its dictates regarding women]] in particular, cited the ''Rights of Woman'' in her autobiography ''[[Infidel (book)|Infidel]]'' and wrote that she was &quot;inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsi Ali, Ayaan. ''Infidel''. New York: Free Press (2007), 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
===Educational works===
[[Image:WollstonecraftEducation.png|thumb|right|First page of the first edition of ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (1787)]]
{{main|Thoughts on the Education of Daughters|Original Stories from Real Life}}

The majority of Wollstonecraft's early productions centre around the topic of education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts &quot;for the improvement of young women&quot; entitled ''The Female Reader'' and she translated two children's works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambon's ''Young Grandison'' and [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann|Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's]] ''Elements of Morality''. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her [[conduct book]] ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (1787) and her [[children's literature|children's book]] ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging [[middle-class]] ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;Literature of advice&quot;, 122-26; Kelly, 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Both books also emphasize the importance of teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to the important seventeenth-century educational philosopher [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 24-27; Myers, &quot;Impeccable Governesses&quot;, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of [[sensibility]] popular at the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;Literature of advice&quot;, 124-29; Richardson, 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 25–27; Jones, &quot;Literature of advice&quot;, 124; Myers, &quot;Impeccable Governesses&quot;, 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vindications''===
====''Vindication of the Rights of Men'' (1790)====
{{main|A Vindication of the Rights of Men}}

Published in response to [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which was a defence of [[Constitutional monarchy#Constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom|constitutional monarchy]], aristocracy, and the [[Church of England]], Wollstonecraft's ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' (1790) attacks [[aristocracy]] and advocates [[republicanism]]. Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', in which [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.

Wollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the ''Reflections'', Burke had lamented: &quot;I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Marie Antoinette]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was at the expense of the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke's gendered language. By redefining the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical ''tableaux'' turn Burke's readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 45;  Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121-22; Kelly, 90; 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; In her first unabashedly [[feminist]] critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia L. Johnson]] argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94-95; Todd, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system would lead to the continuation of [[slavery]], simply because it had been an ancestral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt; She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her [[utopia]]n picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;Political tradition&quot;, 44-46; Sapiro, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rights of Men'' was Wollstonecraft's first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, &quot;it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of ''Rights of Men'' she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this text that made her a well-known writer.

[[Image:Vindication1b.jpg|thumb|left||First American edition of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792)]]

====''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' (1792)====
{{main|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman}}

''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is one of the earliest works of [[feminist]] philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education [[wikt:commensurate|commensurate]] with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be &quot;companions&quot; to their husbands rather than mere wives.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the ''Rights of Woman'' respond vitriolically to [[conduct book]] writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] and educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who wanted to deny women an education.  (Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Émile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.)&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 123; 126; Taylor, 14-15; Sapiro, 27-28; 13-31; 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as &quot;spaniels&quot; and &quot;toys&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt;), but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: &quot;Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt; She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 124-26; Taylor, 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: &quot;Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.&lt;ref&gt;The words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' did not come into existence until the 1890s. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Retrieved on 17 September 2007; see Taylor, 12; 55-57; 105-106; 118-20; Sapiro, 257-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing critiques in the ''Rights of Woman'' is of false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are &quot;blown about by every momentary gust of feeling&quot; and because they are &quot;the prey of their senses&quot; they cannot think rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the ''Rights of Woman'', &quot;On National Education&quot;, she argues that all children should be sent to a &quot;country day school&quot; as well as given some education at home &quot;to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures.&quot; She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], arguing that men and women, whose marriages are &quot;the cement of society&quot;, should be &quot;educated after the same model.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', Chapter 12; see also Kelly, 124-25; 133-34; Sapiro, 237ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the &quot;most natural state&quot;, and in many ways the ''Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167-68; Sapiro, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311; see also Taylor, 159-61; Sapiro, 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
[[Image:Otto Scholderer Lesendes Mädchen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Otto Scholderer|Otto Scholderer's]] ''Young Girl Reading'' (1883); in both ''Mary'' and ''The Wrongs of Woman'', Wollstonecraft criticizes women who imagine themselves as sentimental heroines.]]
{{main|Mary: A Fiction|Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman}}

Both of Wollstonecraft's [[novel]]s criticize what she viewed as the [[wikt:patriarchal|patriarchal]] institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate [[romantic friendship]]s, one with a woman and one with a man. ''Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman'' (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft's most radical [[feminist]] work,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft's novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the ''Rights of Woman''. At the end of ''Mary'', the heroine believes she is going &quot;to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Mary'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably a positive state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 100-101; Taylor, 232-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also critique the discourse of [[sensibility]], a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. ''Mary'' is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In ''The Wrongs of Woman'' the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 60; 65-66; Kelly, 44; Poovey, 89; Taylor, 135; Todd, ''Women's Friendship'', 210-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Women's Friendship'', 208; 221-22; Johnson, 67–68; Taylor, 233; 243–44; Sapiro, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796)===
{{main|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark}}

Wollstonecraft's ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' is a deeply personal [[travel literature|travel narrative]]. The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on [[Scandinavia]] and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with [[Gilbert Imlay|Imlay]] (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using the rhetoric of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], ''Letters Written in Sweden'' shares the themes of the French philosopher's ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' (1782): &quot;the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 104; Sapiro, 286-87.&lt;/ref&gt; While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Frederic Edwin Church The Icebergs.jpg|thumb|left|''The Iceburgs'' (1861) by [[Frederic Edwin Church]]]]
Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and [[sensibility]]. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, &quot;Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''&quot;, 167; 180; Poovey, 83-84; 106; Kelly, 189-90.&lt;/ref&gt; As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, &quot;Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''&quot;, 174; Favret, 96; 120; 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 119ff; Poovey, 93; Myers, &quot;Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''&quot;, 177; Kelly, 179-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Letters Written in Sweden'' was Wollstonecraft's most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. [[William Godwin|Godwin]] wrote &quot;if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.&quot;&lt;ref name=Godwin95&gt;Godwin, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 367; Kaplan, &quot;Mary Wollstonecraft's reception&quot;, 262; Sapiro, 35; Favret, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19 December 2008 I merged the content of this '''stub''' (frozen since 2006) with the [[Mac OS X Tiger]] since the scopes were to similar to validate a distinct project. I requested a edit history merge and tagged it for deletion, since the acting admin thought that since there wasn't a previous merge tag the speedy delete was premature and reverted it, the edit history of the now replicated content does still need at least the edit merge, and as I don't see the point of keeping the content duplicated I propose this vfd discussion, to resolve any problem the original project creators may have to the deletion of the original page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:04, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:{{comment}} It states in [[Mac OS X Tiger#About Mac OS X Server]] that [[Mac OS X Tiger Server]] as a module is supposed to cover different material to [[Mac OS X Tiger]]. In fact it looks like the Server module is intended to be part of the overall book, rather than a different book. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:02, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
::You lost me there, the OS is the same but the version seems to be distinct (they share most of the software features, but server does provide some other functionalities), I merged it in accord to that last bit &quot;the Server module is intended to be part of the overall book&quot; by creating a section to add the subject (I did not haphazardly mix it with the rest of the content).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:51, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

::: That difference could be very well what was intended to make this book different from the other one. I think this one is intended to be aimed at server administration of servers running MacOS X Server, while the other one is probably intended more for End Users who are using MacOS on a personal computer. A MacOS X Server could be headless, while a MacOS X for everyday use would likely include a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard. Personally I think both books need to be renamed to use MacOS X rather than Mac OS X, and Tiger removed from the name, since Tiger is too narrow a scope which would easily make both books dated quickly. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:00, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

:::Yes, sorry, lacking clarity. I meant it looked to me like the original creator expected the content to be distinct rather than a duplication and therefore perhaps they should remain distinct. I'm not arguing against merging or arguing for keeping them separate, it was just a comment on your comment ''the scopes were to similar to validate a distinct project''. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:26, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

::::Yup, my action was only based on the content and activity on both books, I doubt that editors of [[Mac OS X Tiger Server]] will object to the merge and deletion, we are talking about a single active user in 2006 that created a stub (not big on real content), so if the VFD is not opposed I would also support the rename Darklama advances above, the Tiger bit is a bit unnecessary today, but it would better be something that adds to th subject something like &quot;Understanding OS X&quot; or &quot;Using...&quot;, or something that clear the subject to other more distinct approaches, but preserves the subject for a category that can incorporate more books on OS X, even removing Mac should be ok, I think since the OS works on non Mac hardware, and other non computer Apple Hardware, for instance it would enable aggregation with Darwin, Apple TV and iPhone material, in any case this should be put on a back burner until the VFD ends and it's first discussed on the [[Mac OS X Tiger]] book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:52, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

::::: The book has a decent outline for planned chapters, other books of a similar nature have been kept in the past. Even if the Server book has no active contributors, the contributors of [[Mac OS X Tiger]] should still be asked to see if they think a merger makes sense.
::::: '''FYI''': Darwin is just a kernel and Macintosh is just the hardware. MacOS is the actual name of an Operating System, which consists of the Darwin kernel, libraries, packages, and other things that together are considered to make up the OS. MacOS and Macintosh are similarly named, but refer to different things. So removing Mac from the book names would not make sense. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:30, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

The book doesn't seem terribly active so it might not be seen for a while.
: Personally, I think it would be useful to have different books. Desktop and server users will likely have very different technical background so a different style of presentation would be in order. That said, I have no problem with a book that contains subject matter for different audiences (we have some that do this well, already). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:07, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
::Just a note that this content as said in the proposal is now replicated on another book, the VfD was only due process on the grounds similar to the comment you are making. I call your attention to this since it relates to the proposal about forks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:34, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' A few months have past and it appears there has been no activity. I think its safe to conclude the other book is also inactive. So what do people think should be done considering both books are inactive? I suppose I can '''support''' both the merger and renaming the book to &quot;Understanding MacOS X&quot; in light of no recent activity. In the future if someone feels like a separate book is needed for MacOS X Server then they can start one again. If nobody objects, I'll do just that in a week since this discussion has been going on long enough already. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:57, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

This book appears to be notes from a lecture someone attended and not a textbook.  The only page with any content whatsoever is [[PCMI/Graduate_Summer_School_2006/Introduction_to_Link_Homology]].  I don't understand the content of that page to contemplate a suggestion of a book to merge it with, assuming the content is actually useful to someone here.  This book's main contributor and creator has not done any editing since July 2006.  That combined with its appearance as someone's personal notebook led me to believe this should be nominated for deletion.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:51, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

None of these pages are a book. Most edits to them over the past 3 years has been in terms of categorization, removing deleted books, etc. There are also better alternatives such as [[Subject:Reading Levels]]. I believe all 3 pages may also have been at one time part of Wikiversity. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:31, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''': It looks like an old organization system that's fallen by the wayside. For the record, Wikilearn is empty and the other two have been replaced with categories and subjects. -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 19:52, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
: Wikilearn and Wikiprofessional- '''Delete'''. Wikistudy - '''Keep'''. Wikilearn seems to be of no benefit at all, and Wikiprofessional more maintenance than anything, best served through other means. Wikistudy has potentially useful information about school syllabi, I don't see a better way for navigating this information?

:: [[Image:Symbol opinion vote.svg|15px]] '''FYI:''' [[Subject:Standard curricula]] could eventually supersede [[Wikistudy]], should there be enough books created to make it clear what the different curricula entail.  In the meantime, on the subject pages for the various programs I used {{tlx|Wikipedia}} to link to additional information. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:14, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' As a historical note, these pages were intended to be a way to organize books by reading level, along the same guidelines as Wikijunior. We should also be including [[Wikitoddler]] in this request as well, since it's related. But you are right, these pages were never well-utilized and needed to be manually updated like the bookshelves were. A far better alternative would be to use [[Subject:Reading Levels]] to organize books for audiences of particular levels, and use things like [[Subject:Standard curricula]] for books that are designed to accompany specific school curricula (like how [[Wikistudy]] was intended). Make sure [[Wikilearn]] and [[Wikitoddler]] are merged into [[Wikijunior]], make sure all books in these places are marked with the proper templates and categories, and then it will be okay to delete them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:56, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

:: [[Image:Symbol opinion vote.svg|15px]] '''FYI:''' I added links to [[Wikijunior:All Books]] and [[Wikijunior]] for the pages linked to from [[Wikitoddler]] and moved the one book that was not already in the Wikijunior namespace into it (formerly ''Wikitoddler Flowers Alphabet'', now at [[Wikijunior:Flower Alphabet]]).  The categories on the relevant pages were changed to [[:Category:Wikijunior]]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">-I edited The ===Do we need Fund raising=== section of the Wiki book because I felt it was not complete in its explanation of how fund raising is different for each club. There are numerous ways funds can be used by the clubs including travel, materials, coaching, meeting venues, and so on. The individual who wrote before me had an undefined topic of why they think the Hawaii club needs funds. I added the circumstances of how some clubs acquire funds, and also the process that each club uses to find and spend their money. In addition to that I corrected grammar and sentence structure that had been overlooked. 

My revisions in the wiki book have been educated additions to the knowledge put in. I use writing techniques such as forwarding to use the persons idea and expand upon it. The information we have put into the wiki book is subject to change and revision and I knowingly created sentences that could be added to or argued if someone felt my information is misleading.</text>

      <comment>/* Photo Transduction */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">As mentioned before the retina is the main component in the eye, because it contains all the light sensitive cells. Without it, the eye would be comparable to a digital camera without the CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensor. This part elaborates on how the retina perceives the light, how the optical signal is transmitted to the brain and how the brain processes the signal to form enough information for decision making.

====Creation of the initial signals - Photosensor Function====

Vision invariably starts with light hitting the photo-sensitive cells found in the retina. Light-absorbing visual pigments, a variety of enzymes and transmitters in retinal rods and cones will initiate the conversion from visible EM stimuli into electrical impulses, in a process known as photoelectric transduction. Using rods as an example, the incoming visible EM hits rhodopsin molecules, transmembrane molecules found in the rods' outer disk structure. Each rhodopsin molecule consists of a cluster of helices called opsin that envelop and surround 11-cis retinal, which is the part of the molecule that will change due to the energy from the incoming photons. In biological molecules, moieties, or parts of molecules that will cause conformational changes due to this energy is sometimes referred to as chromophores. 11-cis retinal straightens in response to the incoming energy, turning into retinal (all-trans retinal), which forces the opsin helices further apart, causing particular reactive sites to be uncovered. This &quot;activated&quot; rhodopsin molecule is sometimes referred to as Metarhodopsin II. From this point on, even if the visible light stimulation stops, the reaction will continue. The Metarhodopsin II can then react with roughly 100 molecules of a G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; protein called transducing, which then results in α&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and βγ after the GDP is converted into GTP. The activated α&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-GTP then binds to cGMP-phosphodiesterase(PDE), suppressing normal ion-exchange functions, which results in a low cytosol concentration of cation ions, and therefore a change in the polarisation of the cell.

The natural photoelectric transduction reaction has an amazing power of amplification. One single retinal rhodopsin molecule activated by a single quantum of light causes the hydrolysis of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cGMP molecules per second. 
=====Photo Transduction =====
[[Image:Phototransduction.png|thumb|500px|Representation of molecular steps in photoactivation (modified from Leskov et al., 2000). Depicted is an outer membrane disk in a rod. Step 1: Incident photon (hν) is absorbed and activates a rhodopsin by conformational change in the disk membrane to R*. Step 2: Next, R* makes repeated contacts with transducin molecules, catalyzing its activation to G* by the release of bound GDP in exchange for cytoplasmic GTP.  The α and γ subunits Step 3: G* binds inhibitory γ subunits of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activating its α and β subunits. Step 4: Activated PDE hydrolyzes cGMP. Step 5: Guanylyl cyclase (GC) synthesizes cGMP, the second messenger in the phototransduction cascade.  Reduced levels of cytosolic cGMP cause cyclic nucleotide gated channels to close preventing further influx of Na+ and Ca2+. ]]

# A light photon interacts with the retinal in a photoreceptor. The retinal undergoes isomerisation, changing from the 11-''cis'' to all-''trans'' configuration.
# Retinal no longer fits into the opsin binding site. 
# Opsin therefore undergoes a conformational change to metarhodopsin II.
# Metarhodopsin II is unstable and splits, yielding opsin and all-''trans'' retinal.
# The opsin activates the regulatory protein transducin. This causes transducin to dissociate from its bound GDP, and bind GTP, then the alpha subunit of transducin dissociates from the beta and gamma subunits, with the GTP still bound to the alpha subunit.
# The alpha subunit-GTP complex activates phosphodiesterase.
# Phosphodiesterase breaks down cGMP to 5'-GMP. This lowers the concentration of cGMP and therefore the sodium channels close.
# Closure of the sodium channels causes hyperpolarization of the cell due to the ongoing potassium current.
# Hyperpolarization of the cell causes voltage-gated calcium channels to close. 
# As the calcium level in the photoreceptor cell drops, the amount of the neurotransmitter glutamate that is released by the cell also drops. This is because calcium is required for the glutamate-containing vesicles to fuse with cell membrane and release their contents.
# A decrease in the amount of glutamate released by the photoreceptors causes depolarization of On center bipolar cells (rod and cone On bipolar cells) and hyperpolarization of cone Off bipolar cells.

Without visible EM stimulation, rod cells containing a cocktail of ions, proteins and other molecules, have membrane potential differences of around -40mV. Compared to other nerve cells, this is quite high (-65mV). In this state, the neurotransmitter glutamate is continuously released from the axon terminals and absorbed by the neighbouring bipolar cells. With incoming visble EM and the previously mentioned cascade reaction, the potential difference drops to -70mV. This hyper-polarisation of the cell causes a reduction in the amount of released glutamate, thereby affecting the activity of the bipolar cells, and subsequently the following steps in the visual pathway.

Similar processes exist in the cone-cells and in photosensitive ganglion cells, but make use of different opsins. Photopsin I through III (yellowish-green, green and blue-violet respectively) are found in the three different cone cells and melanopsin (blue) can be found in the photosensitive ganglion cells.

====Processing Signals in the Retina====

[[File:Receptive field.png|thumb|300px|right]]

Different bipolar cells react differently to the changes in the released glutamate. The so called ON and OFF bipolar cells are used to form the direct signal flow from cones to bipolar cells. The ON bipolar cells will depolarise by visible EM stimulation and the corresponding ON ganglion cells will be activated. On the other hand the OFF bipolar cells are hyper polarised by the visible EM stimulation, and the OFF ganglion cells are inhibited. This is the basic pathway of the Direct signal flow. The Lateral signal flow will start from the rods, then go to the bipolar cells, the amacrine cells, and the OFF bipolar cells inhibited by the Rod-amacrine cells and the ON bipolar cells will stimulated via an electrical synapse, after all of the previous steps, the signal will arrive at the ON or OFF ganglion cells and the whole pathway of the Lateral signal flow is established.

When the action potential (AP) in ON, ganglion cells will be triggered by the visible EM stimulus. The AP frequency will increase when the sensor potential increases. In other words, AP depends on the amplitude of the sensor's potential. The region of ganglion cells where the stimulatory and inhibitory effects influence the AP frequency is called receptive field (RF). Around the ganglion cells, the RF is usually composed of two regions: the central zone and the ring-like peripheral zone. They are distinguishable during visible EM adaptation. A visible EM stimulation on the centric zone could lead to AP frequency increase and the stimulation on the periphery zone will decrease the AP frequency. When the light source is turned off the excitation occurs. So the name of ON field (central field ON) refers to this kind of region. Of course the RF of the OFF ganglion cells act the opposite way and is therefore called &quot;OFF field&quot; (central field OFF). The RFs are organised by the horizontal cells. The impulse on the periphery region will be impulsed and transmitted to the central region, and there the so-called stimulus contrast is formed. This function will make the dark seem darker and the light brighter. If the whole RF is exposed to light. the impulse of the central region will predominate.

====Signal Transmission to the Cortex====

As mentioned previously, axons of the ganglion cells converge at the optic disk of the retina, forming the optic nerve. These fibres are positioned inside the bundle in a specific order. Fibres from the macular zone of the retina are in the central portion, and those from the temporal half of the retina take up the periphery part. A partial decussation or crossing occurs when these fibres are outside the eye cavity. The fibres from the nasal halves of each retina cross to the opposite halves and extend to the brain. Those from the temporal halves remain uncrossed. This partial crossover is called the optic chiasma, and the optic nerves past this point are called optic tracts, mainly to distinguish them from single-retinal nerves. The function of the partial crossover is to transmit the right-hand visual field produced by both eyes to the left-hand half of the brain only and vice versa. Therefore the information from the right half of the body, and the right visual field, is all transmitted to the left-hand part of the brain when reaches the posterior part of the fore-brain (diencephalon).
&lt;!--
[[File:ERP - optic cabling.jpg|350px|right|The visual pathway]] --&gt;
[[File:Gray722.png |thumb|350px|center|The pathway to the central cortex]]

The information relay between the fibers of optic tracts and the nerve cells occurs in the lateral geniculate bodies, the central part of the visual signal processing, located in the thalamus of the brain. From here the information is passed to the nerve cells in the occipital cortex of the corresponding side of the brain. Connections from the retina to the brain can be separated into a 'parvocellular pathway' and a &quot;magnocellular pathway&quot;. The parvocellular pathways signals color and fine detail, whereas the magnocellular pathways detect fast moving stimuli.

[[File:Magno Parvocellular Pathways.svg |thumb|350px|right|Connections from the retina to the brain can be separated into a &quot;parvocellular pathway&quot; and a &quot;magnocellular pathway&quot;. The parvocellular pathway originates in midget cells in the retina, and signals color and fine detail; magnocellular pathway starts with parasol cells, and detects fast moving stimuli.]]

Signals from standard digital cameras correspond approximately to those of the parvocellular pathway. To simulate the responses of parvocellular pathways, researchers have been developing neuromorphic sensory systems, which try to mimic spike-based computation in neural systems. Thereby they use a scheme called &quot;address-event representation&quot; for the signal transmission in the neuromorphic electronic systems (Liu and Delbruck 2010 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493680]).

Anatomically, the retinal Magno and Parvo ganglion cells respectively project to 2 ventral magnocellular layers and 4 dorsal parvocellular layers of the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). Each of the six LGN layers receives inputs from either the ipsilateral or contralateral eye, i.e., the ganglion cells of the left eye cross over and project to layer 1, 4 and 6 of the right LGN, and the right eye ganglion cells project (uncrossed) to its layer 2, 3 and 5. From here the information from the right and left eye is separated.

Although human vision is combined by two halves of the retina and the signal is processed by the opposite cerebral hemispheres, the visual field is considered as a smooth and complete unit. Hence the two visual cortical areas are thought of as being intimately connected. This connection, called corpus callosum is made of neurons, axons and dendrites. Because the dendrites make synaptic connections to the related points of the hemispheres, electric simulation of every point on one hemisphere indicates simulation of the interconnected point on the other hemisphere. The only exception to this rule is the primary visual cortex.

The synapses are made by the optic tract in the respective layers of the lateral geniculate body. Then these axons of these third-order nerve cells are passed up to the calcarine fissure in each occipital lobe of the cerebral cortex. Because bands of the white fibres and axons pair from the nerve cells in the retina go through it, it is called the striate cortex, which incidentally is our primary visual cortex, sometimes known as V1. At this point, impulses from the separate eyes converge to common cortical neurons, which then enables complete input from both eyes in one region to be used for perception and comprehension. Pattern recognition is a very important function of this particular part of the brain, with lesions causing problems with visual recognition or blindsight.

Based on the ordered manner in which the optic tract fibres pass information to the lateral geniculate bodies and after that pass in to the striate area, if one single point stimulation on the retina was found, the response which produced electrically in both lateral geniculate body and the striate cortex will be found at a small region on the particular retinal spot. This is an obvious point-to-point way of signal processing. And if the whole retina is stimulated, the responses will occur on both lateral geniculate bodies and the striate cortex gray matter area. It is possible to map this brain region to the retinal fields, or more usually the visual fields.

Any further steps in this pathway is beyond the scope of this book. Rest assured that, many further levels and centres exist, focusing on particular specific tasks, like for example colour, orientations, spatial frequencies, emotions etc.

==Visual Perception==
Equipped with a firmer understanding of some of the more important concepts of the signal processing in the visual system, comprehension or perception of the processed sensory information is the last important piece in the puzzle. Visual perception is the process of translating information received by the eyes into an understanding of the external state of things.  It makes us aware of the world around us and allows us to understand it better. Based on visual perception we learn patterns which we then apply later in life and we make decisions based on this and the obtained information. In other words, our survival depends on perception.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:theology|theology]]''': the study and commentary on the existence and attributes of a god or gods, and of how that god or those gods relate to the world and, especially, to human existence and religious thought; more generally, it is the study of religious faith, practice, and experience, or of spirituality. It is sometimes contrasted with [[Subject:Religious studies|religious studies]]: theology is understood as the study of religion from an internal perspective (e.g., a perspective of commitment to that religion), and religious studies as the study of religion from an external (e.g., a secular) perspective.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Writing good multiple-choice questions is tricky. Writing good multiple-choice questions that require students to apply information, rather than just regurgitate information, is even trickier. But, it can be done.

Most high-stakes tests (Virginia's SOLs, the SAT, AP tests, most final exams) contain mostly, if not all, multiple choice questions. These tests aim to assess not just students' knowledge, but their ability to apply knowledge, in other words, their ability to reason.

Do you believe these tests do a good job of assessing students' reasoning skills? Why or why not?.&lt;/span&gt;

== Thumbs Up ==


Yes, I believe standardized tests such as the SAT, AP test, and SOL do an excellent job measuring their preset objectives.  The SAT sets out to measure aptitude, and the AP tests and SOL sets out to measure student achievement.  The creators of these tests have extensive and significant background in how to test for understanding; they also have knowledge of statistics of how students perform in response to certain types of test questions with all of their various conceptual ingredients included.  My only concern with the SOL is that there should be an additional score telling how the student did in comparison to the state average, because sometimes a simple pass/fall score can be misleading if the test is difficult for most students across the state. [[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 15:55, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe that in most of the SOL tests and on the SAT's the majority of the questions force students to use their reasoning skills.  These questions are good indicators of what students not only know and understand, but how they can take that information an apply it to a real life example.  Some of the time, however, these types of questions are used by teachers to trick their students.  I disagree with this practice and think that stumping or tricking students in a test setting is a good way to lower the overall test scores. Despite the occasional obvious answer questions, most high stake tests encorporate a variety of question styles and formats, in order to keep the student on his or her toes.  This type of test makes for a challenging way for students to show off their skills. [[User:Abeck017|Abeck017]] ([[User talk:Abeck017|talk]]) 18:10, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I do not have a problem taking multiple choice tests.  I have found myself doing &quot;eenie meenie miny mo&quot; to answer some questions.  I think multiple choice questions can be a helpful tool to assess students knowledge.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 16:59, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I believe that if well written multiple choice can be a good form of assessment.  If the questions deal with knowledge or reasoning I believe it can show application.  We assess for different reasons.  There are so many different ways to assess students, I think the teacher needs to mix it up a iittle.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 05:43, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I think that a lot of times teachers use multiple choice because it is easy to grade. However, if they are good questions, then multiple chice can be a good form of assessment. Teachers should not ignore other forms of assessment. [[User:Rebecca.hechler|Rebecca.hechler]] ([[User talk:Rebecca.hechler|talk]]) 03:21, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I feel I am on the border with this question.  I do not have a problem with multiple questions and using them to assess what student have learned.  I do feel that in many cases the questions are not written well.  Sometimes I wonder how the people writing the SOL and other tests are qualified.  Overall though i do feel the multiple choice questions are the easiest and failry effective way of assessing knowledge.  I believe no matter what the case may be of evaluating testing there is always going to be groups of people that like or dislike the format.  I would also go on to say that not every test should be given as a multiple choice test and some should be given orally..written...or any other format.  It is tough that every test we are given throughout education is a multiple choice test.  I think the most disheartening part about them is I tell myself &quot;the answer is right in from of me&quot; and many times I still can't pick the right one :).

I feel like multiple choice tests are a fine way to assess students. Personally, I believe one of the only reasons that so many students &quot;hate&quot; or &quot;are terrible at&quot; these types of tests is because, from a very young age, that is what we are conditioned by our peers to believe. In a test, multiple choice questions often do well in conjunction with fill-in-the-blank and short answer. Essays are not always a necessary or valid way to assess students. Frequently, it is common and easy for students to &quot;fudge&quot; their way through an essay, filling it with fluff and not facts, and still receiving a good grade. Done correctly, multiple choice questions can be very difficult. Take, for example, the questions from an AP exam. They are very tricky and have many answers that appear to be correct. These types of questions can only be correctly answered by a student who really knows the material. I went to a private school and never took SOLs so I don't really know how it's questions are, but I do know that all of the tests and exams that I took all through out elementary, middle, and high school (yes, I said elementary) included multiple choice questions that really assessed our knowledge.

I think multiple choice tests can do a good job of assessing a student’s reasoning skills, IF the questions are well written.  That’s the problem.  In my experience, both as taking and creating test questions, too many of them are poorly worded or don’t test higher level thinking skills.  I think the best exam for assessing a student’s reasoning skills though does not depend solely on multiple choice questions but contains a mix of true and false, multiple choice, and depending on the grade level, essay questions.  The multiple choice questions seems to me to be the most fair in assessing a student’s knowledge because with true or false, the student has a 50/50 chance of getting the answer correct if they don’t know the information.  Not all students express themselves well in writing on essay questions even if they thoroughly understand the learned concept.  A well worded multiple choice question can eliminate the negatives of the true or false and essay question.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 18:00, 4 June 2009 (UTC)


I believe that multiple choice testing can be a good way to assess a student's reasoning skills.  However, I do believe that students with specific learning disabilities or even a simple aversion to mutiple choice testing suffer greatly with this testing format.  I assisted with the administration of this year's SOL tests at the elementary level.  While walking around the room as a classroom proctor, I noticed that there seemed to be more application based questions on the test.  It was imperative that the student read each question carefully.  A question could mean one thing to one student and something else for another.  Also, it appeared that students could easily overlook key information that would lead to an incorrect answer choice. Many teachers compain about &quot;teaching to the test&quot;.  I believe that good test taking strategies can assist students when they are deconstructing test questions.  I must say that I am not a fan of the SOL tests, but I do believe that multiple choice tests with well written questions can be a good way to assess reasoning skills.

I am kind of in the middle between liking and disliking multiple choice questions. I believe that multiple choice testing is a good way to assess a student's reasoning skills, however I do believe that some students do not test well on standardized tests. I do prefer multiple choice tests personally over short answer, because I feel with multiple choice the process of elimination is available whereas with short answer you have to have completely memorized the information in order to get the answer correct. Multiple choice questions also allow for application questions, which I believe are important because it really tests whether the student knows the material or not. They can apply what they know to a novel situation, therefore expanding their knowledge of the concept itself. I know from personal experience that I do completely different on multiple choice exams in school than I do on standardized tests like the SAT for example. I believe that some students are not good with multiple choice tests in general. That is why I believe teachers need to provide variety in their testing methods, as well as with standardized testing through the use of matching, true/false, short answer and essay response. Also, each student interprets questions differently therefore what one student may feel is correct because of the way he/she reads it another student may interpret the question and come up with a completely different answer. Both students may interpret the question completely different than what the teacher had intended as well. That is why I am kind of on the fence with multiple choice and standardized testing, because although I do believe it is a good tool to measure student's reasoning skills, I also believe that confusion and misinterpretation can also take place.

I have taken countless multiple choice questions based tests throughout my scholastic career. I believe that they not only assess the logistic knowledge of the student but really make the individual think outside the box... also known as testing the student's reasoning skills. Why? It's simple. For example, if a student is confident of an answer yet there are two others that also make sense and are logically correct, then it makes the student evaluate different standpoints and evaluate the questions from different angles. Multiple choice tests give the student the chance to not only show that they have studied the material at hand, but it tests their own logic.  At the end of the day, if the student made the correct choice, not only will the person know the answer but it automatically becomes a subject that the person is confident to discuss and in my case, teach in the near future. Now, some multiple choice questions are very obvious and the answer shines bright between A, B, C or D.... in my opinion multiple choice is easier for students rather than writing a whole essay to answer one question. It's quick and to the point. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 19:58, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

Yes, I believe multiple choice questions can assess a student's ability to reason.  These questions provide multiple answers to consider.  They do not allow the students to go with the first thing that comes to their mind.  Therefore they need to be able to decide what is the most reasonable answer for the question.  Multiple Choice Tests also help with test anxiety for students who are overwhelmed when faced with &quot;fill in the blank&quot; tests.  By seeing the answers and being able to choose, their memory is prompted and hopefully anxiety is relieved.  With the anxiety gone even poor test takers can reason through the choices, eliminate improbable answers and increase their chances of successfully demonstrating their knowledge.

Being a product of the Virginia SOL's I can say that i think they are a pretty good measure of a students knowledge of the topic for the most part. They are worded in a way that the student is challenged enough to make the test worth while, while also allowing them to pass the test. As with almost everything there is a flip side. Which is that some teachers have started to try to just prepare their classes for just the test and not necessarily the next class that follows it in the students studies. So that is a negative. But overall i think that the tests are a very good thing. I know from a personal experience that I was doing poorly in the class itself because of the way the teaching style of the teacher, but when it came time for the sol I passed with an advanced marking. I think that the tests could use a little tweaking but overall they are pretty good. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 23:46, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

== Not So Hot ==
While I do think that multiple chpice questions are good for long exams or timed exams I do not think they are the best way to assess the knowledge of the students. Multiple choice questions are often created in a negative form of a question such as &quot; which of the following is not the best example of ...?&quot; Of course this type of question does make the students think more before they answer, I believe that too many of these types of questions ultimately confuse the student.  Simple fill in the blank questions are agreat way to assess knowledge or filling in a diagram or map that they have studied. If the information has been presented correctly and often throughout the lesson than fill in questions should be a great way to assess what has been learned.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 23:16, 26 June 2009 (UTC)






Noooo I really don’t think they do that good of a job in assessing a student’s knowledge base.  So often on these tests I am thrown off by a word placed in a sentence that changes the entire meaning.  I know I could do better by reading and rereading the choices given, and make a better decision sometimes…but when you are trying to hurry to finish a timed test you do what you can to pick what you think is right.  Also, even instructors themselves call multiple choice tests “multiple guess” tests because that’s what we always do when we aren’t sure of an answer…you GUESS.  If there are 4 questions, you have a ¼ chance of getting them right.  Of course we can usually eliminate a choice or two that we know are wrong…so then the chances of getting a question right increase!  There is no “sure fire” way to test students but I know we students get happy when we find out a test is multiple choice (or even better yet, true or false)!

I feel my whole life I have taken a number of tests and the majority of those tests were all multiple choice.  I do not care for multiple choice tests very much, however, when they are all you take I guess you have to learn to like them or at least learn to live with them.  I feel I am a strong writer and that may play a large role in why I do not love multiple choice tests.  I feel more pressure when I know Im taking a multiple choice test.  I thoroughly enjoy taking essay tests, however, I have not have too many classes that offered just that.  I have had a variety of classes where it was a mixture of multiple choice, true false, and some essays, but hardly ever and just essay tests.  My thoughts on this matter seem to match many of my peers.  I also did not enjoy taking the SATs or the Praxis, but who really does enjoy those tests? At times I also felt the answer choices left me wondering which was the right answer, or I felt the question was not worded as clearly as it should have been when taking a test that is as serious as the Prxis or SATs.  I felt the multiple choice tips were helpful to me, maybe if some of the creators of tests read these tips taking mulpitle choice tests would be more fun, probably not though.



After taking a number of SOL's, SATs, AP tests, etc., I would have to say that I do not think they are as effective as they could be. From my experience, it seems as though these test do not provide clear and concise questions/ answers. When taking these tests, many times I went into it feeling very confident; more often than not, I walked out feeling angry. It just seems like we spend so much time preparing for these exams and then most of what we study is not on the test or not at all the way we practiced. That could be a problem with the preparation or the testing, I'm not sure (maybe a mix of both). From hearing other teachers talk about the SOL's in particlular, I know that many of them are frustrated with the tests. A child could explain a concept and have a good knowledge base but the test has a way of phrasing questions that can be very misleading. I don't know much about what goes into making up these standardized tests, but I am almost certain that a group of highly trained people is in charge of writing the questions/answers. Maybe they should spend some time reviewing the article we just read that spells out the points to writing effective questions! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 00:30, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I understand the concept of having multiple choice tests used so frequently, however I can't say I am a huge fan of them. While taking the Praxis 1 tests, when I didn't know what the answer was I thought &quot;at least I have a 25% chance of getting it right&quot; and guessed. The Praxis 2 art test was extremely difficult because the multiple choice questions pertaining to artists gave an example of something the artist had created or a fact about the artist and then wanted you to pick which artist it was from the four artists listed. There are a million artists in this world, and even after taking six art history classes I had not heard of most of them on the test. These types of multiple choice questions were not helpful, because I was not given a list of artists I should study before taking the test, therefore I did not know what to prepare for. How can someone assess you on something you were not able to fully prepare for? Multiple choice questions either allow a student to &quot;get lucky&quot; for guessing the right answer or frustrate those that were not told how to prepare ahead of time.

I would have to agree with some of the other posts and say I am not very impressed with the types of questions on tests such as SOL's, the SAT, AP exams and others. As much as I would have studied and prepared for these exams, most times after taking the exam I did not feel that I was as prepared as I should have been. Unfortunately, this hurt my confidence when walking into future exams. I think that many of the questions asked on these exams were not as effective as they could be. They are not always clear or concise, and many times the vocabulary or wording in the question confuses the test taker. Students can be very confident on a subject or concept, but they may have a hard time answeing the questions correctly if they cannot get past this misleading way the question is asked. I think that students should possibly be given better review material when preparing for these types of exams. However, I think it is interesting when you hear that on tests such as the SAT, it's not about how much knowledge you have, but about how you take the test. If this is true, then what is the point of knowledge and application questions? I would like to see most questions asked in a clearer way, maybe using some suggestions from the multiple choice article!

I am not surprised at the other postings about the types of questions on standardized tests. I have taken my share of them as well and the one thing that I have learned is that some questions (that break the rules) are designed to help the test taker move quickly to get finished in the time allotted. I could be wrong but I strongly feel that they want you to discard x amount of answers right off the bat. It seemed that when I took the Praxis II and the PCAT that I always came down to two answers very quickly. I do agree with the article we read with the rule about not using only, except, or none!! My praxis II was full of them. They just do that to trick you up. I think they are testing your reading skills as well. This can be bad because you might know that answer to the information pertaining to the question but misread the question and miss it. My praxis II was filled with all of the above or none of the above as well. I am just very thankful that I passed mine and don't have to worry with it anymore. Hopefully these test will change the way they write their questions and it will help test takers in the future.:)

Ooh…SOL’s and multiple-choice questions…not my favorite.  Too often teachers spend their days teaching and drilling students with narrowed curriculum just to pass these high-stakes tests.  In the process, they are losing students to daydreams and boredom.  With relentless drilling and worksheets, teachers can only hope their students will regurgitate material enough to pass.  Then what?  We pray that our students will carry with them what they’ve learned, but for the most part information is lost because it was never engaging enough in the first place.  It is a challenging task to test teach and provide students with enough hands-on explorations of subjects.  Multiple-choice questions give students a chance to simply guess even when they have no clue of the correct answer.  Then, they don’t even get the chance to go back and learn from their incorrect responses.  These questions don’t really require any use of higher level, critical thinking abilities.  We still teach test-taking methods for these types of questions, such as process of elimination, time management, and choice C.  GRE study guides even focus on specific ways to just make an educated guess.  The main problem is that students are only focused on memorization and not reasoning.  They can memorize facts and then just dump them after their tests. [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 22:30, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


In answer to the proposed question of assessment and reasoning, I do not think multiple choice tests are a good platform to measure students reasoning. In a multiple choice test, the student picks one answer out of four usually, without leaving any indication of &quot;why&quot; they picked this particular answer. However, in an essay type test, the instructor can usually decipher the &quot;reasoning&quot; behind their answer because it is written out in paragraph form. This is also a great way to assess if the student has actually retained any of the information they have learned thus far. Keeping this in mind, the instructor needs to give the student clear and concise information prior to the test so that the student is aware and understands what they are required to do and why it is necessary for them to give answers to particular questions (for assessment purposes).[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 03:36, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Ok... multiple choice question exams, for the most part I dislike them. These exams can be very good in assesing students knowledge and reading skills depending on if the students were given the correct tools to approach the test. After taken a number of these test I still find them confusing with wrding that is not common and sentence frasing that sometimes traps you. I think  that it is harder for students to approach these test. It is important for teachers to teach very well the process of elimination and association of problem solving thinking to be able to approach these test with confidence. Allot of times when I felt confident about the material after taking one of these test my mind set had completely changed. I myself preffer question test where I can just give my answer depending on what I have learned. I feel that the curriculums that teach skills only aiming to pass these type of exams disable the abily of students to answer questions in an informative written way.

I think that most multiple choice tests do a fairly well job of assessing students' knowledge as well as their ability to apply that knowledge. This all depends on who is writing the questions. If someone has the ability to write good multiple choice questions, then there is no problem. However, it is hard to get a good balance between knowledge and application, difficulty, and content. My problem with the SOL's is not the questions themselves. It is the extreme pressure put on the students and teachers to pass these tests. Teachers spend so much time worrying about these tests that are not always doing their students justice. The students never get detailed feedback, so they never even learn what mistakes they may have made. I don't think that standardized tests are always beneficial, especially when the stakes are high and the pressure is on to pass.

I used to be all for multiple choice questions– and sometimes when I feel really haggard, or that I understudied, I rejoice upon seeing them. However, I'm skeptical over if it's the best form of assessment. There can be effective multiple choice tests, I'm sure– but there could have been a much better short answer/brief essay test in its place that had the student get more involved with the content they're supposed to be learning. Multiple choice is the least thought provoking, ''interactive'' test type. It has its time and place, and unfortunately that makes them irregular for English majors. What it boils down to is: I don't ever get the luxury of taking them anymore, so no one else should either. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 01:13, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I feel that this type of multiple-choice can cause the student to be confused and second guess themselves.  The wording of the questions and corresponding answers if not done properly can be more confusing. Short answer and essay, I feel these are the best way to know what has been learned by the student and their ability to apply it. Correctly answering “tricky” multiple-choice questions I feel really only shows the student’s ability to think like the question writer. (So many thoughts are running through my head right now). Scantrons have made this style of testing too easy and is used way too often, classes are too big and teachers don’t always have the time needed to test any other way, and SOL’s ……………… [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 02:16, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


Speaking specifically from a mathematical perspective, I believe that multiple choice tests do not fully assess a student's knowledge, especially if the student's work or method is not accounted for. The right answer should not be the only thing that matters. To achieve a passing score on the Algebra 1 SOL a student must correctly answer about 25 out of the 50 questions correctly. Since there are 4 answer choices for each question, a student has a 25% chance to answer every question correctly. That means that out of 50 questions, a student should be able to answer 13 just by guessing randomly. Therefore, the Algebra 1 SOL, and any math SOL for that matter, only requires a student to know how to do 12 problems, at most, to pass. This is an outrage. Not to mention that most of the SOL questions have been dumbed down so far that either: the calculator will give the student the answer without them having the slightest clue, or that the student can simply plug in possible answer choices and still have not clue about the process to solve the problem. In short, I believe that the math SOL especially should NOT be multiple choice. Math is an applied knowledge subject, yet the state of VA has succeeded in taking any thought out of mathematics. ( I just finished my first year teaching Algebra 1 part 2 to repeat students, very few of which knew any basic arithmetic or logic, yet all of them passed their Algebra 1 SOL using the state sanctioned T1-83. Is that really learning?)[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 15:41, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


Okay, I get the &quot;reasoning&quot; part already.  I understand that it is both critical and beneficial to a student to apply information they've learned.  However, as much as I feel prepared for multiple choice test, I feel more times than not...they do me in!  I can recall instances where I've been able to answer the question in my head but battle between two or more answers on the page. Though, I'm not completely against multiple choice, I'm just adverse to test where it's the only format offered. I'm aware of this tactic of &quot;reasoning&quot; but I think it's nonsense! I could better support my answer through writing vs. reasoning between several explanations.  Therefore, I don't believe this should be the primary method for assessing students!

Multiple choice tests can sometimes be a blessing or curse, depending on a student’s level of confidence, knowledge and reasoning. I have taken many tests where the multiple choice section almost served as notes within the test, because I could use some of the answers for the application or reasoning questions. While this can be a very useful strategy for students, it can also be just as harmful if they answer the multiple choice questions wrong. Another flaw with this method is that if teachers assess a student based on this, and the student does poorly, the teacher’s most likely assumption is that the student does not know any of the material at all. This may be true for many students, but no all of them; some students are simply not comfortable or cannot perform on multiple choice tests. It may be even worse, if the multiple choice questions are ineffective, just as in the article by Timothy W. Bothell. It is ultimately the student’s responsibility to study for a test, however, it is also the teacher’s responsibility to create an effective test.  

Knowledge is an important aspect to assess students on but so is their ability to reason. The facts and concepts they learned from lecture almost become useless if students do not know how to apply them, especially in scenarios when they are required in daily life. Unfortunately, many high-stakes test, such as the Virginia’s Standards of Learning, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, Advanced Placement tests and many other exams, consist of at least 50% of multiple choice, which does not demonstrate if the student truly understands the content of the exam. Another issue of application questions or assessing students’ reasoning skills is that most of the time, they are presented in a written format. For students who have a high level of linguistic skills, who learn by looking and writing things down, this is very beneficial for them because the test are almost planned for them. Even students who are verbal, or like to listen and talk while learn, can benefit from these types of tests because they can quietly read the questions to themselves to come to an answer. However, for the group of students who learn hands-on, or kinesthetically, they are at a severe disadvantage because the test leaves little to no room for them to fully use their strengths. The only time they can use their kinesthetic skills is when they do science laboratory activities. I am not saying that during high-stakes test, schools should start having full scale lab activities. At the same time, they can include their hands-on student by providing objects that demonstrate, or apply, the concepts that they know. For example, if a class was doing an exam and one of the questions dealt with the distribution of energy, the teacher would give each student a Newton’s cradle. Students would not have to use the cradle, unless the question requires the use of it. However, if a hands-on student can recall an answer by ''using'' the cradle, the test levels the playing field for all students. Just as teachers provide differentiated instruction for students with special needs, they should also do the same for students with different learning styles.

Assessment is one of the ways that we make sure that the information that has been taught is understand and retained.  I find that multiple choice assessments do not fully take into consideration the people who are not good test takers.  Some test have so much volume that it is stressful for the test takers.  In my experience, I understand that by the end of a test I am not reading the questions fully because I just want the test to end!  That means that I have to force myself to focus and make sure that I take my time.  I also have found that some people can describe and apply knowledge in different formats other than taking a written test.  We are all not standard learners and assessment should be required but possibly given in other ways rather than multiple choice formats. I do not think that they correctly assess everyone.

No, in most cases I do not think multiple-choice questions are the best way to assess a student’s knowledge. They are merely, as most things in life, the simplest and most efficient way. Not nearly the best.  True practical application is always the best assessment of one’s knowledge, whether this means writing an essay, mixing chemicals, doing complex calculations (and showing your work), or landing a plane, all of these involve the use of actual skills. A multiple choice test is a second hand application of those skills that can approximate one’s knowledge but never their actual talent for applying that knowledge. Let me put it this way, I would never let someone fly a plane, cut me open, or create a new type of rocket fuel, based solely on test scores. Test scores, in my opinion, are simply convenient approximations, and are highly effected by things like, test anxiety, test taking skills, and the quality of the questions, multiple choice tests are especially influenced by these factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;14 Rules for Multiple-Choice Questions&lt;/div&gt;
[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

== Reader Responses ==

Reading these rules confuse me because most of the questions that I experience with multiple choice break these rules. I don't mind when teachers put the answer to one question in the question of another but I do not like negative questions such as which of the following is '''NOT''' ... I hate that. [[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:47, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Giving students multiple choice questions is one method of assessment.  In chapter 2, article 1, of _Foundations and Assessment_, the author discusses a number of other subjects in addition to making multiple choice questions.  One subject that is discussed is the various philosophies of education.  The author lists 8 different philosophies of education, including anywhere from positivism (a method focusing primarily on quantitative facts or what can be objectively measured) to existentialism (a method focusing on the student and how to develop learning in connection to student experience).  One strategy that I see  most often in Virginia is essentialism, a method built around assessing students on learning preset facts, as measured by standardized tests such as SOLs, etc.  How one goes about creating multiple choice questions will depend in part on the philosophy of education one presuppose.  From the point of view of essentialism, there will most often be one correct answer.  From the point of view of existentialism, this would not be the case.  I am interested in studying more about how creating multiple choice questions can change according to the educational philosophy presupposed.

Ah ha!  I knew there was a trade secret involving writing test questions.  On tip #5, doesn’t that tip contradict itself?  Is he saying that options #2 or #3 are usually the correct ones, or to avoid making the correct answer 2nd or 3rd?   I had to laugh when I read #7…avoid extremes – never, always, only.  I was told once by a teacher to look for those words to eliminate that option as a correct answer.  #12 and #13 are the questions that I love in an exam.  Of course if the answer is “all of the above” or “none of the above” I always seem to want to pick that answer!  Additionally, one thing I can’t stand in an exam is when a question seems to have a double negative in it.  For example if an option read, “It is never correct to not use the turn signal when turning right”, my brain is always scrambled by those type of questions and I have to spend too much time deciphering the instructors words to find the correct answer for a question!

I did not realize all the thought that goes into making MC question tests.  This article opened my eyes to something new to think about.  It is surprising to see that just rewording the question can make it so much better.  I do agree with the information in this article, clear directions are so important.  I have always felt that MC questions can be so confusing and that the way some are worded are meant to be tricky.  It was also funny to read about how to set up your answers.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 04:55, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


teachers do need to learn how to give better multiple choice tests. students are always happy when they know a test is multiple choice, because they know it will be easier. Teachers are sleeply, so they write simpler questions. I myself prefer short answer or oral test, but if multiple choice could be made effective, then it could be a viable option. [[User:Rebecca.hechler|Rebecca.hechler]] ([[User talk:Rebecca.hechler|talk]]) 03:02, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

If these rules are followed they could be a constructive way of testing. I feel though that maybe the preparer of the test finds tricking the student is easier than using these rules.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 15:18, 6 June 2009 (UTC) 


This article was very informative and gave me a lot of ideas on how I may want to word multiple choice tests in the future. It is interesting that by just rewording questions and by giving more intricate answer choices, a teacher can better test his or her students.  I believe, however, that it is important to use a variety of questions types, so it might not be a bad idea to use the basic &quot;what is the capital city of California&quot; questions.  Using the questions with real-life examples is a great way to find out if students not only know and understand the information, but they can analyze a situation using the information.  I did not, however, agree that students should be given long, drawn out explanations of how they are being tested.  This might just confuse them, and most will probably just skip over them. [[User:Abeck017|Abeck017]] ([[User talk:Abeck017|talk]]) 01:57, 5 June 2009 (UTC) 


It is always amazing how much thought and how many studies go into just making multiple choice questions. On saying that, it also amazes me the amount of professors/teachers who still make incorrect tests....or really not as effective tests. I agree with the article that so many questions are meant to trick the student really when we should just be assessing what the students know and not trying to see if they can pass the trick. Also there are the test that have the dead give away questions and answers. Overall, I do agree with this article and the amount of time and thought that should go into tests. I feel sometimes that our education system has become too complicated and if things were simply done it would make a much more effective learning environment...this is in reference to teaching tools and assessments. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 16:05, 4 June 2009 (UTC)


Wow! Did I learn some new things about giving multiple choice questions.  The explanation about not to make the answer &quot;none of the above&quot; makes sense. A teacher would not know if the student did not know the correct answer if there is a &quot;none of the above&quot; answer. When I have to make a multiple choice test/quiz for my students I will be putting more thought about how to phrase the questions.  I never even thought about writing the directions like that. Writing the directions like the example really lets the student know what they are being tested on. I will use these tips myself when taking multiple choice tests/quizzes. [[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 14:02, 4 June 2009 (UTC)


I found this article to be very interesting. I found the tips for writinf mutiple choice questions to be very helpful.  I especially found the tip on not using &quot;none of the above&quot; to be informative.  I never thought about that answer choice as meaning the student could not know the answer. I know when I take multiple choice test I dilike the answers that are &quot;none of the above&quot; or &quot;all of the above&quot; or &quot;two or three of the above.&quot;  I did not realize how challenging it can be to write multiple choise test until I began working on my Wikibook article.  I felt as though it took me forever to come up with just four questions.  I think reading these tips helped me better understand multiple choice and I feel I will be more effective writing tests in the future with the help of the tips. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 19:27, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


That article was really interesting! All of the tips listed made perfect sense. After taking thousands of test over the years, I think back to all the ones that violated these rules! The point of tests is in fact to see what the student knows and how to improve teaching skills, yet I remember so many &quot;tricky&quot; tests and questions. Keeping the questions simple and concise will be the best method of assessment. I don't think that this means they have to be &quot;easy&quot; questions, but it will allow for a clearly stated question and answer. Having this list of Do's and Don'ts will not only be helpful when writing the multiple choice questions for the Wikibook but in our own classrooms as well. Im beginning to see all that this Wikibook (and the assignments) have to teach us! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 00:14, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I thought that the multiple choice rules were perhaps the most interesting topic we covered in class today. I never thought writing multiple choice questions could have so many &quot;rules&quot;. They were clear and concise and made sense. Especially since after taking many tests as a student, I could relate to most of the &quot;do not&quot; rules. I laughed when I read the rule about not having one question on a test answer another question on the same test. When I can't remember fill-in-the-blank answers on some tests I just go to the multiple choice questions and matching questions and look for a word I think could be the answer. It usually works, too! [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 17:37, 2 June 2009 (UTC)


I thought this article was informative and very interesting. Who would have thought there would be so many things to think about when writing multiple choice questions? I really liked how this article suggested to ask questions that require higher level thinking, as we discussed in class. When an application question is asked about a real-life situation, students must first use knowledge to recall the facts, and then use application to apply the facts to the situation. I feel that after listening to the lecture and reading this article, I can now easily distinguish between knowledge and application questions. I also thought it was interesting how the article said to avoid answering one test question with another test question. It made me think back on how many tests I took where this rule was not applied (and how grateful the students were that the teacher overlooked this!). I agree with the suggestion not to use “all of the above” or “none of the above” in your answer options. If these are used, I feel there is less an opporunity for application or higher level thinking than questions with four possible answers. I will definitely be using these tips and suggestions when writing my multiple choice questions in Wikibook! [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 00:55, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I enjoyed reading this article because it showed me my poor ability to write multiple choice questions. I have broken almost every rule!! I enjoyed how the article gave examples of ineffective and effective questions that were followed by explanations. I think Bloom's taxonomy was supported by the article with knowledge being the basis of the questions. Without knowledge students would be unable to answer the higher level thinking questions or be able to reason. Each rule made perfect sense in its own way, however I couldn't seem to forget how many standardized tests that I have taken that broke at least two rules. I believe that all educators and test preparers should read and enforce the rules written in this article. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:26, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I found this article very helpful. It really made me think back to all the tests I've taken through out school that didn't follow these rules. One of the points that seemed obvious, but tends to be quite common, is making sure that all possible answers are grammatically correct, because students are more likely to pick the answer that is written well. One point that I think may be left up to the discression of the teacher is point #7: Avoid Clues to the Correct Answer. Many teachers will have correct answers to some questions hidden in other questions in the test to make sure that students are reading critically. This also shows if the students really don't know the material, because if they get one question correct and one wrong that both have the same answer, more than likely, they got lucky on one of those questions. These points are all ones that I will keep in mind when I am a teacher, but especially when I am writing the review questions for my special feature. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 20:11, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


Ok…this article was not my favorite.  Nonetheless, it does provide useful information in order to create multiple-choice questions.  However, it was somewhat boring.  I guess you cannot make this particular topic too exciting.  The content however is significant.  It is imperative that teachers understand how to properly assess students and have a variety of successful methods to do so.  The controversy is whether multiple-choice questions are truly helping students retain information.  Personally, I study less and retain less for multiple-choice tests than either short answer or essay tests.  Now, do not get me wrong, I do not love short answer essay writing.  I just tend to study harder for those types of tests.  Different methods of assessments provide different levels of critical thinking, analyzing, reproduction, and practice.  I suppose truly, it just depends on the content or importance of subject matter, when choosing the appropriate method.  I also suppose that because most classrooms use multiple-choice assessments, teachers should continue to study ways to make these questions more effective.  For this reason, the assigned article was right on point.  It is a great list to refer back to when creating questions, quizzes, or worksheets for your classroom.  It was easy to read.  The format was nicely bulleted and short to the point.  I will probably print it and keep it with me.  The problem…I just don’t always believe in the effectiveness of multiple-choice assessments, but I know they have their purpose.  This article lays a great foundation of the rules for developing these types of questions.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 21:56, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


This was a very informative article and I like the use of so many examples.  I had a biology class where the teacher did not ask higher level thinking questions on her exams.  While it did make it easy to earn a high grade on the tests, I have to wonder how much longer I will retain the information I learned.  She also used a lot of &quot;all of the above&quot; and &quot;none of the above&quot; questions.  I can see where a student could &quot;guess&quot; the correct answer and then they and the teacher might never truly know if the student grasps the lesson.  I will definitely follow the rules from this article when writing my Wikibook article questions and I think every teacher should have this on hand as a reference when designing their exams!  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 17:42, 4 June 2009 (UTC)


I really enjoyed reading this article because it discusses many of the things you should not do when preparing a multiple choice exam, such as &quot;using only one correct option&quot;. Too many times, I have taken multiple choice exams where there were several &quot;possible correct&quot; answers. As a result, I spent too long deciding which answer made the &quot;best choice&quot;. On a timed test, if you have to spend too long on one question because there are several possible answers, you tend to speed through the remainder of the test due to the time constraints without reading the content thoroughly. I liked the fact that the author used examples depicting both sides, &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;less effective&quot; choices. It gives me some food for thought when preparing multiple choice exams in the future.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:21, 5 June 2009 (UTC)


This article was very well thought out and organized. Everything was nicely bulleted and easy to read. The examples of the questions really clarified everything. It made me think back to tests that I have had in the past that did not have these tips in mind. I thought that it was interesting that it says to avoid the &quot;All of the above&quot; and &quot;None of the above&quot; options. The reasons made sense, but I have always been so used to having those types of questions that I was kind of surprised. While &quot;All of the above&quot; can be more easily eliminated (if you can identify one or more responses that are definitely not correct), &quot;None of the above&quot; has always seemed a little bit more tricky for me. If I do not clearly know the answer to the question, and then I see &quot;None of the above&quot;, I always second guess myself a lot more. Great article, certainly shed some light on strategies of making multiple choice questions. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 00:32, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I really enjoyed reading this article especially because it documents the proper and improper ways in which to configure multiple choice questions, which is we as teachers will be doing! All of the tips listed made perfect sense to me as I was reading, I felt that all teachers should take a look at this article to see if they are implementing these tips with their present tests or not! I have personal experience with one of the types of multiple choice questions listed as &quot;to avoid&quot;. This is the &quot;all of the above&quot; choice for multiple choice questions. I have had several teachers throughout my academic career use &quot;all of the above&quot; as an answer choice with tests and quizzes. I do believe that this is not an adequate measure with which to score a student's knowledge because like the author indicated the student merely has to know just two of the answers are right in order to get the question correct. I have also had many teachers use more than one correct option in the answer. In those cases there were two answers listed that were both right, but there was one the teacher felt was more right than the other. Therefore I feel that the &quot;using only one correct option&quot; is a good outline to use for multiple choice tests as well. I liked the layout of the article, it made it easy to read the paragraphs flowed nicely as well. I did like all the sample multiple choice questions, depicting the best types of questions to use and also the worst types to avoid. I do feel this could be a very valuable resource as a future teacher to look back on when devising my own tests for my students!!

You know... I would be really, really terrible at designing a test of multiple choice questions. Most likely because I do not have the patience to design something adequate enough to assess if a student learned what I wanted him to. I would much rather design short answer/essay, as I believe it gives more leeway and wiggle room if they can explain to me what they think or why they suppose their answer is correct rather than just circle or fill in a bubble. I'd be much more apt to give partial credit as well. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 01:40, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


The quiz I had originally written was polished and complete...until I read this article.  I never realized the subliminal factors that went into preparing a quiz or a test.  These factors can prove critical in the clarification or confusion of a test taker.  Back to the drawing board,my wording was revised as well as the format of my questions.  The new improvements required a higher level of thinking for the test taker by implementing situational examples, and my favorite option &quot;All the above&quot; was fatefully removed.  Now, If only I could somehow forward this article to some of my other professors...? [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 16:17, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


Very educational article, such an eye opener!!! After reading this is realize that most of the multiple choice exams that I have taken have not been well constructed, spell checked, proofread and practiced by experts before getting to my hands as a student. Who would have known there would be productive rules to follow when creating a challenging but positive exam? Students would have a good experience with the test even thought they are being challenged intellectually. They would not lose their confidence on a topic; of course if they studied… besides that if the test followed the correct structure I think it would be received better because it would be clearer to the student. I wish that some of the teachers that I had in the past would have practice the rules in this document, I would have not spend so much time dealing with the confusing incomplete unreasonable statements that never helped getting to the correct answer. I am happy that one of the emphases on this article was giving clear instructions; these are sometime the mayor reason why students answer incorrectly other than not studying the material. If the students cannot understand what exactly it is that the teacher is asking, then how are they supposed to answer correctly? Great article, direct and clearly understood.  It all made great sense to me as a student and as future teacher. [[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 16:37, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


Although I have not written many of them, multiple choice questions are one of the hardest things for me to create, because I try hard not be obvious with my answers. By obvious, I mean not having a pattern of answers (for every third question, the answer is B), having a question where it is clear that only one answer is possible (water, juice, soda, candy) or making my choices too hard. However, this article provides many helpful rules and tips for creating a test that actually assess a student’s knowledge and reasoning instead of a test where a student can figure a pattern and answer the questions that way. One of my favorite rules was the fourth rule, keep option lengths similar. There has been many times that I have chosen an answer simply on the basis that it looked longer or shorter than the other choices, so it must be the correct one. I knew that there was a chance that it could be wrong based on that kind of reasoning but it would usually come to this point when I was running out of time or just tired of taking the test. It can be very frustrating on the student’s part, but as a teacher it does give a better view of what the student knows or does not know. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 18:56, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


It is refreshing to know that there is a science to some of the tests that I have gotten over the years. I have found that in my experience the requirement about not putting negative questions is definitely one that should be followed.  I hate those NOT questions.  My job requires me to give American Red Cross tests and the ones that my staff and students frequently get wrong are the questions that have NOT in the question, because they read the questions to quickly and miss that word.  I make up practice tests for my daughters to help them study for tests and I will definitely use these suggestions when preparing for them and the one day when I get to do tests in a classroom setting!

I found most of this information to be common sense aside from the use of “higher level thinking questions”. I was unaware of the difference between the two, but after reading the article the difference is clear.  The “memorization questions” are  those that I found to be much more common on my college level multiple choice tests and the “higher level” questions seemed much more prevalent during my high school years. I suppose this difference can be mostly attributed to professors being experts in their field rather than in “teaching”.  I just found it rather odd that as the level of education seems to increase the quality of tests seems to decrease.  I know I’m opening a can of worms here…but would it hurt for there to be some sort of basic teaching skill required for college professors? There are many, many brilliant professors that simply cannot teach, or do not care to, and it seems as if though a lot of superfluous difficulty on tests and the classes in general could be eliminated with just some very basic teaching skills.

This year has been a crash course for me in assessments.  I have not had an extensive background in test writing.  If I would have had this article from the beginning of the year things would have been much easier for me this year.  Of course I was able to write test questions, but I could assessed the knowledge of my students at a higher level.  All of the classes that I have for my provisional license are in my endorsement area.  The classes I need are the foundation education classes.  These classes have really been an eye opener as to the ins and outs of classroom teaching.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 22:45, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


I think that multiple choice questions help the student in several different ways. for instance in a math class it helps reinforce the correct way to write a certain formula. It can also help the student use decision making skills. this helps them be able to tell the difference between similar answers. in the music world it helps reinforce the difference between different note values and time signatures and things along those lines. I think that multiple choice questions are a very important part of the learning process when they are used properly.

Multiple choice questions are the easiest way to test a student. Why? Well it can provide not only knowledge or reference questions but questions that will test how well the student knows the material. The rules on this article are precise and helpful toward the test-making process. Tricking a student in no way to test the material.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 21:25, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

I have been working with 6th grade students in special education for eight years and for the past two years we have done VGLAs. But, for my grade level/content area that I chose 6th grade reading.  Q# 9 is application because the student has to reason which sentence would fit best in the paragraph. Q#25 would be knowledge because the student has to know the difference between a folk tale, biography, autobiography, and historical fiction.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 17:11, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

Before this class I had no idea what SOLs meant.  I also had no idea that your teaching was pretty much based around this.  Q# 1,3,10 &amp; 17 in 3rd grade reading is knowledge based because you can look up answer in story, it is facts.  Q# 15 &amp; 16 are application based because they are situation/examples questions you can not look up answer in paragraph.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 05:25, 6 June 2009 (UTC)


Last year I taught 4th grade Science.  What is unique about this particular grade level is that there is no Science SOL test given in 4th grade.  When students take the SOL test in 5th grade they are tested on material in both grades.  I have used the Grade 5 Release Test to help review my 4th grade students in preparation for their end-of-year test, which my school division requires.  From what I have observed, elementary level SOL tests for Science have more application questions than knowledge based questions.  Students must be able to read graphs, complete minor computation, and apply what they have learned to answer an array of questions.  In the 2007 Grade 5 release test, question 3 uses a flow chart to identify specific characteristics of an organism and the student must correctly identify which organism they are describing.  Other examples of application questioning include graphing plant growth (#8), using illustrations to describe characteristics of  speed and motion (#9), using factual data about a coral reef to describe and identify the organism that may exist in that biome (#19), and picking the correct illustration that is an example of kinetic energy (#27).  Most children can easily memorize facts. Through recollection of previously learned material, students should be able to easily answer knowledge based questions.  In the release test, students can pick out an invertebrate (#21), identify the correct weather instrument (#23), understand and identify the layers of the Earth (#26), and choose the correct substance that is an electrical conductor (#38).  Due to the nature of scientific investigation, I believe that Science is a great example of how important both knowledge based and application based questioning serves as important tools in student assessment.

I have to admit, that the SOL's are new to me. The assessment test in Washington state, where I live, is called the WASL. I decided to do some research first, to see if both the SOL and WASL are similar in requirements, etc. I chose to look at the reading sample tests for 5th grade from both the SOL and WASL. Some of the differences I found were what grades were required to take the tests and the scoring. However, I did not find much difference in the format and whether the tests were knowledge or application based. For this assignment, I read through the 5th grade reading test that was released in 2007. This particular subject had a proportionate amount of knowledge and application questions to assess the students. One example of a knowledge based question is #5, where the question asks the student to first read the story above and then &quot;read this part of a sentence from paragraph 8&quot;. After reading the particular sentence, the student is asked to tell which word means the same as the suffix of a particular word &quot;en&quot; in the sentence. This is a knowledge based question because it requires the students recall of previous information. One example of an application based question is #12, where the question asks the student to pick &quot;the main problem of the story&quot;. This is an application based question because it requires students to apply previous knowledge to help them decide the best course of action for the particular scenario, i.e. deductive reasoning.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:42, 5 June 2009 (UTC)


As I have just finished my first year of teaching Algebra 1 part 2, I am very aware of the SOL standards. Actually, I have researched all the previously used SOL questions and organized them by SOL point for Algebra only. In doing this, throughout the past year, I have come to notice a disturbing trend. In the early years of the SOLs, the Algebra 1 test was about 50-50 knowledge/application. In more recent years, speaking as recent as 2008, the questions are increasingly knowledge. The idea of the SOL is very idealist, to make a standardized test that everyone must pass. However, in order to facilitate that the standards wind up inevitably being lowered so students can pass to meet NCLB. By lowering the standards, not only are the SOL not accomplishing their goal, but also are doing a disservice to those advanced students. In my opinion, the SOLs are like communism: great on paper but nearly impossible to implement &quot;properly&quot;.

      <comment>/* The Assenter's Charter */ grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Quran is the holy book of The Assent. The [[s:Quran/1#1-7| opening chapter]] of Quran says everything you need to know about The Assent as a way of life or path.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;In the name of God, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Praise be to ''God, the Lord of the worlds''.
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;The Almighty, the Most Merciful.
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Possessor of the ''Day of Judgment''.
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;You alone we serve, and You alone we seek for help.
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Guide us to ''the straight path''.
&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;The path of those whom You have blessed, not those who have incurred the wrath, nor the misguided.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the passage above, The Quran assumes that the reader of Quran is the one who follows three criteria:
# Believe in God
# Believe in The Final Justice
# Follow The Straight Path

Believe in God assumes that something, either natural or supernatural, creates and maintains the planets so they don't crash into each other. Believe in The Final Justice assumes that no thieves nor murderers will get away without paying for their crime. This also means that good works will always get rewards. 

Also note that the highest goal of The Assent is not in money, power or popularity, but in relationship. The quality of relationship between a soul and its creator is reflected in the blessing or wrath mentioned in those verses. This relationship is direct and personal.

== The Assenter's Charter ==
These three criteria are repeated in [[s:Quran/2#62-71 | Koran 2:62]] or [[s:Quran/5#67-77 | Koran 5:69]]. The words in bracket are addition to summarize of what follows it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Those (every single human)
# who believe, and 
# those who are Jewish, and 
# the Sabiens, and 
# the Nazarenes; 

whoever of them (follow three criteria)
# believes in God and 
# the Last Day and 
# does good works, 

then they (get salvation/inner peace)
# will have nothing to fear 
# nor will they grieve.&quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Quranic standard above, every human regardless of their religion will get salvation as long as they follow three simple criteria. It is important to note that this is a charter, a take and give. People join this charter voluntarily to get some benefits in return. People who join this charter are called an Assenter. This is because they enter The Assent to get inner-peace.

In the &quot;Alchemy of Happiness&quot; book, al-Ghazali begins by writing that &quot;He who knows himself is truly happy.&quot; People who is satisfied with herself, proud to be her, and at peace with herself is truly happy. She have no regrets nor fear because she managed to live her live with her own principles, her own rules. And also because she managed to re-conciliate and accept her shortcomings and mistakes that happens in her life.

This charter is a well-kept secret in the Islamic circles. It is a secret, in the sense that it is not mainstream nor being taught in the schools or mosques. It is understandable, because they communicates with mostly the follower of Prophet Muhammad. So, they teach whatever specific to the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad. On the other hand, Quran communicates with the entire humanity. So, some of its messages are generic and universal across religions and prophets.

''Warning'': Some Moslem scholars, such as Taliban in Afghanistan, oppose The Assenter's Charter and declare that this verse is invalid or withdrawn. See [[../Glossary/]] for further information. Fortunately, they do not withdraw nor invalidate the verses that define The Straight Path. We will explain it shortly.

== The Moral Criterion ==
The third criteria &quot;does good works&quot; is to follow The Straight Path or &quot;My Path, a Straight One&quot; as mentioned in [[s:Quran/6#151-154 | Koran 6:150-153]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Say: &quot;Come let me recite to you what your Lord has ''forbidden'' for you: that 
# you should not ''set up anything with'' Him; and 
# be kind to your ''parents''; and 
# do not kill your unborn ''children'' for fear of poverty, We provide for you and for them; and 
# do not come near ''lewdness'', what is plain of it or subtle; and 
# do not ''kill'' the soul which God has forbidden, except in justice. That is what He enjoined you that you may comprehend.&quot;
# And do not come near the money of the ''orphan'', except for what is best, until he reached his maturity; and 
# give honestly full measure and weight ''equitably''. We do not burden a soul except by what it can bear, and 
# if you speak then be ''just'' even if against a relative; and 
# regarding the ''pledges'' made to God, you shall observe them. This He has enjoined you that you may remember.&quot; 
# And this is ''My path, a Straight One''. &quot;So follow it, and do not ''follow'' the other paths lest they divert you from His path. 
That is what He has enjoined you to that you may be righteous.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Quranic standard above, to follow The Straight Path is to avoid crimes against equality, family, humanity, fairness and integrity. These moral criteria, also known as &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; are shared among the three monotheistic religions; Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

Those values are personal moral values and not, by itself, a license to punish people who violates those values. [[../Limits|The legal limits]] restrict what we may and may not do to protect ourselves against such crimes.

=== Equality ===
The simplest example of ''set up anything with'' or ''making equals with'' God precedes and side-by-side with its prohibition in [[s:Quran/6#145-150 | Quran 6:150]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Say: &quot;Bring forth your witnesses who bear witness that God has ''forbidden this''.&quot; If they bear witness, then do not bear witness with them, nor follow the desires of those who deny Our revelations, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter; and they ''make equals with'' their Lord!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, the very basic idea of The Assent is direct relationship with God. No human being, nor saints, prophets, scholars nor religious institutions are allowed stand between you and God. One of first thing the religious institution and scholars do is to invent sacred prohibitions not authorized by God. According to Quranic standard above, ''make equals with'' God is assuming yourself, your scholars or your religious institutions as a partner of God (Bigotry). 

So, if someone complains that Islam is backwards or oppresive, then this verse should enlighten her. This moral code was revealed several millennia ago, inspiring many philosophers and political movements towards Equality, Liberty, Solidarity, Rational, Secularism and Democracy. We can witness this by examining how [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=413 Ibn Rushd] (a.k.a. Averroës) helped trigger the European Renaissance and Western Civilization.

=== Family ===
The [[s:Quran/6#151-154 | next three sacred prohibitions]] is about honoring your parents, avoiding abortion and lewdness. The lewdness prohibited by God includes adultery [[s:Quran/17#31-40 | (17:32)]], incest [[s:Quran/4#15-22 | (4:22-23)]] and homosexuality [[s:Quran/7#73-84 | (7:80-81)]]. God explains these sacred prohibitions in more practical details in [[s:Quran/17#23-30 | 17:23-25]] and in [[s:Quran/17#31-40 | 17:31-32]].

Those three crimes break Family values. Families are the core of humankind. Destroying families equals to destroying humankind.

=== Humanity ===
The [[s:Quran/6#151-154 | fifth sacred prohibition]] prohibits murder. God provides more practical details in [[s:Quran/17#31-40 | 17:33]] about how to bring justice to the murderer.

=== Fairness ===
The [[s:Quran/6#151-154 | next three sacred prohibitions]] is about being fair when dealing with orphan's wealth, doing business and giving testimony in court. There are more practical details about it in [[s:Quran/17#31-40 | 17:34-35]].

You might notice that God use the terms sacred prohibitions to explain The Straight Path. The sacred prohibition of usury in [[s:Quran/2#274-281 | Koran 2:275]] might be the explanation the 6th sacred prohibition, about being fair in business.

=== Integrity ===
The [[s:Quran/6#151-154 | last two sacred prohibitions]] are about keeping your promise you have made with God and following only His Path, the Straight One. We group them as Integrity value as one should follow all the sacred prohibitions above as whole to be accepted by God.

== The Wisdom ==
The Straight Path is simple but not easy. Therefore, [[s:Quran/6#145 | 6:145]] precedes it with dietary prohibitions. Moreover, [[s:Quran/17#23 | Koran 17:23-39]] repeats, details and expands it with four extra prohibitions. [[s:Quran/17#31 | Koran 17:39]] names them as ''part of The Wisdom''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That is from what your Lord has inspired to you of ''the wisdom''. And do not make with God another god, or you will be cast into Hell, blameworthy and regretting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The wisdom also acts as a safety net. For example, being responsible could prevent bigotry-related crime when one does just blame God for all his/her crime. Similarly, solidarity wisdom could prevent money-related crime. Chapter 3 will explain how to respond to a crime.

=== Solidarity Wisdom ===
[[s:Quran/17#23-30 | Koran 17:26-30]] encourages us to be sparing and kind, instead of greed and insults. Some people might refer this as solidarity and empathy.

=== Respect Wisdom ===
[[s:Quran/17#31-40 | Koran 17:36-37]] encourages us to be cautious and humble, instead of blame and show-off. Some people might refer this as responsibility, honesty and respect.

=== Food Wisdom ===
[[s:Quran/2#168-176 | Koran 2:173]] forbids only what is already dead, and the blood, and the meat of pig, and what was dedicated to other than God.

More details and the reasoning is provided through [[s:Quran/5#1-5 | 5:3]], [[s:Quran/6#145-150 | 6:145]], and [[s:Quran/6#111-121 | 6:118]]. The meat of pig is forbidden because it is hazardous (the pig eat all of those forbidden food, including blood and the carcase of other pig whenever they have a chance). We found that, if you knew how bad is the food prohibited by God, you will never even consider to eat it.

=== Remembrance Wisdom ===
People do make mistakes. People may ask for help, guidance, or forgiveness of their Creator. This can be done directly, any time and in any language without artificial restrictions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say: &quot;O My servants who transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God. For God forgives all sins. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.&quot; And repent to your Lord, and submit to Him, before the retribution comes to you. Then you cannot be helped. And follow the best of what has been sent down to you from your Lord, before the retribution comes to you suddenly when you least expect it. ([[s:Quran/39#53-63 | 39:53-55]]) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

People may glorify or remember his Creator. While the first one can be done on occasion, the later should be done continuously, 24 hours per day {{fact}}. This is because remembering Him means honouring His prohibitions, such as avoiding corruptions. Forgetting Him means violating His prohibitions.

== Talk Back ==
Do you know a convert from an atheist or polytheist into a follower of monotheistic religions, such as Islam? 

What difference in her life because of the conversion? Does she feel insecurities or peace and certainty?

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a shocking truth about Koran. Koran contains not only guidance, but also ''traps''! This warning or disclaimer is mentioned in the start of the [[s:Quran/3 | third chapter]] of Koran.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He is the One who sent down to you the Scripture, from which there are ''firm verses''; they are the essence of the Scripture; and others which are ''similar to each other''. As for those who have ''disease in their hearts'', they will follow what is similar from it seeking to confuse, and seeking to derive an interpretation. But ''none know its interpretation'' except God and those who are well founded in knowledge, they Say: &quot;We believe in it, all is from our Lord.&quot; And none will remember except the people of understanding.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In God's point of view, this traps are tests to exposes those people who has disease in their hearts, such as bigots and hypocrites. While it is a useful feature, it can be abused to justify or rally supports for malicious agenda. 

Fortunately, the verse above gives at least three obvious things to watch out:
# firm verses
# disease in hearts
# interpretation of non-firm verses

This chapter will help you to ''focus'' on firm verses, to ''heal'' heart disease and to ''ignore'' interpretation of non-firm verses. This method is known as Fundamentalist or Essentialist Literal understanding of the Koran.

== Focus on Firm Verses ==
There are five most valued book of Islam. One is the Koran, two hadith books and two history books. It will take more than a lifetime to truly understand them. But the essentials from those five books, can be learn in five minutes to five weeks, if you follow the guide from this chapter.

According to [[s:Quran/30#28-40 | Koran 30:30]], humans are naturally born as Assenters. The concept of God, Final Justice and important commandements of Islam from ''Chapter 1'' of this book is known even without opening the Koran. For implementation details and approximate descriptions of the unseen worlds, they can always learn it from the scholars.

=== God guides ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Lord), You alone We do worship and from You alone we do seek assistance. (Lord), ''guide us'' to ''the straight path'', the path of those to whom You have granted blessings, those who are neither subject to Your anger nor have gone astray'' (1:5-7)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then High above all be Allâh, the True King. And be not in haste (O Muhammad SAW) with the Qur'ân before its revelation is completed to you, and say: &quot;My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.&quot; (20:114) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Start with the best message ===
[[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1885 Sahih Muslim Book 004, Number 1885]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jabir b. Abdullah said: God's Messenger say:&quot; The ''best message'' (''khayrul hadeeth'') is the ''Book of God'', and the best of the guidance is Muhammad's. And the most evil affairs are their innovations; and every innovation is error.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
God has revealed the ''best message'' (''ahsanal hadeeth'') in the form of a Book with similar passages which ''refer to each other'' and make the skins of those who fear their Lord shiver. Then their skins and hearts incline to the remembrance of God. This is the guidance of God. ''He guides whomever He wants''. No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray. ([[s:Quran/39#22-31 | 39:23]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Start with the fundamental ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is God who has revealed the Book to you in which ''some verses are clear statements'' (which accept no interpretation) and these are the ''fundamental'' ideas of the Book, while ''other verses'' may have ''several possibilities''. Those whose hearts are perverse, follow the unclear statements in pursuit of their own mischievous goals by interpreting them in a way that will suit their own purpose. No one knows its ''true interpretations'' except ''God'' and those who have a ''firm grounding in knowledge'' say, &quot;We believe in it. All its verses are from our Lord.&quot; No one can grasp this fact except the people of reason. 
(3:7)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A good example of law verses versus similar verses is 4:3 versus 4:129 about poligamy. While first is a law verses, clearly marked with imperative words, the later is a mere statement of facts. But, scholars are polarized by the later verses producing a totally opposite interpretation about poligamy.

=== Do not wait ===
Learning God's book might take generations and certainly will not fit in our lifetime, especialy if it includes research on multiple-meaning (mutasabah) verses. It will be wise not to wait until we finish learning the book. Start practicing it once you understand the straight path, and gain more knowledge when you need it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Believers, do not let your wealth and children divert you from remembering God. Whoever is diverted will suffer a great loss. ''Spend for the cause of God'' out of what We have given you ''before death approaches'' you, and say, &quot;Lord, would that you would give me respite for a short time so that I could spend for Your cause and become one of those who do good&quot;. God will never grant respite to any soul when its appointed time has come. God is Well-Aware of what you do.(63:9-11)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Heal heart disease ==

=== Dig evidence ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do ''not'' follow ''what you do not know''; the ears, eyes, and hearts will ''all be held responsible'' for their deeds. (17:36)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Language is not barrier ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Had We sent down this Quran in a non-Arabic language, they would have said, &quot;Why have its verses not been well expounded?&quot; Could a ''non-Arabic Book'' be revealed to an ''Arabic speaking person''? (Muhammad), say, &quot;It is a guide and a cure for the believers. As for those who do not believe, they are deaf and blind. It is as though they had been called from a distant place&quot;. (41:44)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not need to swear by the setting of the stars - which is indeed a great oath if only you knew it - that this is an honorable Quran preserved in a ''hidden Book'' which no one can touch it ''except the purified ones''. (This Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe. (56:75-80)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Listen others carefully ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is it that they do not think about the Quran or are their ''hearts sealed''?. (47:24)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whenever the Quran is recited (to you), ''listen to it'' quietly so that you may receive mercy.(7:204)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Secret behind arabic keywords ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you recite the Quran We place a curtain as a ''barrier'' between you and those who do not believe in the life to come. We put a veil over their hearts so that they cannot understand it. We deafen their ears. When you mention your Lord in this Quran as One (Supreme Being), they run away. (17:45-46)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The disbelievers say, &quot;Do not listen to this Quran but make a lot of ''unnecessary noise'' while it is being read so that perhaps you will defeat it&quot;. (41:26)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


== Ignore interpretations ==
=== Learn surroundings &amp; related verse ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You, who have wrapped yourself up with a mantle, worship (God) for a few hours at night. (Worship Him) for more or less than half of ''the night'' and ''recite (rateel)'' the Quran in a ''distinct tone (tarteel);'' (73:1-4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your Lord knows that you and a group of those who are with you get up for prayer sometimes for less than two-thirds of ''the night'', sometimes half and sometimes one-third of it. God determines the duration of the night and day. He knew that it would be hard for you to keep an exact account of the timing of the night prayers, so He turned to you with forgiveness. Thus, ''recite'' from the Quran ''as much as possible''. He knew that some of you would be sick, others would travel in the land to seek God's favors, and still others would fight for the cause of God. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible, be steadfast in prayer, pay the zakat , and give virtuous loans to God. Whatever good deeds you save for the next life, you will certainly find them with God. This is the ''best investment'', and for this you will find the greatest reward. Ask forgiveness from God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful. (73:20)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Beware of multiple meaning words ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Muhammad), when you recite the Quran, ''seek refuge'' in God from the ''mischief of satan''. Satan has certainly no authority over the believers who have trust in their Lord. The only authority which he has is over his friends and those who consider things equal to God. (16:98-100)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Muhammad), give the glad news to those of Our servants who ''listen'' to the words and only ''follow the best ones''. Tell them that they are those whom God has guided. They are the people of understanding. (39:18)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(After having revealed the Quran to you) in all truth and justice, your Lord's Word has been completed. ''No one'' can ''change His Words''. He is All-hearing and All-knowing. ''Most'' of the people in the land ''will lead you away'' from God's guidance if you follow them; they only follow their own ''conjecture'' and ''preach falsehood''. (6:115-116)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider (Muhammad) how God (in a parable) compares the ''blessed Word'' to that of a ''blessed tree'' which has ''firm roots'' and ''branches rising up'' into the sky and ''yields fruits in every season'', by the permission of its Lord? God sets forth parables for people so that they may take heed. An ''evil word'' is compared to an ''evil tree'' with ''no firm roots'' in the land and thus ''has no stability''. God strengthens the faith of the believers by the true Words in this world and in the life to come. He causes the unjust to go astray and does whatever He pleases. (14:24-27)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Learn examples ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In revealing this Quran to you, We tell you the ''best of the stories'' of which you were unaware.(12:3)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have mentioned in this Quran ''all kinds of examples'' for the human being, but most human beings turn away in disbelief. (17:89)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Know the ranges (hudud) ===
For example cutting thief hands is a maximum punishment. The minimum one is mentioned right after it.

== Talk Back ==
Do you know two Moslem scholars who have conflicting interpretation of certain Koranic verses, such as verse related to women's right? 

What are the arguments supporting their differing interpretations? Try to investigate the source of the differences using the reference above.

      <comment>/* The winning strategy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the birth of humankind, the Assenter community experienced rise and fall. This chapter discuss about what it takes to attain great success (falah). It is possible to attain success in any levels, as a family, a group or as a nation.

== The winning strategy ==
There are four part strategy in [[s:Quran/103 | Chapter 103]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;By time. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The human is indeed in loss. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Except
# those who believe, 
# do good works, 
# support one another with the truth, and
# support one another with perseverance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As we can see, doing nothing is a losing strategy. The winning strategy start with spiritual strength of individuals and families, and then on good actions and hard work, and on education, media, cooperations, observing God's Legal Limits and perseverance. This is an inside-out approach, starting with yourself, your family and then your organization.

Note the mention of time as the opening of the chapter. It indicates that success is not measured by how much money you have, but on how you spend your time. This is the fairest possible standard of winning because every body roughly get the same amount of time everyday, regardless of his or her background. Focusing in time does not mean to be impatient or taking shortcuts, because the last verse also mention perseverance.

== Spiritual Strength ==
Basically, every activities mentioned in Believer's Charter is geared toward increasing your spiritual strength. Regular connection to God and His messages helps you remember God and keep you in His path. Participate in social development regularly empowers the powerless. Regular fasting helps you control yourself. The pilgrimage will help you shares benefits of this system. The strength increase through learning His Message and practising it and decreased by forgetting Him and violating his prohibitions.

Imagine you start a travel without knowing your destination. Imagine you shot arrows in the dark. That's why the first step in the winning strategy is to believe. As a human being, you need at least to believe in God and Hereafter. A believer will believe also Koran and Prophet Muhammad for the maximum impact.

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;Each child is born in a state of fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew or a Christian.&quot; (Reported in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Parents are responsible for children spiritual education. The golden time is to start it in early childhood, even before the child able to speak. Start by learning to be grateful to the provisions from God, be kind to fellow God's creations, to know and follow the prophets. Parents should encourage children to observe, helps and participate during worship ritual and learn to read the Arabic scripture. So, they can do it independently by the age of seven. Hopefully, when they become teenagers, they already put their trust in God, following the prophets as the model and having learned enough skill to seek help and knowledge independently.

== Hard work ==
Basically, every activities mentioned in The Assenter's Charter are considered as good deeds towards each other. Equality, Family, Humanity, Fairness and Integrity values provides conditions for peace and prosperity. Money, Respect, Diet and Remembrance wisdom will take you to the next level.

The real test begins outside the mosque, when you are with your family, during transport, at work, school, market or neigbours. What you do in 24 hours a day in your life creates the real impacts. The first and the second steps of the winning strategy provides a strong foundation for the third steps. The third steps can only be credible if the participants are giving examples by doing the walk and not just empty talking. Giving examples is especially important when educating our children, the next generation of The Assenters.

== Remind Each Others ==
Basically, everything in Chapter 3 and 4 of this book cannot be understand and decided alone. Everyone has blind spots that need help from somebody else to watch them over. When it comes to public policy and implementing it, the community need to work together to collect informations and conduct investigations. They will need to work together to promote and implement the policy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;O you who believe, revere God as He deserves to be revered, and do not die except as ones who have surrendered. And hold firmly to the rope of God, all of you, and do not be separated. And remember God's blessing upon you when you were enemies and He '''united your hearts''', then you became with His blessing '''as brothers'''; and you were on the verge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it; it is thus that God clarifies for you His signs that you may be guided. And let there be a nation from amongst you which '''calls towards goodness, and orders kindness, and deters from evil'''. And these are the '''successful''' ones. And do not be like those who separated and differed after the clarity had come to them. And for them is a painful retribution. ([[s:Quran/3#102-109 | 3:102-105]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The purpose of collaboration is to calls towards goodness, and orders kindness, and deters from evil. The media used includes education, law making institutions, any activities (social, sports) and any media and communication channels. At home, parents need to use family time, television, books, magazine or internet activities as an opportunity to educate our children.

It is important to note that your audience will varies from a basic assenter into an activist believers. They will have different ethnic and religious background, education levels, languages and interests. Therefore, you will need to be tolerance and localize your message, as well as being kindness. There are times that kind actions speak louder than words.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is ''no compulsion'' in religion. Certainly, right has become clearly distinct from wrong. Whoever rejects the devil and believes in God has firmly taken hold of a strong handle that never breaks. God is All-hearing and knowing. ([[s:Quran/2#254-257 | 2:256]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As explained in Chapter 1, fear and regret is logical consequence of crime. In Chapter 2, higher recognition, generous benefits and forgiveness are logical consequence of contribution towards the society. So, &quot;no compulsion&quot; can be understood as you should not punish people for their faith. In education, you should not punish your children for not following religious ritual, but you may only reward and support them to do it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Believers, let not a group of you mock another. Perhaps they are better than you. Let not women mock each other; ''perhaps one is better than the other''. Let not one of you find faults in another nor let anyone of you defame another. How terrible is the defamation after having true faith. Those who do not repent are certainly unjust. Believers, stay away from conjecture; ''acting upon some conjecture may lead to sin''. Do ''not spy'' on one another or ''back-bite''. Would any of you like to eat the disgusting dead flesh of your brother? Have fear of God; God accepts repentance and is All-merciful. People, We have created you all male and female and have made you ''nations and tribes'' so that you would recognize ''each other''. The most honorable among you in the sight of God is ''the most pious of you''. God is All-knowing and All-aware. ([[s:Quran/49#11-18 | 49:11-13]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those to ''whom We have given the Book'' (Bible, Torah), know you (Muhammad) just as a well as they know their sons. It is certain that some of them deliberately hide the truth. Never doubt that the essence of truth comes from your Lord. Every one pursues his goal. ''Compete'' with each other ''in performing good deeds''. Wherever you are, God will bring you all together. God has power over all things. ([[s:Quran/2#142-147 | 2:146-148]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Perseverance ==
There are time to negotiate your way. To win a negotiation requires patient, research for the facts and reality on the grounds, as in the previous step &quot;support one another with the truth&quot;. You can learn in many examples in the Kuran on how to negotiate. For example how Moses ask help from Aaron to help him to negotiate with Pharaoh.

From Chapter 1 and 2, we learn that concern(fear), problem(regret), growth(rank), solution (forgiveness) and reward (provision) motivates people. To get a deal, you can take time to connect to people by understanding their concern and problem. Therefore, you can offer them a deal that allow them to grow, clean up their mess and/or open opportunities. The wisdom from Chapter 1 teaches you not to be too generous nor to stingy in your deal. Also not too arrogant while not too careless on dealing with human. 

There could be times when some of those who have rejected the message fight against God and His Messenger. We will try to learn about the difference between a liberty fighter and an extremist/transgressors.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fight for the cause of God, ''those who fight you'', but ''do not transgress'', for God does not love the transgressors. Slay them wherever you may catch them and expel them from the place from which they expelled you, for ''oppression is worse than slaughter''. Do not fight them in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque in Mecca unless they start to fight. Then slay them for it is the recompense that the disbelievers deserve. But if they cease, God is All-forgiving and All-merciful. Fight them ''until persecution is no more'', and religion is for God. If they change their behavior, there would be no hostility against anyone except the unjust. ([[s:Quran/2#189-196 | 2:190-193]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And if two parties of believers battle with each other, you shall reconcile them; but if one of them aggresses against the other, then you shall ''fight the one aggressing'' until it complies with God's command. Once it complies, then you shall reconcile the two groups with justice, and be equitable; for God loves those who are equitable. The believers are brothers; so ''reconcile between your brothers'', and be aware of God, that you may receive mercy. ([[s:Quran/49 | 49:9-10]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Choosing Communities ==
As we can see, community is an essential ingredient to the success. However, being in the wrong communities is a receipt to disaster. Therefore, being in a moderate community would be the way to go.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus have We made of you a Middle Ummah, that you might be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves… ( al-Baqarah 2:143) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For example, if you are in a community that trying to rationalize everything including religious rituals, then you are in a extremely liberal community which will only wasting your time arguing trivial things. On the other hand, if you are in a community that continuously criticize many others Believers communities, you might start to worry because you are in an extremely conservative community. By the time they declare other Believers communities as infidels, then it is time to leave. In fact, reporting this even to the authorities could be a good idea, because &quot;declaring others as infidels&quot; is historically the first step that ends up into violence between Believers communities. This declaration could be explicit or implicit, such as refusing to pray behind certain person. 

So, learn to read signs and try to stay with the moderate community of Believers. Experience shows that the level of believe is inline with the level of love to the Prophet. So, try to stay with the community that genuinely love the Prophet, by following not only the basic teaching, but also the examples from the Prophet on every aspect of their life.

As we can see, a good communities would not only helps you intellectually (with the truth) but also emotionally (the perseverance). Therefore, a good community will make you like a member of their family, brother or sister. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The believers are brothers. Then make peace between your brothers &amp; remain conscious of Allah that you may obtain mercy.&quot; (49:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

With perseverance, it should not be difficult to find a good community. With the advance of communication, such as internet radio and internet phone, we could participate regularly within a communities that is separated by hundreds or thousands kilometre apart.

== Talk Back ==
Do you know a Moslem who are your national heros or instrumental in changing the course of history? 

What are his legacy? What events that triggers his actions? What is his methods to achieve his goal?

&lt;big&gt;'''Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) / Gardner Syndrome'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (5q21) - gatekeeper (controls other downstream genes)
*100% progress to carcinoma, most by age 30, often in teens. 100s-1000s of polyps. Other malignancies: thyroid, GB, adrenal. image


'''''Gardner syndrome'''''
*After it has been found to be caused by APC, merged into familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
*Colonic adenomatous polyps plus multiple osteomas (skull, mandible, long bones), epidermal cysts, fibromatosis (usually intraabdominal after surgery), fibromas, lipomas, impacted and supernumerary teeth, dental cysts, lymphoid polyps in small intestine and fundic gland polyps in stomach. 100% develop colon cancer. Other malignancies: periampullary, thyroid, adrenal.
*Mutation in APC gene but has variable penetrance so not all extracolonic features are present.</text>

==PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS)==
*[http://www.geneclinics.org/servlet/access?db=geneclinics&amp;site=gt&amp;id=8888892&amp;key=BJaBikTCUeOkI&amp;gry=&amp;fcn=y&amp;fw=Zdz7&amp;filename=/profiles/phts/index.html Gene Clinics Entry]
*Includes [[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Cowden_syndrome|Cowden Syndrome (CS)]], Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus-like syndrome (PLS)
*Diagnosis only if [[w:PTEN_(gene)|PTEN]] mutation present
**PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor gene, by inhibiting PI3K pathway (please see [[Radiation Oncology/Radiobiology/Growth Factors|growth factors]] page)
**Proportion of PTEN mutation present in above syndromes: CS (80%), BRRS (60%), PLS (50%), PS (20%)
**If PTEN mutation absent, then patients classified under corresponding clinical syndrome
*Autosomal dominant

==Cowden syndrome==
*Part of PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome
*Formation of skin lesions, hamartomas and neoplastic growths, throughout multiple body systems (therefore also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome)
*Clinical criteria (pathognomic, or 2+ major, or 4+ minor, or combinations):
**Pathognomonic: Cerebellar dysplastic gangliocytoma (adult Lhermitte-Duclos disease) or mucocutaneous lesions (facial [http://www.emedicine.com/derm/byname/trichilemmoma.htm trichilemmomas], acral keratoses, papillomatous lesions, or mucosal lesions
**Major: Breast cancer, thyroid cancer (non-medullary), endometrial cancer, macrocephaly, 
**Minor: Benign thyroid lesions (e.g., adenoma, multinodular goiter), mental retardation (IQ less than or equal to 75), hamartomatous intestinal polyps, fibrocystic disease of the breast, lipomas, fibromas, GU tumors (especially renal cell carcinoma), GU malformation, uterine fibroids
*Autosomal dominant
*Clinical manifestation: by 30s 99% develop the mucocutaneous stigmata; colon polyps typically minute and asymptomatic
*Tumor risk: 
**Breast CA: lifetime risk 25-50%; average age 38-46
**Thyroid CA: lifetime risk 10%
**Endometrial CA: lifetime risk 5-10%
*Prevalence: 1/200,000 but likely higher due to often subtle external manifestations</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Li-Fraumeni Syndrome'''&lt;/big&gt;



==Li-Fraumeni Syndrome==
*[http://www.geneclinics.org/profiles/li-fraumeni/details.html Gene Clinics Entry]
*Originally published by Li &amp; Fraumeni in 1969 
**6 component tumors inherited in an autosomal dominant manner: osteosarcomas, soft-tissue sarcomas, premenopausal breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenal cortical tumors, and acute leukemias 
**Since then, also increased risk of: melanoma, GI (esophagus, stomach, colon/rectum, pancreas), gonadal germ cell tumors, breast cancer/phyllodes tumor, Wilms' tumor, lung, thyroid, GYN (ovary, endometrium, cervix), prostate
*Classic Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) criteria:
**A proband with a sarcoma diagnosed before 45 years of age AND
**A first-degree relative with any cancer under 45 years of age AND
**A first- or second-degree relative with any cancer under 45 years of age or a sarcoma at any age
*Li-Fraumeni-like Syndrome (LFL) criteria:
**A proband with any childhood cancer or sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenal cortical tumor diagnosed before 45 years of age AND
**A first- or second-degree relative with a typical LFS cancer (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumor, adrenal cortical tumor, or leukemia) at any age AND
**A first- or second-degree relative with any cancer under the age of 60 years
*Cancer risk: ~50% by age 40, 85-90% lifetime
*Approximately 50% have a p53 mutation
*400 families identified world-wide
*Individuals with LFS/LFL should avoid RT


==p53 Mutation==
*Classically associated with Li Fraumeni syndrome; approximately 50% of Li Fraumeni patients have p53 mutation
*Associated with a wide spectrum of cancers, including choroid plexus tumors
*&quot;4 core cancers&quot;: sarcoma, brain tumor, breast cancer or adrenocorticoid carcinoma before age 50

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added my own commentary about leadership positions due to my past experience in high school of being on ASB. I understand the major time committment that is required in a group and it is crucial to have a positive attitude even when things can be frusterating. Becuase I am highly involved in CCF and the INN, I understand the struggles the leaders go throught when trying to get people to come on a regular basis. CCF has a highered staff becuase students would not have to time to run the event every friday night. I believe that it requires encouragement from others to the leaders in order for them to keep going.



I decided to add my commentary  about christianity and the ten commandments becuase I have had experience with misinterpreting the ten commandments. Before I became a christian I thought christianity was a bunch of man-made rules to follow in order to keep people civilized. However, after figuring things out on my own and really searching, I learned that what the bible says about the ten commandments is really to show people that we are all sinful, which is why we need Jesus. It is very important to follow the ten commandments, but if we mess up, Jesus has already made that sacrifice for our sins. Christianity is the only &quot;religion&quot; that is not cultural. Anyone, anywhere can become a christian, and it is happening around the world. It is for all people. My life has been changed becuase of Jesus Christ. I see Him work in my life every day. For example, I had a dream about a close friend who had an eating disorder and I told her about this dream. She happened to be hiding and eating disorder and I truely believe that the Lord had me have that dream in order to protect her. I am so thankful that I live in America and I can openly write this paragraph. I wanted to clear things up for anyone who does not understand the &quot;rule following&quot; of christianity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have added a summary section to the Leadership Comunication section. I felt that it was necessary to introduce the idea, instead of simply jumping into examples of innefective leadership communication. Now that this change is in effect, I feel that the page reads more smoothly and clearly as a whole.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Organization is key when it comes to putting a group together. Without great organization skills, the club can only go so far until it falls apart. Organization leads to great advertisement and promotion, which is key when trying to attract new members to the club or people to an event. For example, CCF has over 300 members because they have a hired staff to organize all of the events and CCF on Friday nights. Even though Swing Kids does not have a hired staff to organize their events, they have specified leaders who give up  their time to plan Swing Kids and without those leaders there wouldn't be Swing Kids. Organization is key to a vision, goal and purpose within a club.

An effective organizational strategy for any club has a few major components. The first component should be that a club must come to an agreement on the mission or purpose for the group. For example, on the Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF) website, it states &quot;We strive to assist students in their desire to know Jesus Christ and apply his teachings to their lives.&quot; CCF does this by reaching out and spreading the news of God and faith to the rest of the student body. The second effective organizational strategy that a club needs is to plan out events or meeting in advance. This strategy is shown through Swing Kids. They plan all of their big events at the beginning of the year in order to be organized and make sure a space or an area is available. Although both of these clubs are vastly different with their intentions and goal they must plan in advance in order to achieve their mission or purpose. A third effective organizational strategy is recruitment. Once a club has been founded, how do you get the word out. Most clubs use the events fair, which is a opportunity at the beginning of the school year to have a booth about a club. This is the way most students learn about different clubs on campus. However, fliers and word of mouth are very prominent recruitment techniques as well. Finally, funding. Although clubs at Western get $50 to start with, many clubs need more than that. So, the organization has to decided if it will charge it's members, focus on donations, or host events.

''Somewhat inspired by the Linux from Scratch (LFS) project''

Are you a Macintosh owner? Have you always wanted to write programs for your Mac, but weren't sure how to get started? Did you always want to know more about how your Mac works?

I first bought a Macintosh in 1995, shortly after the first major transition Apple made in the architecture of the Macintosh line - the switch from Motorola 68000-family microprocessors to PowerPC processors.

At the time, I wasn't sure exactly what this meant. I did know that Apple had done a lot of work to make sure Mac programs would keep running on pretty much any machine they sold. And at the time, that was a lot of machines! This was before the return of Steve Jobs and the scaling back of Apple's computer catalog to just a home line (iMac), a professional line (Power Macs) and portables (iBooks and PowerBooks). At one point, Apple had dozens of different models on the shelf, with names like Quadra, Performa, Centris... some of which were simply renamed versions of previous machines, or differed only by the speed of the CPU or whether or not the machine had a CD drive.

But the thing that impressed me was, almost all of these machines could run the same software. Given the computer met the minimum hardware requirements, a Mac from 1998 could run software written in 1988! That kind of backward compatibility isn't easy, considering the hardware had changed completely. The CPU changed from 68k to PowerPC. The drives changed from SCSI to ATA. The keyboard and mouse went from ADB to USB. Proprietary video systems were replaced with standard ATI or Nvidia cards. And the floppy drive was eliminated completely.

'''How did Apple do it? What magic did they use?'''

Well, if you're as interested in the guts of your Mac as I am in mine, come with me on this journey of learning and experimentation. I'm not the first to head down this path, but in doing so I hope to &quot;Think Different&quot; and make a tutorial that allows you to dive in at any level of expertise and go in one of several different directions without tediously wading through subjects that don't interest you.


===The plan===

My goal is to teach you to write programs for the Mac (''any'' Mac) with nothing more than your hands, head, and the software that came in the box. This is harder than it sounds - partly because the classic Macs didn't come with much in the way of development tools, and partly because there are so many options in tools, languages, and documentation.

Nevertheless, here is the plan. It is not linear - you can start at the beginning and follow any of a number of different paths:

I. The CPU
## 68000 (68020, 68030, 68040, 680LC40)
## PowerPC (601, 603e, 604, 750 or G3)
## Intel x86/Core/Core2

II. The operating system
## Classic System 6/7
## Classic Mac OS 7.6 - 9.2
## Mac OS X (Cheetah, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard)
## Linux

III. The language
## Assembly language
## Pascal
## C
## C++
## AppleScript
## Objective-C
## Java
## RealBasic
## JavaScript
## Perl
## Python
## PHP
## Ruby
## Fortran
## Scheme/Haskell/Lisp/Ocaml

IV. The tools
## Nothing
## Text editor
## Resource editor
## Compilers (commercial)
## Compilers (from scratch)
## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
### Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW)
### Think Pascal/Think C
### Symantec C++
### HyperCard
### NeXT tools (Project Builder, Interface Builder)
### XCode
### AppleScript Studio
### Eclipse/other Java

V. Program design, goals and options
## Calculation
## Input and output
## Peripherals
## Memory management
## Loading and running programs
## Shared libraries/dynamic code
## Scripting
## Applications
### Word processing/publishing
### Spreadsheets/analysis
### Graphics
### Music
### Games
### Networking

VI. The method
## Spaghetti
## Structured programming
## Object-oriented programming
## Functional programming
## Libraries and frameworks
### Toolbox
### THINK Class Library
### MacApp
### PowerPlant
### OpenDoc
### Carbon
### Cocoa
### AWT/Swing
### X11/GTK/Qt

VII. The product
## Simple programs
## GUI programs

### Freeware/shareware
### Free/Open-Source software
### Commercial sales (boxed/download)
### Network applications/services


This is a long journey, and covers a lot of ground. My philosophy is to take &quot;baby steps&quot; and cover a little bit of a topic each day, and not worry about following a rigid structure. I believe that if you get interested in a tangential topic, you should be able to ask questions without delay, and investigate without losing track of where you are in the big picture. You should always be able to return to the path once you've finished your &quot;subroutine&quot; covering a topic in detail. After all, isn't this what hypertext on the Web is best at? It's what makes it more flexible than just reading a book.

Speaking of which, you may wonder why this tutorial is necessary when there are so many good books out there. There are a few reasons.

# A lot of Mac programming books are very outdated. I know because I own about 300 of them. (And no, I haven't read them all - I collect them!)
# A book will take you through a limited set of topics in a specific order. It may not cover everything you want to learn, and may cover many subtopics which don't interest you.
# This is an experiment in learning strategy, and I hope to learn as I teach - which means I would either have to write my own book to throw on the pile (and likely be dissatisfied with the result) or read everything I can on the topic before regurgitating it on the Web for you. That sounds like a lot of work!

In this tutorial, you should be able to skip around as you see fit:

# Intel Macs
# C programming
# Free tools

or

# Pascal programming
# Classic Macs
# Tools

or

# Games
# Video and graphics
# Assembly language
# PowerPC

...or any number of other paths suited to what you're interested in learning!

So, to get started. Let's talk about what programs are. Next topic: Code vs. hardware</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cloud_chamber_ani_bionerd.gif|right|thumb|300px|A cloud chamber without a magnetic field, so the particles move in straight lines.]]
==Cloud Chambers==
The magnitude of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle is given by:

&lt;math&gt;F = qvB&lt;/math&gt;,

where B is the magnetic field strength, v is the speed of the particle and q is the charge on the particle. This force is exerted in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the direction of motion. If a charged particle enters a uniform magnetic field which is perpendicular to its velocity, then it will move in a circle, since there will be a force of constant magnitude acting on it in a direction perpendicular to its motion. Using the equation for centripetal force, we can derive a formula for the radius of this circle:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{mv}{r} = qB&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{mv}{qB} = \frac{p}{qB}&lt;/math&gt;,

where p is the momentum of the particle, and m is the mass of the particle. This equation makes sense. If the particle has a higher momentum, then its circle of motion will have a larger radius. A stronger magnetic field strength, or a larger charge, will make the radius smaller.

In a cloud chamber, particles enter a magnetic field, and also a liquid which they ionise. This ionisation causes the paths of the particles to become visible. When the particle loses its charge, its track ceases. When the particle loses momentum, the radius of the circle decreases, and so, particles spiral inwards. The direction of this spiralling depends on the direction of the magnetic field. If the direction of the magnetic field causes a positively charged particle to spiral clockwise, then it will cause a negatively charged particle to spiral anticlockwise. Cloud chambers can, therefore, be used to identify particles by their charge and mass.

==Mass Spectrometers==

Mass spectrometers work on a similar principle. Particles to be identified (such as nuclei) are accelerated using an electric field. Then, a velocity selector is used to ensure all the nuclei are at a known velocity - all the rest are discarded. These nuclei enter a uniform magnetic field where they move in a circle. However, they are only allowed to move half a circle, since they are collected at this point, and the number of particles arriving at each point is measured.

[[Image:Velocity_selector.svg|thumb|right|300px|A velocity selector]]
===Velocity Selector===

In the velocity selector, both a uniform electric field and a uniform magnetic field act on the particle. The only way a particle can travel through the velocity selector in a straight line is if the electric force on it is equal and opposite to the magnetic force on it. If this is not the case, the particle's path is bent, and so it does not get out of the velocity selector into the rest of the mass spectrometer. If we equate these two forces, we get:

&lt;math&gt;qE = qvB&lt;/math&gt;,

where q is the charge on the particle, E is the strength of the uniform electric field, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the strength of the uniform magnetic field. The charge may be eliminated from both sides:

&lt;math&gt;E = vB&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{E}{B}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that, by adjusting the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields, we can choose the velocity at which particles emerge from the velocity selector.

[[Image:Apollo_16_mass_spec_schematic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the mass spectrometer which went to the moon on Apollo 16.]]
===Finding Mass===

The particles them move at a speed v into another uniform magnetic field. Here, as in the cloud chamber, the radius of the circle in which the particle moves is given by:

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{mv}{qB} = \frac{mE_{selector}}{qBB_{selector}}&lt;/math&gt;

If we know the charge on the particle (for example, we know what element it is), we can measure the radius of the circle, and find the mass of the particle (i.e. what isotope it is, since neutrons have no charge) using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{qBr}{v} = \frac{qrBB_{selector}}{E_{selector}}&lt;/math&gt;

If we do not know the charge, then we can find the mass to charge ratio:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{q} = \frac{rBB_{selector}}{E_{selector}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==
[[Image:Path_cloud_chamber_question.svg|thumb|right|300px]]

Charge of electron = -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C

Mass of electron = 9.11 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt;kg

u = 1.66 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt;kg

1. An electron enters a cloud chamber, passing into a 0.1T magnetic field. The initial curvature (the reciprocal of its radius) of its path is 100m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. At what speed was it moving when it entered the magnetic field?

2. The electron spirals inwards in a clockwise direction, as show in the diagram on the right. What would the path of a positron, moving with an identical speed, look like?

3. Using a 2T magnetic field, what electric field strength must be used to get a velocity selector to select only particles which are moving at 100ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;?

4. Some uranium (atomic number 92) ions (charge +3e) of various isotopes are put through the velocity selector described in question 3. They then enter an 0.00002T uniform magnetic field. What radius of circular motion would uranium-235 have?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Modern experimental particle physics requires particles to be accelerated to very high energies. This is accomplished by passing them through an electric field multiple times, in a similar fashion to an electron gun. Types of particle accelerator include linear accelerators and cyclotrons.

==Linear Accelerators==

In a linear accelerator, particles pass through a series of tubes. At either end of each tube are electrodes. An alternating current is used. This means that, when particles pass an electrode to which they are being attracted, the electrode switches charge, and starts to repel the particle. The distances between electrodes increase as you go along the accelerator, since, as the particles accelerate, they travel further per. oscillation of the current.

[[Image:Stanford-linear-accelerator-usgs-ortho-kaminski-5900.jpg|thumb|750px|center|Aerial photo of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, with detector complex at the right (east) side]]

[[Image:Cyclotron_patent.png|thumb|right|300px|The original patent for a cyclotron.]]

==Cyclotrons==

A cyclotron is like a linear accelerator, except that, instead of using lots of different electrodes, it uses the same two over and over again. The particles move around in a circle due to a magnetic field. The radius of this circle depends on the velocity of the particles. The orbits of the particles are enclosed by two semi-cylindrical electrodes. An alternating current is used to accelerate the particles. When the particles enter one half of the cyclotron, they are pulled back to the other half. When they reach the other half, the current switches over, and they are pulled back to the first half. All the time, the magnetic field keeps them moving in circles. As they gain energy from the electric field, the radii of their orbits increase, and their velocities increase, until the radius is as large as the cyclotron.

==Questions==

1. Use the formula for centripetal force to show that the radius of motion depends on the speed of the moving object.

2. A cyclotron with a diameter of 1.5m is used to accelerate electrons (mass 9.11 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt;kg). The maximum force exerted on an electron is 2.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt;N. What is the maximum velocity of the electrons?

3. What are the problems involved in constructing a large cyclotron?

4. Why don't particles stick to the electrodes when passing through them?

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{mv^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{mv^2}{F}&lt;/math&gt;

So, if F is constant:

&lt;math&gt;r \propto v^2&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. What are the problems involved in constructing a large cyclotron?'''

Creating a uniform magnetic field over such a large area (for example, the land area enclosed by the LHC!) means that cyclotrons have been largely replaced in experimental particle physics by tubes, instead of flat cylinders.

'''4. Why don't particles stick to the electrodes when passing through them?'''

There are two reasons. Firstly, alternating current is sinusoidal, so there is no charge on the electrode when the particles are passing through them. Secondly, even if there were charge on the electrode, the net force on the particle would still be 0, since the force would be equal in every direction.

This article really made me proud of the field that I have chosen to enter.  It is ironic to be an older student and get the perspective of the student who is learning to be a teacher and the parent who is in constant communication with the teachers.  I interviewed my sister-in-law, who is a great teacher and even better principal.  She and I have had many discussions about teaching and why I want to take on this profession.  I wrote in my piece that I believe it to be a calling, and I am sure now after researching, doing observations, and really getting into my education classes that it is a calling.  I have always felt that urge to teach and lead.  Not that I do not do that now, because I do teach in the field that I work in.  There is another side of teaching that I still feel compelled to do and until I stand in the classroom with my students sitting there and knowing that I have their futures in my hands, I will continue to learn and strive until I get to my goal.

I think it's amazing that anyone would think that teaching isn't a profession.  If not, than what is it?  Barbara Fortner is an excellent choice for someone to interview for an article such as this.  I loved that you included her own quote (a very insiteful one!) as a sidebar.  If anything, I would have liked to read a little bit more about what she has to say regarding teaching as a profession.  The NCLB info in this article was very interesting, and it was interesting to read both the pros and cons regarding it.  Also, I liked the multiple choice questions in this article.

I really enjoyed reading your article and it captured my attention from beginning to end. It was extremely interesting and motivating for me to read what a professional educator had to say about our future career of teaching. I agree that teaching is a calling and there is a reason why certain individuals have the urge to teach. It is not about the money but more about the internal fulfillment. It is unfortunate that in the world we live in, money is viewed as the key to success and those looking to make more money don't even consider teaching as an option. I really liked how Barbara Fortner said that true teachers, like preachers, are called to the profession, and they become teachers because they want to make a difference shaping and preparing individuals for the future. I thought that by saying this, she hit the nail on the head. This is exactly what I tell my friends and family when they question my aspirations to teach. Although some may think I'm crazy, as well as other teachers and up and coming teachers, we all have one thing in common: the passion and desire to make a difference in a child's life. Great job on this article! [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 19:38, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

Wow, talk about touching someone's heart...your interview definately touched mine. What a poetic way to sum up why someone goes into the teaching profession. I especially liked that you included a side-bar for students who are aspiring to become teachers in Virginia and the steps to obtain their credentials. I can understand how hard it must have been for Ms. Fortner to go from teaching where she interacted with students all day, to the administrative job that does not include a lot of time for student interaction. My father was an elementary school principal for over thirty years and he said it was tough making the adjustment from teacher to principal for the first few years. However, he enjoyed it so much that he only retired for a couple of years and is presently back as the principal of a charter school. Teaching is a passion or desire one has to share with the world and in doing so, begins the process of shaping young minds for the future. Great Job![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:34, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

Your article was indeed captivating from head to toe...or should I say beginning to end. It gave an inside view of Mrs. Fortner and the struggles she has faced. It is incredible that &quot;teaching&quot; to some is not regarded as a career/profession, if anything, it is one of the most influential and important professions in the world. Your article was well-written, very informative and captivating. Well done. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 22:12, 15 July 2009 (UTC)


It is obvious that you spent a good amount of time planning out this article.  I really like how you incorporated the use of different sources especially the sidebar that connects the reader to a lecture from Stanford University.  As sad as it is the fact that the majority of people do not regard teaching as an esteemed profession hits very close to home, I do not know how many times I have received a dirty or puzzled look from someone when I tell them what I chose to be.  To these people I always say “How would you be the person you are today without the aid of a teacher.”  Sometimes they change their minds.

Writing this article was awkward and strange for me. I felt how baby giraffes look when they are first born and take those wobbly first steps. My knees buckled, I glistened with otherworldly fluids, and I determinedly shambled along. I found my articles. I summarized them. I tried to string them together. Overall, I think I failed. I am unhappy with the result and I apologize for it. I can only hope my inept attempt at representing the relevancy of education philosophies does not cheapen the reader’s perception of the subject. Despite how pitifully I represent them within my article education philosophies are quite literally what dictates the ebb and flow of education. If education were the economy, education philosophies would be oil.  To demonstrate this please allow me to assail you with an anecdote. 

During my freshman year in high school I had a particularly fantastic history teacher. For the sake of my account, his name was “Mr. Edwards”. Mr. Edwards taught that year with vigor, his lectures were animated, engaging and often he went to great lengths to relate the material to the students. Sometimes this would backfire resulting in tangents that took over large portions of class time. Other times it was highly effective, getting even the most stubborn of students to smile and nod along with his ranting. Then, at the end of the year we took the S.O.Ls.  While Mr. Edwards’ class was the most fun, and I felt the class I took the most away from as a student, overall his were the classes ended up with some of the lowest S.O.Ls.  

In the eleventh grade, I had Mr. Edwards again. I was excited, my other teacher had been no fun, he gave no elaborate lectures, made no effort to relate and generally relied on worksheets to do all the teaching for him. Surely, Mr. Edwards was the best History teacher; surely, his class would be just as fun as it ever was.  On the first week Mr. Edwards handed out a worksheet. Maybe it was an off week. He didn’t have time to prepare his informative raving. On the second week, alas, another worksheet.  I confronted him in the hall, and asked the simple question, “What happened to the old way you did things?” He replied, that he would like to do things that way, it was how he loved to teach, but the graded worksheets made sure students at least skimmed the material. They were the best way to get passing S.O.L’s and that was his job at the moment, not to teach, but to provide passing S.O.L’s.

The author reflection was very interesting to read. The idea of writing being like a baby giraffe walking brought quite the picture to my mind! To the author - I don't think you failed at your article. Everyone has trouble writing sometimes, and apologizing for that is not necessary. I'm sure you aren't the only one who struggled writing the article, and overall the article was nicely written and held my attention!

The hardest part about writing my wikibook article, besides the crazy wiki-code, was finding direct answers to my questions. I quickly realized the questions I decided to ask for my FAQ's did not have one specific answer. This made putting multiple ideas easier, but made it harder to answer the questions effectively. There was not as much information about assessing students progress as I thought there would be, or at least I had trouble finding meaningful ways of assessment. I guess I had just as much trouble finding meaningful answers as I did trying to spell assess correctly! I was quite excited about finding the list of ways to use constructivism in the classroom. They were interesting to me and made the idea of a constructivist classroom make more sense to me. I hope that when I am actually teaching I will use these ideas so that I can go above and beyond just being a teacher. The teachers I remember the most are the ones that went above and beyond their call of being a teacher, and made students want to learn. This is a goal of mine as an art teacher!

What an interesting article to read! I thought you did a great job of capturing the main points and ideas of Chapter 2 and compliling all ideas together to make your Chapter FAQ's. Great use of color, pictures and borders! The article itself was very interesting to read and captured my attention from beginning to end. Everything flowed nicely and I felt that when I reached the end of the article I had a good foundation of Chapter 2. I enjoyed reading about educatioal philosophies, and I agree that teachers seem to work better when using a variety of educational philosophies. This way, students are able to grow and learn from different ideas and are not stuck with just one idea and way of learning.It was also interesting to read that teaching philosophies can be used to stimulate reflection on teaching and help the teacher to grow and develop professionally. I look forward to learning more and &quot;tweaking&quot; my own educational and teaching philosophies. I would have liked if you had given a short description of Perennialism, Idealism, Realism, Experimentalism and Existentialism. Reading about the four main assessment methods helped reinforce the topic in my head after reviewing the class lecture. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 19:50, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

I think you did a great job incorporating all of the main topics of the chapter. I especially liked how you incorporated website links on the sidebars...I went to a few of the sites and found some interesting information. I liked how you broke down the information on educational philosophies so that it was really easy to read. I think you had just the right amount of information to keep the reader interested and hungry for more so that they would read the remainder of articles. Excellent job...great use of wiki code...great pictures and color scheme!! Kudos![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 23:03, 9 July 2009 (UTC)


The author really managed to cover all the bases effectively in one article.  I particularly like how she informed us of the use of analogies in learning.  Most everything I retained from my educational career is attached to an analogy, whether I attached it myself or the teacher presented it in that form it was very helpful.  I agree that a well rounded or &quot;highly effective&quot; teacher gathers from all the teaching philosophies vs. focusing on one.  Not only do the students benefit from this variety, but the teacher does as well.  It helps the teacher to assess what's working for his/her particular classroom and what is not.  The article was executed well, with good organization and aesthetic appeal.  Great Job! [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 16:58, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

I think that this assignment is probably one of the most complex and difficult assignments o have experienced so far at ODU. I mean not many people can say that they helped write a textbook before they even have their degree. It is definitely a different experience. It makes you think about what information is actually necessary and which information doesn't really need to be included. Using this technique is a very unique idea because even though the articles aren't written by professionals the student is able to receive relevant information. It helps the student have more to do with the way that they learn. I know that in the past I have read a textbook and the language was very difficult to understand. In this class the language is less formal because of the age of the authors. I think that this has been a very good learning technique.

I really enjoyed reading your article on the history of education. Before reading the article, I never would have thought that the history of education was important to study. It was interesting to learn that although the teaching styles of today are very similar to those of 50 years ago, they have several differences as well. We tend to forget about the time in history when everyone that was attending school was taught in one big room at the same time, no matter the age. If that was tried nowadays, it would never work because each grade is taught different subject matter. Because of the evolution of the history of education, professionals have greatly improved the way school is thought about. I really enjoyed reading about the different opinions of what important aspects are included in the history of education. Without the certain steps you described that were taken in the education field, we would not be at the level of education we are today. I completely agree with you when you say that the way teaching has evolved over the years will greatly benefit the present and future teachers of the world.

This article seemed to be an important topic to cover in our textbook. Reading about the differences between teaching from past classes throughout history and today's teaching philosophies was interesting and made me consider how many teaching philosophies have changed over the years. I ,too, agreed with your statement about teaching evolving over the years greatly benefiting the present and future teachers of the world.

I found this article interesting in that there are som any ways to interpret the history of education.  History is constantly changing and evolving, like you said in the article.  We will always be thinking up new ways to introduce the same facts but this change always benefits the students and the teachers.

I thought it was interesting how the author interviewed someone as one of his/her sources.  It is always intriguing to listen to another person's perspective as to how things evolved over time and their opinions about it.  Although the learning targets were met, I would've liked to have seen more references to support and expand upon those learning targets vs. just an interview.  I think it was a great idea and informative, I just wish it wasn't the author's only idea.  After reading what I did, it did allow me to realize just how far our society has come in the world of education. We are fortunate to have so much at our fingertips this day and age in comparison to our ancestors. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 20:01, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

Learning about the history of education is very interesting.  It seems like one trend that drove the development of our educational system was the population moving to the cities during industrialization.  One would expect that our cities would be leading the nation in education.  If education started because of the cities, why are they not handling their school systems better?  Inner cities should have the most experience in educating children.   [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 01:28, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

As I researched the topic, I grew more and more aware of the diversity of the United States as a whole. Of course, having these on-going changes in the nation diversify the classroom as well. I grew aware that as we grow into a multicultural society, children, especially in their formative years, do not comprehend that fact. Some children often grow to tease and bully other students for their color, race, ethnicity and even financial status. Writing these article raised an alarm in my head and my strategy towards one day, conducting an inclusive classroom. I will definitely pay attention to turmoil situations going on in my class and between my students to ultimately create a safe learning environment for all. 

Coming from a different cultural background into Old Dominion University I understand what is like to be different. To not speak the language and to not understand those around you which may cause one to feel like an outsider. After writing this article it made me realize that I will maintain true to myself in the classroom and take the approach in my teaching strategies that make everyone feel welcomed and accepted.

I really enjoyed this article. I think it is imperative that teacher's implement various activities emphasizing the importance of students accepting themselves as well as each other. I like how the author placed importance on the teacher's role in the ever diverse classrooms of today.  As students evolve so must our teaching methods and techniques. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 20:15, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

This article was very informative and well-written, and I learned a great deal about the diversity of children in the classroom. It was surprising to learn that due to the heavy immigration of people, student demographics have changed in 17,000 counties in the United States. The article really stressed the fact that classroms are now more diverse, ethnic wise and race wise. I think it is a great idea that teachers around the world are participating in training to learn how to deal with a diverse group of students and how to have an inclusive classroom. I agree that teachers should always be aware that they will never teach a classroom of students where each child is exactly the same as the other.

This article was well-written, and informative about diversity in the classroom. I agree with the author that as diverse as America is, it is no wonder that the classroom shows this diversity. It is a teachers job to make children feel welcomed in the classroom, no matter what their cultural background or differences may be. The author did a nice job showing the importance of the teacher's role in an diverse classroom. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 00:33, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree with the author that we all have a role in maintaining a diverse classroom.  It is most important for teachers to really help their students to appreciate the richness that each student brings to the group.  I have always though that sometimes that appreciation for te fellow man is not addressed in our youth and, like the author, I think that teachers can help to change that.

This article is definetly a hot topic.  Diversity is all over the news and is something that is not going to just “go away”.  I agree with the author that it is the teacher’s responsibility to make the classroom a safe and comfortable environment.  One thing I wish the author would have incorporated more of was how a teacher can go about doing this.  Overall though I found this article to be informative.

Wow, seriously...molding genitals out of clay in the second grade??  I think at that age it's up to the parents to discuss such things with the children!  Not all young people are ready for such a graphic display of one's private areas.  I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with either of my sons taking part in a class like that at 6 or 7 years old.  I definately think that sex education belongs in school, but in second grade?  Nope!  Good article, nice pictures. I also thought the learning objectives and questions at the end were well-thought out. [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 01:45, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

Seems to me that back in &quot;the olden days&quot;, before all of these graphic sex-education classes, girls got pregnant, but not that many girls. Now, in this more graphic sex-ed classroom setting, girls and guys are kept together for the education and more is discussed than even when I was in school. Is this really helping or hurting? When did the school system take upon itself to do what parents were suppose to be doing. This graphic &quot;stuff&quot; does not belong in the school system and it certainly doesn't appear to be reducing the amount of teen pregnancies. Parents should be the ones to decide what is taught to their children and at what ages, not the school system, when it comes to sex. Now, I know some parents don't talk to their kids about sex, but maybe if they didn't rely on the school to do their job it would be different. And now I digress ... [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 16:39, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

Teaching Health in the high schools is a very difficult scenario.  Most of the kids start sex education thinking that they know more than the teacher.  About halfway though the study I think the kids realize they don't know everything and that is when the questions start.  At that point, I think the students are actually learning things that they will take back and use in their everyday life.  In our school system we also do single-sex &quot;family life&quot;.  The boys are separated from the girls which leads to a better learning environment for all involved.  Another thing I have noticed about our &quot;family life&quot; unit.  The school system tends to have guest speakers that come in and speak to some of the more controversial topics.  I think that gives the school system some wiggle room when it comes to covering the more controversial topics or answering questions.

I found your article to be very informative, well-written and interesting. It really opened my eyes to how sex education is being taught in the schools. When I went to elementary school (back in the 70's), the school separated the boys and girls into separate classrooms. We watched a film of what happens during puberty and the instructor told us (the girls) what would happen during our period...that was the extent of our sex education. As a parent, I did not realize that sex education has gotten more graphic...I feel that parents should have the right to be thoroughly informed of what will be taught in school and have the right to sign-up if they approve. After reading your article...I am convinced that I need to check more into what is being taught on the school level regarding sex ed. Thank you for opening my eyes![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 01:09, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading your article about sex education in schools. I feel it is surprising yet necessary that sex education started as a class to promote abstinence and prevention of intercourse and is now a program promoting safe sex. Now that the younger population is becoming sexually active, students need to hear safe sex practices in the school as they might not be hearing it at home or with their peers. Many individuals, such as Dr. Jocelyn Elders believe that sex education classes have helped to use increase the use of contraceptives but have also increased the rates of sexual activity among students. I disagree, as the rates of sexual activity among students continue to rise each year, regardless of sex education classes. By teaching students safe practices, more students are protected than could be. I agree that sex education offers the necessary knowledge and the hope of preventing STD’s, premarital sex and pregnancy. When given at the appropriate age, it allows students to understand the necessary consequences of their actions. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 19:00, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

I cannot say that I distinctly remember learning anything I didn't already know in the super, super watered down sex ed I had multiple times throughout my public school life. But I'm sure it was at least informative in some sense. Well, drilling some form of the repercussions of early sexual activity before you're responsible enough for it is always relatively the route to go– rather than teaching nothing at all.

Being a biologist I know how easy it is to become pregnant, transmit diseases, and how we are attracted to the opposite sex. Pharamones and hormones are raging in the teen years and as we all know children are curious. When I done some long term subbing this past fall I done a spill on this topic. I don't think students realized how pregnancy occured at the bilogical level. After showing some pictures of some sexually transmitted diseases they had faces of disgust. However when I would show a picture of a person, usually looking healthy and clean, then show them that person had a STD they were in shock. They had it in their head that people with diseases look unclean and unhealthy. When I told them those appearances occured during the late stages of the disease they were white as ghost. Unfortunatly 18 girls are presently pregnant in this high school out of ~420 students!!! Some are even 8th graders. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 17:35, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

I have stated it before: our world is evolving and so is the need for the education we give to children. This article clearly explains the fact that sex education is becoming more and more graphic and 'normal' in the classrooms. With everything going on in the outside world, it is necessary that our children know what could go wrong, what are the risks, etc. This article is well written, informative and supported by not only great detail but excellent sources.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 22:34, 15 July 2009 (UTC)


I loved this article!  My mother is a teen pregnancy nurse and works a lot with the inner city population.  Though some may not want to accept these classes being taught to our children, we must understand that in this day and age it is imperative.  These classes aren't condoning they are informing so that students are more equipped to making wiser decisions when it comes to sex.  It provides a forum for both their questions to be answered and their curiousities to be acknowledged.  I think the graphics in this article were quite funny, and amusingly appropriate for this topic. Great job! [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 03:57, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

I found this assignment to overall be challenging, but very rewarding.  I felt a great relief to have it finished, but at the same time when it was finished I was able to look at the finished project and I felt proud that I had completed this article from scratch.  I found the reviews from my peers to be extremely helpful.  They were able to see grammatical errors or other mistakes that I had overlooked.  I feel like a true author after completing this assignment.  I realized that yes it was time consuming, but it was also a great feeling to look at the work once it was completed and know I made this article from scratch, well with the help of some great and informative sources.  After completing this assignment I have realized that writing a textbook is not as hard as one may think.  Looking at the finished work makes me appriciate all the work and time I put into this article.

I think that this article had a lot of information for any beginning teacher.  We need to understand that the pressures that face our students when they are outside of the classroom will impact their performance in the classroom.  I really like the links that were available and the formatting made it very easy to read.

Trying to research one subject is difficult and time consuming. While writing this FAQ article I found it a little more challenging then a normal research paper. Mostly because: I had to first to consider what questions to use as my article, next I had to research. It was the research part that I found most challenging. It quickly became clear to me that there was not enough time to research any of the subjects that I covered. Then came trying to research racism, it is very difficult to find scholarly information on a controversial subject. Social issues in school are always going to be challenging, my wish is that with a little understanding some knowledge formed.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 16:27, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

The main topic of my article was the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; program.  I received some helpful feedback from the person who reviewed my article.  One of the points made in the feedback was that some of my sources may have had some bias.  What I learned from this is as follows:  if an article is peer-reviewed, this does not mean that the article is without bias.  I thought that using a mostly peer-reviewed sources would help me to steer completely clear of bias in my research.  In retrospect, I think using a majority of peer-reviewed sources was good.  However, if I ever decide to research this topic in more depth and provide a research paper of a higher quality, I am going to have to work harder to find sources even within peer-reviewed journals that have minimum amount of bias. 

The topic of NCLB is a rich topic and as times passes, this legislation is going to evolve.  So if I am going to continue research on this subject in the future, I am also going to have to keep in touch with how the legislation is being critiqued and modified.

After carefully researching educational reform, I realized just how many opinions and theories there are on this particular topic.  I did not expect the overwhelming amount of current information that led me to one plain and simple fact…education reform will continue to be debated, and in the meantime, educators must still do their jobs to the best of their abilities, according to the bureaucratic policies that are in place at the time.  It seems a disheartening task that educators are sometimes forced to follow policy rather than do what is best for their students.  It seems truly a shame.  Research indicates this type of embarrassment and failure in the United States public school system.  The issue, however, no matter how desperate, is still left for dinner party discussions, while no massive reform seems on its way.   Regardless of opinions, there are better, more successful ways to educate American children.  Even so, we would rather sit and argue, instead of reaching some type of political compromise.  It seems everything is tied unfortunately to politics.  I suppose we cannot really complain about NCLB.  It was the first attempt in years to reform some part of our system.  It just fell short.  Most of us can agree on that.  Why is it that we are afraid of change?  Afraid of trying new things in our schools?  After evaluating this multifaceted issue, I refuse to believe that money is the only problem.  Nonetheless, I tried to incorporate numerous stories in the content of my article.  I tried to cover a lot of ground without bias.  The realization that I could have wrote for a whole year on my “in the news” section came very early.  I would have really enjoyed discussing new research for curriculum, assessments, and project based learning.  Never less, I tried to include the most popular, most recently debated issues surrounding educational reform.

I enjoyed reading your article about current news and events in United States public schools. I think the No Child Left Behind Act has the right ideas but does have some short fallings in its legislation. I found it shocking that 1/3 of schools failed to meet yearly progress goals last year. I hope that Arne Duncan is able to make an improvement in those schools that have been, as the article states, “swept under the rug”. I have a pretty positive reaction to ideas of a federal curriculum, as then students from every state would be tested in the same way in chosen subjects. I couldn’t agree more with your statement that regardless of all the policy debates, teachers still have the most important job of making positive changes everyday in the lives of their students. It is important that our future generations learn the skills to survive successfully. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 18:52, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

This was a very good article to read.  I enjoyed its timely resources and information.  As a non-core teacher, I'm easily frustrated by the NCLB act.  The over emphasis on the the core classes seems to leave technical education and electives out in the dust.  If I had a dollar for every time I had a student taken from my class so they could review for their SOL, I wouldn't have to teach anymore.  Teaching to the tests have become the normal.  Teachers rarely have time to interject any relevant outside information if it doesn't serve the purpose of having their students ready for the test.   Like it or not the teachers are judged as to how their students do when taking their SOLs.  I don't find it a very sound way of educating our students.

Your article really opened my eyes to the realistic world behind the legislation of our educational system in the United States. Many great reform laws have stayed deep within the walls of Senator's offices, buried, much like the great education we expect. The important thing (like you explained) is that as educators we take a stand to do what is best for our students and ultimately for the children that will one day run this country. A reform is a must and I'm glad you feel as deep about it as we all most likely do. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 22:38, 15 July 2009 (UTC)


This article was not only very well-written and organized, but it was also very informative. It gave me a lot of insight about real-world issues involving educational reform. These issues are real, current and debatable. I'm glad that this article presented some of the most current and important issues in the news. Yes, educational reform is needed but it will take a huge effort to change policies or put new ones in place. Ultimately, you're right. It is up to teachers to do what is best for their students.

Great article! You did a wonderful job illuminating the numerous issues behind much of the current educational legislation. No child left behind negatively affects and pressures many once adequate school systems and is minimizing the learning that happens within a school. NCLB like communism sounds like a great idea, but the enactment is nearly impossible. Your article will help many previously unfamiliar with the legislation see both sides of our educational reform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">graphs don't show up, most of the formatting doesn't work, and some of the special characters show up as boxes. i checked and its not just my browser

I think the images need to be added - I have had a problem uploading images onto the site - which is excellent by the way.

I have edited some of this page for subscript and superscript that need to be added to allow some of the equations to make sense.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Some Thoughts About a Bcite Extension==

Here are some thoughts (formulated in the form of use requirements) about a '''Bcite''' extension.

* Most, if not all, Bcite extension options should be per book, not per mediawiki implementation. Different books have different citation requirements and these should not be constrained by site-wide choices.

* The Bcite extension should support both citation source lists and footnote lists (the latter being parenthetical explanatory text inserted by the book's author(s)).

* Citation list management and rendering should be completely separate. It should be possible to render a citation list on a page that contains no citation list data.

* Citation lists should be named. This name might be a pagename on which the list is displayed for management purposes or it might be a name that is completely independent of a pagename. (It is not necessary that an implementation support both of these options. Either one is an acceptable implementation choice).

* It should be possible to create a citation list from operations on other citation lists. Useful operations are create, merge, diff and same (the opposite of diff - '''same''' returns all elements that the two citation lists hold in common). One model is to treat citation lists as instances of more general ordered sets and provide a set of ordered set operations.

* It should be possible to create a citation list that is dynamically dependent on operations applied to other citation lists. Thus, if a citation list is the diff of two other citation lists and one of the latter changes, the change should propagate to the dependent citation list. This dependence should include removal of the affected citation list entries when one of the base citation lists is deleted. It should also include the change of text in a citation list entry when it comes from a base citation list.

* Provision of citation list names and operations obviates the need for a grouping feature. Effectively, the citation list name is the name of a group.

* Citation list entries should be named. This allows them to be referenced in book text.

* Maintaining links between citation references and citation list renderings is awkward, since there may be multiple citation list renderings that include common citation list entries. To accommodate forward and back links, citation list renderings should have an optional name. To connect a reference and citation list rendering, a reference should have an optional parameter that names the citation list rendering to associate with it. This allows the provision of a forward link in the reference and a back link in the rendering. It also supports the insertion of reference prefixes and tags in the reference (see bullet on citation list rendering parameters below). Finally, it supports the use of one tagging/prefixing style for content sources and another style for footnotes.

* It should be possible to turn off a forward link in a reference. Alternatively, (if that is more flexibility than necessary), it should be possible to turn off all forward linking in a book.

* Different rendering and referencing tags should be supported (e.g., numbers associated with a citation list entry and its reference or an associated ordered set of characters, such as a, b, ..., aa, ab,.. useful for footnote lists). It would be useful if a book could define an ordered set of characters to use in the latter case. There should be an option to use the citation list entry name as the tag.

* Back links should be placed at the end of a citation list rendering entry. This supports good indentation styling.

* Rendering of citation lists should have several parameters, including:

:* Rendering order - it should be possible to render citation list entries in the order in which they appear in the list or alphabetized by the citation list entry name. The latter is more likely to provide useful results, since the provision of merge, diff and same operations may make it difficult to predict the order of citation list entries.

:* Rendering back links - it should be possible to turn off back links for a particular citation list render. Alternatively, (if that is more flexibility than necessary), it should be possible to turn off all back linking in a book.

:* Prefix text - It should be possible to specify prefix text for references. This prefix text is concatenated with the entry tag in the reference. Prefix tags should not be separated from the tag by a space (as is done with the group identifier and tag in the Cite extension). If a space is desired, the writer/editor can provide it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installation Notes==

===Installing the Bref Template===

To install Bref on a MediaWiki installation, load the Bref subtree (the Bref Template, plus all subsidiary children pages) onto the appropriate grafting point in the target installation (e.g., you may wish to put it into the Template namespace, where it normally belongs. Alternatively, you can put it into user space, where it currently exists on Wikibooks).

The recommended way to install Bref is to obtain an XML file created by Special:Export on an installation with Bref already installed. To generate this file, access Special:Allpages on a Mediawiki installation with Bref installed. Get a list all of the Bref pages in the installation. This is quite simple. First, choose the namespace (e.g., User, if Bref is installed in a user namespace, such as User:Dnessett or Template, if Bref is installed in the Template namespace). List all of the pages in that namespace and copy the list. Paste the copied text into a new file (you can do this by creating a new file with a text editor and pasting the copied text into it). Remove any formating from the text by saving it as plaintext. The result should be a list of all of the pages in the namespace, one page per line. ('''The list must contain one pagename per line, since this is required by Special:Export'''.) The namespace identifier will not appear in each entry.

Delete all pagenames in the list that do not begin with the Bref pagename prefix for the existing installation. For example, if Bref is installed at User:Dnessett/Template/Bref, delete all pagenames that do not begin with Dnessett/Template/Bref.  Now add the namespace identifier to each pagename. Simply globally replace the prefix with &lt;namespace identifier&gt;:&lt;prefix&gt;. For example, if the pagename prefix is Dnessett/Template/Bref and Bref is installed in the User namespace, globally replace Dnessett/Template/Bref with User:Dnessett/Template/Bref.

The resulting pagname list is now ready for use by Special:Export. Paste the list into the box immediately ''below'' the one labeled &quot;Add pages from category&quot;. Make sure the checkboxes &quot;Include only the current version, not the full history&quot;, and &quot;Save as File&quot; are checked. There is no need to check the &quot;Include templates&quot; check box. Finally, click the button labeled &quot;Export&quot;. The file is saved to your system. If you have trouble with these exporting instructions, you can read the material at [[meta:help:Export | Help:Export]].

The file created by Special:Export must be modifed to indicate the grafting point on the '''target''' installation. Open the XML file with a text editor (making sure it remains plain text) and globally replace the pagename prefix (the one including the namespace identifier) with the target installation grafting point. For example if the pagename prefix is User:Dnessett/Template/Bref and Bref will be grafted into the target installation at Template:Bref, globally replace User:Dnessett/Template/Bref with Template:Bref. '''Don't forget to include the namespace identifier in the grafting point prefix'''.

Once you have modified the XML file so it uses the grafting point prefix for the target installation, access Special:Import on the target installation, click the button labled &quot;Choose File&quot;. and provide the name of the XML file. You can provide a comment if you wish. Then click the button &quot;Upload file&quot;. The import may take a while (up to a few minutes). When it finishes, Import will report what happened. If it reports something like, &quot;The action you have requested is limited to users in one of the groups: Administrator, Importers, Transwiki importers&quot;, you do not have import privileges on the target installation. You must contact an administrator, provide the XML file and ask that it be uploaded.

Once you have successfully installed Bref, you can discard the file containing the list of pagenames on the origin mediawiki installation and the XML file generated by Special:Export. Alternatively, you can retain the XML file for installing Bref on other mediawiki installations. (If you do this, don't forget to modify the grafting point prefix in the XML file to reflect the proper location on the new target installation).

After loading Bref onto its grafting point, resolve the following issues:

* Each helper template calls Bref using substitution (i.e., using the &quot;subst:&quot; keyword). Do not change this. If you rewrite the helper templates to call Bref dynamically, template loop errors will occur for some Bref OP parameter values. Furthermore, the call by substitution is more efficient, since Bref is not going to change between helper template calls. If you do change the Bref template (e.g., to install a bug fix), you have to go back to each helper template and reinstall them using the steps described below.

* There is a MediaWiki bug (18965) fixed in r50537. This bug affects the use of the Bref helper script (see the Bref document for details about this script). If your installation version precedes this version (to find your installation's version number, access the Special:Version page), then putting the importScript call into User:&lt;username&gt;/per_book/&lt;bookname&gt; will not work. Until the installation revision equals or exceeds r50537 (or until the bug is fixed locally) the only way to clean up the useless back links in citation data renders is to put the importScript call into the appropriate skin script (e.g., for Monobooks, monobook.js). This is inefficient, as described in the Bref document. So, it is preferable to get the bug fixed in the installation as soon as possible and move the importScript call to User:&lt;username&gt;/per_book/&lt;bookname&gt;. This bug should not affect the global per-book gadget (although, as of 5/29/2009 using the helper script with the  global per-book gadget is untested).

* There was a bug in the personal per-book gadget script MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper.js that prevented the Bref helper script from working. This is now fixed. However, if your installation has an old copy of that script, it needs to be updated. Go to Wikibooks and reference the  MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper.js page (e.g., paste  MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper.js after /wiki/ in the URL showing in the browser and navigate to the page). Compare the script on that page with the page on your installation. If they are different, update (or get a sysop to update) the installation's page to the text on the Wikibooks page.

* After loading the XML file into its grafting point on the new installation, the Bref template and the helper templates will have extraneous line breaks between their lines. This causes problems with their use. Consequently, after Importing the XML file, some cleanup is required, specifically that given in the next two bullets.

* The line breaks between switch statement lines and any line breaks at the end of the Bref template code must be eliminated. This can be done manually. Alternatively, the following code can be copied and pasted into the Bref template page:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;{{#switch: {{{OP}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | nop&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | #default = &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blueviolet&quot;&gt;Bref_Place_Holder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | scl = &lt;div style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; | sbp = &lt;div style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;{{ {{#if: {{{CLP|}}} | {{{CLP}}} | {{#titleparts: {{FULLPAGENAME}} | -1 }}/Citations_List}} }}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Don't put the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#switch&lt;/nowiki&gt; keyword on the line below &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and don't put the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the line below the &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; closing template braces. For some reason, (perhaps related to Mozilla bugs 1878, 12974 and 18994) doing so causes the template expansion code to add line breaks in inappropriate places, which breaks the Bref template calls.

* The helper templates are themselves template calls. They must be reinstalled from the text shown below. For example, the Bref Add Citations List Page is located at ''Bref''/Add Citations List Page, where ''Bref'' represents the Bref grafting prefix, e.g., Template:Bref. To clean it up edit the helper template page, delete all existing text on the page, copy the text given below (including the HTML comment) under the title '''Bref Add Citations List Page''' (obviously, don't copy the title), paste it into the helper template edit area and then save the page. Keeping the HTML comment on the helper template page allows it to be refreshed (in case the Bref template changes, e.g., for a bug fix) without referencing these installation notes. To do this, edit the helper template page, delete everything but the HTML comment, copy the text within the comment delimiters, paste it immediately after the comment (not on the next line) and save the page.

===Installing the Bref Examples===

Installing the Bref Examples follows the same general procedure as installing the Bref template. Load the Bref_Examples subtree onto the appropriate grafting point at the install site. When using Special:Export to accomplish this, the prefix User:Dnessett should be changed in the XML file to the grafting point prefix on install site.

Like other documents that use Bref, a clean representation of citation and footnote rendering sections requires the use of the Bref helper script. The recommended way to enable the helper script (see the '''Cleaning Up Meaningless Back Links (Bref Helper Script)''' section in the main Bref document) is through the use of the per book or personal per book gadgets. Due to the way per book and personal per book gadgets work, the grafting prefix '''must''' be either a user name (i.e., User:&lt;some name&gt;) or the main name space. So, the name of the Bref_Examples portal page will be either User:&lt;some name&gt;/Bref_Examples or simply Bref_Examples. All of the examples pages are prefixed by the portal page name (NB: prefixes may have subsidiary organization, e.g., the first markup page in chapter 1 of Example 2 is &lt;portal page prefix&gt;/Example2/Chapter1/Markup Page 1).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Usage==

The Bref template utilizes CITE extension functionality to provide citation, footnote and reference structures more applicable to books and other long texts. It assumes a book contains three structures: 1) one or more citations list page(s) where all citation and footnote information is specified, 2) one or more references sections where citation and footnote information is rendered, and 3) a set of book pages, where citations and footnotes are referenced. Distinguishing between types 1 and 2 is necessary to overcome certain unwelcome CITE extension behavior.

The Bref template family consists of one core template (Bref) and several helper templates that utilize it. The core template should not be directly called, since doing so causes template loop errors. Instead, authors should insert calls to the appropriate helper templates into their documents.

''Terminology'': A '''citation''' comprises data identifying either a textual source or a footnote. It includes a name (e.g., &quot;Tolkien1954a&quot;) and associated text. A '''reference''' is the name of a citation inserted into a document.

===Bref Template Call===

The Bref template is the core engine of the Bref template family. A Bref template call has the following skeleton:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref | OP = &lt;op value&gt; | CLP = &lt;citations list pagename&gt; | NAME = &lt;citation name&gt; | GROUP = &lt;group name&gt; | TEXT = &lt;citation data&gt;}}. The &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; specified in this skeleton simply deliminate a description of the parameter values. They do not appear in an actual Bref call. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

The parameter values are:

:OP: the specific Bref operation performed. Default=nop
:CLP: the name of a Citations List Page holding citation information (in the form of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref | OP=cite}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or equivalently Bref/Citation_Definition data). Default=Page_Parent/Citations_List.
::To build the default CLP pagename, &quot;Page_Parent&quot; is replaced by the parent pagename. The parent is the page located at one higher level in the pagename hierarchy. For example, if the page containing the Bref call is: Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Chapter 1, then the default CLP for that call is: Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Citations_List. Note: if the CLP is a page in the main namespace, it must be specifically indicated. That is, using it as the value of the CLP parameter requires a colon before the pagename, i.e., CLP=:BookName/Citations_List
:NAME: the name of a citation. Default=&quot;&quot;.
::Bref calls with OP=ref or OP=cite (equivalently, Bref/Citation_Reference or Bref/Citation_Definition) '''must''' contain a NAME parameter and '''may''' contain a GROUP parameter. Bref calls with OP=note (equivalently, Bref/Footnote_Reference) '''must''' contain a GROUP parameter and '''may''' contain a NAME parameter. The value of NAME is ignored for all other Bref OP values. For Bref OP=ref, OP=cite, and Bref OP=note calls, the paired values of NAME and GROUP must be unique in the scope of all citation lists presented on the page. In a OP=cite call, NAME and GROUP associate their values with the provided citation information (i.e., the TEXT value). In a OP=ref call, they identify the citation information (again, the TEXT value) referenced. In a OP=note call, they identify the footnote (the TEXT value) referenced.
:GROUP: The name of a group of footnotes or citations. Default=&quot;&quot;.
::The value of GROUP is the name of a group. When rendered in document text, references to a footnote or citation with a non-null GROUP parameter are prefixed with the value of GROUP. A Bref call with OP=cite (equivalently, Bref/Citation_Definition), GROUP=fn and NAME=&lt;some value&gt; places an entry in a Citations List grouped with all others inserted with GROUP=fn. If a Bref call with OP=ref or OP=note (equivalently, Bref/Citation_Reference or Bref/Footnote_Reference), GROUP=fn and NAME=&lt;some value&gt; is placed on a document page, the reference will appear as &quot;fn xxx&quot;, where xxx is the numerical order of the entry in the Citations List. For example, if a Citations List contains three footnotes in group GROUP=fn and the third is referenced in a document's text by a Bref call with OP=note, GROUP=fn and NAME=&lt;identifier of third footnote&gt;, the reference in the text will be : &quot;fn 3&quot; (without the quotes). Defining and referencing footnotes without an identifying NAME value should only be used when all footnotes and the rendered footnote list appear on the same page. Otherwise, it is difficult to synchronize the footnote's reference name with its numerical label in the footnote list (footnote references without a NAME value are given a numerical value based on the order in which they appear on a document page). When specified in a Bref call with OP=rcd (equivalently, Bref/Render_Citation_Data), only footnotes or citations in the identified group are rendered. Consequently, assuming a set of footnotes are grouped together by GROUP=group1 and GROUP=group2, a Bref call with OP=rcd and GROUP=group2 only renders those footnotes in group2.
:TEXT: The textual information associated with a  citation or footnote. This parameter is used only in Bref calls with OP=cite (equivalently, Bref/Citation_Definition).  Default=&quot; &quot;.
::It is perfectly legal for TEXT to evaluate to white space, although normally it should evaluate to citation or footnote data, e.g., information formated by the Cite family of templates (e.g., [[Template:Cite_book]]) in the case of a citation or contained within &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;span class=footnote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags in the case of footnotes. Using whitespace as citation data allows the insertion of citation references and empty footnotes into a document before the associated text is available. Note: any text not contained within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags will be rendered to the null string by the Bref helper script (see below).

The OP parameter may take one of the following values:

:OP=nop: No Operation.
::This OP value is provided so that Bref template calls may be placed in markup as placeholders for later elaboration. It is also the default OP when Bref is called with an unrecognized value. It returns the text &quot;Bref_Place_Holder&quot; (without the quotes) rendered as a superscript.
:OP=scl: Start Citation List.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the beginning of a Citations List Page.
:OP=ecl: End Citation List.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the end of a Citations List Page.
:OP=sbp: Start Book Page.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the beginning of every document page that includes references to citations.
:OP=ebp: End Book Page.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the end of every document page that includes references to citations.
:OP=aclp: Add Citations List Page.
::One or more Bref calls with this OP value '''must''' be placed at the beginning of a references section. One or more Bref calls with this OP value '''may''' be placed at the beginning of a document page after the Start Book Page call (e.g., so that data in multiple citation lists is available).
:OP=rcd: Render Citation Data.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the beginning of a references section. If document organization calls for the rendering of multiple citation lists on the same document page, each citation list is identified in a Bref/Add Citations List Page call, which should appear immediately before the relevant Bref/Render_Citation_Data call
:OP=cite: Citation Definition.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed within the Citations List page in order to define the citation data associated with the NAME parameter value. A NAME parameter that evaluates to white space generates an error. This call takes an optional GROUP parameter that associates the citation data with a group.
:OP=ref: Citation Reference.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the location in a document page where a source reference occurs. The NAME parameter specifies the particular citation referenced. A NAME parameter that evaluates to white space generates an error. The optional GROUP parameter specifies the citation's group.
:OP=note: Footnote Reference.
::A Bref call with this OP value is placed at the location in a document page where a footnote reference occurs. The GROUP parameter identifies the group to which the footnote belongs. A GROUP parameter that evaluates to white space generates an error. The optional NAME parameter specifies the particular footnote referenced.

===Helper Templates===

These are the helper templates that should be used instead of direct calls to Bref. Parameters and their values are specified. Optional parameters are indicated by placement within square brackets. Currently the templates are in the User:Dnessett/Template/Bref namespace, so at present &quot;Bref&quot; in the text below should be replaced with &quot;User:Dnessett/Template/Bref&quot;.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Place_Holder}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Start_Citation_List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/End_Citation_List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Start_Book_Page [| CLP=&lt;citations list page&gt;]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/End_Book_Page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Add_Citations_List_Page [| CLP=&lt;citations list page&gt;]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Render_Citation_Data [| GROUP=&lt;footnote group&gt;]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Citation_Definition | NAME=&lt;citation reference&gt; [| GROUP=&lt;citation group&gt;]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Citation_Reference | NAME=&lt;citation reference&gt; [| GROUP=&lt;citation group&gt;]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Footnote_Reference | GROUP=&lt;footnote group&gt; [|NAME=&lt;footnote reference&gt;]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

==Typical Use==

Assume a book in the main namespace with the title &quot;Tales Told By An Idiot&quot; is organized into numerous book pages, a single citations list page and a single references page (see Example 1 in [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples | Examples]]). Then its pages might be formated as follows (Note: the parameter CLP=Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Citations_List is explicitly given, even though that is unnecessary, since its value equals the name of the default Citations List page.):


'''Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Citations_List'''

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Start_Citation_List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Citation_Definition | NAME=reference 1 | TEXT=Citation Information}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Citation_Definition | NAME=reference 2 | TEXT=Citation Information}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Citation_Definition | NAME=reference 3 | TEXT=Citation Information}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Citation_Definition | NAME=reference 4 | TEXT=Citation Information}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/End_Citation_List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;



'''Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Some_Book_Page'''

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Start_Book_Page | CLP=Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Citations_List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
.
.
.

Some text&lt;nowiki&gt; {{Bref/Citation_Reference | NAME=reference 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

.
.
.

Some other text&lt;nowiki&gt; {{Bref/Citation_Reference | NAME=reference 1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

.
.
.

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/End_Book_Page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;


'''Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/References_Page'''

Some text at the beginning of the References Page
.
.
.

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Add_Citations_List_Page  | CLP=Tales_Told_By_An_Idiot/Citations_List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bref/Render_Citation_Data}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Cleaning Up Meaningless Back Links (Bref Helper Script)==

The Bref template utilizes data held within hidden (i.e., display:none) sections when rendering reference and footnote sections. This means any back links displayed by &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (which is called by Render_Citation_Data) are effectively meaningless. Consequently, the Bref template is accompanied by a [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js|Helper Script]] that removes these links. It is simply constructed. Any textual data in a reference list entry that is not encapsulated by &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags is removed by setting it to the null string.

The Bref helper script is only available to logged on users. In order to utilize it, enable the per-book and/or personal per-book gadgets and place the statement importScript('User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js') on the appropriate page. In the case of the per-book gadget, this page is MediaWiki:Perbook/&lt;book name&gt;.js, For the personal per-book gadget, it is User:&lt;your name&gt;/per_book/&lt;book name&gt;.js. It is also possible to put the importScript call in the user's per-user javascript page, e.g., monobook.js for the monobook skin. While this may be useful for initial development (e.g., before you have a book with which to configure the per-book data), such use is deprecated, since the script will run on every wiki page rendered, even though the page contains no Bref formated data.

To enable the helper script for the [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples | Examples]], create a page named either MediaWiki:Perbook/Bref_Examples.js (installation wide) or User:&lt;your name&gt;/per_book/Bref_Examples.js (per user) and add the line importScript('User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js').

==Examples==

The Bref template is sufficiently flexible so that it can be used to implement different book citation styles. A selection of these styles is illustrated by several examples specified on this document's [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples | Examples]] page. In order to eliminate the back reference marks in the examples, use the steps [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/doc#Cleaning Up Meaningless Back Links (Bref Helper Script) | described above]] for enabling the helper script for the [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples | Examples]].

==Implementation Comments, Installation Notes and Compatibility Testing==

The motivation for developing the Bref template arose when it became apparent that cite extension functionality was not designed for use in books. Books are generally long and comprise many wiki pages (organized in a combination of linear and tree structures). It is rare that references in a book occur on the same wiki page as the citation data. The cite extension was designed primarily for wikipedia where this condition generally obtains.

In a perfect world someone would create a new mediawiki extension more suited for use in books. However, getting new extensions onto wikimedia foundation servers is a task of roughly the same difficulty as boiling the ocean. So, Bref was born. Admittedly, it is not a beautiful/lyrical example of programming. It works around a number of irritating cite extension &quot;features&quot; using several hacks. Nevertheless, it appears to work, which is always the most important criterion for a programming tool. If someone eventually decides to replace Bref with an extension for book citations, [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Book Citation User Requirements|here]] are some thoughts that they might find useful.

If you wish to install Bref on a MediaWiki installation other than Wikibooks, read the following [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Installation Notes |Installation Notes]].

The Bref Template and its helper script are compatible with: '''Mac OS X 10.4.11''' (Safari 3.2.1, Firefox 3.04, Opera 9.50), '''Windows Vista SP1''' (IE 8.0, Firefox 3.0.10, Opera 9.64, Safari 3.1.2, Chrome 2.0.172.28), '''Windows XP SP3''' (IE 7.0.5730.11, Firefox 3.0.1, Opera 9.64, Safari 4 Public Beta 528.17, Chrome 2.0.172.28), '''Linux [Ubuntu 8.04:2.6.24-23]''' (Firefox 3.0.5, Opera 9.50, Epiphany 2.22.2, Konqueror 3.5.10). '''Skins''' (Monobook, Chick, Classic, Cologne Blue, Modern, My Skin, Nostalgia, and Simple).

==Acknowledgments==

User [[w:User:Happy-melon|Happy-melon]] suggested a way to get around the annoying &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;TEXT error: &lt;ref&gt; tags exist, but no &lt;references/&gt; tag was found&quot; error when &lt;ref&gt; data is on a page without a &lt;references/&gt; call&lt;/nowiki&gt;. User [[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]] was very helpful answering a number of questions in the Technical Assistance section of the Reading room.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should be aware of the purpose and target readership of the blog before creating it. The purpose may influence the selection of an appropriate blog creation tool, e.g. to what extent are collaboration facilities required. It may also influence the overall style of the blog – a corporate blog is likely to be more formal than one devoted to a rock band. 

Target readership is also an important consideration as this is likely to influence the design of the blog. One critical aspect to consider here is readability. Some useful information can be found at: http://www.write101.com/letham2.htm

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most important features of blogs is currency. A blog which is out of date can rapidly become useless.  However, it is important to note that a blog should only be updates when there is something useful to be added: updating just for the sake of it, when there is nothing new to be added, can simply be annoying to readers.

A blog can be regarded as an effective information tool when it succeeds in reaching the target audience and communicating the desired information.

==Introduction==
The sensory system for the sense of hearing is the auditory system. This wikibook covers the physiology of the auditory system, and its application to the most successful neurosensory prosthesis - cochlear implants. The physics and engineering of acoustics are covered in a separate wikibook, ''[[Acoustics]]''. An excellent source of images and animations is &quot;Journey into the world of hearing&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ability to hear is not found as widely in the animal kingdom as other senses like touch, taste and smell. It is restricted mainly to vertebrates and insects. Within these, mammals and birds have the most highly developed sense of hearing. The table below shows frequency ranges of humans and some selected animals:

&lt;table border=1 align=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th align=left&gt;Humans&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;td align=right&gt;20-20'000 Hz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th align=left&gt;Whales&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;td align=right&gt;20-100'000 Hz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th align=left&gt;Bats&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;td align=right&gt;1'500-100'000 Hz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th align=left&gt;Fish&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;td align=right&gt;20-3'000 Hz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The organ that detects sound is the ear. It acts as receiver in the process of collecting acoustic information and passing it through the nervous system into the brain.
The ear includes structures for both the sense of hearing and the sense of balance. It does not only play an important role as part of the auditory system in order to receive sound but also in the sense of balance and body position.

&lt;table border=0 align=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Mother-Child_face_to_face.jpg|thumb|Mother and child]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Sanc0602.jpg|thumb|Humpback whales in the singing position]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|thumb|Big eared townsend bat]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; [[File:Hyphessobrycon_pulchripinnis.jpg|thumb|Hyphessobrycon pulchripinnis fish]] &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Humans have a pair of ears placed symmetrically on both sides of the head which makes it possible to localize sound sources. The brain extracts and processes different forms of data in order to localize sound, such as: 
* the shape of the sound spectrum at the tympanic membrane (eardrum) 
* the difference in sound intensity between the left and the right ear 
* the difference in time-of-arrival between the left and the right ear 
* the difference in time-of-arrival between reflections of the ear itself (this means in other words: the shape of the pinna (pattern of folds and ridges) captures sound-waves in a way that helps localizing the sound source, especially on the vertical axis.


Healthy, young humans are able to hear sounds over a frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. We are most sensitive to frequencies between 2000 to 4000 Hz which is the frequency range of spoken words. The frequency resolution is 0.2% which means that one can distinguish between a tone of 1000 Hz and 1002 Hz. A sound at 1 kHz can be detected if it deflects the tympanic membrane (eardrum) by less than 1 Angstrom, which is less than the diameter of a hydrogen atom. This extreme sensitivity of the ear may explain why it contains the smallest bone that exists inside a human body: the stapes (stirrup). It is 0.25 to 0.33 cm long and weighs between 1.9 and 4.3 mg.

The main function of the balance system, or vestibular system, is to sense head movements, especially involuntary ones, and counter them with reflexive eye movements and postural adjustments that keep the visual world stable and keep us from falling.
An excellent, more extensive article on the vestibular system is available on Scholorpedia

==Anatomy of the Somatosensory System==
Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The receptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell us about temperature (''thermoreceptors''), pressure and surface texture (''mechano receptors''), and pain (''nociceptors''). The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles.
(The following description is based on lecture notes from Laszlo Zaborszky, from Rutgers University.)

===Cutaneous receptors===
====Mechanoreceptors====
[[File:Skin proprioception.svg | thumb | 450 px | Receptors in the human skin: Mechanoreceptors can be free receptors or encapsulated. Examples for free receptors are the hair receptors at the roots of hairs. Encapsulated receptors are the Pacinian corpuscles and the receptors in the glabrous (hairless) skin: Meissner corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles and Merkel’s disks.]]

Sensory information from ''Meissner corpuscles'' and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when objects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief burst of action potentials when objects move a small distance during the early stages of lifting. In response to rapidly adapting afferent activity, muscle force increases reflexively until the gripped object no longer moves. Such a rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication of the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor activity. 

The slowly adapting ''Merkel's receptors'' are responsible for form and texture perception.  As would be expected for receptors mediating form perception, Merkel‘s receptors are present at high density in the digits and around the mouth (50/mm2 of skin surface), at lower density in other glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin. This innervations density shrinks progressively with the passage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in human digits is reduced to 10/mm2. Unlike rapidly adapting axons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the initial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation up to several seconds in duration.

Activation of the rapidly adapting ''Pacinian corpuscles'' gives a feeling of vibration, while the slowly adapting ''Ruffini corpuscles'' respond to the lataral movement or stretching of skin.

====Nociceptors====
Nociceptors have free nerve endings. Functionally, skin nociceptors are either high-threshold mechanoreceptors or ''polymodal receptors''. Polymodal receptors respond not only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and to noxious chemicals. These receptors respond to minute punctures of the epithelium, with a response magnitude that depends on the degree of tissue deformation. They also respond to temperatures in the range of 40-60oC, and change their response rates as a linear function of warming (in contrast with the saturating responses displayed by non-noxious thermoreceptors at high temperatures).

Pain signals can be separated into individual components, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmitted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is called ''first pain'' or ''cutaneous pricking pain''. It is well localized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affective component is called ''second pain'' or ''burning pain''; it is poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or ''deep pain'', arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated with referred pain.

====Thermoreceptors====
The thermoreceptors have free nerve endings. Interestingly, we have only two types of thermoreceptors that signal innocuous warmth and cooling respectively in our skin (however, some nociceptors are also sensitive to temperature, but capable of unamibiously signaling only noxious temperatures). The warm receptors show a maximum sensitivity at ~ 45°C, signal temperatures between 30 and 45°C, and cannot unambiguously signal temperatures higher than 45°C , and are unmyelinated. The cold receptors have their maximum sensitivity at ~ 27°C, signal temperatures above  17°C, and some consist of lightly myelinated fibers, while others are unmyelinated. Our sense of temperature comes from the comparison of the signals from the warm and cold receptors. Thermoreceptors are poor indicators of absolute temperature but are very sensitive to changes in skin temperature.

===Proprioceptors===
The term ''proprioceptive'' or ''kinesthetic sense'' is used to refer to the perception of joint position, joint movements, and the direction and velocity of joint movement. There are numerous mechanoreceptors in the muscles, the muscle fascia, and in the dense connective tissue of joint capsules and ligaments.  There are two specialized encapsulated, low-threshold mechanoreceptors: the ''muscle spindle'' and the ''Golgi tendon organ''. Their adequate stimulus is stretching of the tissue in which they lie. Muscle spindles, joint and skin receptors all contribute to kinesthesia. Muscle spindles appear to provide their most important contribution to kinesthesia with regard to large joints, such as the hip and knee joints, whereas joint receptors and skin receptors may provide more significant contributions with regard to finger and toe joints.

====Muscle Spindles====
[[File:Muscle_spindle_model.jpg | thumb | 400 px | Mammalian muscle spindle showing typical position in a muscle (left), neuronal connections in spinal cord (middle) and expanded schematic (right). The spindle is a stretch receptor with its own motor supply consisting of several intrafusal muscle fibres. The sensory endings of a primary (group Ia) afferent and a secondary (group II) afferent coil around the non-contractile central portions of the intrafusal fibres. Gamma motoneurons activate the intrafusal muscle fibres, changing the resting firing rate and stretch-sensitivity of the afferents.]]

Scattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spindles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle third of the fibers. These fibers are called ''intrafusal fibers'', in contrast to the ordinary ''extrafusal fibers''. The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so whenever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has few myofilaments and is non-contractile, but it does have one or more sensory endings applied to it. When the muscle is stretched, the central part of the intrafusal fiber is stretched and each sensory ending fires impulses.

Numerous specializations occur in this simple basic organization, so that in fact the muscle spindle is one of the most complex receptor organs in the body. Only three of these specializations are described here; their overall effect is to make the muscle spindle adjustable and give it a dual function, part of it being particularly sensitive to the length of the muscle in a static sense and part of it being particularly sensitive to the rate at which this length changes.

# Intrafusal muscle fibers are of two types. All are multinucleated, and the central, non-contractile region contains the nuclei. In one type of intrafusal fiber, the nuclei are lined up single file; these are called ''nuclear chain fiber''. In the other type, the nuclear region is broader, and the nuclei are arranged several abreast; these are called ''nuclear bag fibers''. There are typically two or three nuclear bag fibers per spindle and about twice that many chain fibers.
# There are also two types of sensory endings in the muscle spindle. The first type, called the primary ending, is formed by a single Ia (A-alpha) fiber, supplying every intrafusal fiber in a given spindle. Each branch wraps around the central region of the intrafusal fiber, frequently in a spiral fashion, so these are sometimes called ''annulospiral endings''. The second type of ending is formed by a few smaller nerve fibers (II or A-Beta) on both sides of the primary endings. These are the secondary endings, which are sometimes referred to as ''flower-spray endings'' because of their appearance. Primary endings are selectively sensitive to the onset of muscle stretch but discharge at a slower rate while the stretch is maintained. Secondary endings are less sensitive to the onset of stretch, but their discharge rate does not decline very much while the stretch is maintained. In other words, both primary and secondary endings signal the static length of the muscle (static sensitivity) whereas only the primary ending signals the length changes (movement) and their velocity (dynamic sensitivity). The change of firing frequency of group Ia and group II fibers can then be related to static muscle length (static phase) and to stretch and shortening of the muscle (dynamic phases).
# Muscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers are called ''alpha motor neurons'', while the smaller ones supplying the contractile portions of intrafusal fibers are called ''gamma neurons''.  Gamma motor neurons can regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sensitivity can be maintained at any given muscle length.

====Golgi tendon organ====

[[File:Tendon_organ_model.jpg | thumb | 400 px | Mammalian tendon organ showing typical position in a muscle (left), neuronal connections in spinal cord (middle) and expanded schematic (right). The tendon organ is a stretch receptor that signals the force developed by the muscle. The sensory endings of the Ib afferent are entwined amongst the musculotendinous strands of 10 to 20 motor units.]]

The Golgi tendon organ is located at the musculotendinous junction. There is no efferent innervation of the tendon organ, therefore its sensitivity cannot be controlled from the CNS. The tendon organ, in contrast to the muscle spindle, is coupled in series with the extrafusal muscle fibers. Both passive stretch and active contraction of the muscle increase the tension of the tendon and thus activate the tendon organ receptor, but active contraction produces the greatest increase. The tendon organ, consequently, can inform the CNS about the “muscle tension”. In contrast, the activity of the muscle spindle depends on the “muscle length” and not on the tension. The muscle fibers attached to one tendon organ appear to belong to several motor units. Thus the CNS is informed not only of the overall tension produced by the muscle but also of how the workload is distributed among the different motor units.

====Joint receptors====
The joint receptors are low-threshold mechanoreceptors and have been divided into four groups. They signal different characteristics of joint function (position, movements, direction and speed of movements). The free receptors or type 4 joint receptors are nociceptors.

== Modelling muscle spindles and afferent response ==
The response of the muscle spindles in mammals to muscle stretch has been thoroughly studied, and various models have been proposed. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate data of the afferent and fusimotor responses during muscular movement, these models have usually been quite limited. For example, several of the earliest models account only for the afferent response, ignoring the fusimotor activity.

=== Mileusnic et al. (2006) model ===

One recent model, developed by Mileusnic et al. (2006), portrays the muscle spindle as consisting of several (typically 4 to 11) nuclear chain fibres, and two different nuclear bag fibres, connected in parallel as shown here in the figure below. The muscle fibres respond to three inputs: fascicle length, dynamic fusimotor input and static fusimotor input. The &lt;math&gt;bag_1&lt;/math&gt; fibre is mainly responsible for detecting dynamic fusimotor input, while the &lt;math&gt;bag_2&lt;/math&gt; and chain fibres are mainly responsible for detecting static fusimotor input. All fibres respond to changes in the fascicle length, and are modelled in largely the same way but with different coefficients to account for their different physiological properties. The responses of the three types of fibres are summed to generate the primary and secondary afferent activities. The primary afferent activity is affected by the response of all three types of muscle fibres, while the secondary afferent activity only depends on the &lt;math&gt;bag_2&lt;/math&gt; and chain fibre responses.

[[File:MuscleSpindle_Model.png | thumb | center | 500 px | . ]]

=== Hasan (1983) model ===

Another comprehensive model of muscle spindles was proposed by Hasan in 1983 &lt;ref name=&quot;Hasan1983&quot;&gt;[http://www.example.org Hasan 1983], Hasan 1983&lt;/ref&gt;. This representation of muscle fibres and spindles is based closely on their physical properties. The muscle spindle is represented as two separate regions connected in series: sensory and non-sensory. The firing rate of the spindle afferent depends on the state of the two regions&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasan1983&quot; /&gt;. The lengths of the two regions can be labelled &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt; for the sensory and &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; for the non-sensory region. The tension &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the two regions is equal, since they are placed in series. The sensory zone can be assumed to act like a spring (equation (3)), while in the non-sensory region, tension is a non-linear function of &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; (equation (2) derived by Hasan).

&lt;math id=eq.2&gt;
f(t) = k_1(y(t)-c)(1+[\frac{y'(t)}{a}]^{\frac{1}{3}}) \qquad \qquad \text{(2)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math id=eq.3&gt;
f(t) = k_2z(t) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{(3)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The total length of the muscle spindle, x(t) is the sum of the length of the two regions (equation (4)). 

&lt;math id=eq.4&gt;
x(t) = z(t) + y(t) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{(4)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using this substitution and rearranging, we can derive the following expression for the length of the sensory zone (equation (5)):

&lt;math id=eq.5&gt;
z'(t) = x'(t) - a(\frac{bz(t) - x(t) + c}{x(t) - z(t) - c})^3 \qquad \text{(5)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents the sensitivity of the tension to to velocity in the non-sensory zone, parameter &lt;math&gt;b = (k_1+k_2)/k_1 &lt;/math&gt; and parameter &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; determines the zero-length tension which influences the background firing rate of the afferent. The length of the sensory zone depends not only on the current length and velocity of the spindle, but on the history of the length changes. 

The firing rate, &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; in Hasan's model depends on a combination of the sensory zone length and its first derivative (equation (6)), with an experimentally derived weighting.

&lt;math id=eq.6&gt;
g(t) = z(t) + 0.1z'(t) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{(6)}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Model parameters ====
Approximate values for the model parameters a, b and c were suggested by Hasan (1983), and differ for voluntary and passive movements. A summary of these values is presented in the table below.
Type of ending
Condition
A (mm/s)
B
C (mm)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type of ending !! Condition !! A (mm/s) !! B !! C (mm)
|-
| Primary || Passive || 0.3 || 250 || -15
|-
| Primary || Gamma - dynamic || 0.1 || 125 || -15
|-
| Primary || Gamma - static || 100 || 100 || -25
|-
| Secondary || Passive || 50 || 50 || -20
|}

In the model, these values are assumed to be static for the duration of a movement, however this is not believed to be the case.

== Internal models of limb dynamics ==
In addition to modelling the response of muscle spindle afferents to muscle stretch, several groups have worked on modelling the signals which are sent from the brain to the spindle efferents in order for muscles to complete specific movements. The complexity here lies in the fact that the brain must be able to adapt to unexpected changes in the dynamics of planned movements, using feedback from the spindle afferents.

Studies in this area suggest that humans achieve this using internal models, which are built through an “error-feedback-learning” process, and transform planned muscle states into the motor commands required to achieve them. To generate the motor commands for a particular reaching movement, the brain performs calculations based on the expected dynamics of the planned movement. However, any unexpected changes in these dynamics while the movement is being executed (e.g. external strain placed on the muscle) will lead to errors in expected muscle length (Gottlieb 1994, Shadmehr and Muss-Ivaldi 1994).  These errors are communicated to the brain through the muscle spindle afferents, which experience a different sensory state to what is expected. The brain then reacts to these error signals with short and long latency responses, which work to minimise the error, but cannot eliminate it completely due to the delay in the system. 

Studies suggest that the error can be eliminated in a subsequent attempt at the movement under the same dynamics, and this is where the “error-feedback-learning” idea comes from (Thoroughman and Shadmehr 1999). The corrections which are generated by the brain form an internal model, which maps a desired action (in kinematic coordinates) to the necessary motor commands (as torques). This internal model can be represented as a weighted combination of basis elements:

&lt;math&gt;
torque = \sum w_i  g_i(\theta,\theta',\theta''...)
&lt;/math&gt;

Here each basis &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; represents some characteristic of the muscle's sensory state, and the motor command is a “population code”. Population coding is a method of representing stimuli as the combined activity of many neurons (in contrast to rate coding). In order to use such a model, we need to know how the bases represent particular limb or muscle positions, and the neuronal firing rates associated with them. The bases can, in principle, represent every aspect of the state: position, velocity, acceleration and even higher derivatives. However, this high dimensionality makes it very difficult to derive relationships experimentally between each dimension of the bases and the firing rates.

{{:Biological Machines/Sensory Systems/Gustatory System/Introduction}}
==Sensory Organs==
===Tongue and Taste Buds===
[[File:Tongue1.png|thumb|250px|Human tongue]]
Taste cells are epithelial and are clustered in taste buds located in the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, pharynx and the esophagus the tongue being the primary organ of the Gustatory System.
[[File:Taste bud.svg|thumb|left|200px|Schematic drawing of a taste bud]]
Taste buds are located in papillae along the surface of the tongue. There are three types of papillae in human: fungiform located in the anterior part containing approximately five taste buds, circumvallate papillae which are bigger and more posterior than the previous ones and the foliate papillae that are in the posterior edge of the tongue. Circumvallate and foliate papillae contain hundreds of taste buds. In each taste bud there are different types of cells: basal, dark, intermediate and light cells. Basal cells are believed to be the stem cells that give rise to the other types. It is thought that the rest of the cells correspond to different stages of differentiation where the light cells are the most mature type of cells. An alternative idea is that dark, intermediate and light cells correspond to different cellular lineages. Taste cells are short lived and are continuously regenerated. They contain a taste pore at the surface of the epithelium where they extend microvilli, the site where sensory transduction takes place. Taste cells are innervated by fibers of primary gustatory neurons. They contact sensory fibers and these connections resemble chemical synapses, they are excitable with voltage-gated channels: K+, Na+ and Ca+ channels capable of generating action potentials.
Although the reaction from different tastants varies, in general tastants interact with receptors or ion channels in the membrane of a taste cells. These interactions depolarize the cell directly or via second messengers and in this way the receptor potential generates action potentials within the taste cells, which lead to Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ voltage-gated channels followed by the release of neurotransmitters at the synapses with the sensory fibers.

===Tongue map===
The idea that the tongue is most sensitive to certain tastes in different regions was a long time misconception, which has now been proved to be wrong. All sensations come from all regions of the tongue.

===Supertasters===
An average person has about 5'000 taste buds. A &quot;supertaster&quot; is a person whose sense of taste is significantly more sensitive than average. The increase in the response is thought to be because they have more than 20’000 taste buds, or due to an increased number of fungiform papillae.

==Transduction of Taste==
As mentioned before we distinguish between 5 types of basic tastes: bitter, salty, sour, sweet and umami. There is one type of taste receptor for each flavor known and each type of taste stimulus is transduced by a different mechanisms. 
In general bitter, sweet and umami are detected by G protein-coupled receptors and salty and sour are detected via ion channels.

===Bitter===
Bitter compounds act through G protein coupled receptors (GPCR’s) also known as a seven-transmembrane domains, which are located in the walls of the taste cells. Taste receptors of type 2 (T2Rs) which is a group of GPCR’s is thought respond to bitter stimuli. When the bitter-tasting ligand binds to the GPCR it releases the G protein gustducin, its 3 subunits break apart and activate phosphodiesterase, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, closing the K+ channels. This secondary messenger stimulates the release of Ca2+, contributing to depolarization followed by neurotransmitter release. It is possible that bitter substances that are permeable to the membrane are sensed by mechanisms not involving G proteins.

===Salt===
The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a type of ion channel in the taste cell wall, allows Na+ ions to enter the cell down an electrochemical gradient, altering the membrane potential of the taste cells by depolarizing the cell. This leads to an opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, followed by neurotransmitter release. 

===Sour===
The sour taste signals the presence of acidic compounds (H+ ions) and there are three receptors: 1) The ENaC, (the same protein involved in salty taste). 2) There are also H+ gated channels; one is the K+ channel, which allows K+ outflux of the cell. H+ ions block these so the K+ stays inside the cell. 3) A third channel undergoes a configuration change when a H+ attaches to it leading to an opening of the channel and allowing an influx of Na+ down the concentration gradient into the cell, leading to the opening of a voltage gated Ca2+ channels. These three receptors work in parallel and lead to depolarization of the cell followed by neurotransmitter release.

===Sweet===
Sweet transduction is mediated by the binding of a sweet tastant to GPCR’s located in the apical membrane of the taste cell. Saccharide activates the GPCR, which releases gustducin and this in turn activates cAMP (cyclic adenylate monophosphate). cAMP will activate the cAMP kinase that will phosphorylate the K+ channels and eventually inactivate them, leading to depolarization of the cell and followed by neurotransmitter release. 

===Umami (Savory)===
Umami receptors involve also GPCR’s, the same way as bitter and sweet receptors. Glutamate binds a type of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlurR4 causing a G-protein complex to activate a secondary receptor, which ultimately leads to neurotransmitter release. In particular how the intermediate steps work, is currently unknown.

==Signal Processing==
In humans, the sense of taste is transmitted to the brain via three cranial nerves. The VII facial nerve carries information from the anterior 2/3 part of the tongue and soft palate. The IX nerve or glossopharyngeal nerve carries taste sensations from the posterior 1/3 part of the tongue and the X nerve or vagus nerve carries information from the back of the oral cavity and the epiglottis.

The gustatory cortex is the brain structure responsible for the perception of taste. It consists of the anterior insula on the insular lobe and the frontal operculum on the inferior frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe. Neurons in the gustatory cortex respond to the five main tastes. 

Taste cells synapse with primary sensory axons of the mentioned cranial nerves. The central axons of these neurons in the respective cranial nerve ganglia project to rostral and lateral regions of the nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla. Axons from the rostral (gustatory) part of the solitary nucleus project to the ventral posterior complex of the thalamus, where they terminate in the medial half of the ventral posterior medial nucleus. This nucleus projects to several regions of the neocortex, which include the gustatory cortex.

Gustatory cortex neurons exhibit complex responses to changes in concentration of tastant. For one tastant, the same neuron might increase its firing and for an other tastant, it may only respond to an intermediate concentration. 

==Taste and Other Senses==
In general the Gustatory Systems does not work alone. While eating, consistency and texture are sensed by the mechanoreceptors from the somatosensory system. The sense of taste is also correlated with the olfactory system because if we lack the sense of smell it makes it difficult to distinguish the flavor.

===Spicy food===
(black peppers, chili peppers, etc.)

It is not a basic taste because this sensation does not arise from taste buds. Capsaicin is the active ingredient in spicy food and causes “hotness” or “spiciness” when eaten. It stimulates temperature fibers and also nociceptors (pain) in the tongue. In the nociceptors it stimulates the release of substance P, which causes vasodilatation and release of histamine causing hiperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain).

In general basic tastes can be appetitive or aversive depending on the effect that the food has on us but also essential to the taste experience are the presentation of food, color, texture, smell, previous experiences, expectations, temperature and satiety.

==Taste disorders==

===Ageusia (complete loss of taste)===
Ageusia is a partial or complete loss in the sense of taste and sometimes it can be accompanied by the loss of smell.

===Dysgeusia (abnormal taste)===
Is an alteration in the perception associated with the sense of taste. Tastes of food and drinks vary radically and sometimes the taste is perceived as repulsive. The causes of dysgeusia can be associated with neurologic disorders.

I edited the section which introduced the qualities of strong leaders.  It just seemed a little weak before because it didn’t have much detail or substance.  Also, it suggested that leaders could only sprout from already successful people, which I don’t believe to be true.  I wanted to describe a leader in such a way that helps people understand that anyone can be a leader if they try.  I wanted to outline the benefits of being a leader and highlight the many qualities that contribute to strength in leadership.  Because I added a few additional qualities, sub sections may need to be added later for further development and explanation.</text>

*Purpose: Test the validity of the causal links in the strategy diagrams
*Input: Strategy Diagrams
*Activities: Turn the causal links into a theory and test hypotheses deduced from the theory
*Outputs: Evidence demonstrating the validity of the theory behind the strategy diagrams
*Documents: Validated Strategy Diagrams

==Introduction==

''Accordingly, the process of documenting causality at the objective level requires a management team to become explicit about their understandings / beliefs about the reasons why achievement of one objective will influence another: conversely a good challenge to a Balanced Scorecard design is to test the objectives in different perspectives to see if the implied causality is plausible'' (Cobbold and Lawrie 2000b)

''&quot;In arguing that explanations proceed in terms of implicit conceptual models, this essay makes no claim that foreign policy analysts have developed any satisfactory, empirically tested theory. In this essay, the use of the term &quot;model&quot; without qualifiers should be read 'conceptual scheme.'&quot;'' (Allison 1969)

Allison also makes an important point about unproven models (not empirically tested). He calls these a conceptual scheme. All decision makers bring implicit conceptual models to the table. This does not mean that it is impossible to test these models. We argue that building a Business Intelligence system using a framing approach requires turning implicit assumptions and implicit models into explicit assumptions and explicit models. We used strategy diagrams to make implicit conceptual models explicit. Next, we propose a means to test these models using causal link maps. Proving conceptual models turns implicit conceptual schemas into explicit strategic models.

Strategy diagrams are visual representations of a firm's strategy.   They show how decision makers believe the company can manage customer outcomes in order to maximize profitability.  The key to this chapter is understanding that the three types of diagrams contain links between activities, themes or investments and that these links are an explicit representation of cause and effect relationships that constitute the strategy.  Each link represents a hypothesis.  A theory, at its core, is a set of inter-related hypotheses that explain a phenomenon.  Therefore, taken as a whole, the strategy diagram is a visual representation of a theory regarding how activities generate profitability.

Turning the diagram(s) into a theory and then testing the theory requires the following activities:

* Testing a hypothesis
* Testing a theory
* Testing the strength of a theory

An untested strategy diagram may not be useful or could be counter-productive.  That is why this is perhaps the most important step in building a strategy and therefore a Business Intelligence architecture.

==Definitions==
Before demonstrating how the strategy diagram is a theory it is necessary to present some definitions.

===Hypothesis===

''A hypothesis consists either of a suggested explanation for an observable phenomenon (observable occurrence) or of a reasoned proposal predicting a possible causal correlation among multiple phenomena (different types of observable occurrences)'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis]

Hypotheses are usually written in the &quot;if-then form&quot;: If X, then Y.  Or, X-→Y. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis See Hypotheis]) 

Each causal link in the causal link map can be considered a hypothesis.

===Theory===

There are a few acceptable definitions of a theory.  This book assumes that a theory is a group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing.[http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistry101/a/lawtheory.htm]  Some argue that a theory is ONE tested and accepted hypothesis.  However, it is just as acceptable to assume that a theory is a set of hypotheses.

A theory is an analytic structure (set of hypotheses) designed to explain a set of observations. A theory does two things:[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory#Pedagogical_definition]

# Identifies a set of distinct observations as a class of phenomena, and
# Makes assertions about the underlying reality (hypotheses) that brings about this class
A scientific theory can be thought of as a model of reality, and its statements as axioms (assumptions) of some axiomatic system.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory#Theories_as_models]

==Mechanism==
An assertion about the underlying reality regarding how X→Y.  The testing of a hypothesis is a test of the validity of the mechanism.

==Measure==
Quantitative or qualitative data about a phenomenon.  It is not possible to test underlying mechanisms.  Rather, we create measures associated with the mechanism.  For instance, it is not possible to test the correlation between two concepts.  It is only possible to test the correlation between the measures of concepts.  That is why effective measures and clean data are important.

=== Model===

This book focuses on a scientific theory of strategy represented explicitly as a model (strategy diagram).  &quot;A model in is a physical, mathematical, or logical representation of a system of entities, phenomena, or processes. In essence a model is a simplified, abstract view of any complex reality.  It may focus on particular views, enforcing the 'divide and conquer' principle for a compound problem.  Formally a model is an interpretation which deals with empirical entities, phenomena, and physical processes in a mathematical, or logical way. &quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling]

&quot;A business process is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer or customers. It often can be visualized with a flowchart as a sequence of activities.&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process]

A model is an abstract visual representation of the processes that link critical activities and resources to customer outcomes. 

==Strategic Theory==

This section demonstrates that a strategy diagram is a theory.

Again, a strategy diagram is a causal link map (theory) with hypotheses (links) that form a theory (set of hypothesis).  For instance, in the figure below, we are saying that more customers (X) leads to higher profitability (Y).  Assume that costs (C) remain constant regardless of the number of items produced or purchased (A).  Further, assume that each customer purchases the same number of items over a specific period of time (B).  The more customers (X) the more items purchased and greater revenue (R), which will generate profits when revenue exceeds costs (Y).

[[Image:Transition_Scorecard.jpg|600px|center|Scorecard]]


Summarized the point is this (purposefully simplistic):
:X→R
:IF (R&gt;C) →Y
:Assume A and B.
:→ means causes

The transition scorecard shows that the strategy map is really also a theory.  This is because any item on a strategy map can be turned into a hypothesis.  Demonstrating this will prove that the strategy map is a theory and demonstrate an important chapter activity.

==Deducing testable hypotheses==

Why is this important?  Because the strategy diagrams constitute an important part of the BI frame.  Reports allow the decision maker to understand the world by monitoring performance.  Specifically, they allow the decision maker to ask:

#What happened?: Y1 versus Y2
#What may happen?: Xf --&gt;Yf

Reports allow the decision maker to monitor performance by asking and answering these questions.  However, the ability to effectively ask and answer these questions is based on testing the links in the causal map.  For instance, the decision maker may want to know:

Using the model for monitoring performance requires knowing:
*What happened?: Y1(actual performance) versus Y2 (prediction or expectation)

However, this assumes that X--&gt;Y1.  What if Y1 (actual measure) was lower than Y2 (what we expected)?  We would assume that X was a problem and would take corrective measures.  What if X--&gt;Y1 was not only untested but false?  We would be incorrect and changes to X would not necessarily have any impact on Y1.

Similarly, using the model for prediction requires asking:
*What may happen?: Xf --&gt;Yf

What if we tried to predict Yf but in reality Xf --&gt;Yf was not only untested but false?  When we tried to predict Yf we could be wrong.

An important step in building a BI system is to make sure that the strategy is correct.  To do this requires deducing hypotheses in order to test the theory.  While we could test X--&gt;Y1 directly it is better to test as much of the theory as possible.  Not every hypothesis can and needs to be tested.

Deducing hypotheses for testing requires taking causal links.  Assume the strategy map shows X--&gt;Y--&gt;Z.  We could use the direct (X--&gt;Y) or indirect (X--&gt;Z) link to formulate a hypothesis.  Testing concepts that are closer on the maps is more fruitful but may be impractical, based on time or resource restrictions.

==Testing Hypotheses==

We will adopt hypothesis testing modified from an econometrics point of view (Gujarati 1999)

#Create a hypothesis
#*Why did it happen?: X--&gt;Y
#*How did it happen?: X1--&gt;Y2
#Collect data
#Specify the hypothesis, either in terms of a verbal or mathematical model
#Specifying the experimental or quasi-experimental model of theory or hypothesis (causal effects or mechanisms, discussed below)
#Estimating the parameters of the chosen model
#Checking for model adequacy: model specification testing
#Testing the hypothesis derived from the model

While this approach is generally more applicable to quantitative methods it does not preclude qualitative measures.  Steps 5, 6 and 7 will differ depending on the model of explanation applied to the hypothesis.  

This book presents two ways to test hypotheses.  The first is the use of causal effects.  The second is the use of causal mechanisms.  

Before going forward a very short description of the philosophy of social science is in order.  One approach to social scientific explanation is the covering-law model (Little 1991).  For our purposes this model accepts the explanation of an event or regularity when it can be subsumed under the strategic theory.  What we are trying to understand is how a phenomenon or regularity derives from general law.  However, we are not working with laws but theories, which will have to do.  

===Deductive Models and Criticisms===
One version of the covering-law model, called the deductive-nomological (D-N) model, requires us to ask: Why was the phenomenon to be explained necessary in the circumstance? (Little 1991 page 5).  This type of explanation is deductive, meaning that the outcome is necessary given the events.

D-N model of explanation (see Little 1991 page 5)

:L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (one or more universal laws)
:C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (one or more statements of background circumstances)
:____________(deductively entails)
:E (statement of the fact of regularity to be explained)

The difficulty with purely deductive models is that, for instance, they founder in the face of quantum mechanics (see George and Bennett).  It is also unlikely that such a strict definition of causality would apply to business strategy.  So, purely deductive models are not feasible.  

===Inductive Models and criticisms===

There is an inductive approach of the covering law model.  The inductive-statistical model describes a statistical explanation as consisting of one or more statistical generations, one or more statements of particular fact, and an inductive argument to the effect.  

:I-S model of explanation (see Little 1991 page 6)
:L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (one or more statistical laws)
:C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (one or more statements of background circumstances)
:==========(makes very likely)
:E (statement of the fact of regularity to be explained)

Note the difference between an inductive and deductive argument.  A deductive means that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.  An inductive argument means the truth of the premises makes the conclusion more probable but not always certain.  

What are the criticisms of the inductive models, such as the I-S or other related explanations?  Salmon argued that they put causality in a black box.  This is true.  So, purely inductive models will not work.

One way to approach the problem of explanation is focusing on the common believe that explanations share the assumption that there is an underlying mechanism by which X produces Y.  This book proposes two, mutually supporting ways to test theories related (note that many more exist) that accept mechanisms:

*Causal effects
*Causal mechanisms

===Causal Mechanisms and Causal Effects===

The approach proposed in this book to both avoid the tedious arguments surrounding causality and provide for a pragmatic, realistic approach to testing causality by focusing on causal mechanisms and causal effects.  A causal mechanism approach is similar to the deductive approach in that it attempts to use a theory to explain how X produced Y.  However, attempts to demonstrate causal mechanisms generally need to be applied to a wider range of phenomenon than are tested using methods available for studying causal mechanisms.  Causal effects, based on statistical methodologies, can help determine if the mechanism is applicable to a wider range of observations.  Using causal effects and mechanisms creates a unified methodology where the weaknesses of one are augmented by the strengths of the other.  So, a mixed approach is the preferred method.

===Why? - Causal Effects=== 

At the heart of causal effects is the correlation between two variables.  Causal effects examines data to determine if the changes in one variable are linked with changes in another variable.  

'Statistical correlation is explanatory to the extent that it provides evidence of a credible causal process underlying the variables being analyzed.' (Little 1991 page 159).  However, Little also points out that statistical correlation is not acceptable without a causal story indicating the mechanisms through which the observed correlations evolve (1991).   Correlation is not causation.  It simply demonstrates that one measure of a variable is associate with another measure of a variable, but says nothing about the mechanism by which one variable produced changes in another.

===How? - Causal Mechanisms===

Causal mechanism posit how changes in one variable produce changes in another variable.  Little defines a causal mechanism as follows:
:C is a cause of E = df there is a series of events Ci leading from C to E, and the transition form each Ci to Ci+1 is governed by one or more laws Li.

==Testing theories==
These are mutually reinforcing as a means to assure the strength of a theory.

===Competing hypotheses===

When facing alternative hypotheses consider [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis]: 

*Falsifiability -  framed in such a manner that they can be proven false
*Simplicity - (as in the application of &quot;Occam's razor&quot;, discouraging the postulation of excessive numbers of entities)
*Scope - the apparent application of the hypothesis to multiple cases of phenomena
*Fruitfulness - the prospect that a hypothesis may explain further phenomena in the future
*Conservatism - the degree of &quot;fit&quot; with existing recognized knowledge-systems

==Conclusion==

In essence a strategy diagram shows how activities and investments generate customer outcomes.  Specifically, the causal link map serves as a visual representation of how company activities effect customer outcomes and behavior.  Previous chapters demonstrate how to develop strategy diagrams.  This chapter demonstrated how a strategy diagram is a formal model of a strategy firm's strategy and how to test the strength of the underlying theory.  Testing the strength of the theory helps the company understand how executing the strategy will influence profitability, if at all.</text>

==Introduction==

Scorecard: Aligning Strategy with Operational Activities

“The Balanced Scorecard is a performance management tool.  It began as a concept for measuring whether the smaller-scale operational activities of a company are aligned with its larger-scale objectives in terms of vision and strategy. Organizations were encouraged to measure, in addition to financial outputs, those factors which influenced the financial outputs. The underlying rationale is that organizations cannot directly influence financial outcomes, as these are ‘lag ’measures, and that the use of financial measures alone to inform the strategic control of the firm is unwise. Organizations should instead also measure those areas where direct management intervention is possible. In so doing, the early versions of the Balanced Scorecard helped organizations achieve a degree of &quot;balance&quot; in selection of performance measures. In practice, early Scorecards achieved this balance by encouraging managers to select measures from three additional categories or perspectives: ‘Customer,’ ‘Internal Business Processes ’and ‘Learning and Growth.’”
-Norton and Kaplan

Understanding Business Intelligence requires, first and foremost, an understanding of the balanced scorecard as a performance management methodology. Business Intelligence is a tool for examining strategy and managing performance.  The Balanced Scorecard is a performance management tool.  They are therefore joined at the hip 

It began as a concept for measuring whether the smaller-scale operational activities of a company are aligned with its larger-scale objectives in terms of vision and strategy. Stated differently, the purpose of the scorecard is to align vision and mission to customer requirements and day-to-day work (Howard Rohm).  Scorecards also allow companies to manage and evaluate strategy.  It accomplishes this by linking strategic themes and objectives to measures of operational excellence.  In order to understand the role of the scorecard in Business Intelligence it is first necessary to discuss quantitative methodology.

==What is a scorecard?==

Cobbold and Lawrie identify key components of a 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard (2002), quoted verbatim: [ http://www.2gc.co.uk/pdf/2GC-CP-ClassBSC-090311.pdf PDF]

*''Destination Statement'': In order to make rational decisions about organizational activity and not least set targets for those activities, an enterprise should develop a clear idea about what the organization is trying to achieve (Senge 1990, Kotter 1995).  A destination statement describes, ideally in some detail, what the organization is likely to look like at an agreed future date (Olve ''et al.'' 1999 and Shulver ''et al.'' 2000).  In many cases this exercise builds on existing plans and documents - but is rarely in practice to find a pre-existing document that offers the necessary clarity and certainty to fully serve this purpose within an organization.

*''Strategic Objectives:'' The destination statement offers a clear and shared picture of an organization at some point in the future, but it does not provide a suitable focus for management attention between now and then.  What needs to be done and achieved in the medium term for the organization to &quot;reach&quot; its destination on time is agreed upon in the form of objectives or priorities.  By representing the selected objectives on a &quot;strategic linkage model&quot;, the design team is encouraged to apply &quot;systems thinking&quot; (Senge 1990; Senge et al. 1999) to identify cause-and-effect relationships between the selected objectives i.e. what do we need to do to achieve the results we expect.  This approach also helps ensure the objectives chosen are mutually supportive and represent the combined thinking of the team's high-level perception of the business model.  

*''Strategic Linkage Model and Perspectives'':  The chosen strategic objectives are spread across four zones or 'perspectives'.  The lower two perspectives contain objectives relating to the most important activities in terms of business processes, cycle time,. productive, etc.  (Internal Processes) and what needs to happen for these processes to be sustained and further developed in terms of people, product and process development (Learning &amp; Growth).  The two top perspectives house objectives relating to the desired results of the activities undertaken, i.e., how we wish external stakeholders (e.g. the general public, partner agencies and organizations to perceive us (External Relations) and how this will ultimately translate into financial results and economic value (Financial).

*''Measures and Initiatives'':  Once objectives have been agreed, measures can be identified and constructed with the intention to support management's  ability to monitor the organization's progress towards achievement of its goals (Olve et al., 1999).  Initiatives are special projects with a finite start and end date and are mapped to strategic objectives to give an indication of the projects or actions needed in order to realize the objectives (Niven 2002).</text>

* Purpose: To develop KPI's, dimensions and budgets for the reports and dashboard
* Input: Scorecard
* Activities: Identify and list the KPI's, dimensions and budgets
* Outputs: List of dimensions, facts and budgets
* Documentation: Dimensions, facts and budgets

==Introduction==
This step begins the transitions from focusing on strategy to focusing on the measures of effective strategy implementation.  The assumption going forward is that the causal link map was verified amd the strategy is sound.  The next step is to measure leading indicators (KPI's) that indicate success.  Again, assuming that X causes Y then we want to determine if the operational activities are achieving Y.  This requires extracting the measures objectives, (KPI's), budgets and initiatives from scorecards.

This chapter extracts these items for the reports and dashboard.  All these items come from the scorecard.  These items become the list of KPI's (measures), budgets and dimensions for the data mart.  It is here where we start the transition between focusing on strategy diagrams and building the tools for monitoring operation effectiveness.

==Scorecard==
Assume that the input for this stage is the following scorecard:

[[Image:Transition_Scorecard.jpg|600px|center|thumb|Figure: Transition Scorecard]]

==List of dimensions, facts and budgets==

This is how we extract the dimensions, facts and budgets from the business unit's strategy map.  Each business unit leader receives a scorecard, or a slice, from the enterprise strategy map outlining his/her objectives.  The leader then determines how to achieve the objectives by creating objectives for his/her subordinates.</text>

==Introduction==
This step requires moving from concepts (KPI's, dimensions) to measures (data).  It is difficult, if not impossible, to directly measure concepts.  How does one measure income?  Gross or net revenue?  The goal is not to find the correct measure but the most appropriate based on the theory driving the strategy.  It is therefore necessary to search databases and data warehouses for measures that approximate concepts.  The final step is to determine the lowest level of analysis in the data sources.  This completes the link between KPI's (concepts) and facts (measures).  

==Metadata directory==
Note that the ease of accomplishing this goal depends on the extent of the completeness of the metadata directory.  A metadata directory &quot;is the database that carriers all the data describing the data warehouse (Poe et al. 1997)&quot;.  It is difficult to implement because, regarding a data warehouse project, &quot;the process is the deliverable (Poe et al 1997)&quot;.  Ideally, the data architecture and metadata directory will be easily accessible.  If this is not the case finding the measures will prove much more difficult.

This stage will also require the input of the data warehouse administrator(s).  Interviewing the administer should provide knowledge of the architecture that will prove invaluable in understanding how to match concepts to measures.  

Documenting the data sources for frames requires:

* Understanding enterprise data warehouse architecture
* Obtaining data source metadata
* Matching the concepts to the appropriate database or data warehouse columns
 
==Understanding enterprise data warehouse architecture==

Identifying company data sources for measures first requires understanding the enterprise data architecture.  First, we need to identify the components of a data warehouse architecture.  These include (Poe et al. 1997):

* Data extraction from source  systems, databases, files, etc.
* Data form the source systems is integrated before being loaded into the data warehouse
* A data warehouse is a read-only database designed specifically for decision support
* Front-end tool or application used to access the data warehouse

So, an enterprise data architecture includes all the data sources used to populate the data warehouse, the structure of the data warehouse, the extraction of data from the data warehouse into data marts and how this data is then extracted and used by users or business units.

===Data warehouse architectures===

Poe et al. (1997) cover data warehouse architectures and provide example diagrams.  Drawing from their work, the first enterprise data architecture is presented in the figure showing a Data Warehouse Feeding Data Marts.  Note that the database could be any type of data source.  The goal is to identify the all data sources in the company.  This is because each data source could contain columns, in the case of a database style data store, that measure the KPI's.  These could exist in the data mart, data warehouse or database.  Note that it is much easier to extract the necessary data from a data warehouse or mart structure than from a database.

[[Image:Data_Warehouse_Feeding_Data_Mart.jpg|600px|center|thumb|Figure: Data Warehouse Feeding Data Marts]]


Another type of data warehouse architecture is presented in the figure depicting no Enterprise Data Warehouse.  This structure presents some difficulties because it is less likely that the measures and data exist outside the databases in an easily extractable structure.  This case is generally rare in large organizations.

[[Image:No_Enterprise_Data_Wharehouse.jpg|600px|center|thumb|Figure: No Enterprise Data Warehouse]]

Finally, there is the case where an integrated Database feeds a Data Warehouse.  In this case the business user or business unit both extracts the data for reporting purposes and also updates the data.  Regardless of the type of source it is important to obtain the enterprise data warehouse architecture, especially the metadata on each data source.

[[Image:Integrated_Database_Feeding_a_Data_Warehouse.jpg|600px|center|thumb|Figure: Integrated Database Feeding a Data Warehouse]]
 
==Organizing data source metadata===

Metadata is data about the data.  It provides information about:
* Data Structures
* Relationships between the data structures within or between databases

For data warehouses there are two types of metadata:
#Integration metadata shows associations between source systems and warehouse
#Transformation metadata maps data from warehouse to end users' front-end tools

Transformation metadata is important as it includes business names and hierarchies.  

==Matching concepts to database or data warehouse facts==

Finally, it is necessary to identify the database columns that closely match the concepts.  For instance, if on-time departure is the KPI that we wanted to measure, the goal is to find a sufficient measure of this concept.  An operational database or the data warehouse should have a column identifying the date and time the train was scheduled to depart versus the actual departure data and time.

[[Image:Facts.jpg|300px|center|thumb|Union Pacific Facts]]

==Matching concepts to database or data warehouse facts==

The other activity is to identify the dimensions that will be used to analyze the facts.  For instance, commodity mix is an important dimension.  Does the rate per pound of cargo differ based on the commodity mix?  What is the average rate?  Is it worth targeting a specific customer in order to increase cargo from inthat commodity mix?

*Purpose:
*Input: Scorecard, KPI's, budgets, dimensions and data sources
*Activities: Create data extraction architecture for frame
*Outputs: Diagrams and explanations of data extraction architecture
*Documentation: Data extraction and integration architecture and metadata

This step details the architecture for extracting the data from the source.  Remember that data architecture identifies data sources used to populate the data warehouse, the structure of the data warehouse, the extraction of data from the data warehouse into data marts and how this data is then extracted and used by users or business units.  Here we are building the integration metadata that shows the associations between the source systems and our data mart.

The data architecture will depend on the type and location of data sources.  In his step we will examine a few example architectures.  However, we should start with a few rules of thumb regarding the creation of the diagrams:

* Begin by identifying all data sources
* Next, one data mart for the frame must end the data architecture
* All intermediate steps should be identified, including all data stores
* The need to extract, transform and load should be identified between all data stores</text>

Data Model Defined

A data model is a collection of concepts used to describe the structure of a database. This means the data types, relationships and constraints that should hold for the data. Data models are categories as (Elmasri and Navathe 2005):

* Conceptual: provide concepts that are related to the way users understand the data
* Physical: provide concepts that describe how the data is stored in the computer
* Representational/Implementation: Concepts understood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way data is organized within the computer

This chapter focuses on creating a conceptual data model. Conceptual data models use concepts such as entities, attributes and relationships. Chen proposed the entity-relationship data model in 1976. 

Entity: Real-world object or concept
Relationship: Property of interest that further describes an entity
Attribute: An associated among two or more entities

Representation data models include the widely used relationship data model.

*Purpose:
*Input: Framework architecture and scorecards
*Activities: Diagram frame architecture (Legorreta and Valentine)
*Outputs: Frame architecture - conceptual, logical and physical
*Documents: Frame Architecture

A frame turns data into information that is useful to the decision maker.  It is therefore important to first define the terms related to data and information. 

Hierarchy of meaning: From data to events

Data has a hierarchy of subjective meaning. Through Extracting, Transforming, Loading,
Cubing, and Analyzing techniques:
*Data becomes information
*Becomes knowledge
*Becomes intelligence
*Becomes events

;Data
:Data is objective.  For instance, data on a car can be color, cost, size of the engine, etc. 

;Information
:Information is subjective as it depends on the meaning the subject gives the data. Meaning is acquired by adding structure and/or context to data. Context can be added either explicitly (metadata)or tacitly by the subject.

;Knowledge
:Knowledge is information that fits a reference frame. A reference frame is a model the subject uses to comprehend reality. Knowledge is subjective to the extent that the reference frame is unique to the subject.

;Intelligence
:Intelligence is actionable knowledge. Intelligence is subjective because different subjects will have different reasons prompting them to action even when they share many reference frames. They share the same “know-how and know-what ”frames but not the same “know-why ” frame. Hence the need for leadership to prompt a timely unified response. Intelligence creates cognitive arousal. However, intelligence need not trigger a response.

;Event
:Event is intelligence that demands a decision from the subject. What is an Event is subjective because different subjects will hold different motivations prompting them to action even when they share the same intelligence. They share the same “know-how, know-what, and know-why ”frames but not the same level of commitment.

Hence the need for leadership to prompt a timely, committed, unified response. Events may create emotional arousal in addition to cognitive arousal. When this happens we say the event is provocative. Emotional arousal may, at times, override cognitive arousal. “Do nothing ”is often an option in the menu of decision choices. Even if the event is very provocative, the subject may decide to do nothing. 
Events add up beyond a threshold of latent summation to trigger Action. The threshold of latent summation can be visualized as a bar that fills up –like when you are waiting for something on a computer; except here you will see stops, reversals, and hesitations, before the bar fills up. Action yields results, which is information regarding the apparent consequents of the action.

The information architecture identifies how data moves to events and action.  The information architecture identifies a process for adding structure to data so as to move it through the hierarchy of meaning.

ETLCZ

Information Architecture is the pattern of activities data undergoes as it flows up the BI
Frames (i.e., through the hierarchy of meaning). An Information Architecture can be depicted using letters: E,T,L,C,Z:
*E = Extracting
*T =Transforming
*L =Loading
*C =Cubing (short for “slicing and dicing ”)
*Z = Analyzing Extracting needs to include IQA

The information architecture follows some rules:
*E starts the Information Architecture (1)
*T is optional, but can occur many times (0 …)
*L is not optional and can occur many times (1 …)
*C is optional and can occur at most once preceding Z (01)
*Z ends the Information Architecture (1)

Some examples of Information Architecture: ETLZ, ETLTLCZ, and ELTCZ

ELZ, the simplest Information Architecture, is type-0 E(n-times TL)C*Z is type T-first
E(n-times LT)C*Z is type L-first

Business Intelligence Framework
*Conceptual schemas depict frames as abstractions
*Logical schemas add logical relationships between the constructs in a conceptual schema in increasing levels of detail
*Physical schemas are real-world instances of the logical schemas and include design specifications in increasing levels of detail

*Purpose: Clearly identify the objectives of the BI project.  The goals of the project must be made clear to the stakeholders.
*Input: All documentation
*Activities: Consolidate Documentation from planning stage
*Outputs: Acceptance of project charter by frame stakeholders
*Documentation: Project charter

It is assumed that a project proposal has been delivered and accepted.  The next step is to develop a project charter.   The project charter is usually a short document that refers to more detailed documents such as a new offering request or a request for proposal.  The project charter establishes the authority assigned to the project manager.  This is a project management tool used to define the scope, objectives and participants in a project.  See wikipedia section on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_charter Project Charter] or [http://www.pmhut.com/?s=%22How+to+Write+a+Project+Charter+-+Part%22].   

==Purpose==
The purpose of the project charter is to document:
 
* Reasons for Project
* Objectives and constraints
* Directions concerning the solution 
* Identities of the main stakeholders 

==Charter contents==
The charter should contain:

* Preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities
* An outlines project objectives
* Identities of the main stakeholders
* Project manager's authority
* References to important project documents

==Uses==
The three main uses of the project charter:

*To authorize the project - using a comparable format, projects can be ranked and authorized by Return on Investment. 
*Serves as the primary sales document for the project - ranking stakeholders have a 1-2 page summary to distribute, present, and keep handy for fending off other project or operations runs at project resources. 
*As a focus point throughout the project - for example: project as people walk in to team meetings and use in change control meetings to ensure tight scope management.</text>

*Purpose: this step produces a dashboard for the frame.  The dashboard serves as the central report for the frame.  In this sense the reporting system works like a hub and spoke system.  The hub is the dashboard.  Each spoke emanates from a KPI in order to provide detailed information.
*Input: KPI's, dimensions and budgets
*Activities: Create dashboard prototype
*Outputs: Dashboard prototype
*Documentation: Dashboard prototype documentation

Why Dashboard?

It is worth repeating that the purpose of businesses is to generate superior profitability over time (Porter 2000).  Companies remain profitable by engaging in activities designed at strategic positioning, meaning performing different activities from rivals' or performing similar activities in a different way.  These activities provide goods or services with greater value or at a lower cost (Porter 2000).

Decision makers must therefore focus on the activities designed to generate profits.  However, overseeing activities is not possible.  Instead, the decision maker focuses on measures of the effectiveness of activities.  Specifically, are the activities meeting the strategic or core objectives.  The metrics identified by the Chatterjee and Strategy Maps measure how effectively operational activities are meeting the strategic/core objectives.  

Finally, remember that we are assuming that the theories behind the strategy were verified by testing the links in the causal link map.  We are therefore assuming that achieving measures is an indication of effective execution that will sustain profitability.  Since we assume that X--&gt;Y then we want to monitor X.  Note that we monitor X by identifying KPI's and developing measures.

This stage assumes that KPI's are a measure of how effectively companies are executing on important activities.  Key Performance Indicators KPI ’s are financial and non-financial measures or metrics used to help an organization define and evaluate how successful it is, typically in terms of making progress towards its long-term organizational goals (see F. John Reh).  We focus on leading indicators since we want quick feedback regarding operational performance and profitability.  Decision makers should therefore focus their attention on KPI's in order to guide the business.  

The best tool for focusing on KPI's is the dashboard.  Dashboards “A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.”  This section assumes that dashboards are the most important report for decision makers to monitoring the business.  This is due to the alignment between dashboard measures, KPI's and strategic execution.  However, the most effective BI system allows the decision maker to dig deeper by look at other reports.


Example Dashboards
:Dashboard Media

There are seven items that constitute a dashboard (See Few ):
#Graphs
#Images
#Icons
#Drawing objects
#Text
#Organizers
#Command tools (buttons, sliders, etc.)</text>

*Purpose: this step requires the analysis of the dashboard to make sure it meets all criteria.  The criteria are broadly divided into form and function.  A well-formed dashboard presents data that is appealing to the eye and easily understood.  A functional dashboard allows the decision maker to evaluate strategic and operational effectiveness
*Input: Dashboard prototype
*Activities: Evaluate dashboard prototype
*Outputs: Acceptable dashboard prototype
*Documentation: Evaluation of dashboard prototype against criteria

After creating a report the next step is to evaluate its design.  A dashboard can be evaluated based on two principles:

Form 

Presenting the information in a manner that is appealing and easily understood
*Exceeding the boundaries of a single screen
*Displaying excessive detail or precision
*Choosing a deficient measure
*Choosing inappropriate display media
*Introducing meaningless variety
*Using poorly designed display media
*Encoding quantitative data inaccurately
*Arranging the data poorly
*Highlighting important data ineffectively or not at all
*Cluttering the display with useless decorations
*Misusing or overusing color
*Designing an unattractive visual display
*Supplying inadequate context for the data

Function

Functionality allows the decision make to answer What?, Why?, How? and What if?’s

* Granularity
Defined as is the ability of a system to be broken down into smaller and smaller parts. It is measured by the extent to which a larger entity is subdivided.  For example, a dollar divided into pennies has finer granularity than a dollar divided into quarter, dimes or nickels. So, a coarse system has fewer and larger components than a fine system. Similarly, a coarse-grained description of a system regards larger subcomponents than a fine-grained description, which describes smaller components.

To drill down through data is to access information at a general category and then moving through multidimensional data by moving from one level of detail to the next. Drill-down levels depend on the granularity of the data.
The purpose here is to answer the what question. What happened? Generally univariate, this type of analysis is in the domain of summary statistics. 

* Analysis
Seeks to answer the why question. We are looking for one factor (independent variable)to explain the other (dependent variable). Assume that the part was unexpected closed for two days due to an earthquake and the need to inspect all the rides. We could hypothesize that the loss of two days was the culprit. Developing hypothesis and testing them allows the decision maker to answer the why question.

* Comparison
Comparison is the act of slicing and dicing data in order to determine how the independent variable caused the dependent variable. 

* Simulation
If we know how the independent variable caused the dependent variable we can model how changes in one or more variables influences our dependent variable

Remember that reports either provide details on dashboard KPI's or verify relationships, particularly those outlined in the causal link map.  The reporting system therefore provides the decision maker with the ability to either monitor performance (operational effectiveness) or evaluate positioning and differentiation (strategy effectiveness).  This section analyzes evaluating a frame from the standpoint of joint operational and strategic effectiveness.

Monitoring KPI's determines if the company is achieving operational effectiveness.  Stated simply, it focuses on the efficient use of inputs.  If the company is operating a 

 
Analyzing Joint Operational and Strategic Effectiveness

Evaluating a frame is really about evaluating its ability to provide the decision maker with the intelligence necessary to analyze operational effectiveness (doings things right) and determining if the company is engaging in the right activities (doing the right things).  This is based on the assumption that operational effectiveness is necessary but not usually sufficient for sustained profitability.  

While companies should be operationally effective competitive strategy is about being different.  Companies must choose different sets of activities to deliver a unique mix of values.  Operational effectiveness only generates profitability if it is performing the activities that will differentiate the company from competitors.  If activities are the basic unit of competitive advantage then the right activities are the basis for profitability.

Evaluating the frame therefore is about determining if the company is engaging in the right activities.  If operational effectiveness is not delivering profitability then the company needs to rethink its strategy.  However, given that operational effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for profitability.</text>

Data Mart Definition

&quot;A data warehouse is an analytical database that is used as the foundation of a decision support system (Poe et al. 1998).&quot;  Poe et al. note that it is a commitment by the organization to ensure the appropriate data is available to the end user as needed.  It integrates appropriate data from different data database so that it is available to decision makers.

A Business Intelligence frame draws data from a subset of the data warehouse called a data mart.  A data mart is a subject-oriented or a subject-specific data warehouse (Poe et al. 1998).

This book does not go into the details of data warehouse administration.  The goal is to make the analyst an informed consumer of data mart and data warehouse structures.  It is assumed that the databases to create a data mart but a data warehouses does not exist.  This book takes the reader through the process of making their first data mart.  Creating the data mart will also serve to create the data warehouse. The reader will then go on to create a data warehouse in future chapters.</text>

*Purpose: to determine if users accept the frame
*Input: BI Frame
*Activities: Decision makers test and accept prototype
*Outputs: Completed BI System
*Documentation: User acceptance of BI Frame


The final stage of building a BI frame is to gain stakeholder acceptance.  This includes individuals from all parts of the business, from the IT department to the business unit.  It also requires each aspect of the BI Frame architecture and infrastructure withstand scrutiny.  It also requires discussion of how to maintain and update the frame.

A frame is never complete.  It is always possible to improve or update a frame.  Changes in the organization or environment may require strategy changes and this requires updating the architecture.  Technology that can enhance the infrastructure and improve the ability of decision makers to monitor the business and make strategic changes should be implement.  For this reason the initial frame acceptance does not signal the end of building the BI system but rather the beginning.

The frame consists of the architecture, infrastructure and documentation.  Once the frame is submitted to the users the completion of the project comes when they accept the production BI frame.  The frame must also meet the policies and rules of the IT department.

Stakeholders

* Decision makers
* Data mart administrator
* Data warehouse administrator</text>

|name = Acorn mush
|ingredients=
* Two cups raw acorns (from white oak or black oak trees)
* Water
|procedure=
#Shell the acorns and remove the skins.
#Grind the acorns into a fine flour with a mortar and pestle.
#Place the acorn flour in a cheesecloth, place the cheese cloth in a kitchen strainer, and run water through it repeatedly.  This step is crucial as it removes the extremely bitter tannin from the flour.
#Taste the flour.  If it is still bitter, run more water through it.
#Combine the flour with twice that amount of water in a large pot.
#Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for five minutes
#Serve

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Radish stew''' dates back to at least the 4th century when a recipe appeared in the Roman cookery book Cnecht. It is a simple and inexpensive dish, and is said to calm an upset stomach.

==Ingredients==
* 1/4 pound [[Cookbook:Radish|red radish]], cut in 1-inch strips, or about 5 to 6 slices
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], cut in 1-inch chunks
* 4 to 6 [[Cookbook:green onion|green onion]]s, sliced
* 1 1/2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 1 teaspoon dried leaf [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* 1/4 cup dry [[Cookbook:Wine|white wine]]
* 3 pounds non-red radish, cut in 1-inch chunks (red, yellow, or variety)
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken Broth|chicken broth]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:pepper#black pepper|pepper]]
* sweet ground [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]] (optional)

==Procedure==
#In a large [[Cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]] or [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]], cook the radish until crisp. 
#Add onions and cook until they soften somewhat, about 4 or 5 minutes. 
#Sprinkle flour over the onions, add bay leaves and thyme; increase the heat to high. 
#Pour in wine and stir to loosen brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until wine has evaporated.
#Add non-red radishes, broth, and pepper. Cover and bring to a [[Cookbook:boil|boil]]. 
#Reduce heat to medium low and simmer until radishes are tender, about 45 to 60 minutes. 
#Sprinkle with paprika, if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings. 
#Remove bay leaves before serving.
Serves 3 to 4.

The purpose of this page is to help suggest some possible test cases you should be running for different types of things one might test.
=Purpose=
The purpose of this page is to get QA engineers thinking out of the box when it comes to testing different permutations of data.  This site does not tell you how the system you are testing should react to this data, but is just a suggestion of the type of data you should try to use for testing.  Please feel free to add your own permutations to this site.
=Data Types=
==String==
*Min- (1 less character than the allowable minimum)
*Min (minimum allowable # of characters)
*Max (maximum allowable # of characters)
*Max+ (1 more character than the allowable maximum)
*Null (&quot;null&quot;)
*Empty (&quot;&quot;)
*Space (&quot; &quot;)
*Leading Spaces (&quot;   abc&quot;)

*Extended characters (èü)
*International characters (asian, bi-directional)

==Integer==
*Min- (1 less than the allowable minimum #)
*Min (minimum allowable #)
*Max (maximum allowable #)
*Max+ (1 more character than the allowable maximum --if you are allowed any size Integer, then you may want to test with a bigger data type)
*Null (&quot;null&quot;)
*Empty (&quot;&quot;)
*Space (&quot; &quot;)
*Leading Spaces (&quot;   123&quot;)
*Trailing Spaces (&quot;123   &quot;)

*Leading with Zeros (&quot;000123&quot;)
*Trailing with Zeros (&quot;123000&quot;)

==Double/Float==
*Min- (1 less than the allowable minimum #)
*Min (minimum allowable #)
*Max (maximum allowable #)
*Max+ (1 more character than the allowable maximum --if you are allowed any size double/float, then you may want to test with a bigger data type)
*Null (&quot;null&quot;)
*Empty (&quot;&quot;)
*Space (&quot; &quot;)
*Leading Spaces (&quot;   123.84&quot;)
*Trailing Spaces (&quot;123.08   &quot;)

*Special characters in the middle (&quot;123.94-456&quot;)
*Leading with Zeros (&quot;000123.5700&quot;)
*Trailing with Zeros 
**With #'s after decimal (&quot;123000.3400&quot;)
**Without #'s after decimal (&quot;123000.0000&quot;)
*Localization
**Comma verses decimal (10,000 verses 10.000)
*Characters that represent Floating or Doubles
**Float (10.00F, 10.00f)
**Double (10.00D, 10.00d)

==Objects==
*Null
*Valid Object
*Object that can be cast to the correct type of object 
**Example:  API takes object Cat, I should pass in object Animal
***Foo ([CAT]Animal)
**Example:  Api takes object Animal, I should pass in object Cat since it inherited from Animal
***Foo2 (Cat)

==Dates==
*Test All Months
*Test all days of the week
*Test the first date of each month

== Author Reflection ==

I am very happy that I had the opportunity to write my article on the Chapter FAQ's of classroom practice, law and diversity. I learned a great deal from this chapter, including information on technology integration, magnet and charter schools, vouchers, homeschooling, and the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act. I am a great advocate for integrating technology in the classroom, as I believe students (as well as myself) learn better and maintain a higher focus when computers and other programs are used. I am a hands-on learner, and I remember specific times during my elementary and middle school years where computer programs helped to reinforce subject matter. For example, in second or third grade science class we learned the parts of a flower. It was helpful to see and &quot;build&quot; a visual picture of a flower on the computer. This made the lesson fun, exciting and challenging. Writing this article also helped to expand my knowledge on magnet and charter schools. I knew only a few details about each before conducting my research, and I now feel that I can easily compare and contrast these schools. I personally have not attended either type of school, but I see the benefits of each and respect any parent who chooses to send their child to one. I learned a great deal about vouchers, the controversy surrounding them, and the supporting and opposing arguments. I am an advocate for vouchers, as I believe all parents, regardless of their socioeconomic status, should be given the opportunity for their child to receive a better education. A close friend of mine was greatly blessed with a voucher, and was able to send her child to the private school of their dreams. However, I do understand the opposing arguments for vouchers, and hope that one day a resolution will be made. 

Homeschooling was an interesting topic to research. I was never homeschooled but I have many friends that were. After reading the pros and cons, I think homeschooling is a good choice for some parents, but it is not for everyone. Homeschoolers experience many benefits, but if you do not have the time and finances to invest, it is better to send your child to a public (or private) school. Researching the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) allowed me to review its standards and the controversy surrounding the act. I am glad the NCLB was implemented and I truly believe it will improve education for all children. After conducting all of my research, I was not left with any questions and I feel that I have a strong handle on all chapter material. I included a basic summary of each main subject in the chapter, along with some frequently asked questions of each. My sources were mostly scholarly, as there provided the most accurate information. As I mentioned above, I am glad I chose this chapter to write on, and I feel I will retain much of this information throughout my college career.

I really liked the graphics in this article.  I think it gave a clear overview of important topics.  I think the section about homeschooling was interesting but I know that in Chesapeake children have the opportunity to be involved with sports at the public school.  I'm not sure how it is in other cities in Hampton Roads however.  The voucher section was interesting and I'm glad you were able to briefly sum up the important issues in this chapter so effectively.  If anything, I would have liked to read a little bit more about the NCLB act.  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:08, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

I enjoyed this article because it gave a clear understanding of things I have heard about but didn't fully understand what they meant. Vouchers are a heated topic; however, I think these are so controversial because they deal with money and politics. I think they are good but can be abused. I would like to see guidelines set to clear up the mess they are in. No Child Left Behind (NCLB), is a good idea but like the vouchers they need some ironing out. I believe it was an excellent idea, but no foolproof. Technology is excellent to use in the classroom because it allows the students to interact in a way that wasn't present 10 years ago. It also allows additional resources (internet) and introduces new concepts and ideas. I believe the more children are exposed to technology the more tech savy they will become. This is excellent because one day these students will have jobs that more than likely require basic technology skills. Since technology is ever changing these vital skills of use will help them transition to better technology than they use today.[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 00:28, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

This article was helpful because it gave clear definitions of words and phrases I did not know the meanings or differences to. Thanks for helping make the differences of terms clear and concise, because it helped me understand what the differences really are. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 16:50, 19 July 2009 (UTC)


This article was great and answered a lot of questions that are involved with education today.  The article was very well written with great graphics!  I liked the section on homeschooling, there are many people who do not understand that concept.  I also liked the section on technology, that is a part of the push in NCLB to ensure that our students will be engaged.  I thought the article answered many of the questions about vouchers, that will continue to be debated throughout the country.

How convenient... I actually had this already in my article. It's almost if I planned that all along. Yes, I am a cheater.

I don’t see the harm in trying new things with our education system. There’s obviously no way to please everyone, and what’s most important is the best interests of the students. There’s definite room for improvement in public schools in virtually every conceivable area. There’s the inkling that if the federal government gets more involved that things will just get worse, but they’re certainly didn’t get any better in my scholastic lifetime in the state’s hands. I think James Beane has an interesting approach– the concept of doing away with standardization entirely and approaching teaching from a much more interactive and personal experience level. However, I do not think we are ready for that much of a leap of faith. Give it another fifty years or so, when schools become obsolete and we simply have interactive transmitted educational discussions broadcast into our homes via holograms. But I would like to see more room for creativity to flourish in the classroom. With technology integration, curricula are destined to go through some extreme changes and focus mainly on developing a student’s concrete skills.

I think the issue of a National Curriculum is an interesting one.  I think your article raises some intersting points, and I like how there is plenty of humor in it as well.  One arguement against it is creativity and freedom could be limited, but isn't it already limited because of the SOL's..etc.  It certainly would make it easier for a student to catch up when moving to another state in the middle of the year.  Although there are plenty of arguements for and against, I think you argued both very well.  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 01:57, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

I am really glad I chose to read your article and I found it very interesting and well-written.  After reading about the proponents and adversaries of a National Curriculum, I realized that for me this is a difficult issue to take sides on. However, I am more of an adversary than an opponent. I understand what the proponents believe that set academic standards shape what is taught to students and how teachers teach. I also understand that they believe a national curriculum should enable students to experience and practice democracy. On the other hand, I think I agree with the adversaries that education decisions should be left up to the state and local school boards. With a nationalized curriculum, would students and teachers be given any educational freedom? Most likely the answer is no. Although I don’t plan on homeschooling my children, I know many families that do and they would be greatly affected. My hope would be that one day a compromise can be made, but until then I will have to support the education freedom that I believe students deserve.

I absolutely loved your article...I especially liked the sidebar you used in the beginning from Charles West...it was great that you gave both the pros and cons. It made it very easy to see both sides of the coin. I can understand both sides of the argument, however, I too feel that a nationalized curriculum will take creativity and freedom away from teachers and students alike. I think we need to study other successful countries and their curriculums before making any serious committments.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 03:39, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for showing the pros and cons to a national curriculum. They were both quite informative and makes it show how tough it is to decide which curriculum to go with, national, or school or state. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 16:19, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I believe the federal government has more important issues to be concerned with than developing a national education curriculum.  I am a proponent of smaller government.  The local and state governments are in a much better position to decide what is best for their constituents.  I also believe that states should have the ability to focus on issues and topics that are important to them.

== Author Reflection ==



Following my research and submission of this article I was delighted to observe and spend a great deal of time in a third grade classroom.  I observed an instructor who fell clear into the Interventionist model.  After much research it was interesting to actually observe this model in action. Originally, I had an adverse opinion toward the &quot;Interventionist&quot; without giving them the benefit of the doubt. I viewed it as old school and too harsh.  Yet,  I'm' incredibly forgiving  which places me at a bias complete opposite this perspective.   Believe it or not this specific third grade class responded well to this style.  They had a clear understanding of the rules and were well behaved.  My imagery of a strict, grey classroom was disputed. The students received tokens for abiding by the rules or when they were &quot;caught being good.&quot;  These tokens could be redeemed for prizes or extra computer time at the end of class.  Students who disobeyed regardless of who they were had minutes subtracted from recess.  I observed how being assertive was effective rather than harmful.  Would this have been my chosen model? ....not necessarily.  However, this instructor and I varied greatly.  She did what she believed was best for her class and appeared successful.  Being paired with an instructor opposite of myself was extremely beneficial it provided balance to my &quot;Non-Interventionist&quot; style and gave insight to what I was lacking.  As stated in my article, one must assess the climate of his or her own classroom and create a balance between the models  to achieve an environment where both the instructor and students can thrive.[[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 05:09, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

I found your article to be very interesting and to the point. You explained the differences between interventionist, non-interventionist, and interactionalist quite well. After doing my observations, I can definately see what category the teachers that I observed fall into. After reading this article, I would like to think of myself as having of little of each type of category. In my opinion, it all comes down to what the situation calls for. As a teacher, one must learn to pick their battles so to speak and not adress every little infraction as being the ultimate, unforgivable action that deserves severe consequences. I really liked how you broke down Proactive...it made more sense. Great job with font, choice of words, and punctuation. The questions were not hard to answer and were easy to find in the article. Kudos![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:49, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I really liked the way that you presented the information in this article.  The study of classroom management is so important for future tachers.  We have all had good and bad experiences in each of these teaching styles.  I think that maybe there can be a balance of both.  The Be Proactive will be something that I will use in my classroom!  You did a great job with the layout and the questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Quantum Mechanics]] describes systems on a microscopic level where classical mechanics no longer apply. One of the main features of quantum mechanics  is the fact that the energy levels of physical systems are quantisized, meaning that when energy enters or leaves a system (a molecule, for example) this happens only in discrete amounts, a 'quantum' of enery.

For example, the energy of any given photon is &lt;math&gt; E = h \cdot v&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:Planck's Constant|Planck's Constant]] = &lt;math&gt;6,626 \cdot 10^-{34}{} \rm{Js}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the lightwave. Plancks constant is an experimentally determined quantity.

For isolated, microscopic systems the relative difference between energy levels may be significant, while macroscopic (large-scale) systems have miniscule differences between neighbouring energy levels. For macroscopic systems, the quantization of energy will therefore not by obvious, and the laws of classical mechanics apply very well. It can be said that quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics at the macroscopic level.

In contrast to classical mechanics, quantum mechanics do not lead to expressions for the exact position and velocity of the particles being considered. A particles behaviour is instead described by a mathematical function that gives a probability distribution for the values of postion, energy and other properties that the particle/system posesses.

'''At a quantum mechanic level, the behaviour of particles is stochastic.'''

As a given particle, for  example an electron, can not be localized exactly from theory (it can be investigated experimentally, but it will not be possible to predict exactly what the result will be in each case), it is common to consider the particle as a ''delocalized phenomenon'', or a ''wave'' in space. It is common to say that particles on a quantum mechanic level, 'have wave nature' or 'behave like waves'.  

Because of this, the mathematical function that describes a particle is often called the '''wave function''' for the particle.

It may be neccesary to consider and treat a phenomenon '''both''' as both a particle and a wave. For example, light has properties that both implies that it consists of waves (diffraction, for example) '''and''' properties that implies that light it of particles (as in the [[w:photoelectric effect|photoelectric effect]]).

'''Key points:''' 

*In the macroscopic world, objects can be treated as particles or clusters thereof with clearly defined and measurable locations and velocities. 
*At a sufficiently microscopic level, particles must be considered quantum-mechanically as 'waves'.
*In general, a quantum mechanical particle has theoretically unclear position and velocities which can be considered only by way of a probability distribution
*The probability ditribution arises from a mathematical function called the '''wave function''' that describes the particle, and from which probabilities for the desired properties can be computed.
*Objects can have both particle and wave properties to varying extent

===The wavelength of objects - De Broglie's wavelength===

By combining Planck's equation
&lt;math&gt; E = h \cdot v&lt;/math&gt;
and Einstein's famous equation
&lt;math&gt; E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt;
the french scientist [[w:Louis de Broglie|Louis de Broglie]] constructed the following expression for the '''wavelength of a particle''':
&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{mu} = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;
where h, again, is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle and u is the speed of the particle. On the rightmost side, the expression is written using p for the '''moment''' of the particle, where p = mu.

Example: An electron with a speed of &lt;math&gt;10^6 m/s&lt;/math&gt; and mass &lt;math&gt;9,11 \cdot 10^-31 kg&lt;/math&gt; has the wavelength
&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{mu} = \frac{6,626 \cdot 10^-34 \rm{Js}}{9,11 \cdot 10^-31 \rm{kg} \cdot 10^6 \rm{m/s}} = 7,27 \cdot 10^-10 \rm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

The result is of the same order of magnitude as the size of a small molecule, and the wave nature of the electron will therefore be of significance when considering such systems. A macroscopic object with mass 5 g travelling at a speed of 1 m/s will by contrast have a wavelength of about &lt;math&gt;10^-31&lt;/math&gt; m . Such a small wavelength for such a large object can not be measured experimentally, and the conclusion is that the macroscopic object has a negligible amount of 'wave nature' - it is fully adequate to describe it using classical mechanics.

In general: Quantum mechanics is used when the De Broglie-wavelength of a particle under consideration is abput equal to or greater than the '''characteristic size''' of the system. 

The term '''characteristic size''' does not have an exact definition, but is related to the object of interest we are considering. For example, for the electron in the example, the de Broglie wavelenth was compared to the characteristic size of a small molecule with which the electron might be interacting. For the macroscopic particle, the characteristic wavelenth considered was the size of the particle itself (which was not declared, but which about reasonable assumptions can be made considering the mass of the particle).


===Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation===
One of the most important results of quantum mechanics is '''Heisenbergs' uncertainty principle''': To every quantum-mechanical quantity, there corresponds a complementary quantity. Two complementary quantities can never be determined completely precisely and simultanenously.

The best known example of this principle, is the uncertainty relation between the two quantities (a quantity being anything that can be measured) ''position'' and ''momentum'':

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \Delta x \ge \frac{h}{4 \pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is '''Planck's reduced constant''' &lt;math&gt; \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; represtents the uncertainty in the position of the particle along the x axsis, while &lt;math&gt;\delta p&lt;/math&gt; represents the uncertainty in the moment of intertia of the  particle along the same axis.

The uncertainty principle has a more general definition, on the same general form as the expression over, which requires some additional mathematics to be considered.  Another '''specific''' example is the following relation, similar to the one above:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, E  is the total energy of the system and t is time.

===The Schrödinger Equation===
As previously stated, when a particle is considered as a wave, the particle's behaviour can be described by a mathematical function. A ''wave function''
&lt;math&gt;
\psi  = \psi (x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt; is a function of position and time that describes such a particle.

The '''Schrödinger equation''' is a a differential equation with wave functions as solutions. If we constrain ourselves to x and t as variables, working in one space dimension only, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}} =  - \frac{{{\hbar}^2 }}{{2m}}\frac{{\partial ^2 \psi }}{{\partial x^2 }} + V(x)\psi 
&lt;/math&gt;

where V(x) is the potential enery of the particle at the point x (the potential is assumed to not change with time). i is the imaginary unit, &lt;math&gt;
\sqrt { - 1}&lt;/math&gt;, so the Schrödinger equation is a complex equation.

'''Justification:'''

If we c onsider a wave (an electromagnetic wave, for example) with amplitued &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; that moves along the x-axis with the speed c, the wave can be described with the following ''wave equation'':

&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 \psi }}{{\partial x^2 }} = \frac{1}{{c^2 }}\frac{{\partial ^2 \psi }}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\psi (x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of the wave in the point x at time t.

A general solution of this equation can be written in complex form as:

&lt;math&gt;\psi (x,t) = Ce^{i2\pi (x/\lambda  - vt)}  = Ce^{i2\pi x/\lambda } e^{ - i2\pi vt} &lt;/math&gt;
where C is a constant. If we replace &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the wavelength, with &lt;math&gt;\frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;, from the de Broglie relation, and v with &lt;math&gt;\frac{E}{h}&lt;/math&gt; we get

&lt;math&gt;\psi (x,t) = Ce^{i2\pi xp/h} e^{ - i2\pi E/h} (*)&lt;/math&gt;
Derivation with respect to t gives

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{{\partial t}}\psi (x,t) =  - \frac{{i2\pi E}}{h}Ce^{i2\pi xp/h} e^{ - i2\pi E/h}  =  - \frac{{i2\pi E}}{h}\psi (x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

we can now write
&lt;math&gt;- \frac{h}{{2\pi i}}\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}} = E\psi (**)&lt;/math&gt;

Derivating (*) with respect to x we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{{\partial x}}\psi (x,t) = \frac{{i2\pi p}}{h}Ce^{i2\pi xp/h} e^{ - i2\pi E/h}  = \frac{{i2\pi p}}{h}\psi (x,t) (***)&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

&lt;math&gt;\frac{h}{{2\pi i}}\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial x}} = p\psi &lt;/math&gt;

The total energy of the system equals the sum of kinetic and potential energy

&lt;math&gt;E = E_k  + E_p  = \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}} + E_p (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(E_k  = \frac{1}{2}mu^2 ,\,p = mu\, \to E_k  = \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}})&lt;/math&gt;

Vi insert the expression for the enery into (**):

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{h}{{2\pi i}}\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}} = \left[ {\frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}} + E_p (x)} \right]\psi  = \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}}\psi  + E_p \psi (****)&lt;/math&gt;

We now define the ''operator'' \[

&lt;math&gt;\hat H = \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}} + E_p (x)&lt;/math&gt;

From (***) we can extract the momentum operator:

&lt;math&gt;\hat p = \frac{h}{{2\pi i}}\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial x}}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; into (****), we have:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 \psi }}{{\partial x^2 }} = \frac{{i^2 4\pi ^2 p^2 }}{{h^2 }}\psi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}} =  - \frac{{i2\pi E}}{h}\psi &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
 \hat H\psi  = \left[ { - \frac{{h^2 }}{{8\pi ^2 m}}\frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial x^2 }} + E_p (x)} \right]\psi  =  - \frac{{h^2 }}{{8\pi ^2 m}}\frac{{i^2 4\pi ^2 p^2 }}{{h^2 }} + (E - \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}})\left[ { - \frac{{h^2 }}{{8\pi ^2 m}}\frac{{i^2 4\pi ^2 p^2 }}{{h^2 }} + (E - \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}})} \right]\psi  \\ 
 \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}}\psi  + E\psi  - \frac{{p^2 }}{{2m}}\psi  = E\psi  =  - \frac{h}{{2\pi i}}\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}} \\ 
 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the ''one-dimensional, time-dependent'' Schrödinger equation.

In three dimensions, we replace &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{{\partial x}}&lt;/math&gt; with the Laplace operator

&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2  = \frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial x^2 }} + \frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial y^2 }} + \frac{{\partial ^2 }}{{\partial z^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;
And define the '''Hamilton operator''' &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;\hat H =  - \frac{\hbar}{{2m}}\nabla ^2  + E_p &lt;/math&gt;

We then get the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in three dimensions:

&lt;math&gt;\hat H\psi  =  - \frac{\hbar}{i}\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}} = i\hbar\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;

In a less compact form, the equation can be written as

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\nabla ^2 \psi  + E_p \psi  = ih\frac{{\partial \psi }}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;

The set of solutions &lt;math&gt;\psi  = \psi (x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt; of this equation describes possible states for a particle.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is a seprable differential equaion in space and time, and a general equation can be written as a product of two functions, one function in space and another in time:

&lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,y,z,t) = \psi (x,y,z,)\phi (t) = \psi (x,y,z,)e^{ - iEt/{\hbar}} &lt;/math&gt;

Note: Even though the wave function varies with time, the ''square'' of the absolute value of the wave function does not:

&lt;math&gt;\left| {\Psi (\overrightarrow r ,t)} \right|^2  = \Psi ^* \Psi  = \psi ^* e^{ - iEt/h} \psi e^{iEt/h}  = \psi ^* \psi  = \left| {\psi (\overrightarrow r )} \right|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

====Separation of the Schrödinger equation====

The (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation, which can be separated into two ordinary differential equations, one in time and one in space. The ''time-independent'' Schrödinger equation which is the ordinary differential equation which deals with position only:

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt; - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\nabla ^2 \psi  + E_p \psi  = E\psi &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Or more succintly

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat H\psi  = E\psi \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\psi  = \psi (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The time-independent Schrödinger equation gives an ''infinite number of solutions'' with distinct values of E. The solutions are ''eigenfunctions'' of the Hamilton operator &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt;, and E is the corresponding ''eigenvalue''. The solutions of the differential equation depend on the value of m and the potential V(x) and can be difficult or indeed impossible to solve for analytically.

In comparison, the solutions to the differential equation in time are much simpler. They are all of the form

&lt;math&gt;\phi (t) = e^{ - iEt/h} &lt;/math&gt;

The general solution of the time-''dependent'' Schrödinger equation is a ''linear combination'' of separable olutions. There is one wave equation for each allowed value of the energy E.

&lt;math&gt;\Psi _1 (\overrightarrow r ,t) = \psi _1 e^{ - iE_1 t/h} ,\Psi _2 (\overrightarrow r ,t) = \psi _1 e^{ - iE_2 t/\hbar} ...&lt;/math&gt;

Every linear combination of solutions is itself a solution. We can therefore write a general solution as

&lt;math&gt;\Psi (\overrightarrow r ,t) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {c_n } \psi _n (\overrightarrow r )e^{ - iE_n t/\hbar} &lt;/math&gt;

''All'' solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation can be written on this form.

Example: A general type of problem might be (constraining ourselves to one space dimension): Given a potential V(x) and the value &lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,0)&lt;/math&gt; of the wave function over all space at time 0, find &lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

: Strategy: First, solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation. This gives an infinite number of solutions each with distinct values for E. The initial value criteria can be fulfilled by selecting suitable coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; for

&lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,0) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {c_n } \psi _n (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the constructed by multiplyin with the characteristic time-dependent exponential factor for each term.

&lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,t) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {c_n } \psi _n (x)e^{ - iE_n t/h}  = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {c_n } \Psi _n (x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

====Solution of the Schrödinger equation by separation of variables====

We want to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in space (here, x) and time (t).

&lt;math&gt;\hat H\Psi  = ih\frac{{\partial \Psi }}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, writing out in full:

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\frac{{\partial ^2 \Psi }}{{\partial x^2 }} + V(x)\Psi  = ih\frac{{\partial \Psi }}{{\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume that &lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,t)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the product &lt;math&gt;\Psi (x,t) = \psi (x) \cdot \phi (t)&lt;/math&gt;

We then get

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\psi ^{''} (x)\phi (t) + V(x)\psi \phi  = ih\psi \phi ^'&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing on both sides by &lt;math&gt;\psi \phi&lt;/math&gt; gives

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\frac{{\psi ^{''} }}{\psi } + V(x) = ih\frac{{\phi ^' }}{\phi } = E&lt;/math&gt;
Both sides of the equation equal each other, but they depend on separate, independent variables. Therefore both sides must be constant, and equal to a ''separation constant'' which here is given the name E.

The differential equation for the variable x becomes:

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\frac{{\partial ^2 \psi }}{{\partial x^2 }} + (V - E)\psi  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The potential V(x) must be specified before this equation can be solved.

The equation in the variable t becomes

&lt;math&gt;ih\frac{{\partial \phi }}{{\partial t}} - E\phi  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial \phi }}{\phi } = \frac{E}{{ih}}\partial t \to \frac{{\partial \phi }}{\phi } =  - \frac{{iE}}{h}\partial t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int {\frac{{\partial \phi }}{\phi }}  = \int { - \frac{{iE}}{h}\partial t}  \to \ln \phi  =  - \frac{{iE}}{h}t + C&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\phi  = e^{ - \frac{{iE}}{h}t + C}  = e^{ - \frac{{iE}}{h}t} e^C  = Ce^{ - \frac{{iE}}{h}t} &lt;/math&gt;

Absorbing the constant C into the solution of the equation in x, we get


&lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline {\Psi (x,t) = \psi (x)\phi (t) = \psi (x)e^{ - \frac{{iE}}{h}t} }}&lt;/math&gt;

===Postulates and principles===

Some important postulates and principles of quantum mechanics are as follows:

Postulate: Every ''observable'' can be represented by a ''linear operator''

:Example: Kinetic energy can be represented with the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat E_k  =  - \frac{{h^2 }}{{2m}}\nabla ^2 &lt;/math&gt;

An operator &lt;math&gt;\hat o&lt;/math&gt; is linear if &lt;math&gt;\hat o(a\psi  + b\varphi ) = a\hat o\psi  + b\hat o\varphi &lt;/math&gt;

Theorem: If two operators commute, every eigenfunction of one of the operators will also be an eigenfunction of the other operator.

:Two operators ''commute'' if &lt;math&gt;\hat o_1 \hat o_2 \psi  = \hat o_2 \hat o_1 \psi &lt;/math&gt;

The commutator of two operators is defined as:

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left[ {\hat o_1 ,\hat o_2 } \right] = \hat o_1 \hat o_2  - \hat o_2 \hat o_1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Two operators commute if and only if their commutator is zero.

Probability distribution, interpretation of the wave function:

The value of the expression 
&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi ^* \psi \,dx\,dy\,dz = \left| \psi  \right|^2 d\tau &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
is proportional to the probability of finding the particle described by &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; in the volume element &lt;math&gt;d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Restrictions on wave functions:
*The wave function must not go towards infinity over any area
*The wave function must have only one value for every point in space
*The wave function must be continueous, and its second derivative must be defined everywhere.
*The wave function must be quadratically integrable over its area of definition
*If &lt;math&gt;\psi ^* \psi d\tau&lt;/math&gt; is to give the actual probability of finding the particle in &lt;math&gt;d\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the wave function must be normalized. That is:

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int {\int {\int {\psi ^* \psi d\tau \,} } }  = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Expectation values:'''

Postulate: The expectation value &lt;F&gt; for a physical observable can be calculated from the following expression

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt; F &gt; \, = \int {\psi ^* } \hat F\psi \,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is assumed that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is normalized. If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenfunction of &lt;math&gt;\hat F&lt;/math&gt;, with eigenvalue f, the eienvalue f is equal to the expectation value &lt;F&gt;.

Hermitean operators:

Observable quantities must be ''real'' (in the mathematical sense, contain no imaginary component). Therefore

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;F&gt; = &lt;F&gt;^*&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This means that the corresponding operator &lt;math&gt;\hat F&lt;/math&gt; must be ''hermitean''. For the operator to be hermitean, the following must be true:

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int {\psi _1^* } \left[ {\hat F\psi _2 } \right]d\tau  = \int {\left[ {\hat F\psi _1 } \right]} ^* \psi _2 \,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Properties of hermitean operators:
*The eigenvalues of an hermitean operator are always ''real''.
*The eigenfunctions that belong to distinct eigenvalues of an hermitean operator are always orthogonal.

:Example: The Hamilton operator is hermitean and corresponds to an observable energy. If &lt;math&gt;\psi _1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi _2&lt;/math&gt; correspond to different energies, it follows that they are orthogonal.

'''All observable quantities are represented by hermitean operators'''

Orthogonality:

That two wavefunctions &lt;math&gt;\psi _1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi _2&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal means that

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int {\psi _1^* } \psi _2 \,d\tau  = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Degeneration: 
When two eigenfunctions share a common eigenvalue, that eigenvalue is degenerate. Example:

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat F\psi _1  = f\psi _1 \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\hat F\psi _2  = f\psi _2 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here, the eigenvalue f is two-degenerate.

If two eigenfunctions share the same eigenvalue, any linear combination of the two is also an eigenfunction. Example:

&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat H(c_1 \psi _1  + c_2 \psi _2 ) = E(c_1 \psi _1  + c_2 \psi _2 )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</text>

      <comment>/* Changing the Separator Character */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
When you submit data to a web service you want to change the way that parameters are encoded.

== Method ==

== Changing the Separator Character ==
By default the separator character is a semicolon. You can change it to be an ampersand by adding the following attribute to the submission element:

   separator=&quot;&amp;amp;amp;&quot;

Note that the ampersand must be escaped.

(09 MAR 2009 the default was changed to ampersand in the official xsd-file)

== Changing the URL encoding Parameter ==

You can also change the way that special characters are encoded by using the encoding attribute.

The options are any of the character encoding systems such as:

encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;

encoding=&quot;UTF-16&quot;

== Discussion ==

The number of players: 4 to 116 persons

Necessities: a[[ tennis ]]ball, stone

People come in two groups for which one individual is selected as a leader. One group stands in specified place of where seven stones are piled up in order to aim stones with tennis ball. The second group is waiting to see if the throwing ball doesn’t strike the stone, they change their position with that group immediately.

But if the throwing ball strikes the stones, they should pick up the ball in order to pitch members of the first group with aiming and passing the ball.

If the ball pitches, they are sent out of the games.

At the end each group which gains 7 point will become a winner.

Hints: We play this game in another mood than the above mentioned. This game is played in a big circle. There is a smaller circle which is a place for putting seven stones in that one. All players are out of that circle. After colliding ball with the stones and pour them, one of the members of the second group chases all first group in the circle in order to hit them with hands and become an obstacle for piling stones up and whenever he/she is tired, the subsequent person undertakes the following responsibility. 


The effect of this game :

This game is team work so it causes to provide social and natural maturity of child and they get acquainted with the speed of using reactions such as leadership, cooperation and victory…

The Scoop From Someone Who Knows

By Jill Newhart-Fortner

Learning Target

Students will be able to identify the definition of profession.

Students will be able to identify examples of characteristics of education professionals.

Given the definition of an expert, the students will be able to recognize the qualification of the administrator.

Students should be able to compare the positive and negative views on education as a profession


Background of Topic

The term profession is defined in Webster's Dictionary as &quot;a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation.&quot; (profession, 2009) Students understand that at the end of their college career the end goal will be their desired profession. If becoming an educator is that goal, there are characteristics that educators must possess. Many educators feel that teaching is a calling and there is a reason why they have the urge to teach. In a hearing before the United States House Committee on Education and Labor a teacher, Valdine McLean, from Lovelock, Nevada reiterated this point; “Aspiring teachers rarely go into teaching for the money.” (Representatives, 2007, p. 22)

In a lecture given by Professor Seth Lerer at Stanford University, he describes the exploration of education and literature and compares the view of some people in society when they describe teaching. Lerer gives many examples of characteristics that teachers should adapt in their profession using literature to describe teachers.

Dr. Lerer Lecture about Teaching. 
Professor Lerer proposed that there are stereotypes of teachers. These stereotypes describe the adage that &quot;those who can't teach.&quot; (Lerer, 2003) This quote actually is adapted by a film by Woodie Allen called Annie Hall in 1977. The quote was &quot;those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, teach gym.&quot; (Allen, 1977) This describes how some people in society view teachers and is the main reason why it is necessary for educators to be positive role models, continue to pursue further training, and use themselves as the examples that educators are professional.


Introduction of the Expert

Barbara Fortner is an experienced teacher and is currently a principal at Sparrow Road Intermediate in Chesapeake, VA. She completed her Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education from Longwood College (now University) in May, 1988. Barbara received an early contract to teach in Chesapeake through the career commitment program and began her employment with Chesapeake Public Schools in August, 1988. In May, 1994 she received her Master of Arts in Urban Education and Administration from Norfolk State University. After teaching for 11 years (3rd and 4th grades), Barbara was appointed to Assistant Principal of Deep Creek Central Elementary where she worked for 8 years. This is her 2nd year as Principal of Sparrow Road Intermediate. Based on her knowledge and educational experience, she would be considered an expert in education. Sparrow Road Intermediate Website

Interview

Give your thoughts why someone would discount education as a profession.

For as long as I can remember, education has always been given a bad rap. In the capitalistic world in which we live, money is viewed as the key to success and unfortunately those looking to get ahead financially look to higher paying jobs to climb that ladder. As a result, many do not enter the field of education. Ignorant people assume that because the salary is not enticing that those interested in the field must be lower achievers. Ironically, it is the educators that help mold and shape the individuals into the successful professionals that they are.

What do you think makes an educator more credible as a professional?

True teachers, like preachers, are called to the profession. They are teachers because they want to make a difference ~ shaping and preparing individuals ~ for the future! For the very same reason as I stated above, educators are not in the field for the money. They truly want to help students grow academically, socially and emotionally so that they may become productive citizens and lifelong learners. In this day and time, they are needed more than ever and represent more than just a student’s teacher. They are a counselor, nurse, police officer, friend, pseudo-parent, encourager, supporter just to name a few.

What has been your experience going from a teacher to an administrator? Has that changed your perspective on education?

As an administrator, I have become the instructional leader and manager of the school and have less direct personal contact with students. That is the hardest transition for me. I miss that connection with “my” students! I miss the impact that I made as a teacher but know that I am creating an instructional environment conducive for learning and I am helping 500 students rather than just 20 while leading 100 staff members to continue to strive for success while giving their best. Seeing the bigger picture from administration has changed my perspective on education a bit. The paperwork and politics can blur anyone’s vision; but watching the students learn and share their enlightenments reminds me every day of our purpose, educating all of the children of all of the people, and that keeps me focused.

How would you encourage future students to choose education as a profession?

As I stated earlier, education is a work of heart! Teachers are born, not made! It is my hope that we continue to hire exceptional teachers who will leave a mark not just on students’ minds but on their hearts. They will touch, figuratively speaking, students in such a way that they will want to be able to share those same experiences with the next generation. It is truly that simple. Thirty six years ago, one such teacher did just that and changed my life forever!

Commentary

The expert has provided many insights that are in keeping with the idea that educators are not viewed or valued for the level of education they possess. It is important to note that Principal Fortner pointed out that academic preparation is a part of the characteristics that make educators professional. She described that there was an understanding that educators also needed to aid students emotionally and socially. The inclusive education that students receive in college understands that necessity to prepare students as a whole and not only academically. In the curriculum for teacher preparation it is required that a teacher receives instruction in child development to better understand the emotional and physical changes that are occurring in growing students. (College of Arts &amp; Letters: Teacher Prep, 2009) Consequently, there must be the consideration that there are also environmental factors that contribute to the role of educators. Students that have the greatest need are often grouped together in areas of poverty and low-income. A teacher may continually have to deal with lack of parent participation, unstable home environments and other important factors that contribute to security and will have an effect on their students.

According to the No Child Left Behind Act, there are requirements for schools that have high percentages of low-income students that receive Federal assistance designated as Title I. The law ensures that all teachers in those schools are highly qualified, have to pass a rigorous State Assessment and must use some of the funds that they receive from the government to provide professional development to teachers, principals and other staff members. (Bush, 2006, p. 11) The expert has also pointed out the discrepancy in the pay for educators in comparison to other professionals have contributed to negative connotations about teaching. In that aspect it is difficult to understand why the academic preparation of a teacher could be any less rewarded than the academic preparation of an engineer.

The establishment of teaching as a profession relies heavily on the definition of academic preparation. Many schools are using the term accreditation when describing their curriculum. According to an article in the Journal of Teacher Education, &quot;Each accrediting body sets rigorous standards for its profession and holds the school it accredits accountable for meeting these rigorous standards.&quot; (Wise, 2005; vol 56:, p. 320) It is necessary to associate the &quot;rigorous standards&quot; to include the education and training that is given to educators. If educators must receive their education and training from an accredited school and meet the requirements adapted by that school to receive their degree, they have completed the rigorous training and are professional educators. Even though the degree has been earned, there are other factors that prevent educators from being viewed as professionals. The enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (Bush, 2006)set forth new criteria for teachers. It not only required teachers to hold at least a bachelor's degree, it also required teachers to be licensed or certified by the State and pass a rigorous State test on subject knowledge and teaching skills. (Bush, 2006)

Although there have been some negative connotations to the NCLB law, there has been positive reform when it comes to the recognition that teachers should meet stringent criteria. There was a requirement in the NCLB law that challenged each state to have all teachers meet the criteria by 2005-2006 school year. According to a hearing in U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, that deadline has been extended based on the failure of all states to meet the criteria. (Representatives, 2007, p. 2) States have guidelines for teacher licensure, as well as guidelines for licensure for other occupations. Professional licensure gives merit to the educational and testing requirements that are mandatory for many professions. Educational professionals can gain the acceptance and distinction of those professions by adhering to the standards of licensure set forth by their state.

State of Virginia Routes to Teacher Licensure. 


Educators are professionals, they meet the definition in every way. The interview with the expert again referred to teaching as a calling, which was the term in the definition of profession. It takes extensive academic preparation and specialized knowledge to be a professional educator. Those standards are the reason that other professionals have received the foundations they have acquired to succeed in their fields. Public opinion needs to be re-evaluated to include the requirements that were enacted with NCLB. The more that society understands the intensive training and continued commitment to education that is demonstrated by teachers every day; the easier it will be for educators to be respected and viewed as professionals.


IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE AUTHOR REVIEWED THEIR ARTICLE BEFORE SUBMITTING, AS I FOUND NO GRAMMAR OR MECHANICAL ERRORS. GREAT JOB!

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. THE LEARNING TARGETS WERE SPECIFIC AND CORRESPONDED WITH THE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS.
&lt;li&gt;. THE ARTICLE CAPTURED MY ATTENTION FROM BEGINNING TO END AND HELD NO GRAMMATICAL ERRORS. GREAT JOB!

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. THE SIDEBAR COULD INCLUDE A QUOTE OR INTERESTING PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD MOTIVATE THE READER. 
&lt;li&gt;. THE ANSWERS TO THE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE LISTED UNDER THE QUESTIONS. 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

== Education as a Profession ==

'''&lt;big&gt;The Scoop From Someone Who Knows&lt;/big&gt;'''

By Jill Newhart-Fortner

'''&lt;u&gt;Learning Target&lt;/u&gt;'''

''Students will be able to identify the definition of &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; &quot;profession&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;''

''Students will be able to identify examples of characteristics of education professionals.''

''Given the definition of an expert, the students will be able to recognize the qualification of the administrator.''

''Students should be able to compare the positive and negative views on education as a profession''


'''&lt;u&gt;Background of Topic&lt;/u&gt;'''

The term &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; &quot;profession&quot; &lt;/font&gt; is defined in Webster's Dictionary as''',''' &quot;a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation.&quot; ('''p'''rofession, 2009) Students understand that at the end of their college career the end goal will be their desired profession. If becoming an educator is that goal, there are characteristics that educators must possess. Many educators feel that teaching is a calling and there is a reason why they have the urge to teach.  In a hearing before the United States House Committee on Education and Labor a teacher, Valdine McLean,  from Lovelock, Nevada reiterated this point; âAspiring teachers rarely go into teaching for the money.â (Representatives, 2007, p. 22)

In a lecture given by Professor Seth Lerer at Stanford University, he describes the exploration of education and literature and compares the view of some people in society when they describe teaching. Lerer gives many examples of characteristics that teachers should adapt in their profession using literature to describe teachers. &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCC7F7;border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;[http://ctl.stanford.edu/AWT/Lerer_03.html Dr. Lerer Lecture about Teaching]. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Professor Lerer proposed that there are stereotypes of teachers. These stereotypes describe the adage that &quot;those who can't teach.&quot; (Lerer, 2003) This quote actually is adapted by a film by Woodie Allen called Annie Hall in 1977. The quote was''',''' &quot;those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, teach gym.&quot; (Allen, 1977) This describes how some people in society view teachers and is the main reason why it is necessary for educators to be positive role models, continue to pursue further training, and use themselves as the examples that educators are professional.





'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction of the Expert&lt;/u&gt;'''

Barbara Fortner is an experienced teacher and is currently a principal at Sparrow Road Intermediate in Chesapeake, VA. She completed her Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education from Longwood College (now University) in May, 1988.  Barbara received an early contract to teach in Chesapeake through the career commitment program and began her employment with Chesapeake Public Schools in August, 1988.  In May, 1994 she received her Master of Arts in Urban Education and Administration from Norfolk State University.  After teaching for 11 years (3rd and 4th grades), Barbara was appointed to Assistant Principal of Deep Creek Central Elementary where she worked for 8 years.  This is her 2nd year as Principal of Sparrow Road Intermediate.  Based on her knowledge and educational experience, she would be considered an expert in education.

'''&lt;u&gt;Interview&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''Give your thoughts why someone would discount education as a profession.'''

For as long as I can remember, education has always been given a bad rap.  In the capitalistic world in which we live, money is viewed as the key to success and unfortunately those looking to get ahead financially look to higher paying jobs to climb that ladder.  As a result, many do not enter the field of education.   Ignorant people assume that because the salary is not enticing that those interested in the field must be lower achievers.  Ironically, it is the educators that help mold and shape the individuals into the successful professionals that they are.

'''What do you think makes an educator more credible as a professional?'''

True teachers, like preachers, are called to the profession.  They are teachers because they want to make a difference ~ shaping and preparing individuals ~ for the future!   For the very same reason as I stated above, educators are not in the field for the money.  They truly want to help students grow academically, socially and emotionally so that they may become productive citizens and lifelong learners.  In this day and time, they are needed more than ever and represent more than just a studentâs teacher.  They are a counselor, nurse, police officer, friend, pseudo-parent, encourager, supporter just to name a few.  

'''What has been your experience going from a teacher to an administrator?  Has that changed your perspective on education?''' 

As an administrator, I have become the instructional leader and manager of the school and have less direct personal contact with students.  That is the hardest transition for me.  I miss that connection with âmyâ students!  I miss the impact that I made as a teacher but know that I am creating an instructional environment conducive for learning and I am helping 500 students rather than just 20 while leading 100 staff members to continue to strive for success while giving their best.
Seeing the bigger picture from administration has changed my perspective on education a bit.  The paperwork and politics can blur anyoneâs vision; but watching the students learn and share their enlightenments reminds me every day of our purpose, educating all of the children of all of the people, and that keeps me focused.

'''How would you encourage future students to choose education as a profession?'''

As I stated earlier, education is a work of heart!  Teachers are born, not made!  It is my hope that we continue to hire exceptional teachers who will leave a mark not just on studentsâ minds but on their hearts.   They will touch, figuratively speaking, students in such a way that they will want to be able to share those same experiences with the next generation.  It is truly that simple.  Thirty six years ago, one such teacher did just that and changed my life forever!
 
&lt;u&gt;Commentary&lt;/u&gt;

The expert has provided many insights that '''are in keeping with''' the idea that educators are not viewed or valued for the level of education they possess.  It is important to note that Principal Fortner pointed out that academic preparation is a part of the characteristics that make educators professional.  She described that there was an understanding that educators also '''needed''' to aid students emotionally and socially.   The inclusive education that students receive in college '''understands''' that necessity to prepare students as a whole and not only academically.  In the curriculum for teacher preparation it is required that a teacher receives instruction in child development to better understand the emotional and physical changes that '''are occurring''' in growing students. (College of Arts &amp; Letters: Teacher Prep, 2009) '''?''' Consequently, there must be the consideration that there are also environmental factors that contribute to the role of educators.  Students that have the greatest need are often grouped together in areas of poverty and low-income.  A teacher may continually have to deal with lack of parent participation, unstable home environments and other important factors that contribute to security and will have an effect on their students.  

According to the No Child Left Behind Act, there are requirements for schools that have high percentages of low-income students that receive Federal assistance designated as Title I. The law ensures that all teachers in those schools are highly qualified, have to pass a rigorous State Assessment and must use some of the funds that they receive from the government to provide professional development to teachers, principals and other staff members. (Bush, 2006, p. 11)  The expert has also pointed out the discrepancy in the pay for educators in comparison to other professionals have contributed to negative connotations about teaching.  In that aspect it is difficult to understand why the academic preparation of a teacher could be any less rewarded than the academic preparation of an engineer.  

The establishment of teaching as a profession relies heavily on the definition of academic preparation. Many schools are using the term '''(appostrophes)'''accreditation when describing their curriculum. According to an article in the Journal of Teacher Education, &quot;Each accrediting body sets rigorous standards for its profession and holds the school it accredits accountable for meeting these rigorous standards.&quot; (Wise, 2005; vol 56:, p. 320) It is necessary to associate the &quot;rigorous standards&quot; to include the education and training that is given to educators. If educators must receive their education and training from an accredited school and meet the requirements adapted by that school to receive their degree, they have completed the rigorous training and are professional educators. Even though the degree has been earned, there are other factors that prevent educators from being viewed as professionals. The enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act '''(Bush, 2006)set''' forth new criteria for teachers. It not only required teachers to hold at least a bachelor's degree, it also required teachers to be licensed or certified by the '''S'''tate and pass a rigorous '''S'''tate test on subject knowledge and teaching skills'''. (Bush, 2006)''' '''(IN ALL OF THESE IN-PARAGRAPH CITATIONS THE PERIOD SHOULD GO LAST.)'''

Although there have been some negative connotations to the NCLB law, there has been positive reform when it comes to the recognition that teachers should meet stringent criteria. There was a requirement in the NCLB law that challenged each state to have all teachers meet the criteria by 2005-2006 school year. According to a hearing in U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, that deadline has been extended based on the failure of all states to meet the criteria. (Representatives, 2007, p. 2) States have guidelines for teacher licensure, as well as guidelines for licensure for other occupations. Professional licensure gives merit to the educational and testing requirements that are mandatory for many professions. Educational professionals can gain the acceptance and distinction of those professions by adhering to the standards of licensure set forth by their state.  &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCC7F7;border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;[http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/newvdoe/licroute.pdf State of Virginia Routes to Teacher Licensure]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





Educators are professionals, they meet the definition in every way.  The interview with the expert again referred to teaching as a calling, which was the term in the definition of profession.  It takes extensive academic preparation and specialized knowledge to be a professional educator.  Those standards are the reason that other professionals have received the foundations they have acquired to succeed in their fields.  Public opinion needs to be re-evaluated to include the requirements that were enacted with NCLB.  The more that society understands the intensive training and continued commitment to education that is demonstrated by teachers every day''';''' the easier it will be for educators to be respected and viewed as professionals.

'''Comment:  I thought the question and answer section was too easy.  Question 2 has more than once answer.  Question 3 is too easy.  Question 4 isn't really reasoning, I think it is an opinion question.  There are many ways society views educators as professionals. '''

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article '''4''' for importance because...The article has lots of good information retrieved from sources.  Information was applicable to today's schools.  Good overview and info.  

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article '''3''' on interest because...Visuals are plain, sidebars are both links.  A picture or chart would have made it much more interesting to read.  Interview section was really short.  
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article '''4''' for credibility because...Sources are good but a few formatting errors.  Variety of sources.  


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article '''2''' on writing because... Some spelling and gramatical errors.  Learning objectives and multiple choices need work.
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold

&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Mostly based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals are included but have minimal effect'''
&lt;li&gt;'''One interesting or new perspective is presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented.''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Good information in article.  
&lt;li&gt;  Good sources.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Longer interview
&lt;li&gt;  Stronger learning objectives and multiple choice questions
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?
The feedback on the questions was most effective.  I realized that I needed to go back and totally re-do the learning targets and the questions.

I am not sure if you saw that there were some problems with the APA citations in the body of the work.  I am not well versed in that citation either and the other peer reviewer caught them, so there were some errors that were missed in this review.</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?
I found the grammar, citation and questions feedback very effective and I incorporated those suggestions into my edit.

I found the grading of the writing to be too strict and in comparison to the other reviewer a bit hard to understand the score, especially with very few grammatical errors.</text>

By Jennifer Leonard

'''Learning Targets'''

The student will be able to:

a)	Gain an understanding of and define inclusion

b)	Describe how inclusion can be used in a classroom

c)	Determine who is affected; is everyone pro inclusion?

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;



== Introduction ==

&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

It is the middle of June and the popular kids from school decide they are all going to Busch Gardens and Water Country USA. They planned their trip very well and had an excellent day riding roller coasters and playing in the water park. Their trip sounded like a lot of fun, but Megan spent her whole day sitting by the sprinkler in her back yard. She was not invited and was therefore excluded from the fun day the other kids had planned. 

Defined by Colleen Tomko from Kids Together Incorporated, inclusion is âbeing part of what everyone else is; being welcomed and embraced as a member who belongsâ (Tomko, 1996). When the popular kids went to Busch Gardens and Water Country USA, they did not include Megan. This exclusion most likely made Megan feel left out or depressed. Kids Together Inc. has determined that âfeelings of loneliness and alienation can have a negative impact in all areas of lifeâ and that âinclusion should focus on maximizing a personâs overall quality of lifeâ (Tomko, 1996).

== Inclusion in the Classroom ==

After gaining an understanding of the term inclusion, one may ask how this can be used in a classroom. âIn special education literature, inclusion refers to providing services to special education students with a regular classroom setting to the extent possible rather than pulling them out for remediation in a special classroom settingâ (Clark &amp; Breman, 2009). In other words, including those with special needs in regular, age-appropriate, classrooms with their peers. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #66FF33;
border: solid 2px #000099; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
'''''Inclusion is âbeing part of what everyone else is; being welcomed and embraced as a member who belongsâ'' (Tomko, 1996).'''&lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Historical background, provided by Issues about Change, a quarterly produced magazine from Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), dates back to the early 1800s. âResidential institutions, or asylums, began to emerge in order to accommodate those with hearing, visual, mental, or emotional impairmentsâ (Thompkins &amp; Deloney, 1995). Prior to the 1800s, there was not any form of education for those students with special needs or disabilities. In the mid-1990âs, parents of the disabled students began expressing their concerns about what was to become of the education and overall lives of their children. 

The result of these actions led to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. Under this act, âall children, regardless of disability, had the right to a free, appropriate education in the least restrictive environment.â This Act was updated in 1991 by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA (Thompkins &amp; Deloney, 1995). âFurthermore, a recent legislation, the NCLB Act of 2001, which is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, also provides the legal foundation for schools to improve educational outcomes for all studentsâ (Clark &amp; Breman, 2009). Below you can see some statistical information on the percentage of children with disabilities included in regular classrooms and how the percentages have changed throughout the years. Keep in mind that these numbers are forever changing: âthere has been an increase of students identified with disabilities and an estimated 6.6 million children who receive special education services in 2004 under federal law, which is up from 3.7 million in 1977â (Clark &amp; Breman, 2009).

'''&lt;center&gt;PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS (aged 6-21) WITH DISABILITIES IN REGULAR CLASSROOMS'''	
			
School Year-----80%in Reg-----79-40%in Reg----- &lt; than 40%in Reg-----Not in Reg

1994-1995----------44.5%--------------28.7%---------------22.4%---------------4.3%

1998-1999----------46.1-----------------29.8------------------29.8------------------4.1

2001-2002----------48.4-----------------28.3------------------19.2------------------4.0

2003-2004----------49.9-----------------27.7------------------18.5------------------3.9

''Source: Adapted from Table 27-1 in National Center for Education Statistics, the Condition of Education 2005 (Washington, DC: U.S. Printing Office, 2005), p 172)(Spring 2008)	''			

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Inclusion does not only consist of preparing the special education students for regular classes, but also preparing regular classes for students with disabilities. According to Dr. Watnick and Dr. Sacks, âmodification of the classroom environment must be done so that all students can receive the maximum education services.â They claim that âa successful inclusive service delivery model should expose all special education students to age-appropriate curricula as well as provides more natural social interaction with general education peersâ (Watnick &amp; Sacks, 2006). As a result, it is also hoped that âthe bias against children with disabilities will decrease due to their interaction with other students their ageâ (Spring, 2008).

== Is everyone for Inclusion in the classrooms? ==

Is inclusion really beneficial for all students in the classroom? Inclusion has been a conflicting topic in education since the laws for those qualifying for special education began to develop in the 1800s. Many educators and parents want students with disabilities to have the best and most un-restrictive education possible; while some fear it may affect the way the other students learn. 

In 1994, the president of the Florida Education Associated United publically spoke out about his beliefs of how âinclusion leaves classroom teachers without the resources, training, and other supports necessary to teach students with disabilities in their classrooms.â As a result, âthe disabled children are not getting the appropriate, specialized attention and care, and regular studentsâ education is disrupted constantly&quot; (Thompkins &amp; Deloney, 1995).

That very same year, a poll was conducted by the American Federations of Teachers in West Virginia. The poll revealed that 78 percent of the respondents thought that disabled students would not benefit from inclusion and 87 percent said other students would not benefit either (Leo, 1994). With these percentages, one can see why inclusion remains a conflicting topic in our education today.

== Conclusion ==
After researching inclusion, it is clear that there is not just one way to look at this situation in education. Teachers, parents, and government agencies all look at inclusion through different eyes and standards. It is not an âI like itâ or âI hate itâ scenario, but a starting point towards further advancement in education of the disabled and regular academic leveled students. As with any policy, there are conflicting theories that can yield society for or against something, but with inclusion it is different. Almost all can agree that no one wants the special education students to be institutionalized, but at the same time, not everyone wants them in regular academic classes with their non-disabled peers. The policy of inclusion will continue to be argued while researchers gather the statistics needs to prove or disprove its accuracy. Until it is proven, attempts will continue to âhelp teach all children team work and how to interrelate and function together with others of different abilitiesâ (Tomko, 1996).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I decided to change the section titled, ''Ineffective types of communication''. I made this change because communication is such a broad definition that I felt as if people needed a summary of what it is, so maybe they could fix their ineffective types of communication. I believe that it was the perfect place to put a introduction paragraph because it flowed right into the other paragraphs that students had left already.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I made revisions to the SMASH group section about the struggle of technological advancements. SMASH is a very popular video game among the youth and Nintendo technology continues to make newer versions because it is so popular. Advancements take time but they are created, especially with the Nintendo Corporation. If the SMASH club continues its run, there will be a newer version of SMASH that is released sometime in the next five years. Although the majority of SMASH club members prefer the original version, technological advancements will capture their interest and the interest of other gamers. This will hopefully convince more people to join the club.</text>

Can you imagine a school sponsored by NIKE or maybe Levi Straus?  Would you be apprehensive about sending your son or daughter to a school that promotes specific products?  What if that same school had the highest test scores in the state and the highest percentage of graduates going on to college?  The very idea that our children could be subjected to commercial product endorsement as early as kindergarten may be of concern, but so too is the idea that our children are failing to rise academically in the global arena (Zeiger, 2004) (KJ, 2008).

==Introduction==
[[w:for-profit school|For-profit schools]] claim they can better manage the school system and are more equipped to run the financial side of educating our youth.  Those who agree with this premise believe it is the combination of forces in business, competition and profit, which will produce the exceptional education that people in the U.S. desire (Symonds, Palmer, Lindorff, McCann, &quot;For-Profit&quot;, 2000).


In today’s economic times, many people are concerned about the future.  With the collapse of mortgage companies, banks, and insurance giants; coupled with rising fuel prices that make basic operating costs of schools difficult, many are struggling to obtain funding for the [[w:public school|public school]] system (KJ, 2008). 


This financial question has caused many [[w:public school|public school]] systems to search for means of change from a seemingly unlikely source: the corporate world.  Whether it is handing management of the schools over to a corporations, or merely seeking sponsored products and supplies, schools are looking to the business world (Keen, 2006).  


In a search for a solution to this growing problems of public education; states, cites, and parents have considered many alternative answers, from [[w:school voucher|school vouchers]], [[w:Charter schools|charter schools]], [[w:magnet school|magnet schools]], etc.  This search has yielded a myriad of possibilities that are being attempted throughout the country today.  Within these options is the alternative of outsourcing [[w:public school|public schools]] to varying degrees to private businesses that may open up a wide array of educational choices.  This alternative of corporate involvement was used by the city of Philadelphia, when in 2002, they turned over management of forty-two of their schools in an attempt to improve their school system (Steinberg, 2002).


----

== For-Profit Schools ==


A simple explanation of a [[w:for-profit school|for-profit school]] is any school that operates in terms of making money.  


Every decade seems to have its push for reform, and beginning in the early 1990s the idea of privately run [[w:public school|public schools]] come to the forefront.  This outsource of management of public schools to the private business sector are the educational management organizations (EMOs) (Molnar, Miron, Urschel, 2008).  These EMOs began in the early 1990s with the likes of the [[w:Edison Schools|Edison Schools]].  An EMO, as defined by Molner, Miron, and Urschel in their report on [[w:for-profit school|for-profit schools]], is, “an organization or firm that manages schools that receive public funds, including district and charter public schools. A contract details the terms under which executive authority to run one or more schools is given to an EMO in return for a commitment to produce measurable outcomes within a given time frame” (2008, p. 3).


The premise behind these [[w:for-profit school|for-profit schools]] is varied.  Some feel that these schools are better able to respond to change and have the finances to provide it.  Some also believe that the [[w:for-profit school|for-profit schools]] offer an opportunity to increase competition in both teaching approach and curriculum (Lips, 2000).  Yet others believe that it is a natural expansion of the free market system and a “competitive market is the most effective and efficient way to make schools accountable and to determine the success or failure of a
school” (Lips, 2000, p. 8).


In a typical EMO, the corporation is initially burdened by large start-up costs and entrenched teacher’ unions, but they are also free of some regulations that allow greater latitude for designing the school and its curriculum (Lips, 2000).


When considering [[w:for-profit school|for-profit schools]], one has to also look at those operating in the college and trade school market venues.  These include the likes of DeVry, ITT, and University of Phoenix to name but a few.  These [[w:for-profit school|for-profit]] institutions have attempted to fill a niche for career training and have been able, in the past to create considerable profit for their investors with a 460% stock increase during the years of 2000-2003 (Brown, 2004).

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&quot;Innovations&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Obstacles&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New or varied curriculums designed to improve student performance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Huge capital costs: Unlike [[w:Public schools|public schools]], must pay for their own buildings&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Longer school days and school years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Political opposition from the education Establishment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most don't have teachers' unions, but offer merit pay and stock options&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Far fewer ''frills,'' such as extracurricular activities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Less spending on administrative and central-office expenses&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fewer programs for severely disabled/special-education students&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More parental involvement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More difficulty attracting experienced teachers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Freedom from traditional school bureaucracy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Huge startup costs mean most companies are losing money&quot;  (Symonds, Palmer, Lindorff, McCann, &quot;Primer&quot;, 2008)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



----

==Corporate Sponsorship of Schools==

Corporate sponsorship, on the other hand, takes many forms in the school system.  Corporations are involved in the full management of schools (EMOs), but also involve themselves in many other lesser forms.  These involvements are seen in schools selling naming rights to locker rooms as in the case in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (Keen, 2006).  In order to increase their revenue and be able to better afford the costs of educating children, they renamed their gym for the sum of $45,000 (Keen, 2006).

&lt;table border=&quot;4&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FDD017;
border: solid 10px #E56717; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; [http://www.channelone.com/| Channel One News] &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



Other schools have followed suit and done similar things.  


**In Newburyport, Massachusetts the school collected from $5,000-$100,000 for the renaming of several buildings (Keen, 2006).
**An insurance company paid $650,000 for the ability to name two athletic field houses after their company (Keen, 2006).


Corporation sponsorship also takes the form of materials used in the classrooms, such as, pamphlets and books that are funded by businesses.  Businesses further sponsor school activities by providing uniforms for sporting activities, backing the “Book-it” program, and the program [[w:Channel One News|Channel One]] that is offered to schools (&quot;Corporate-Sponsored&quot;, 1998).  


In the case of the [[w:Channel One News|Channel One]] program, viewing participation of schools allots them the benefit of free visual media players (&quot;Corporate-Sponsored&quot;, 1998).  


In some school lunchrooms, corporations aid schools by providing students the availability to purchase Subway, Pizza Hut, or Arby’s for lunch at their own school (&quot;Corporate-Sponsored&quot;, 1998).


&lt;table border=&quot;4&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FDD017;
border: solid 10px #E56717; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Pros&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Cons&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Increased revenue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Commercialism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Longer school days and school years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Students subjected to advertising campaigns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Larger budgets for school activities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Objectivity clouded&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Still maintain [[w:Public school|public school]] status&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;




----

==Results==
Of the six largest [[w:for-profit school|for-profit]] organizations operating in 2000, none of them were making a profit, (Symonds, Palmer, Lindorff, McCann, &quot;The Business&quot;, 2000).


Harvard study found that between 2002 and 2006, Philadelphia EMOs had a 10-8 percentage point increase over the other public and district run schools operating in the same area. (Garland, 2007)


Many [[w:for-profit school|for-profit schools]] remain unregulated and in the state of California, it is the responsibility of the student to assure accreditation, until full disclosure laws become enacted (Fensterwald, 2008).


A slight yearly increase in the number of EMOs, approximately 2 additional EMOs in 2007, and student enrollment, approximately 25,000 students, has been seen. (Molnar, 2008, p. 7-10)

==Suggestions==


The debate over the extent or even involvement of private corporations in the school system stems from a concern over influence and goals. Since corporations are by nature indebted to their stockholders, where do their loyalties lie when running a school? This is the concern that motivated the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS, 1999) to advise a focus on these eight steps to maintain the integrity of education where corporations are involved:
**•	&quot;Corporate involvement shall not require students to observe, listen to, or read commercial advertising. 
**•	Selling or providing access to a captive audience in the classroom for commercial purposes is exploitation and a violation of the public trust. 
**•	Since school property and time are publicly funded, selling or providing free access to advertising on school property involves ethical and legal issues that must be addressed. 
**•	Corporate involvement must support the goal and objectives of the schools. [[w:Curriculum|Curriculum]] and instruction are within the purview of educators. 
**•	Programs of corporate involvement must be structured to meet an identified education need, not a commercial motive, and must be evaluated for educational effectiveness by the school district on an ongoing basis. 
**•	Schools and educators should hold sponsored and donated materials to the same standards used for the selection and purchase of [[w:Curriculum|curriculum]] materials. 
**•	Corporate involvement programs should not limit the discretion of schools and teachers in the use of sponsored materials. 
**•	Sponsor recognition and corporate logos should be for identification rather than commercial purposes.&quot;(NCSS, 1999)

==Conclusion==

We all want the ability to have and offer the best possible education for our youth and ourselves.  Though there may be debate as to how to achieve this, [[w:for-profit school|for-profit schools]] and corporate sponsorship of schools is an option to attempt to achieve our full potential as an educated country.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''For-Profit Schools and Corporate Sponsorships'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Brian Smith&lt;/center&gt;


== Learning Strategies ==
*Define for-profit schools.
*Define educational management organizations (EMOs).
*List the possible pros and cons of for-profit schools.


== What are for-profit schools? ==
There are two types of for-profit schools. The first kind is one that operates as a business and attempts to make a profit from its operation. The second kind is called an educational management organization or EMO. An EMO contracts with school districts and charter schools to operate public schools; most for-profit schools operate as EMOs. The biggest difference between the two types is that EMOs usually manage schools receiving public funds (NSPCE). Edison Learning is one of the largest educational management organization in the United States, serving close to three hundred thousand students in twenty four states (edisonlearning.com).


== How do EMOs operate? ==
Typically an educational management organization will contract with a public school to operate one or more schools with a history of under performance or an inability to make steady progress. They partner with a number of schools that have been designated by their states as, &quot;in need of improvement&quot; (Education Innovator). Many of the schools operate in low-income areas. EMOs manage schools under a contract in which the EMO exercises full administrative control over the school. The principal and teachers are EMO employees, and decisions about curriculum and instructional practice are made by the EMO (Plank). In exchange for the freedom to self-govern these schools are expected to deliver a higher level of achievement than the public schools provide (Weiss). 



== Edison Schools ==
Edison schools work closely with its partners to implement a comprehensive, research-based school design with an unrelenting focus on achievement. It features a reading and math skill-building program developed to help all students meet or exceed proficiency. Edison schools divide schools into smaller groups or academies, provide interactive professional development for teachers and staff, and integrate various technologies to support the program. One of the hallmarks of Edison schools is an online benchmarking system in which students are assessed on a monthly basis. The assessments provide an objective, standards based measure of student performance (Education Innovator). Edison schools provide more instruction than the typical public school. Students attend school for an additional hour (8) each day and twenty more days a year (200). Additionally, every Edison student above second grade gets free use of a home computer (Greenwald).


== What do advocates of for-profit schools and EMOs say? ==
Advocates of for-profit schools and EMOs make three arguments:

1. Why should profits be acceptable in some parts of the educational system and not in others?
*They contend that many activities in the educational system have always been run by private firms such as textbook production and standardized testing.

2. Why should we exclude for-profit firms from providing educational services?
*They contend the pursuit of profits serves our society well in many ways. We rely on profits to finance our retirement and to provide most of the goods and services that we consume, including food, housing, and health care.

3. If private firms, motivated by profit, can enhance organizational efficiency and do a better job educating our children, why not let them try?
*The public sector has failed to provide a satisfactory standard for large numbers of children, especially poor and minority children in urban areas (Plank).

Proponents also claim that business models will benefit students, because financial success depends on providing a quality education. Schools must improve to compete for students (NSCPE. Competition, driven by the profit motive, can deliver the quality education many parents are looking for (Symonds). If test scores drop, parents complain, or teachers quit the company stands to lose its contract (Pollard).


== Possible Advantages ==
*Greater Efficiency- Schools have incentive to be efficient and eliminate unnecessary expenses. 
*Increased Competition- To gain fees and attract students, schools are encouraged to offer successful programs and produce successful results.
*Responsive to Customers- Each school must adapt to the needs and desires of its students.
*Encourage Innovation- Schools benefit from offering new products, which induces them to experiment (NSCPE).


== Possible Disadvantages ==
*Lack of Knowledge- A proven blueprint does not exist; therefore, management can make costly errors.
*Misguided Focus- The fundamental purpose of school is to educate, not to make money; school functions may conflict with making profits. 
*Eliminated Services- Schools may minimize or eliminate school services readily available in public schools, because of costs. 
*Large Added Costs- Unique costs, such as marketing and promotion, may drain instructional resources (NSCPE).


== Are they working? ==
The two basic goals of for-profit schools and EMOs are to make money from the educational services that they provide and to provide academic achievement to students. These corporations have struggled to show profits (NCSPE). If an when they turn a profit it will be a relatively small one. The profit margin for EMOs hovers at around seven percent (Pollard). According to Edison CEO and founder, Chris Whittle, students have raised their performance on standardized tests an average of five percent each year (Greenwald). Five year gains in reading and math at Edison Schools are approximately twice the states' average gains (Edison).[[File:EdisonLearning.gif|300px|center|Edison]]

== Conclusion ==
The idea of a school operating as a business and seeking a profit may seem like a radical idea when first mentioned. However, after researching for-profits and educational management organizations I feel that they may actually serve a very useful purpose in today's educational system. I had never heard of for-profits before beginning this article and at first I was figuring that they would cater to upper class families. I was quite surprised that the majority of them serve lower income families and students that are struggling to meet expectations and achieving standards. For-profits serve a very meaningful purpose and have a much higher standard to live up to; if they are not succeeding, they will not survive, as is the case with most businesses. They have shown very good academic achievements, but have not been very profitable. Which leads me to wonder whether or not they will survive in the current economic climate.

== Author Reflection ==

I really enjoyed researching this topic and finding current events dealing with problems in educational organization. I was not aware about either of the topics I discussed in my article before starting my research. This has given me a desire to stay on top of educational news and current reform ideas/ issues. I hope to follow both of the issues covered in the article in the weeks and months to come. It seems like the mayoral takeover may occur in many other places, not just Detroit! And I am curious to see how the &quot;pay for performance&quot; project plays out in Utah. There seem to be so many benefits and problems for the project; it seems like a good idea to me. I agree with many others that specific guidelines and goals need to be set (and it could vary by school) so that the teachers know what they are working for and it is not ambigious. It was all very interesting for me to research and I hope it was enjoyable to read! Thanks!

== Reader Responses ==

There were two things I really liked about this article.  I enjoyed the very current information (the mayoral takeover happened pretty recently) and I liked the well thought out and researched information about the pay for performance plan.  Surprisingly I had never heard of it, but often thought it was a good idea.  With good teachers in high demand it surprises me that a plan such as this isn't more common, you think it would work in the favor of highly qualified teachers AND the students.  There are arguements for an against it of course, but I liked how you argued both points and the article was great!
[[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 01:49, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading your article and found it very interesting. I was pleasantly surprised to read about the “Pay for Performance” plan and teacher evaluations. I like the idea Utah has to measure teacher and student success. I agree with your statement that this plan has the potential to increase the quality of education for students as well as to raise and standard and motivation for teachers. I understand the controversy surrounding the issue, but it is always nice to work towards an incentive. I also believe that significant changes need to be made in Detroit in order for the students to succeed. A mayoral takeover may be the first step of the solution. The organization and structure of the school system continues to change, but it is my belief that these changes are for the better as they will increase the educational quality and success of students. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 18:01, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

I think I was watching the Colbert Report or Daily Show about a year ago when Pay for Performance was debated. I still cannot believe it actually exists, not because I don't think the idea would work– but because it's just so ridiculously simplistic that I figured no one would ever implement such a thing. It's shocking to see how it's worked in some situations, but I'm not sure it's up to par for every standard. I don't think Pay for Performance is beyond an ephemeral plan, and that they'll need another more solid strategy for those school systems when its effectiveness diminishes. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 17:31, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

I also really enjoyed reading your article. I have heard of &quot;Pay for Performance&quot; before, but had not heard both sides of the arguements for and against it. I also agree that it will create a better quality of education and motivate teachers, but you are right, it also has the potential to damage that quality as well. I, however, think that it is time for teacher pay to be dependent on something more than education and experience. There are so many professions that get bonuses and incentives for exemplary performance. It does sound very simple, and I'm sure that there would be ammendments and changes throughout time to figure out the right balance and what is most effective. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 02:56, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

You're article was very informative. I had no idea about this new concept of &quot;pay for performance&quot; and thought it to be a very interesting idea. If extra money motivates teachers to go above and beyond with their students so they can reach achievement, then it sounds like a pretty neat idea. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 16:09, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


I liked reading your article and the overview of the &quot;pay for performance.&quot;  While I agree that many teachers would benefit from this idea, I am not sure that with the budget crises that we have all been experiencing, that this would be the first program out the window, and therefore it would be a moot point.  I do think that this program would give an incentive to some teachers to strategize and think outside the box to help their students to achieve.  My argument is why aren't they doing that anyway, and like I said, with budget cuts everywhere that is one thing that will be brought up by cash strapped school administrations.
[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 17:55, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


I really enjoyed reading your article. It may be helpful to include the links to the specific articles throughout so readers can easily access the original text should they wish to read further. Your article definitely brings to light some novel ideas. Great job![[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 22:59, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

So, what about all the kids that don't take standardized tests?  What about kids that get modified diplomas?  How do you determine a teachers performance incentives when they work with that type of students?  It seems to me that Special Education teachers are already a critical need.  If the response to those questions is that you are only looking at general education students, then how can you value their education more than others?  If you eliminate performance incentives for special education teachers, it will only exacerbate the problem.

== == Author Reflection == ==
In order for our nation to survive, it must start with educating our children. Today's child is tomorrow's future. In school, learning is the responsibility of students, teachers, administrators, and parents. We have an obligation to make sure students are learning enough of the right information to take them into the future. We also have an obligation to make sure that teachers are qualified enough to teach students. School budget cuts and lack of resources have put students in danger of not meeting standards. This is not the fault of the students, but unfortunately test scores tend to argue. I have seem too many instances where teachers have had to shell out thousands of dollars out of their own pocket in order to provide for their students. For this, I think is a shame on our government who should fund more for education. The news is not a pleasant show to watch because of the negativity and bias surrounding the topics they choose to present. However, with that being said, they are informative. Last month there was talk on the news about the Govenor of Washington state, who said that they were going to have to do some serious budget cuts to pay off the deficit. The cuts she was referring too were in the safety, health and education departments. In my opinion, those are three vital areas where we should not be cutting, but adding money too. Since budgets are being cut in education, schools are forced to combine classrooms and put teachers who are not qualified to teach certain subjects in classrooms. Here again, we are shortchanging the student. I have worked in a school where the P.E. teacher had to teach the English class. The students were struggling and could not catch up with the other classes because the teacher was never prepared. Times have changed since I was in elementary and secondary schools. No longer are students being held for their actions or lack of responsibility. The school that I completed my observation in was in total chaos. Children screaming inside classrooms, running around without raising their hands, not following rules (which there were very few) and not doing assignments because they would rather talk amongst themselves. How can we have effective students and learning, if we do not have effective teachers and educational system?
The only problem I had when figuring out which content to include was how to condense the information. There is a lot of information about education out there, but narrowing down to the most important was daunting at times. However, I have learned a lot from this investigation and writing experience. It is information that I can adapt of what and what not to do as a teacher.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 00:29, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Your article was well written and the reading targets were all fulfilled. The information was very informative and helpful. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:21, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Being a teacher that took a non-traditional route to my profession, I didn't have the luxury of enrolling in an effective teaching course.  Reading this article I was surprised at the variety of courses that are available to undergraduates today.  A class just for English majors on the use of technologies seems a bit lavish.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 23:50, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


Overall it is a very well written article. You might think about put links to the news stories you addressed directly into your work. This would also help to add visual appeal by breaking up the large sections of text. [[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:39, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


I agreed with the author's stance on standardized testing and how it's jeopardizing the creativity of our teachers as well as the students.  While an effective teacher should be able to roll with the punches and keep with the changing times, it is also important to remember that teachers are beneath a thumb and are expected to &quot;produce results.&quot;  These &quot;results&quot; are heavily relied upon from standardized tests.  While under these restraints highly effective teachers are able to maintain standards while infusing creativity of their own.  It's nice to have something to aspire to in this field and material to get you there. I hope to become an educator with the many positive characteristics explored in this article. Great job![[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 03:06, 3 August 2009 (UTC)



This article was very well written. It consisted of many very important points. The learning targets were very accurate.

Looking back on the time spent writing this article I am amazed at it's turnout. In the beginning I hated using wikicode and trying to figure out good/bad sources. Being a full time mommy, part time worker and student I am thankful that I completed this article. I believe it to be relevent to educators today and the research to be quite interesting as well. I wish I would have spent more time reading articles related to the topic than I did. However, I feel that I produced the best work to my ability and I am proud to have had this experience as a future educator.

I enjoyed reading your “In the News” Article and found it quite interesting. I found it interesting but not too suprising that recently a high school senior stated that classroom management needed to be improved in his school. I agree that the parterships that used to exist between teachers and parents are fading.  I also agree that eliminating consequences in the classroom is a problem, because without consequences rules will be broken. The War and Court descriptions surprised me, but I think that each could work with different teaching styles. As long as the teacher grows accustomed his/her students, they will know what works best for classroom management. I really enjoy integrating technology into the classrom and I think this is a great part of classroom management as it keeps the teacher and students connected. Moodle sounds like a great tool I look forward to using! [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 17:41, 21 July 2009 (UTC)


I thoroughly enjoyed reading your article. I might be good to consider adding in links to the news articles you cite. This would also add to your sidebars and help break up the text. I might also be good to choose a less difficult color to read for the background of the sidebars. But overall great job![[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:47, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I liked your article very much.  It is interesting to see how difficult the job teachers have both maintaining order and teaching what they need to.  I love the idea of the mock court, would definitely work in older students classes since they tend to argue a point into the ground anyway.  I also liked that new idea of technology in moodle.  It is part of the process in teaching to find new ways to interact with our students and I think that may be one that would benefit the teacher and the student.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 18:44, 8 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

As a new teacher, this article was surprisingly difficult to write. After researching about what the media reports on about public schools, I felt that the picture is very skewed. All the media portrays are the scandals, the violence and those stories that show contemporary schools in a negative light. Although, those are also the topics of my article as it is called &quot;In the Media&quot;, I found that it was difficult to keep by bias out of my article. There are so many wonderful aspects of public schools that never see any media attention, and again I found myself focusing on the negative legal woes of schools today. Based on the news articles I found, I tried to keep my article balanced, but due to the overwhelmingly negative outlook of all of the current media, I feel that my article is not as balanced as it could be.

As a christian, I think Erica was very bold and brave to deviate from her graduation speech. I enjoyed reading your article and the different school stories from the news. Thanks for showing different views/sides to the articles. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 23:22, 9 August 2009 (UTC) 

Wow! I thought that your article was very interesting to read and the current events are important for today's teachers. I think we must all be aware of our rights and take note of times when these rights are being infringed upon. I was shocked to see some of the cases about freedom of speech and religion and how they turned out. As you stated in the article, I think its important to remember that we must protect both the teachers and the students in cases like abuse. Hearing both sides of the story and investigating the issue are critical! Great job on the article! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 23:29, 9 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I found your article really interesting to read. I liked how you included the link to the story of Erica Corder and her graduation speech.  	Although I would not take offense to her statement of leaning more about Jesus Christ, I am sure that there were many in the crowd that did. Since she was speaking at a public school, I understand the school’s request for Corder to apologize. I commend her effort to sue because of the first amendment; however, I do understand the court’s decision. It was also interesting to read Todd Richmond’s story about his religious freedom of expression on his artwork. In this case, I agree with Richmond that the school’s policies were infringing on his freedom of religion. In my school years, I was fortunate enough to have teachers who valued their student’s freedom of expression, even in religious areas. All of your examples and articles show the amount of effort that is being done to maximize the rights of students. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 17:44, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

I enjoyed your article.  It was interesting to read some of the news stories that you referenced.  I'm continually amazed at the lack of common sense some administrators display.  I must have the benefit of working with some great administrators.  Its laughable to think that they would put themselves in these positions.  I do understand that these are the exceptions rather than the rule. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 17:12, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I liked how you found different stories and explained each. I enjoyed this article because we currently have a teacher scandal going on in our county. A middle school teacher was arrested on 5 different counts, with the major one being having a sexual realtionship with a child. She had actually sent picture messages of herself naked to a 14 yr old boy that was in her class. The boy's mother found the pic messages and took the cell phone to the police. The teacher was arrested but did make bail. Her job has not been posted because the county has not fired her and states that she will not be fired until she is found gulity of the charges. I have heard even if she is found guilty there is a possiblity that she will still not be fired. Parents have went crazy over this and are furious at the thought that she might still have her job even if she is found guilty. I thought that if you are convicted then you automatically loose your position. I am still trying to find out the truth to this or should I say the law. When I find out I will let you guys know. I hope she will not return because I would love to have her job. Is that a bad thing??[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 17:31, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

I enjoyed your article that outlined different ways that students rights have been put into the media.  Many of these stories are necessary for future teachers to understand so that they can make sure that they are maintianing the correct protocal with their students.  I think that it is great that students are taking advantage of their right to defend themselves and to stand for what they believe in, although it makes things difficult for the school systems there must be the vaslue of an individual's rights as a fundamental lesson to all, especially young people.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 19:04, 8 August 2009 (UTC)


I liked the examples featured in the author's article, they were very interesting and produced a variety of angles.  I personally believe people often take advantage of amendments such as the &quot;Freedom of Speech.&quot;  In the scenario with the art student, the teacher had them sign something prior to the project which he signed so I have no sympathy.  He argued about a Buddha in the classroom of a teacher that taught religion, yet it was educational material for the subject not something projecting the educator's specific view.  I'm sure had that teacher signed a document indicating that he/she was not to have religious material in their classroom...they wouldn't have it in the classroom.  I'm glad our amendments are there to protect our rights, I'm just afraid they get abused too often.[[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 15:54, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


I really enjoyed reading your article, it was very interesting and easy to read. In the media, there have been numerous cases of teachers taking advantage of their position and abusing their students. Sometimes I wonder if the media is not at fault too for glorifying the acts committed and the people who commit them against children. Why I am saying this is because how many times do we remember the victim? As for 1st Amendment rights...I think that some people in our country take advantage of the amendments. I do not think this is what are forefathers had in mind when they wrote the Constitution. If religion is not allowed in school, then we should abide by those rules set in place. However, some have gone above and beyond that to include the Pledge Allegience to the Flag. Since all countries have their own flag and customs, why is it that this country cannot show pride in their flag and customs...is it because they are too worried that they will offend someone who is not from our country? Anyway, I think you did a great job presenting the information.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 02:33, 10 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

This topic was an engaging yet challenging process because there is not much information on social networking in the classroom. However the limited amount of information is extremely fascinating because it appears very versatile among students and teachers and employs education on something students use all the time. One example that I really enjoyed was an eighth grade English teacher using Twitter in his classroom, where he created a classroom account and had all of his students as “friends”. The project was a story created by the class, where each student would add their own part. Since Twitter allows no more than 140 words, it forced students to make the limited amount of text that they had meaningful. It was a limit that students did not groan at, but at the same time, take into account of what they were posting. The teacher eventually received students from all over the world, contributing to this interactive story and he published the book. One of the most important things I learned about teaching language arts is that writing has to be significant to students.  Otherwise the entire experience of writing is meaningless. By taking social networking, which students do constantly anyway, the English teacher made writing an engaging and interactive experience. More importantly, he made his classroom a truly diverse classroom. 

Another important issue that also caught my attention was how Web 2.0 could possibly demolish the traditional brick-and-mortar school. A struggling economy, geography and the pressing issue of school safety constantly on a community’s mind, teaching students through a virtual school does seem very appealing- to an extent. While many college and even high school students are taught online everyday, I personally do not see elementary and middle schools students being taught in a virtual school. At that age, I feel they are not ready for the self-discipline and responsibility of being an online student, when some of their higher education counterparts cannot. Of course, these are issues that will most likely not be seriously addressed until the next ten to fifteen years. However, it is something that current and pre-service teachers should think about as it may happen within their careers.[[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 00:49, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading this article and the aspect of social networking that it covered. It was very interesting to read about the many advantages that it has to offer teachers and students. I never really gave it much thought but the idea of using social networking as a way to save costs and open the doors to new things that the students may not otherwise experience is a great thing. This is definitely a technologically advanced generation and I think its important to continue teaching and learning these new ideas. Great work!

I liked your article.  It had many things that are important for teachers of the future to understand.  While I am a big fan of social networking, I think if a teacher would be using this in a classroom there would have to be VERY clear rules about content!  Some people have no thought to posting themselves in unflattering ways.  Although I love the fact that because these sites are global there si the chance for students to interact with others in different countries and places around the world.  This is the great advantage of technology, the exposure to a life that can be so different from the one we see very day!

I really enjoyed how the author effectively covered both angles of the argument of technology integration.  I personally think it can be used as a remarkable tool to get students actively engaged in learning.  This is there generation, and they can't turn the corner without some form of technology in front of them whether its a video game, a social or interactive website etc...This is how they are processing these days, so it is important that we as educators conform to this logic and use it to our advantage.  As long as we thoroughly educate on how to safely use the internet, I see no problem with integrating technology into the classroom.

I have many colleagues that have jumped on the Twitter bandwagon in the past few months.  Our school now has their own Twitter account where important information is placed for parents, staff, and students.  I think that could be a positive thing in terms of distributing information.  I'm still trying to figure out what the best way to use Twitter in the classroom.  The article listed some very good information on advantages and disadvantages of social networking.  I think social networking is the way to go in the classroom, but more education for the teachers should be included.  It helps to know more about information than some of your students.

I really enjoyed reading your article. The organization was well thought out, and made the information logical in allocution. One suggest to think about is to possible add hyperlinks in the text to articles you referred to. This would also add to the visual effect of the piece as well as add a bit of color to the article as a whole. Overall, great job!

For my author reflection, I have chosen to discuss the topic of standardized testing in schools. As a student, and much like the multitude of other elementary, middle, and high school students all over America, I hated standardized testing. Now, as a high school graduate and a teacher-in-training I am beginning to see the importance of standardized testing. Standardized testing of all ages of students is very important at assessing the depth of the students' knowledge. Since I attended private school, I do not have any experience with the Virginia SOL but I do have experience with the ERB, PSAT, and SAT. The ERB is taken in elementary school and assess what these young students know. It is like a mini-SAT. The PSAT is taken from middle school up to sophomore and junior year and assess what these students know. The SAT is taken by juniors and seniors; everyone knows what this test is and how it is formatted. I feel that standardized tests are important as a way to gauge where students stand and where the need help. Standardized testing should not be the only type of testing used and should not be the only thing that teachers prepare students for. Teachers should also strive to create an environment where students learn the importance of standardized testing so that students can learn to accept them and not hate them.

I enjoyed your FAQs for the chapter.  I am a mother of a student that just got accepted into a college prep program and I found it familiar reading through the section that focused on that.  I also am interested in the importance of standardized testing and the knowledge that can be garnered from the results, from the teacher perspective.  The AP courses are such a benefit for students so that they will possible have college credits prior to actually starting college.  One topic that was not covered is the fact that some students are also dually enrolling in college while still in high school.  That is a lot of work but will save them a lot of time in pursuit of their college studies.

Job well done! I particularly enjoyed the formatting of your work. The way that you approached the material and in the style you chose added to the ease of reading and understandably. The article was quite informative, and gladly strayed far from dull.

I am always amazed at how much information can be found on any given topic after it has been researched.  I have agreed and learned a lot of information after constructing this FAQ section.  I really did not have trouble finding sources.  The ones that I found had so much information that they answered most of my questions.  The sources I did find were full of great information that will be useful to anyone and covers many topics that will be useful in the future.  I hope the readers get out of the FAQ section some valuable information. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 21:22, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

I enjoyed reading your FAQ article and found it very interesting. I like how you reviewed the concept of mentors. I have a family member with autism, and a mentor has been extremely influential in my family member’s life that he can look up to and role model after. The mentor has become a trusted counselor and supporter and my family member has greatly benefited from having his mentor assigned to him on a regular basis. I found it interesting that the three characteristics of effective teachers are having positive expectations for student success, is a good classroom manger, and knows how to design lessons for student mastery. I couldn’t agree more with these three characterisitics and I feel that these allow the teacher to create a good classrom environment.

I thought that your FAQ article was very well done.  I have also realized the importance of mentorship.  I think that in every field it is vital for mentors to aid in the advancement of the training of new teachers.  This chapter contains many ways that we as teachers need to maintain effective schools that will benefit our students, families and communities.  Effective schools utilize principals that are necessary to the safety of our students.  Classroom management helps our students to learn while also ensuring that they respect each other and the teacher. [[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 01:40, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I liked how the author answered many commonly asked questions on this topic.  It is amazing when you think about the many components that must be fine tuned in order to run a well oiled machine or an effective school.  It all begins with the faculty in these institutions and their ability to achieve results and maintain a positive learning environment at the same time. The author did a fine job on the coverage of this topic. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 02:48, 3 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

I learned a lot about cooperative learning techniques and how to create differentiated instruction today’s classroom while researching this article.  It seems that more and more a classroom is made up of increasingly different learning styles and abilities and today’s teacher has such a challenge meeting them all.  What excited me most was how the different cooperative learning techniques from Dr. Kagan called “Kagan Structures” and the Jigsaw Classroom structure from Dr. Aronson will meet many of these challenges.   There are going to be times when direct instruction is simply the best way to teach certain concepts but when there is flexibility, cooperative learning techniques are so effective.  They engage the students and make them directly responsible for their own learning.  They also encourage social bonding between students and cut down on behavior problems in the classroom.  The students have so much fun they don’t realize they’re learning!  I am looking forward to using many of these techniques in my own classroom.

Writing the FAQ article was made so much easier by finding another Wikibook article that had a style and format I liked and then just copying their code.  What was most challenging was the reference page.  When the resource came from a journal, it was easy to reference.  When it came from an article located from an online source such as an organization’s webpage, it was much more difficult to figure out how to credit it.  I think I may stick only to journal articles in the future just to save myself the time and headache.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 14:31, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

I thought this article was really well written and I enjoyed reading it! I think I am most fascinated with the part of the article that discusses cooperative learning techniques and the Kagan ideas. I saw a great deal of this while doing my observation in the Virginia Beach Schools and I just find it so interesting and successful. The teachers I have talked to about the Kagan ideas seem to think that they work very well for their classes (all grade levels). This promotes a positive group atmosphere and allows the children to work together all the time. I really hope to use these ideas in my teaching! Great job!

I thought that you did a great job with your FAQs.  I especially like the quote that you included about the inspiration that teachers have the ability to give to their students.  I liked how you broke apart the different styles that help teachers to teach their classes, like cooperative learning.  This is one of the things that is emphasized in every class that I am taking in education.  There are many ways that students can learn from each other using this style.

I believe that classroom management is one of the many important facets of teaching. I believe that obtaining classroom management when teaching is a crucial element because the students need to understand the basic rules and regulations of the classroom, and the teacher needs to be able to handle the class as well. Therefore I believe that in some cases, classroom management can be one of the hardest things to obtain depending on the students and environment. If the students are not receptive to the teacher then it may be very difficult to obtain classroom management. Based on the information presented about classroom management, I believe that there are many factors that come into determining and enforcing classroom management. From personal experience, I remember that the two types of motivation (extrinsic and intrinsic) were used in the classroom often, whether by the teacher or the student themselves. I remember that I have always been intrinsically motivated to do well in school because I like the satisfaction and sense of personal pride in knowing that my hard work and efforts paid off in a good grade. I also remember working to achieve a goal in the classroom due to external motivators or incentives. Some of my teachers in the past would offer rewards such as candy, stickers or others to motivate students to do well on an assignment. I believe that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can exist simultaneously for the student, because I know that sometimes I needed the external motivation depending on the assignment, and it made me only push myself further for the next assignment because of the feeling I would get as a result, the internal reward. When I did my observations this summer at the middle school, I realized that often the students would cooperate more with the teacher if they knew that she would give them something in return, or if they would be punished for bad behavior. In both cases, they were being motivated by extrinsic factors which seem to be present a lot more in the classroom. I was still left with a few questions after reading the content, because I was unsure of which methods were the best to use in the classroom for effective classroom management. This was mainly because there were so many arguments for each method, and I would have liked to hear some personal experiences from teachers who had tried each method, and what they felt was the best method for effective classroom management. I did have some deliberations about what to include in the article, mainly because I felt I should include a little something from each section in the content article. Therefore, I tried my best to include something from each section so the readers would be well rounded to an extent in their comprehension of classroom management and its different facets. Sometimes the sources were a little confusing to determine whether they were popular or scholarly, but overall I believe that I ended up with a good variety that showed varying perspectives on classroom management allowing for all sides to be discussed and presented.

I chose this chapter because I am very adamant about Technology Integration in the classroom. We live in an ever-changing modern society that is dependent on technology. That said, I believe that it is an absolute &quot;must&quot; that teachers integrate it into various assignments, lectures, projects, etc. I think that all schools should have technology workshops as needed so that teachers have the resources required to produce students with necessary 21st century skills. I don't think that having a computer in a classroom or visiting a computer lab is enough. For technology integration to be successful, it should be transparent. I don't think that it is ever too early to teach children new skills that will help them later in life. For students to be successful in the future, it is important for them to start developing these 21st century skills early as well as regularly.

Your article was very well written and it captured my attention from beginning to end. I think you focused on all of the most important aspects of the chapter. Technology Integration has always been an interesting topic to me as I plan to integrate many different forms of technology into my classroom. During my school years, I was more captivated into the lesson when different modes of technology were used, such as Power Point, computers, and video and audio clips. I think most students favor technology because most of these lessons become student-centered. I also favor Project-Based Learning and plan to use the approach in my future classroom as well. I think project-based learning brings students together that would not normally come together to work on a project. It allows students to improve their social skills and helps to bring together diversity into the classroom. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 17:50, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

When I signed up to write this article, I had no idea of what to look for or what an &quot;assessment&quot; was.  Well, to my surprise, I had been assessing the students that I work with in the classroom for nine years and did not know it.

I have had to get work together for the students that I work with at the last minute.  I would make worksheets with true/false, matching, or questions.  I had no idea that what I was doing was assessing them; I was just getting work together for them to do.  But now that I know I will be more aware of what the students know and what they need more help on.


I wished that I had done more research because I see where a lesson on assessments was done.  I would have focused more on other kinds of assessments, students being assessed and a more indepth evaluation on assessments.  

I am glad to have done this paper, because there is so much that I did not know and now I can use this information to guide me and be aware of what I have to do to see to it that the students that I teach will benefit from my teaching and to put these assessments to practice and see which ones work and which ones do not.

I liked the content of your article and it is most important for teachers to havr a fimr grasp on why we assess our students and what those results can mean to us.  I think it is somehting that we assume that assessment is just summative and lets us know if they learned what we were trying to teach but formative can give us clues to evaluate our methods and adapt our lesson based on what results we get.

One of the hardest things for me to learn after taking a non-traditional route to teacher license has been assessing students appropriately.  This article helped reinforce things I have learned in this class about properly assessing students.  Knowing what type of assessment you are giving and the correct way to execute the questions.

It is essential for educators of today to be knowledgeable about the various types of assessment.  I typically gravitate more towards the formative way of assessing students, I think it caters to the class and their specific needs rather than adhering to state standards which is important, but student's progress is the ultimate goal.  Teachers practicing this form of assessment our skilled in their abilities to swiftly change priorities to correlate with the needs of their class, something I hope to be successful at.

My interview with Harry and his mother gave me reason to pause and reflect on my previous teaching experiences and how I formulated my own  student expectations.  During the 2007-08 school year, I taught 4th grade Science in a Virginia public school.  I specifically requested to have all of the special education students placed in my homeroom.  I did this for two reasons: my history with this particular group of students and my desire for all of the students to learn.  I knew what this class of students could do both academically and behaviorally.  My expectations were the same for all of my students behaviorally and for the most part academically.  I did take into consideration the various cognitive disabilities of my students and adjusted my expectations accordingly.  I never formulated my expectations based on a student's race, gender, or socio-economic status.  To me, they were all my children.

I adjusted my teaching so that all learners were comfortable, had a positive learning experience, and could take something valuable out of my door each day.  I refused to &quot;dumb down&quot; my lessons.  There's nothing worse than making a child feel different.  I will continue to strive to include all learners in my classroom and to formulate fair and achieveable expectations.

As for Harry, I watched him walk across the stage on Promotion Day.  He will be entering the 6th grade in September.  Harry received Honor Roll, Science, and Math awards as well as the Presidential Academic Achievement Award. His parents couldn't be prouder.

Neither could I.

I am happy to report that SOL scores have returned for this school year.  While I knew that Harry passed his Writing SOL test, I am pleased to announce that he passed his Reading, Math (perfect score!), Science, and Social Studies tests all with Advanced Proficiency.  Believe me, he was cheesing hardcore!

This is my favorite article of all of the ones that I have read this semester.  I loved the interview and it was great that you thought to include a picture of Harry.  Also, it had a good balance of personal info of the people and technical, well thought out information about learning disabilities.

I found your article to be extremely interesting! I really liked how you interviewed three different sources (student, parent and teacher) all relating to the same case. This offered such a great perspective on the situation. I felt like I was part of the interview while reading the questions and responses from each person. I pictured the little boy answering and my heart broke for him as he talked about the difficulties he faced. I am so glad that he is now self confident and able to succeed! What a great article!

I really enjoyed reading your article and found it quite fascinating. It is interesting that teachers develop certain expectations towards individuals in their class without taking into account their unique needs. Teachers need to understand that expecations are variable for each and every student, regardless of their learning ability. I found your student interview fascinating but I was also saddened to read that the teacher told Benjamin to “work harder”. It seems that his difficulties along with the responses of his teacher contributed to his low self-esteem. It broke my heart when he said he thought he was “broken”. I am glad to see that after proper diagnosis of dyslexia, a 504 plan was developed to help Benjamin with his unique needs and disabilities in school. I think teachers should always push students to do their best, but they must take into account the needs of each student. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 17:30, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

Wow, what a great article. I did not know that dyslexia could be passed on from generation to generation. I cannot imagine how hard it was for Harry in school and how much he had to endure in class. The comments made by teachers can have an enormous impact on impressionable children. Although students should be held to a high standard when it comes to school work, tests, etc., I think some leeway should be allowed to help those that need the extra help without singling them out or making them feel &quot;different&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; because they are unable to understand or keep up with the assignments.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:39, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

This was fantastic. I've a few friends that were classified as dsylexic growing up, and it's interesting to hear an elaboration on the experience. Great writing, good story. And I love that you followed up in your reflection to let us know the outcome of his SOLs. Your enthusiasm for your student's success is extremely commendable. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:22, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I can not tell you how fascinating this article was to read.  I loved that you took this from all the involved perspectives.  It is a testament to the involvement of teachers, parent and student and when everyone knew what Harry's problem was they were all there to help him to succeed.  The problem that many teachers face is that they forget that each student is different and they have different needs and learning styles.  Superb job on this article!!![[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 02:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

I am so glad I selected this topic.  When it comes to classroom management, we need to be aware that our responsibility is to give students the tools and the skills they need to work successfully in the classroom.  We must provide leadership and guide, counsel, encourage, and teach students to work successfully in the classroom.  I have learned so much by researching this topic including, areas of classroom management, ways to handle disruptive students, and received some powerful insight from a teacher.  It is so important to always show respect and be enthusiastic about teaching and working with students. If we're not positive and upbeat, many students won't be either.  I truly believe that creating a positive classroom helps students to be eager to learn and easier to teach. Students need encouragement in order to take pride in their efforts and achievement.  All of these things together, will help promote a positive classroom environment, which as teachers is what we all want.

I have learned through my current job, daycare, many of the same principles of handling disruptive students.   On any given day, I average 10-12 kids of different ages.  Among those kids, there are a couple that have problematic behavior.  They are disrespectful to me and the other kids, and do not want to listen at all.  It is true that knowing their background and being able to relate to them helps so much in understanding why they act this way.  Good parental involvement and communication are also key.  It was shocking when I was researching this topic and came across ideas that I already use. There is always a reason for disrespect.  The reason may or may not have anything to do with me.  I always try to be calm, poised, and rational.  The behavior I display toward them will be mirrored back to me.

I think that this is one of those topics that worries us prospective teachers!  How are we going to deal with the disruptive behavior and difficult students when the situation arises.  And, ohhhhh it will :-)  I loved reading the article.  It really flowed and it was fun to read.  If anything I would have liked to read more of the interview with the teacher.  Thanks for such a great article!  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:56, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for this article! I especially enjoyed learning about how to act in certain situations with disruptive behavior and difficult students. I also enjoyed learning, and found beneficial, the four areas of classroom management.[[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:36, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Classroom management is a very fine line.  Some new teachers have problems with discipline in the classroom, but are hesitant to seek about help from administrators.   It seems to me that the belief among new teachers is that administrators will see them as unable to control their classroom when they send students to the office.  Teachers don't want to do anything that would negatively effect their evaluations on their way to be tenured.  I have found that if teachers solicit help from other teachers, they will not only manage their class but learn helpful tactics in the meantime. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 00:08, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

This was an informative article with outlined steps to achieving order in a classroom setting.  I observed this first hand where a teacher was extremely skilled in understanding her students and knowing exactly what to do to get them to behave and reject the negative behavior. For example, all the kids were standing in line for the bathroom and everyone was talking loudly when they shouldn't have been talking at all. She pulled the quietest child from the line to begin the &quot;quiet game.&quot;  The student removed from line was then able to pick the next quietest person from the line, this continued til everyone was silent and proved effective because every child wanted to be picked. I hope to be assertive enough for the students to respect me and nice enough for them to want to be around me.  If I can achieve this I know I can have proper classroom management.  Great article!

I am very excited about the different types of technology utilized in classrooms today.  I enjoyed speaking with my sister about specific tools she uses.  When I was younger and in school we didn’t have the Internet to use, nor did we have SMARTboards, email, or even whiteboards!  We had a big black chalkboard and sometimes an overhead projector.  On days when we watched films, they were shown on reel-to-reel projectors.   I haven’t been in a classroom yet where the teacher used a SMARTboard.  I have many questions about all the different new technology classrooms have today, but I just want to see and try it all out for myself!

[[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 00:47, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

The interview taht you did with your sister was fascinating.  I am taking instructional techology now and was amazed at all the great resources for teachers!  Your sister hit on many of the things that we can use to help students get the most out of a lesson.  I am most interested in the Krindle, have seen them in publications and advertised but would love to see it in person.  Truthfully I think that those are going to be standard issue in the future to students.  The ability to have use these advances in technology will make our students far more advanced than we could have hoped while in school, but you can't beat the chance to curl up in a chair with a good book, the krindle may not be able to replace that feeling![[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 19:23, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

This article was very interesting.  Technology is not something that I will be able to escape anytime soon and it is good to know that other teachers are finding vast ways to apply it in their classrooms.  I sometimes wonder though if all of the advances will have some downsides.  Smartboards, video chatting and virtual field trips seem to make the classroom a much more interactive environment for students who are used to constant feedback.

After interviewing Ms. Street about the Virginia Alternate Assessment Program, I was very surprised as to the detail of the program.  I have not had much experience working with special education students.  It was refreshing to see the time and effort that went into the development of the aligned standards used to evaluate students with severe cognitive disabilities.  By having this program it assures that all students in the State of Virginia receive a quality education no matter their disability.

I thought this was a very intersting and insightful article.  Prior to reading it, I had no idea what the VAAP was.  I think it's great there are other standards that children with disabilities can reach.  The portfolio assesment sounds like a really good idea to me.  In this article I would have avoided having a paragraph entitled &quot;disadvantages&quot; and then listing that there were no disadvantages.

I enjoyed reading your article and found it to be very interesting. I had not yet heard of the Virginia Alternative Assessment Program and I think it is a great idea for students who are working on academic standards that have been reduced in complexity. The specific criteria that must be met to participate in the VAAP rather than SOL testing are understandable and I do not think they are too strict. I think there is a great benefit to VAAP because it shows the student’s progress over time and improvement in certain areas.  [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 17:57, 24 July 2009 (UTC)


What a great article from a reputatble source.  I can completely understand how much hard work goes into preparing and completing an alternative assessment portfolio like the VAAP.  While I have not worked with on a VAAP, I have worked on numerous VGLAs which are equally time consuming.  My suggestion is to start collecting evidence early.  Don't wait!  Use a variety of sources for evidence.  Worksheets are fine but I like to include photos, videos, audio recordings, and student prepared materials (pictures, etc.).  Although students completing a VAAP or VGLA do not take the regular SOL tests, they are responsible for meeting SOL or ASOL requirements.  Don't think they are a way out of meeting specific learning requirements.  Great job on an informative and enlighting article.

Many future teachers do not understand ho difficult it is to evaluate children that have special needs.  Your article was great in that it described the different methods for evaluation and assessment and valued the progress that is evident in the portfolios.  I thouroughly enjoyed your interview and applaude all special education teachers that have a lot of documentation for each student and still have the heart to love their job!

I changed “unite” a group into “move” a group because goals are not what unite a group, their common interest is what unites them, goals just keep things moving and interesting. They must gather rather than “hash out” because these clubs are recreational and shouldn’t resemble assignments. I took out “or else that club will never achieve anything with a point” because there are silent individual goals that can reach meaning full points even if they are not verbally expressed. Perfect example is the Creators of Visual Art and Literature Society who don’t do much of anything but attend their meetings and work of their projects. They don’t sit down and figure out what they are going to do as a group each year it’s more like they gather together just to be around people who are also creating.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Anatomy of the GI Tract==

The GI tract is essentially a hollow tube connecting the mouth to the anus. The GI tract has a similar layout through out its length:
*An inner '''mucosal''' layer with an epithelial lining
*A '''submucosal''' layer
*A thin layer of muscle , the '''Muscularis Mucosa''' is at the junction of the mucosal and sub mucosal layers, outside this are the nerves of the '''mucosal plexus'''
*A muscular layer with an inner circular muscle layer and an outer longitudinal layer
*Between the muscles are the nerves of the '''myenteric plexus'''
*A '''serosal''' layer which is continuous with the '''mesentry'''
This is illustrated graphically here:

[[File:Smallintestine layers2.png]]
===General Anatomy===
====Mucosa====
[[File:Illu stomach layers.jpg|thumb|Layers of Intestine as illustrated in the stomach]]
[[File:Gray1061.png|thumb|villi (from Grays anatomy)]]
The mucosal layer consists of a Epithelial layer, and its underlying suportive tissue, the '''Lamina Propria'''. It is separated from the Submucosal layer by the '''Muscularis Mucosa'''. The epithelial layer varies from section to section of the Gut. In the oesophagus it is a '''non-cornified stratified squamous epithelium'''; in the stomach it is mainly '''mucosal''' cells; the small intestine and large intestine are characterized by '''absorptive''' cells, with many mucous producing '''goblet''' cells. In the absorptive sections of the intestine, the surface are for absorbtion is greatly increased by finger like projections into the lumen called '''villi''', and the absorptive cells themselves also have small projections of '''microvilli''' giving them the appearence of a '''brush border''' when viewed with a light microscope.

The lamina propria contains lymph and blood vessels which drain into larger vessels in the submucosal layer. Also in the lamina propria, particularly in the absorptive layers are numerous '''immune cells''', wandering macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as agregations of lymphoid tissue called called '''Peyers patches'''. By some estimates 80% of the body's lymphoid tissue is in the intestine.

The cell to cell junctions are of the epithelia are mainly '''tight junctions'''. In the stomach there are very little or no gaps between the epithelial cells, but in the absorptive sections there is a certain amount of 'leakiness' so that water and some solutes can go between the cells rather than through them. The degree of leakiness is variable and is to some extent under hormonal control.

====Submucosa====
The '''submucosa''' consists of connective tissue with larger blood and lymph vessels. It is separated from the mucosa by the '''muscularis mucosa'''. Also in the the submucosal layer is the '''submucosal plexus''', part of the '''enteric nervous system'''. The muscularis mucosa probably acts to propel the contents of the mucosal glandular lumens and crypts (see below) into the lumen and also to enhance contact of the cells with the contents of the lumen.

====Muscular Layers====
Consists of an inner circular muscle, and an outer longitudinal musle. Between the two layers is the '''mesenteric plexus''', also part of the '''enteric nervous system'''. In the stomach there is also an oblique layer of muscle fibers interior to these two. The musclar layers work in harmony to produce '''peristaltic'' contractions and '''segmental''' contractions.
====Serosa====
The serosa is a continuation of the peritoneal membrane. It is useful to think of the gut as being ''envaginated'' into the peritoneal membrane until it completely surrounds it. The double layer of membrane as it attaches to the gut is called the mesentry, and contains the main vessels and the non-intrinsic nerve supply to the gut.



[[File:Stomach_diagram.svg|thumb]]

Each section of the intestine has a variation on this theme. A brief review of the anatomy and function of each section follows.
&lt;br clear ='both' /&gt;

===Mouth &amp; Pharynx===
[[File:Gray994.png|thumb|anatomy of mouth and pharynx]]
Digestion starts in the oral cavity. Food is taken into the mouth and masticated by the teeth, being mixed with saliva from the '''parotid''', '''sub-mandibular''', and '''sublingual''' glands. Saliva contains '''amylase''' and '''lipase''' enzymes, and these are mixed with the food. As these enzymes are deactivated on reaching the stomach, the more thoroughly food is masticated, the longer they have to act. When mastication is complete, the food is swallowed, a three part process, only the first part of which is under voluntary control. (see Motility).
The epithelia lining of the mouth and pharynx is non-cornifed squamous epithelium.

[[File:Gray1024.png|thumb|Plate from Grays anatomy showing Salivary glands]]
&lt;!--[[File:Swallow food.png|thumb|1.The tongue pushes a bolus of food against the soft palate triggering the swallowing reflex.2.The epiglottis closes, preventing food entering into the trachea. The Oesaphageal sphincter relaxes.3.Peristaltic waves push the food down the oesaphagus.]]--&gt;
&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;

===Esophagus===
The esophagus extends from the pharynx to the stomach and is about ten inches in length. It traverses three regional anatomical areas, the neck, the thorax, and the abdominal cavity. At the upper and lower ends of the esophagus the musclar layers act like sphincters - they are in tonic contraction, and these have been known as the '''esophageal''' and the '''cardiac''' sphincters. Although the esophagus is outside the abdomen, and thus does not have a serosal layer, it has the same basic layout as the rest of the system

The epithelium of the mucosal layer is '''non-cornified stratified squamous epithelium'''. The lamina propria is not copious and contains aggregates of lymphoid tissue. 

[[File:Oesophageal layers.png]]
&lt;br clear='both' /&gt;
The '''oesophageal glands''' are scattered throughout the length of the esophagus and are located in the submucosa. There are also '''cardiac glands''' - similar in microscopic appearance to those in the stomach, but with no enzymes in their secretions - at the proximal and distal ends of the esophagus. These glands are confined to the mucosal layer.
The longitudinal rugae disappear on swallowing. The sub-mucosal layer consists of loose fibrous tissue and elastic tissue allowing expansion.
No new digestive enzymes are added nor does absorption take place in the esophagus.
====Clinical Note - Barrets esophagitis====
[[File:Barretts alcian blue.jpg|thumb|Barrett's esophagus  Alcian blue stain. The characteristic goblet cells are stained blue.
Normal stratified squamous epithelium is seen on the right of the image]]
In Barrets esophagitis the stratified squamous epithelium at the lower end of the esophagus is replaced by intestinal-type lining (columnar epithelium), due to reflux esophagitis. It is considered a pre-malignant condition as about 0.5% per year of patients will go on to develop esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus).
&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

===Stomach===
====Gross Anatomy====
&lt;div style='border:1px black solid; width:300px;float:right;padding:5px' &gt;
[[File:Illu stomach.jpg|250px]]

1. Body of stomach 2. Fundus 3. Anterior wall 4. Greater curvature 5. Lesser curvature 6. Cardia 9. Pyloric sphincter 10. Pyloric antrum 11. Pyloric canal 12. Angular notch 13. Gastric Canal 14. Rugal folds
&lt;/div&gt;

Food enters the stomach from the esophagus at the at the '''cardia''' and passes into the stomach. In the fasting state the stomach is kept in a state of contraction, but the presence of food causes it to expand. The '''rugae''' of the stomach are folds in the mucosa seen in the fasting state, unlike the small intestine they are not there to increase surface area for absorption. Numerous pores are seen, the openings to the '''gastric glands''' which secrete enzyme '''pepsinogen''' and '''Hydrocloric Acid''' as well as '''mucous'''. The Hydrochloric Acid produces a pH of about 2. This highly acidic environment serves two purposes - to provide an environment hostile to bacteria and other pathogens; to denature protein, causing it to unfold, and thus  increasing the area that pepsins can attack (see digestion below)

The stomach is divided into three parts, the '''fundus''',; the main '''body'''; and the '''pyloric antrum'''. Stored food is mixed with enzymes and HCl to form '''chyme'''. The muscles feed the the chyme down to the pyloric anrum, where it is thoroughly mixed, and fed in small amounts into the small intestine by relaxation of the pyloric valve. 

The Arterial Supply to the stomach is from the '''Coeliac Artery'''.
The venous drainage of the stomach drains into the '''venous portal system''' 
&lt;br clear='both'/&gt;

====Microscopic Anatomy====
&lt;div style='border:1px black solid; float:right;padding:5px;margin:5px' &gt;
[[File:Gastric anatomy.png]]
&lt;/div&gt;

The basic layout pattern holds true in the stomach, although the stomach has a third inner layer of oblique muscle fibers. The mucosal layer has numerous pits opening into the lumen, the mouths of the gastric glands. Some of these glands penetrate down into the submucosal layer.

====Gastric Glands====
The gastric glands secrete mucous, hydrochloric acid and enzymes into the stomach. They are located for the most part in the mucosal layer of the stomach, but some of the deeper gland penetrate into the submucosal layer, and secrete into the lumen via. ducts. Several different secretory cells are found: mucous; parietal; chief cells; D cells; enterochafin cells; and G cells.

Mucous cells secrete both mucous and bicarbonate, substances that protect the stomach from auto-digestion. Parietal cells secrete Hydrochloric acid, 1-3 liters a day which cause the pH in the stomach to fall as low as 1. Chief cells secrete the enzyme '''pepsinogen''', which is activated to '''pepsin''' by the pH of the stomach. G cells produce '''gastrin''', a hormone that promotes gastric acid secretions and stimulates the growth of the gastric mucosa.

[[File:Gastric gland.png|250px]]


&lt;table style='border:1px black solid; float:right;margin:5px;padding:5px;text-align:center' align='right' &gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;[[File:Gray1053.png|180px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Gray1054.png|120px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Gray1055.png|150px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align='center'&gt;Cardiac glands
(at cardia)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pyloric glands
(at pylorus)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fundic glands
(at fundus)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
 	 	&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
The composition of the gastric glands varies throughout the stomach. In the fundus, the glands are more branched and contain all the different kinds of secretory cells. In the pyloric part of the stomach the glands are deeper and contain more mucous cells. The Chief cells are only found in the fundus of the stomach,G cells are found mainly in the Antrum, the other cells are found in all areas.

Not much absorption of nutrients take place in the stomach, although many fluids, particularly alcohol, can be absorbed from here.
&lt;br clear='both'/&gt;

===Small Intestine===
The small intestine is divided into three sections, the '''duodenum''', the '''jejunum''', and the '''ilium'''. In is the area of the intstine where most of the absorption takes place. In all three sections the layers follow the general pattern:
&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;
[[File:Intestinal layers.png]]
&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;

The surface for absorption is increased in many ways: the mucosa of the small intestine is thrown into folds called '''rugae'''; the mucosa itself has numerous finger like projections called '''villi''', and the epithelial cells are also covered with numerous projections called '''microvilli'''. this later gives the appearance of a 'brush' on light microscopy, hence the term '''brush border'''. the following illustration shows the anatomy of a villi: 
[[File:villi1.png]]
&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;
Mucous is secreted by numerous goblet cells, the other cells are specialized for absorption and are known as absorptive cells. In the base of the crypts are numerous secretory cells which secrete the digestive enzymes of the small intestine. Some of the cryts will penetrate into the submucosal layer forming digestive glands which will communicate with the mucosa via. a secretory duct.
The length of the small intestine is about 12-13 ft. in the living adult, although after death, due to the loss of longitudinal muscle tonicity, this length will double.

====Duodenum ====
[[File:Microvilli-Duodenum.JPG|thumb|epithelia of duodenum]]Release of chyme into the duodenum is controlled by a number of factors that ensure that there is a controlled release into the small intestine for processing. 
The duodenum is itself divided into three parts, the '''first''', '''second''', and '''third''' part.
Small portions of highly acidic chime is released into the first part of the duodenum. This part secretes the hormone Secretin from the mucosal cells (as do the other parts of the doudenum)in response to the presence of acidic chyme leaving the stomach. This stimulates the pancreas to secrete copious amounts to neutralizing Sodium Bicarbonate, so the pH of the chyme is nearer 7 when it leaves the duodenum. the digestive enzymes of the pancreas and small intestine operate maximally at this pH. This also means that any pepsin from the stomach is also deactivated.
The first part of the duodenum does not have plicae and folds, indicating that this part is probably not important for absorption.

In the Second part of the duodenum bile and pancreatic enzymes are secreted via the '''common duct''' into the lumen see (Biliary System &amp; Pancreas) below. Absorption of food  starts in the second part of the duodenum.
====Jejunum &amp; Ilium====
[[File:Human jejunum microvilli 1 - TEM.jpg|thumb|Transmission electron microscope image of a thin section cut through a human jejunum(segment of small intestine) epithelial cell. Image shows apical end of absorptive cell with some of the densely packed microvilli that make up the striated border. Each microvillus is approximately 1um long by 0.1um in diameter and contains a core of actin microfilaments.]]
The jejunum comprises about the upper two fifths  and the ilium the lower three fifths of the small intestine past the duodenum. The jejunum and ilium are classified according to various anatomical differences. These differences  include the arrangement of the cascade of vessels in mesentry mesentry; the distribution of Peyers patches - more numerous in the ilium; the mucosa is thicker and has more blood supply in the jejunum; and the incidence of surface area increasing plicae are more prevalent in the jejunum. Physiologically they have more or less the same functions, although probably more digestive enzymes are produced in the proximal portions of the small intestine. In any case, when we consider absorption and digestion we shall just consider them all 'small intestine'.

&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;

====Epithelial Regeneration====
Epithelial cells have a life-time of 5-7 days. New cells are continuously being generated in the crypts, and migrate up the sides of the villi. These cells differentiate into either goblet cells (10-25%) or absorptive cells. Old cells are shedded from the tips of the villi.
[[File:Epithelial shedding.png]]
&lt;div id='bil'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

===Bilary System &amp; Pancreas===
[[File:gray1100.png|thumb|From Grays Anatomy: The anterior part of the pancreas has been removed to show the pancreatic duct]]
Bile and bile salts are manufactured by the liver and fed into the second part of the duodenum via the common duct. Bile salts are important in fat digestion.

The pancrease is a retro-peritoneal gland that is both an endocrine - producing the hormones insulin and glucagon, and an exocrine gland  - producing digestive enzymes. The enzymes are secreted in a deactivated form - to prevent auto-digestion - and are activated in the lumen of the duodenum. 

The following illustration indicates the relationships of the pancreas and bilary systems.
[[File:Pancrease biliary1.png]]
&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

===Large Intestine===
&lt;!--[[File:Intestinal layers.png|thumb|The microscopic appearence of the Large intestine is similar  to that of the small intestine]]--&gt;



The large intestine extends from the ileo-caecal junction to the recum and anus. The microscopic appearence is similar  to that of the small intestine. In is divided into the '''caecum''', '''ascending''', '''transverse''', '''descending''' and '''sigmoid''' colon.
In the colon electrolytes and water are removed, and faeces are formed. These are propelled fowards by a form of movement called '''mass movement'''. (see Motility).
The colon is populated with bacteria, which usually operate in a symbiotic mode. Any food that has not been processed may be digested by these bacteria, and the products will then be absorbed by the Large Intestine.

The microscopic appearence is similar to the small intestine with the following exceptions:
*'''Goblet cells''' are more numerous.
*'''Villi''' are few or absent.
*The '''muscularis mucosa''' has both a circular and a longitudinal layer.
*The '''Crypts of Lieberkuhn''' are larger and do not branch.
*The longitudinal muscle layer is condensed in the colonic portion of the Large Intestine into three longitudinal bands called the '''teniae coli'''.
&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;
[[File:Intestine.png|200px]]
&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

===Rectum and Anus===
[[File:Anorectum.gif|thumb|Illustrating the Internal and External anal sphincters]]
The faeces are now passed to the rectum where they await elimination. The process of elimination is  controlled by two sphinctae, the Internal and external Anal sphinctae. The former is under involuntary control, the latter under voluntary control. The functioning of these are discussed in the section on motility
&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

==Splanchnic Circulation==
This includes the blood supply and drainage - via. the portal system - of the Gut as well as the pancreas, liver and spleen. The liver is drained by the hepatic vein.
===Gastrointestinal blood supply===
Blood supply comes from three arteries branching off the aorta:the '''coeliac''' artery; the '''superior mesenteric''' artery; and the '''inferior  mesenteric''' artery. 
====Coeliac Artery====
Supplies blood to the stomach, liver, pancreas and spleen as well as the duodenum.

[[File:Gray532.png|300px]]

====Superior Mesenteric Artery====
Supplies blood to the small intestine as well as the superior part of the Colon. Notice the system of arching anastemoses that is a feature of The splanchnic arteries.

[[File:Gray534.png|300px]]

====Inferior Mesenteric Artery====
Supplies blood to the Colon. Again notice the system of arching anastemoses.

[[File:Gray537.png|300px]]

===Hepatic Portal System===

[[File:Gray591.png|thumb|The Hepatic Portal Vein]]
All the blood from the GI system below the esophagus drains into the '''Hepatic Portal Vein''', the Portal system also drains the spleen and pancreas. Blood is conveyed to the liver for processing where it passes through millions of '''liver sinusoids'''. This allows the '''reticuloendothelial cells''' that line the sinusoids to remove bacteria and other particulate matter. Blood finally leaves the liver via. the '''Hepatic vein''' where it drains into the '''Inferior Vena Cava'''. 

The total blood flow to the liver is about 1.5 Liters per minute of which two-thirds is carried by the portal vein. The Blood in the portal vein is more oxygen saturated than blood in the Systemic Venous System - about 80-90% saturated, and provides about 70% of the oxygen requirements of the liver.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motility==
Ingestion of food is is controlled by hunger and appetite. In health the body controls the rate at which ingested food moves through the GI system, so that digestion and absorbtion are optimised. The first residue from a meal will pass through the GI system in 7-10 hours, but some may take up to 5 or six days to pass through. 
===Smooth muscle Characteristics===
Smooth, also called involuntary or un-striated muscle is usually found in the walls of hollow organs, and have many unique characteristics. Contraction of these cells is dependent on the influx of Ca++ ions. In the gut three types of contraction are seen:
*Tonic sustained contractions, such as occur in sphincters
*Peristaltic contractions
*Segmental contractions
By a variety of these contractions, food and chyme is moved through the bowel.

====Mechanics of contraction====
Smooth or un-striated muscle cells contract by altering their shape. They contain numerous actin-myosin bundles. Some of the actin Strands attach to the cell, they are all anchored to dense bodies in the cytoplasm of the cell. On activation the actin strands slide over the myosin causing shortening of the actin-myosin bundle:

[[File:Actin myosin filaments.png|400px]]

This causes overall bulging and shortening of the cell:


[[File:Smooth muscle contraction1.png|300px]]

====Physiology of contraction====
Muscle cells in the intestine communicate with each other through gap junctions, causing a series of function syncitial units. Thus an action potential in one cell will spread to other cells in the unit. 

[[File:Single unit smooth muscle1.png]]

Contraction can  be initiated by action potentials or by chemicals and hormones. Contraction caused by the former are know as '''myogenic potentials''', the later is known as '''pharmacomechanical coupling'''. 
Some of the smooth muscle cells have a spontaneous cycle of depolarization, and these are known as '''pacemaker cells'''. They are said to have '''slow wave depolarization'''. When the level of depolarization reaches a certain threshold, an action potential is triggered. The strength of contraction depends on the number of action potential triggered.  

Some pace maker cells will trigger an action potential with every slow wave, others with only occasional slow waves. The following illustration shows the electrical pattern of slow waves with occasional action potentials and 'pacemaker' potentials where every wave generates action potentials. Each slow cycle lasts 7-12 seconds.

[[File:Myogenic potentials.png|300px]]

The following illustration demonstrates the effect on two agents, A &amp; B on Muscle Tension in pharmacomechanical coupling. Note that there is no change in the membrane potential.

[[File:muscle_pharmaco_mechanical_coupling.png|300px]]

Action Potentials cause an influx of Ca++ ions which release more Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Because the supply of Calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is limited it must be replaced by Calium ions from outside the cell. The membrane potential is restored by an efflux of Na+ ions.

===Tonic sustained contractions===
One characteristic of smooth muscle cells is their ability to maintained '''tonic sustained contractions'''. Muscle that has this is said to have or maintain '''tone'''. This allows sphincters to to maintain  their tonicity, and to open by 'relaxing' their tone.
As an example of the tone in the gut, the length of the small intestine is about 24 ft. in death, but is only half this length in life due to the tone in the longitudinal muscle bundles. 

===Peristalsis &amp; Segmental Contractions===
Segmental contractions are used for mixing food or chyme. The circular muscles in adjacent segments of the intestine undergo alternate contraction and relaxation. The effect of this is not to move food along the lumen, but to churn it and mix it, especially with the digestive juices. Segmental contractions also bring the chyme into contact with the epithelial cells for absorption.

[[File:Segmental contractions.png]]

Peristaltic contractions move food and chyme down the lumen of the bowel. Circular muscles contract  behind a bolus of food, the muscles in front of the bolus relax and this wave of contraction proceeds down the bowel propelling the bolus of food forward.

[[File:Peristalsis.png]]

===Motility through out the GI System===
The passage of food through the gut, its conversion to chyme, and finally feces is all under involuntary control. Only the first part - ingestion and swallowing, and the last part - defecation are under voluntary control.

====Mastication====
Chewing is extremely important part of the digestive process especially for fruits and vegetables as these have indigestible cellulose coats which must be physically broken down. Also digestive enzymes only work on the surfaces of food particles, so the smaller the particle, the mre efficient the digestive process.
====Swallowing====
Swallowing is coordinated by the swallowing or deglutition center loated in the upper medullar and lower pons. Impulses are carried by the Trigeminal, Glossopharangeal, and Vagus nerves.
[[File:Swallow food.png]]
*The tongue pushes a bolus of food against the soft palate triggering the swallowing reflex.
*The soft palate is pulled upwards preventing reflux of food into the nasal cavities
*The vocal cords are strongly approximated
*The larynx is pulled upwards, closing the epiglottis, preventing food entering into the trachea. The esophageal sphincter relaxes.
*The muscular wall of the pharynx contracts beginning superiorly, pushing the food into the esophagus
*Peristaltic waves assisted by gravity push the food down the esophagus.

====Esophagus====
Food is carried down the esaphagus by peristaltic contractions. If these are insufficient to move all the food, stronger secondary peristaltic waves develop. These are intiated by both the myenteric plexus and centrally.

The muscle at the lower end of the esophagus thickens and is called the lower esophageal sphincter. This is usually tonically contracted, but relaxes when the peristaltic wave reaches it, allowing passage of food into the stomach.
====Stomach====
Food entering the stomach passes into the fundus of the stomach where it is stored. Weak peristaltic waves, known as mixing waves originate in the upper stomach and pass down to the antrum. These waves become stronger as they approach the antrum, and as they push the food against a closed pylorus they also act as mixing waves. Food in the antrum of the stomach is also thoroughly mixed with segmental contractions.
The mixed fluid contents are called chyme, and small amounts of this are pushed through the pylorus into the duodenum with the stronger peristaltic contractions.

====Control of Stomach Emptying====
The rate of emptying of the stomach is controlled by various factors originating in the duodenum and stomach, of which the duodenal factors are the most important.

Gastric factors include increased volume of food in the stomach and stretching of the stomach wall. The hormone '''Gastrin''' also appears to promote stomach emptying.

Duodenal factors serve mainly to inhibit entering, thereby ensuring that the small intestine is not overwhelmed by a sudden influx of acidic chyme. They include '''nervous reflexes''' and '''hormones'''. The '''nerve reflexes''' are transmitted both by the enteric nervous system and through extrinsic nerves via the pre-vertebral sympathetic ganglia.

Factors that inhibit emptying include:
*Distension of the duodenum
*The degree of acidity of the duodenal chyme
*The osmolarity of the chyme
*Irritation of the duodenum

The reflexes are particularly sensitive to acidity and irritation which case rapid inhibition of stomach entering.

'''Hormones''' that inhibit emptying include '''cholecystokinin''', '''secretin''', and '''Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP)'''. Secretin is secreted in response to acidity in the duodenum, Cholecystokinin and GIP in response to the presence of fats in the chyme.

All these factors ensure that the rate of stomach emptying is limited to what the small intestine can process.

==== Small bowel====
In the small intestine mixing with segmental contractions continues and the food is slowly passed through the intestine, finally passing through the  ileocaecal sphincter to the large intestine.
to a large extent the separation of segmental contractions from peristaltic contractions is artifical as both serve to move chyme forward, and both add to mixing. Chyme moves down the small intestine at the rate of about 1cm/min, so will reach the ileocaecal junction in 3-5 hours. It often stays there til the next meal the '''gastroileal reflex''' intensifies peristalsis in the distal ileum forcing chyme through the ileocaecal valve.

Intensity of peristalsis is controled by both neuronal reflexes and hormones. Neuronal factors include distension of the intestine wall, but also distension of the stomach will also cause increased small intestine peristalsis. Both of these reflexes are mediated by the myenteric plexus.

Hormonal factors ''increasing'' peristalsis include gastrin, CCK, insulin, motulin and seretonin. Glucagon and secretin ''inhibit'' peristalsis

====Ileocaecal valve====

[[File:Ileocaecal sphincter.png|200px]]

The prime function of the ileocaecal valve is to prevent reflux of fecal contents into the small intestine. As can be seen from the illustration, the valve protrudes into the caecum, thus increased caecal preasure will cause occlusion. Futhermore, the muscle is thickened for a few centimeters from the distal end of the ileum, and this acts as a functional sphincter.

Increased preasure or irritation in the ''distal ileum'' will cause relaxation of this sphincter; increased ''caecal preasure or irritation'' will cause constriction.

====Large Bowel and Defecation====
The principal function of the large intestine is to remove water and electrolytes from the chyme, and to store the resultant faeces until it can be eliminated.

In the colon the longitudinal muscle coat is condensed into three narrow bands called the '''taenia coli.''' Thus mixing movements of the circular muscle coat, so called '''haustrations''' predominate in the Large intestine. These will also slowly move the contents towards the rectum.


Much of the forward movement comes from these 'haustrations, but there is a third type of contraction called the '''mass movement''' which sends substantial amounts of material forward. These typically occur 2-3 times a day, usually after a meal - the so called '''gastrocolic reflex''', and last for about 20 minutes. They are responsible for the final formation of the faeces and the filling of the rectum. 

Filling of the rectum is a signal for the relaxation of the Internal anal sphincter. However the External anal sphincter is under voluntary control.

Although the myenteric defecation signal only weakly relaxes the Internal anal sphincter, the stronger signal comes from parasympathetic reflexes synapsing in the sacral cord. These can be inhibited centrally, and when time to defecate is convenient, the inhibition is released, and the external anal sphincter, under voluntary control is relaxed.

[[File:Defecation reflex.png|250px]]

The sequence of defecation is often initiated voluntarily; the epiglottis is closed a deep breath, and contraction of the abdominal muscles increase intra-abdominal pressure.

===Coordination of motility===
All these actions are coordinated, and are under control of hormones, and the autonomic nervous system as well as the enteric nervous system, the result is that in health food products and chyme are moved forward at the optimal rate to allow for efficient digestion and absorption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Secretions in the GI tract==
About 9 liters of fluid pass through the GI system each day, and only about 2 liters are ingested, the rest represent secretions from the system itself. About half, 3.5, liters is secreted from the exocrine glands, the salivary glands, the pancreas and the liver, the other half is secreted by the epithelial cells of the of the digestive tract it self. Nearly all this fluid is absorbed, so the pellets of feces only contain a significant amount of fluid in diarrhea.

To put this in perspective a 70 Kilogram man has about 42 liters of fluid, so the secretions represent about a sixth of the body's volume. The circulation contains about 3.5 liters, so these secretions represent twice the bodies circulating volume! Failures of absorption of the intestinal secretions can thus lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

The secretions consist of  digestive enzymes, mucous and substantial amounts of fluid and ions.
&lt;table cellpadding='5'&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Daily Volume&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;pH&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Saliva&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.0 - 7.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stomach&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.0 - 3.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Brunners Glands (duodenum)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8.0 - 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pancreas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1000-1500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8.0 - 8.3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bile&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7.8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Small Intestine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1800&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7.5 - 8.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Large Intestine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7.5 - 8.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;6700-7200&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
===Types of glands===
Several different types of gland are found in the GI Tract:
*Single cell mucous glands and goblet cells.
*Pit glands. Invaginations of the epithelia into the submucosa. In the small intestine these are called '''Crypts of Lieberkuhn'''.
*Deep tubular glands. These are found in the stomach - the '''gastric glands''', and the upper duodenum - '''Brunners glands'''.
*Complex glands, the salivary glands, the pancreas, and the liver. The salivary glands and the pancreas are '''compound acinous glands'''.

===Mechanisms of stimulation===
Stimulation occurs due to local effects; autonomic stimulation; and hormones
====Local effects====
The mechanical presence of food causes stimulation not only locally but also adjacent regions. This may either be a direct effect, or via. the enteric nervous system.
====Autonomic stimulation====
Stimulation of parasympathetic nerves invariably serve to increase secretion. Stimulation of sympathetic nerves may increase some secretions, but usually diminishes blood flow, which will usually decrease overall secretion.
====Hormones====
Several different hormones affect secretions. They will be looked at in the regional review of secretions.

===Digestive Enzymes===

Digestive enzymes are secreted by glandular cells which will store the enzyme in '''secretory vesicles''' until they are ready to be released. These cells are characterised by a robust rough endoplastic reticulum and numerous mitochondria. Passage of materials from the ribosomes, through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi body to the secretory vesicles takes about 20 minutes.

[[File:Cell gland.png]]

Note the presence of nerve fibers on the basal side of the cell.

===Water &amp; Electrolyte secretions===
Glandular secretions must also secrete water and electrolytes to go along with the organic substances. The following illustration shows the most likely mechanism for this.

[[File:Cell electrolytes.png|400px]]

*In its resting state the membrane resting potential is about -30-40 mV
*Neural stimulation causes an influx of -ve chloride ions decreasing resting potential by 10-20 mV
*Sodium ions follow down the electrical gradient. Cell contents become hyper osmotic.
*Water follows. Intracellular pressure increases
*Increased pressure opens ports on apical side of cell flushing water and electrolytes

Micro electrode studies indicate that the whole process lasts about a second!

===Digestive Enzymes of the GI tract===
The following table shows a summary of the digestive enzymes of the GI tract:

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


&lt;/table&gt;
Note that in both the stomach and the Pancreas the protein digesting enzymes are secreted in non-active forms - pepsinogen in the stomach and Tripsinogen and Chymotripsinogen in the pancreas. This is to prevent autodigestion. They are then activated in the lumen, in the case of Tripsinogen and Chymotripsinogen these are activated by the small intestine enzyme '''enterokinase'''.

===Digestive Hormones of the GI tract===
Numerous  hormones are secreted by the Gastrointestinal system. Here is a summary of the most important hormones secreted by the gut.
&lt;table cell padding='5' border='1' rules='rows'&gt;
&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;&lt;th&gt;Hormone&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Secreted by:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Target(s)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Releasing stimuli&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secretin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Endocrine cells of small intestine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pancreas; stomach&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Acid in duodenum and small intestine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stimulates bicarbonate secretion and pepsin release; inhibits gastric acid secretion&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motilin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Endocrine cells of upper small intestine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Smooth muscle of Antrum and duodenum&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fasting&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stimulates gastric contractions (hunger pangs)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Secretin is of particular historical interest as it was the first hormone discovered in 1902

===Mucus Secreting Cells===
Mucous is a viscous secretion used for protection and lubrication. It consists mainly of '''Glycoproteins'''. It is made by '''mucous cells''' in the stomach and '''Goblet cells''' in the small intestine. Up to 25% of the intestinal epithelial cells are goblet cells.In the mouth about 70% of the mucous is secreted by the minor salivary glands.

Mucous has the following properties:
*Adherent properties, it sticks well to surfaces
*Enough body to prevent contact of most food particles with tissue
*Lubricates well - has a low resistance to slippage
*Strongly resistant to digestive enzymes
*Neutralizing properties. As well as a buffer like effect, mucous can also contain large quantities of bicarbonate.

[[File:Barrett's mucosa, Alcian blue stain.jpg|thumb|Blue staining Goblet cells]]

Control of secretion is by a variety of neuropeptides in the enteric nervous system; parasympathetic innervation; and cytokines from the immune system.

[[File:Gray1060.png|250px]]

===Electrolytes and Fluids===
A large portion of the 7 liters is composed of water and ions. The ionic composition varies from region to region.
*The '''acini''' of the salivary glands secrete a sodium and chloride rich secretion, this is then turned to a potassium, bicarbonate rich secretion as it travels down the lumen and ducts of the glands
*The '''Oxyntic cells''' of the stomach secret Hydrochloric acid
*The '''mucous cells''' of the stomach secrete a mucous rich in bicarbonates
*The '''pancreatic ducts and ductules''' secrete a solution rich in bicarbonate
*the '''Crypts of Liberkuhn''' of the small intestine secrete a solution almost indistinguishable from interstitial fluid.

====Hydrogen ions and Bicarbonate====
[[File:secretion_hydrogen.png]]
[[File:secretion_bicarbonate .png]]
--&gt;

===Mouth===
The Salivary glands consist of the '''parotid''', '''submandibular''', and '''sublingual''' glands as well as numerous smaller '''buccal''' glands  secreting both ''serous'' and ''mucoid'' secretions. The parotid secretions are mainly serous, the buccal glands mucus, and the sublingual and submandibular are a mixture of the two. The acini secrete proteins and a fluid similar in consistency to interstitial fluid, and the ducts exchange the sodium for potassium and Bicarbonate for chlorine leaving saliva that is rich in Potassium and bicarbonate ions. 

The glands secrete between 800-1500 mls a day

[[File:Gray1024.png|thumb|Salivary Glands, From Grays Anatomy]]
&lt;div style='margin:10px;padding:10px; border:1px black solid;width:300px'&gt;[[File:Salivary1.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

The sodium ions are actively reabsorbed, and the potassium ions are actively secreted at the luminal side of the cell with an excess of sodium reabsorbtion causing a -70mV gradient. This causes passive reabsorbtion of chlorine ions. Bicarbonate ions are both passively exchanged , and actively secreted in exchange for chlorine. This is illustrated in the diagram below.


[[File:Saliva secretion duct.png]]

The saliva contains the enzyme Ptyalin, an amylase for breaking down carbohydrates as well as a lipase.

====Anti-bacterial action of Saliva====
The mouth contains numerous bacteria, and an important function of saliva is oral hygine. The saliva contains thiocyanate, a potent antibacterial. The lipase in the saliva will also breakdown bacteria cell walls and facilitates the passage of thiocyanate into the bacteria.

The lipase in fact is not very important for the digestion of food, most fat digestion occours with the pancreatic enzymes, but is important in its anti-bacterial  and oral hygiene role.

====Regulation of Salivary Secretion====
Salivation is controlled viathe parasympathetic system from the salivary nuclei in the brain stem. Factors that induce salivation include:
*Taste stimuli, especially sour taste
*Higher centers especially appertite anticipation, smells and visual clues
*In response to signals from the stomach and upper GI tract, particularly irritating stimuli. Salivation can also occour as a prelude to vomiting.
====Clinical Note - Sjögren's syndrome====
[[File:Sjogren syndrome (2).jpg|thumb|Histopathologic image of focal lymphoid infiltration in the minor salivary gland associated with Sjögren syndrome. Lip biopsy. H &amp; E stain]]
Sjögren's syndrome is an auto immune disorder where immune cells attack the salivary and tear glands. This can play havoc with oral hygiene and lead to rampant caries.

&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

===Esophagus===
Esophageal secretions are entirely mucous in character, and assist passage of food as well as protecting the lower end of the esophagus from gastric reflux.
===Stomach===
The adult stomach secretes about 1500 ccs in a normal day consisting of '''hydrochloric acid''', '''bicarbonate rich mucous''', and the digestive hormone precursor '''pepsinogen'''. Pepsinogen is activated to its active form '''pepsin''' by the acidity of the stomach. G cells also secrete the hormone '''gastrin'''.

The gastric pits of the stomach open on to branching glands: '''pyloric glands''' in the antral part of the stomach; '''gastric''' or '''oxyntic''' (acid forming) glands in the fundus and body of the stomach. A schematic diagram of an oxcyntic gland is shown here (see also anatomy).

[[File:Gastric gland.png|250px]]

The parietal or oxcyntic cells secrete hydrochloric acid; the peptic or chief cells secrete pepsinogen; the mucous cells secrete a bicarbonate rich mucous; and the G cells (found only in the antral glands) secrete the hormone Gastrin.

====Hydrochloric Acid secretion====
The oxcyntic or parietal cell contains a large number of of intracellular '''canaliculi''' shown schematically here:

[[File:Cell parietal.png]]

The pH of the secreted acid is about 0.8, and has a hydrogen ion concentration of about 3 million times that of arterial blood. To achieve this level of concentration requires a lot of energy, about 1500 calories per liter of secretion. The mechanism of hydrogen ion formation is illustrated schematically here.

[[File:secretion_hydrogen.png]]

*Carbon dioxide and water enter the cell and combine to form carbonic acid under the influence of the enzyme ''carbonic anhydrase''.
*Bicarbonate is actively excreted at the basal side of the cell and is exchanged for chlorine.
* Potassium is exchanged for hydrogen ions at the apical side of the cell
*Chlorine ions (not shown in diag.) are also actively secreted.

====Clinical Note: Intrinsic factor and Pernicious anaemia====
The oxcyntic or parietal cells also secrete '''intrinsic factor''', a substance essential for the absorption of '''Vitamin B12''' in the small intestine. In ''chronic gastritis'', this may not be secreted, and the medical condition ''pernicious anaemia'' will develop.

====Bicarbonate Rich Mucous Secretion====
Mucous secretion rich in alkaline bicarbonate protects the stomach from the Hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice. 

[[File:Stomach mucous.png]]

Bicarbonate ions are generated by the mechanism illustrated below:

[[File:secretion_bicarbonate .png]]

*Carbon dioxide and water enter the cell and combine to form carbonic acid under the influence of the enzyme ''carbonic anhydrase''.
*Hydrogen ions are actively secreted on the basal side of the cell in exchange for sodium.
*Bicabonate ions are actively secreted on the apical or lumen side of the cell in exchange for chlorine

====Secretion and Activation of Pepsinogen====
Pepsinogen is secreted by the '''peptic''' or '''chief''' cells of the gland. 

When first secreted pepsinogen is inactive, but contact with acid converts it to the active form '''pepsin''' by splitting the pepsinogen molecule. Pepsin functions best at a pH between 1.8 and 3.5

====Stimulation of Gastric Acid secretion.====
The Oxcyntic cells function in close association with histamine producing cells called '''enterochromaffin-like cells''' (ECL) which secrete '''histamin'''. These cells release histamin in direct contact with the oxcyntic glands and promote the secretion of HCl. The activation of this complex is under hormonal (Gastrin) and nervous control.
*'''Gastrin''', secreted by the '''G cells''' in the antrum of the stomach in response to the presence of protein is the most potent stimulator of the Histamine/Acid complex. The gastrin is not only carried by the blood stream, but is also carried directly into the lumens of the gastric pits an has a direct stimulating action.
*The Histamin/HCl complex is also activated by '''acetylcholine''' released by the vagus nerve
*Other substances also control Acid secretion, mainly through their action on  Gastrin production.
====Inhibition of Gastric Acid secretion.====
Factors which slow stomach emptying, which was discussed when considering ''motility'' will also reduce gastin production and hence Acid secretion.
====Regulation of Pepsinogen Secretion====
Pepsinogen secretion occours in response to two signals:
*Acetylcholine release from the vagus nerve
*stimulation of peptic cell secretion in response to acid in the stomach, probably not directly but through the enteric nervous system

===Small Intestine===
The upper small intestine secretes the hormones '''Cholecystokinase''' and '''secretin''', mucous, Intestinal digestive juices, and possibly enzymes. The Digestive enzymes are The small intestine secretes about 1800 ccs a day. The pH of the small intestine secretions averages 7.5 to 8.0.
====Hormone Secretion====
'''Cholecystokinin (CCK)'''is secreted in response to fats and peptides in the upper small intestines, particularly the duodenum. Actions of CCK include:
*Secretion of Pancreatic Enzymes
*Contraction of Gallbladder
*Relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi
*increased tension in the pyloric sphincter, inhibiting stomach emptying

'''Secretin''' is released in response to the presence of Acid in the duodenum.
Actions of Secretin include:
*Secretion of Copious amounts of bicarbonate rich fluid by the biliary and gall bladder ducts
*Secretion of alkaline rich mucous by Brunners glands
*increased tension in the pyloric sphincter, inhibiting stomach emptying

====Brunner's Glands====
The first few centimeters of the Duodenum, between the pylorus of the stomach and the Ampulla of Vater, contain numerous compound mucous glands called '''Brunner's Glands'''. These secrete an Alkaline rich mucous - pH between 8.0 &amp; 8.9 - in response to various stimuli:
*Local irritation and the presence of Acid
*Vagal Stimulation
*Gastrointestinal hormones, particularly '''secretin'''.

The mechanism for secreting the alkaline rich mucous is similar to that already discussed for the stomach.


====Clinical Note - Peptic Ulcers====
Gastric and duodenal ulcers are due mainly to the breakdown of the protective barrier of alkaline mucous.

The following factors have been identified as causes:
*Non Steroidal Anti-inflamatory Drugs ('''NSAIDs''').
*The '''bacteria''' ''Heliobacter Pylori''.
*Excess acid secretion which can over whelm the defences. This can occour particularly in ''Zollinger-Ellison syndrome'', caused by  benign '''gastrin''' secreting tumors which may develop in the stomach or duodenum.
It is of interest that Brunner Cell secretion is ''inhibited'' by sympathetic stimulation, thus this may be a connection between the 'hyper' personality and their disposition to duodenal ulcers. Less mucous may be secreted making the duodenum more vulnerable to stomach acid and stomach pepsin.

====Crypts of Lieberkuhn====
These are located over the entire surface of the small intestine adjacent to the villi. They secrete a copious solution almost identical to interstitial fluid. The mechanism for secretion is not well understood but one hypothesis is illustrated here which differs only slightly from the hypothesis described earlier:
&lt;div style='margin:20px;'&gt;[[File:secretion_NaCl.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

Sodium and chlorine ions are pumped into the cell; water follows by osmosis; the chlorine ions are actively pumped into the lumen; water and sodium follows from the cell itself or possibly passes through 'leaky' tight junctions.

====Mucous Cells====
The villi are covered with goblet cells. About a quarter to a half of the villi cells are mucous producing.
====Enzyme Secretion====
Small intestine secretions that are free of cellular debris contains almost no enzymes! Thus the enzymes are either secluded within the cell, or possibly they are attached to the brush border. In any case they are not flushed down the lumen, and they remain local.

====Regulation of Small Intestine Secretions====
Secretions are produced almost entirely from local enteric nervous reflexes  in response to local stimuli.

===Pancreas===
[[File:gray1100.png|thumb|Anatomiical relations of pancreas]]
[[File:Langerhanssche Insel.jpg|thumb|Islet of Langerhans surrounded by Acini]]

[[File:Gray1105.png|thumb|showing relationship of Islet of Langerhans and exocrine gland]]

The pancreas is a large endocrine and exocrine gland  situated retroperitonealy beneath the stomach. The endocrine portion of the gland secretes ''Insulin'' and ''glucagon'' from the Islets of Langerhans (see thumbnail of histology). This function of the pancreas will be looked at else where. The microscopic structure of the pancras is similar to the salivary glands, the acini secrete enzymes, and the ductules and ducts secrete large quantities of a bicarbonate rich juice. These travel down the pancreatic duct to the second part of the duodenum where it exits via the  '''Ampulla of Vater''', protected by the '''Sphincter of Oddi'''.

&lt;div style='border:1px solid black;margin:10px;padding:10px;width:300px'&gt;[[File:Pancreas secretions2.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

Enzymes secreted by the acini include proteolytic enzymes, amylases and lipases. The proteolytic enzymes are all secreted in an inactive form to prevent auto-digestion(see below).


====Pancreatic Digestive Enzymes====
The following table summarizes the digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas:

&lt;table cellpadding='5'&gt;
&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Group&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Enzymes&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Substrates&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carbohydrates and Starch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Amylase&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Starch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lipase &amp;amp; Colipase&lt;br/&gt;
Phospholipase&lt;br/&gt;
cholesterol esterase
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Triglycerides&lt;br/&gt;
Phospholipids&lt;br/&gt;
Hydrolysis of Cholesterol esters
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proteins and Peptides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Trypsin (Tripsinogen)&lt;br/&gt;
Chymotripsin (Chymotripsinogen)
Carboxypolypeptidase&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Peptides&lt;br/&gt;
Peptides&lt;br/&gt;
Peptides

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

*'''Amylase''' breaks down carbohydrates (except cellulose) to di-saccharides  and some tri-saccharides.
*'''Proteolytic enzymes''' are secreted in the in active form to prevent auto digestion, they are converted to the active form in the small intestine. '''Trypsin''' is activated by '''enterokinase''', secreted by the intestinal mucosa; 
*Tripsin then activates Chymotripsinogen
*'''Lipase''' converts fats to fatty acids and monoglycerides
*'''Phospholipase''' splits fatty acids from phospholipids
*'''Cholesterol esterase''' hydrolises cholesterol esters

====Inhibition and Activation of Enzymes====
The cells that secrete proteolytic enzymes also secrete another substance called '''tripsin inhibitor'''. This prevents any tripsin that may form in the cells or ducts from becoming active, or activating the other enzymes. If however the pancreas becomes damaged or the pancreatic ducts become blocked then the action of tripsin inhibitor can be over whelmed, and the very serious condition '''acute pancreatitis''' can develop. This can also occur if there is regurgitation of intestinal contents through the Ampulla of Vater. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis Wiki Article on Acute Pancreatitis]

====Secretion of Bicarbonate ions====
Copious quantities of Bicarbonate ion rich solutions are secreted by the ducts and ductules of the pancreas in response to the hormone '''Secretin'''. The mechanisms are similar to that of the mucous cells of the stomach, except that large quantities of fluid are also produced.

&lt;div style='margin:10px;padding:10px;'&gt;[[File:secretion_bicarbonate .png]]&lt;/div&gt;

*Carbon dioxide and water enter the cell and combine to form carbonic acid under the influence of the enzyme ''carbonic anhydrase''.
*Hydrogen ions are actively secreted on the basal side of the cell in exchange for sodium.
*Bicabonate ions are actively secreted on the apical or lumen side of the cell in exchange for chlorine
*Sodium and Water ions follow either passively through 'leaky' tight junctions, or through cell by the mechanism described above in 'Water &amp; Electrolyte secretions'.

====Phases of Digestion====
Like Gastic secretions, Pancreatic secretions can be divided into three phases:
*Cephalic
*Gastric
*Intestinal
The '''Cephalic phase''' occurs  when we think about or anticipate food. It is mediated by the vagus nerve. It causes secretion of about 20% of the enzymes, but as this secretion is not accompanied by fluid secretions, the enzymes are not flushed out and tend to remain in the ducts.

The '''gastric phase''' occurs when food enters the stomach, and again is mediated by neural stimuli. This accounts for another 5-10%, and again in the absence of serous flow these secretions tend to remain in the ducts.

The '''Intestinal phase''' occurs when food enters the small intestine and both serous pancreatic secretion becomes copious due to the hormone ''secretin''.

====Regulation of pancreatic Secretion====
Three basic stimuli control pancreatic secretion
*'''Acetylcholine''' from the parasympathetic nerves of the vagus and the cholinergic nerves of the enteric nervous system.
*'''Cholecystokinin''' secreted in the duodenum and the uopper small intestine
*'''Secretin''', also secreted in the duodenum and upper jejunum.

The following diagram summarizes the factors controlling pancreatic secretions.

[[File:Pancreas secretion.png]]

Acetylcholin and Cholecystokinin cause secretion of digestive enzymes, but these tend to remain in the gland, as there are no secretions to flow them out.

Secretin causes copious secretions of sodium bicarbonate rich fluids which wash the enzymes into the small intestine, and also neutralize the Hydrochloric acid from the stomach.

  2HCl + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; 2NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The carbonic acid (a weak acid) immediately dissociates into Carbon Dioxide and water The Carbon dioxide is absorbed into the blood stream. 

Pancreatic enzymes work best between a pH of 7-8. Sodium Bicarbonate has a pH of about 8.

===Biliary System===
[[File:Pancrease biliary1.png|thumb|Basic anatomy of the biliary system]]
About 1500 mLs of bile are secreted every day. The bile is secreted continuously by the hepatocytes of the liver, and if not immediately required for digestion are stored in the gall bladder. Here they are concentrated up to 15 times. Initally bile fluid has about the same electrolyte concentration of interstitial fluid, but during concentration large quantities of electrolytes (but not Ca ions) are reabsorbed. 

In the presence of fats in the duodenum, cholesystokinin is secreted which causes strong contractions of the gall bladder and relaxation of the Sphincter of Oddi, propelling the bile into the small intestine. Vagal stimulation can have a similary but secondary effect.

Bile contains Bile salts, an emulsifying agent neccessary for the digestion and absorption of fats; as well as bilirubin, cholesterol and fatty acids

&lt;table cellpadding='2' style='margin:20px'&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Composition of Human Hepatic Duct Bile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;0.7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Bile Pigments&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0.2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0.07%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Inorganic Salts&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0.7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fatty Acids&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0.15%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fat&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0.1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Lecithin&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0.1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Manufacture of Bile and Structure of Hepatic Lobule ====
The illustration below shows a schematic diagram of a liver lobule. Blood is conveyed to the lobules by branches of the '''hepatic portal vein''' and the '''hepatic artery'''. It then flows through sinuses, bathing the '''hepatocytes''', to the '''central vein''' of the lobule, a branch of the Hepatic vein which drains into the '''Inferior Vena Cava'''. The hepatocytes secrete bile into bile canuliculi running between the hepatocytes, and these drain into branches of the bile duct.

&lt;div style='margin:20px;'&gt;[[File:Hepatic structure.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

Bile is continuously secreted by the hepatocytes. The fluid part of the secretion, a watery substance rich in sodium and bicarbonate is added by the ducts of the biliary system, and this secretion is stimulated by '''Secretin'''.
[http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/Gastrointestinal/Liver02.htm Histology slide from the University of Ottawa]
====Recycling of Bile Salts====
Bile salts are recycled by the GI System. About 95% of bile salts are are reabsorbed from the terminal ilium and returned to the liver via the portal system. In addition, some salts are produce by bacterial action in the Large intestine, and these too are returned to the liver.

[[File:Bile recycling.png|350px]]

About 0.2 gms per day of bile salts are manufactured by the Liver, and the total pool of salts is about 3.5gm, so recycling is very important. recycling occours 6-8 times per day or about twice per meal. If the terminal ilium is resected, or affected by disease such as Crohn's, fat digestion is seriously compromised, and mal-absorption of fat soluble vitamins can occour.

====Regulation of Bile Secretion====
The following Diagram summarizes the regulation of Bile secretion:

[[File:Gallbladder1.png|350px]]




&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

===Large Intestine===
The chief function of the large intestine is absorption of fluids and the formation of faeces. About 1-2 liters of fluid enter the large intestine, and these are mainly absorbed, only about 200 ccs being egested each day.
The large intestine secretes about 200 ccs of fluid a day, mainly in the form of mucous.

====Diarrhea====
The large intestine can produce large quantities of water and electrolytes in response to irritation, such as occurs in infections. This can lead to dehydration, but also has the beneficial effect of flushing out the irritants.

&lt;big&gt;'''Cell Cycle'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Decision to proliferate and enter cell cycle highly regulated process
*Binding of extrinsic growth factors typically necessary
*[[w:MTOR|mTOR]] integrates input from growth factor receptors, cellular nutrient and energy levels, and redox status to stimulate new protein synthesis in preparation for cell cycle entry via [[w:P70-S6_Kinase_1|S6K]] to regulate translational machinery and [[w:EIF4E|eIF4E]] to regulate cyclin D
*Regulation of cell cycle through complex of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk)
**cdk levels constant throughout cell cycle
**cdk activity regulated by concentration of cyclins, cdk phosphorylation, and cdk inhibition
**Cyclin concentrations are cyclical
*Progression is unidirectional from G1 -&gt; S -&gt; G2 -&gt; M
*Cell cycle checkpoints
**Prevent or delay progression through cell cycle when critical events have not been completed
**Provide time for DNA repair
**4 main checkpoints (please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Damage_Response|DNA damage response]] for information about effect of RT on the checkpoints
***G1 (stop)
***S (slow)
***Early G2 (stop)
***Late G2/M (stop)


==G1 Phase==
*Preparation for synthesis: Is cell big enough, is environment favorable, is DNA undamaged?
*G1 checkpoint is integrated at p53. Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Damage_Response|DNA damage response]] for more information
**If there is a G1 arrest, p53 increases levels of p21, which inhibits cyclinD-cdk4/6 complex
*If there is no arrest (low p53 levels), the cyclinD-CDK4/6 complex becomes active, and phosphorylates Rb protein
*Rb protein is normally associated with E2F, but upon phosphorylation dissociates from it
*E2F is a DNA transcription factor, which triggers entry into S phase
*Cyclin D and E2F levels are promoted by myc and by eIF4E 

==S Phase==
*CDK2 kinase plays a major role in maintaining the pace of S-phase; it is a transcription target of E2F
*S phase checkpoint serves to insure that there is no replication through DNA damage that could result in double strand DNA break
**S phase checkpoint is triggered by DNA damage -&gt; ATM -&gt; Chk2 -&gt; CDC25A -&gt; CDK2 phosphorylation
**If there is an S phase arrest, CDC45 fails to load onto DNA, and DNA replication halts
*If there is no arrest, CDK2 remains dephosphorylated and CDC45 begins DNA replication
*CyclinD/CDK2 also inhibits p27&lt;sup&gt;kip1&lt;/sup&gt;, which promotes expression of Cyclin A and progression through S-phase
*CyclinA/CDK2 plays a key role in duplication of centromeres

==G2 Phase==
*CyclinB/CDK1 kinase is called the Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF), and promotes entry into mitosis by phosphorylating multiple proteins. The complex also includes Cyclin A and CDC 20
*G2/M checkpoint is triggered by DNA damage -&gt; ATR -&gt; Chk1 -&gt; CDC25C -&gt; CDK1 phosphorylation
*Prior to mitosis, cyclin B is primarily located in the cytoplasm. When the cell is ready, Cyclin B is phosphorylated, which results in its accumulation in the nucleus
*At the same time, CDK1 must be dephosphorylated to trigger mitosis
*Targets of MPF complex include:
**condensins, which enable chromatin condensation 
**microtubule-associated proteins involved in mitotic spindle formation 
**lamins, contributing to degradation of the nuclear envelope 
**histones H1 and H3 
**Golgi matrix, which leads to fragmentation 
**Dephosphorylation of Rb protein, prior to start G1 of the next cycle
*There are two distinct G2/M checkpoints (PMID 11809797)
**A very rapid, dose-independent, ATM-dependent arrest of cells that were in G2 at the time of irradiation (and consequent failure to enter mitosis), which can be assayed using flow cytometry against phosphorylated histone H3 (a marker of mitosis)
**A slower, dose-dependent, ATM-independent accumulation in G2 of cells which were in earlier stages of the cell cycle at the time of irradiation, which can be assayed using standard propidium iodide flow cytometry
**Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Damage_Response#Cell_Cycle_Checkpoints|cell cycle checkpoints]] for further information

==Viral cell cycle promoters==
*These block Rb, which leads to dissociation of E2F and cell entry into S phase
**SV40 T Antigen
**Adenovirus E1A
**HPV E7

==Cell cycle inhibitors==
*Block cyclins to prevent entry into next cell cycle phase. They act primarily in G1 to stop progression into S
*Kip inhibitors: 
**p21&lt;sup&gt;WAF1/CIP1&lt;/sup&gt; blocks cyclin D
**p27&lt;sup&gt;KIP1&lt;/sup&gt; blocks cyclin D &amp; E
**p57&lt;sup&gt;KIP2&lt;/sup&gt; blocks cyclin E &amp; A, and to lesser degree mitotic cyclin B
*INK inhibitors:  
**p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4a&lt;/sup&gt;, p15&lt;sup&gt;Ink4b&lt;/sup&gt;, p18&lt;sup&gt;Ink4c&lt;/sup&gt;, p19&lt;sup&gt;Ink4d&lt;/sup&gt;
*Structurally related, they destabilize association of cyclin D with CDK4/6
*p21 and p16 increase in senescence and contribute to G1 arrest

==Myc==
*DNA transcription factor
*Multiple actions to promote entry of cells into S phase
**Cyclin D transcription -&gt; Rb phosphorylation -&gt; E2F activity
**SCF gene transcription -&gt; KIP family (p21, p27, p57) inhibitor degradation
**E2F transcription

==Ras==
*Activation of ras triggers two major pathways related to entry into cell cycle:
**Ras -&gt; Raf -&gt; MEK -&gt; MAPK -&gt; transcription of cyclin D and block of p27 inhibitor
**Ras -&gt; PI3K -&gt; PKB -&gt; stabilization of cyclin D and block of p21 inhibitor</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I chose to edit a piece about KUGS in chapter 2 because I felt that there was not enough information there. While I did not study that organization, I have been a newsreader at KUGS and gone through DJ training. There was another problem that needed to be addressed as well as a more positive possibility. This page is about effective organizations and even the issues facing them are chances to show how to be more effective overcoming them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{center|This category contains books on '''[[Subject:Automata theory|automata theory]]''': the study of abstract machines and problems which they are able to solve. An automaton is a mathematical model for a finite state machine (FSM). A FSM is a machine that, given an input of symbols, &quot;jumps&quot;, or transitions, through a series of states according to a transition function. In the common variety of FSMs, this transition function tells the automaton which state to go to next given a current state and a current symbol.  Note, however, that, in general, an automaton need not have a finite number of states, or even a countable number of states.  An automaton need not strictly accept or reject an input; it may accept it with some probability between zero and one. Automata play a major role in compiler design and parsing.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{center|This category contains books on '''[[Subject:Algorithms and data structures|algorithms and data structures]]'''.  An ''algorithm'' is a finite sequence of instructions, an explicit, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, often used for calculation and data processing. It is formally a type of effective method in which a list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, will when given an initial state, proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state.  A ''data structure'' is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.}}

Real numbers and rational numbers have the property that between any two numbers a third can be found, and consequently these numbers vary &quot;smoothly&quot;. The objects generally studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in &quot;continuous mathematics&quot; such as calculus and analysis.}}

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:algorithm|algorithm]]s''' and '''[[w:data structure|data structure]]s'''. An ''algorithm'' is a finite sequence of instructions, an explicit, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, often used for calculation and data processing. It is formally a type of effective method in which a list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, will when given an initial state, proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state. A ''data structure'' is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:discrete mathematics|discrete mathematics]]''': the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. Real numbers have the property that between any two numbers a third can be found, and consequently these numbers vary &quot;smoothly&quot;. The objects generally studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in &quot;continuous mathematics&quot; such as calculus and analysis.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:automata theory|automata theory]]''': the study of abstract machines and problems which they are able to solve. An automaton is a mathematical model for a finite state machine (FSM). A FSM is a machine that, given an input of symbols, &quot;jumps&quot;, or transitions, through a series of states according to a transition function. In the common variety of FSMs, this transition function tells the automaton which state to go to next given a current state and a current symbol. Note, however, that, in general, an automaton need not have a finite number of states, or even a countable number of states. An automaton need not strictly accept or reject an input; it may accept it with some probability between zero and one. Automata play a major role in compiler design and parsing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Steps to Run a Java Program ==


1. Install JDK (google for the download link)

2. Add JDK's /bin directory to your %PATH% (google for that too)

3. Write a Java Program (here is a simple one: class Hello { public static void main(String args[]) { System.out.println(&quot;hello, world!&quot;); } }

4. Save it as Hello.java

5. Type javac Hello.java (This compiles and creates the Bytecode)

6. Type java Hello (This executes the Bytecode in the VM)

== eclipse shortcut==
1. Ctrl + Shift + t = find class

== Ubuntu important command line ==
1. sudo sh shutdown.sh = restart tomcat server

2. sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart = restart server</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I chose to edit that part of the wiki about the poor advertisement for the strength club because I am one of the many students who attends to the gym on a regular basis so I see these advertisements and videos that they provide the public to see. But I also realize that without these posters and such in the gym that I would not know anything about this event, so I can see both sides from being in the gym and not being in the gym to see how well this club does in advertising themselves.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section about leadership I felt needed revision because it just started into different skills that a leader needs. It gave no kind of introduction to what was being discussed other then the title.  I also decided to discuss this because I have always been intrigued by what are the key skills that separate a leader from just a team member. Ive always felt I could lead people but people never really followed my ideas, so naturally I became just a normal group member in many of the activities that I attended.  I have always just been curious about the human psychology that makes some humans want to lead and others follow.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">     The Fundraising section needed revision because it wasn't specific enough. Before it talked about how groups without funds would have a difficult time promotting there message without funds, which is too obvious of a message. I said that some do fundraising all year or just once and go to parents or do activities for money.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hope this is where you meant by 'talk page?'

I added a paragraph to the Suggestions For Future Chapters sections because, and I tired to convey this, for all the work we did, I'd like a little comfort in knowing that it wasn't a waste of time. Maybe it didn't need to be added for the good of the clubs, but more for the good of the students. It may be the ego inflated Americanism in me, but why shouldn't we students get something out of this besides a grade?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I made an edit to the inscriptions section of communication.  This section of the article said that &quot;many do not realize that inscription is a form of communication.&quot;  I disagreed with this point.  I think that, in our society especially, we are very aware of how appearance is a form of communication and how it can change the ways in which we are viewed.  I also added a sentence about the importance of first impression.  I felt that this was a point that was neglected in the article that should not have been.  It was implied that inscription makes an impression on how people are viewed, but it was not explicitly said that inscription is almost always the first impression.  I added this because I felt it was an important component to the inscription article.</text>

 | valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Toxicodendron radicans'' (Poison Ivy)'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''''Toxicodendron radicans''''' (poison ivy) is a deciduous woody vine or shrub common throughout the Mid-Atlantic, and is one of the most problematic weeds because the oils it contains causes severe rashes in most people. 

The plant can be difficult to identify because the leaflets have a great variation in shape, but they are always trifoliate, alternate on the stem, and usually have a reddish petiole. The bark is a warm gray color to cinnammon reddish brown. Mature vines exhibit hair like rootlets resemble rusty steel wool when climbing. Like [[../Hedera helix|English ivy]] and many other climbing vines, the mature form has branches that grow perpendicular to the main vine produce small yellowish white flowers and greenish looking fruits. Flowers are yellowish green in early summer, while the white/grey drupes (seeds) mature in autumn, often persist through winter. 

All parts of the plant contain the oil [[w:urushiol|urushiol]], which is the chemical responsible for causing an allergic reaction ([[w:Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis|Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis]]). The toxin is present all year, and persists in dormant branches and dead fallen leaves. 

The prolific plant seeds are spread by wind, small rodents, and birds. The drupes serve as an important persistent food source. Once spring arrives seedlings will be found growing anywhere birds, mammals congregate, particularly where they perch or hide, such as on fences, shrubs, and small trees. 

== Removal ==
Removal of poison ivy requires special care, especially by susceptible individuals. Slightest skin contact can be neutralized by &quot;washing&quot; the skin immediately with soil to bind the urushiol (urushi oil), and there are a number of soaps available to remove the oils as well. Tools exposed to the plant, especially its sap, should not be reused or handled without thorough cleansing.

While the hazard of the urushiol makes it difficult to work with this plant, its root systems tends to be shallow and relatively easy to remove. The roots contain the highest urushiol concentrations 

When removing from trees, the vine can simply be cut at the base by removing a 1-2&quot;  x - section using pruners, lopers or a straight bladed saw (it is difficult to avoid cutting the tree's bark using a curved saw). 

When cutting large vines or cutting up trees that are covered in the vine with a chainsaw, always use the top of the cutting blade to throw any sap away from the chainsaw operator.

== Disposal ==
Disposal of poison ivy must always be approached with utmost care, since the plant material, dead or alive always contains urushiol, and can cause the known rash to occur. 

It never should be burned, since burning causes the urushiol to vaporize into aerosol, makes it airborne, and can cause severe respiratory problems or even death if inhaled. As it causes your lungs to internally blister next causing you to drown in your own fluids. Vines located on fire wood thoroughly need to be removed prior to burning of wood
Poison ivy can be chipped and hot composted, but care should be taken to segregate the chips since they should not be used as uncomposted mulch on pathways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is a review of the rights of Muslims, the criticism of Islam, and the condition of Islam in a variety countries.  Views from both the Qur'an, and its cited interpretation, and the views of critics of Islam will be included into discussion.
{{quote|Allah does not forbid you respecting those who have not made war against you on account of (your) religion, and have not driven you forth from your homes, that you show them kindness and deal with them justly; surely Allah loves the doers of justice.  &lt;ref&gt;[[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/koran/koran-idx?type=DIV0&amp;byte=870663 Koran 60:8]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical context==
This correct understanding, perversely, first led to wars that united Arab tribes into a nation and later initiated the Islamic Empire and [[w:Islamic Golden Age|The Golden Age of Islam]].  This period extended from the second to the ninth century of the Muslim calender which is the 7th to 13th century after the common epoch (ACE).  At this time Islamic scholars evolved new legal, philosophical, and religious understandings.  Artists, engineers, scholars, poets, philosophers, geographers, and traders in the Islamic world contributed to the arts, agriculture, economics, industry, law, literature, navigation, philosophy, sciences, sociology, and technology, both by preserving and building upon earlier traditions and by adding inventions and innovations of their own.  Historian Howard Turner noted that: &quot;Muslim artists and scientists, princes and laborers together made a unique culture that has directly and indirectly influenced societies on every continent&quot;.

Eventually, the Mongols and Turks that conquered and settled in parts of Persia, Central Asia, Russia, and Anatolia converted to Islam, and formal, inflexible state religions emerged which dictated that there could be no further development of human understanding of God's intent for mankind, and further, prohibited any artistic representation of God's handiwork, thus effectively suppressing inquiry into the natural world. 

Elsewhere, much of Islam retreated into traditionalism and the huge technical innovations of the Islamic Golden Age were frequently rejected, except by the medieval Christian invaders of the Iberian Peninsula, who merged Muslim and Byzantine traditions at the beginning of the 13th century ACE. The end of the medieval period marked the beginning of the transformation of European higher education that would eventually result in the modern research universities from which emerged religious reformation and schism ({{nowrap|16th &amp;ndash; 17th}} century ACE), academic enlightenment (18 Century ACE) and eventually the hydrocarbon and electronic economy of the 19th and 20th Century ACE.

Islamic orthodoxy was widely imposed by brutal state force from about the 14th century until quite recently, and external developments by Christians and Buddhists were often rejected as 'un-Islamic'.  Yet  many Muslims continued to evolve new interpretations of their traditional teachings.  One of the most controversial of these is the [[w:Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i Faith]], a monotheistic religion founded by Bahá'u'lláh in nineteenth-century Persia.  Baha'i claims to emphasize the spiritual unity and teaches the integration of all religions of all humankind by claiming that God's messengers have included Krishna, Buddha, and others, including Abraham and Christ who were canonized by the author of the central religious text of Islam.

In classical Arabic, ''Islam'' is not a proper noun, but a reference to submission or assention. Therefore, this book uses ''The Assent'' to refer to Islam as a way of Life and ''Islam'' to refer to it as a religion. Similarly, ''The Assenter'' refers to the followers of the way of life, while ''Moslems'' refers to the followers of the religion. The title of this book uses the word ''Islam'' instead of ''Islamic'' to further emphasize its descriptive use rather than a proper noun.

== Holy Qur'an ==
The ''Holy Qur'an'' as it exists today was compiled by Muhammad's companions ([[w:sahabah|Sahaba]]) in approximately 650, and is accepted by all Muslim denominations.  It was revealed to the Last Prophet of God on Earth, Muhammad, peace and blessings of God be upon him and all the prophets and messengers before him.  This Last Revelation of God on Earth, was given the Prophet through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). 

* in Qur'an there is one Souraa about Jesus and there isn't for Prophet Mohammad.
* in Qur'an there is one Souraa about Jesus mother Mariam and there isn't for the Prophet's parents.
This shows emphatically that Muhammad was not the author of the Qur'an, and the Surat about Jesus and Mary, and other Surat in the Qur'an explain that Jesus was a Prophet a messenger from God. Jesus furthermore, as explained in the Qur'an, was born without a father (virgin birth), and that he is not the son of God. 

=== Islam ===
The [[w:Amman Message|Amman Message]] issued on 9 November 2004 (27th of Ramadan 1425 AH) recognizes eight legal schools of thought (''[[w:Madhab|madhāhib]]'') and the varying strains of Islamic theology viz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__One of the most effective ways to control perennial weeds in the organic garden is to use the &quot;newspaper-and-mulch method&quot;. The way it works is quite simple: the newspaper acts as a physical barrier which prevents perennial weeds from growing above-ground, which over time starves the plants, since they are unable to photosynthesize. The results are very good if it’s done properly.

This method should not be used around some shallow-rooted shrubs (particularly some plants in [[../Ericaceae/]]). Digging dogs and squirrels can undo the barriers as well, so the treated areas need to be monitored carefully if these animals are present in the garden. The method works very well for some of the worst common weeds in the region, including:

*[[../Cirsium arvense/]] (Canada Thistle)
*[[../Trifolium/]] (Clover)
*[[../Artemisia vulgaris/]] (mugwort)

It can also be used to kill lawns in preparation for adding a bed the following year, or as a base layer for [[../raised beds/]].

==Tools and Materials==
*'''Newspaper or cardboard:''' A large amount of newspaper of cardboard is needed, since to be effective the barrier beeds to be at least 1 cm (about 1/3 inch) thick when wet. Newspaper can often be attained from local recycling centers, cardboard from supermarkets (call the market first and ask them to save it). 
*'''Plastic or metal bins:''' Shallow, flat bottomed containers to hold water, large enough to fit a folded newspaper section. This might not be useful when using cardboard, depending on the size of the boxes.
*'''Covering material:''' Mulch, compost, soil, or gravel needs to be put on top of the paper to keep it from blowing away (and to hide it from sight).
 
==Site preparation==
Once all the materials are together, it’s time to prepare the area for application. If it is a new bed (without ornamental plants already growing), start by mowing or weed-wacking as close to the ground as possible. Tilling is also an option, as long as you can get the soil good and smooth afterwards, and compact it a bit with a rake. Make sure that the outermost 6 inches or so of the bed are as weed-free as possible, so plants can't just grow around the barrier.

If there are already ornamental plants growing, more care is needed. Shrubs and small trees with shallow root systems will not appreciate having paper on their roots, so you’ll need to carefully hand-weed within their driplines. Outside the dripline, cultivate just as you would on a new bed. Perennials are usually OK with the newspaper laid within 4” of their crowns. 

If the bed is badly invaded with running weeds like bindweed, thistle, goutweed, it’s usually better to just cut everything down to the ground, transplant and [[../Quarantine|quarantine]] the shrubs, and apply newspaper to the entire area.

==Application==
Prepare the newspaper by thoroughly soaking it in water to give it weight and help it bind together. The easiest system for doing this is to have two tubs of water, so one tub can be used for soaking while you pull paper out of the other one. 

Once the paper is thoroughly wet, begin laying it down on top of the soil. Use whole sections, not unfolded, and let them overlap by 1/2, so that the entire soil surface has 2 sections on it, at least 1/4 inch thick (1/2 inch is even better). Once the paper is down, pat the sections together so they’ll start to form a continuous layer. This layer will keep perennial weeds or turf from poking through, effectively smothering the weeds and denying them light. Leave at least 2 inches on the outer portion of the bed to allow for edging without having to cut through the paper.

Once the paper is down, and before it starts to dry, start laying down mulch on top. Don’t dump wheelbarrows on the paper, but instead place it by hand, to avoid disturbing the newspaper as much as possible (unlike mulching without a barrier, it's actually better to go from front to back, rather than back to front). Put on enough mulch to thoroughly cover the paper, as this will not only look nicer, but will also prevent the wind from blowing the paper around the yard. 

If it’s a “must plant” location, use 6 inches of compost instead of mulch, and grow annuals and shallow rooting vegetables on top (keep in mind that you’ll need to water the bed more often than the surrounding soil, because soil moisture will not wick up through the paper barrier as much as it would if the paper wasn’t there). With that much compost sitting atop the bed, it’s a good idea to use some logs on the edge (on top of the paper) to keep it from washing into adjacent areas.

==Maintenance==
As a rule, you’ll want to leave the bed alone for about a year to ensure that the perennial weeds are completely smothered. Use the area in the meantime for containers, ornaments, to store new plant acquisitions in, or as the quarantine site for any shrubs you might have moved. 

Make a regular inspection for tenacious weeds that might try to pop through the paper, and if you see any, brush the mulch aside, find the hole they’re using, and add a patch layer of newspapers to seal it up.

Once you’ve had a full year without any weeds poking through, it’s safe to till the bed and start growing in it. Keep in mind that there will still be weed seeds in the soil, but the pernicious perennials will be history, as long as you keep on top of the new seedlings. If using a tiller, remove any large pieces of paper and add them to the compost pile, as they are a carbon source and may divert nitrogen from the soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book deals with the problem of using Java to make connections to databases and successfully handle data in the databases. It assumes a basic understanding of Java concepts.

The example database used is freely available as a download from http://www.sqlite.org/; at time of writing the recommended version was Version 3.6.14.2. It is recommended that you download a copy of this if you intend to proceed with this tutorial since it will allow you to visit your databases independently of the Java programs to assess and evaluate the data structures and contents. In addition to this you will also need a functional Java JDK, optimally release 1.5 or higher since this gives support to the much improved JDBC 2.0 drivers; ideally you will have the very latest Java release. You will also need a downloaded copy of the JDBC jar file in order to connect your Java programs to the database. The JDBC jar files can be found at a number of locations (e.g. http://www.xerial.org/trac/Xerial/wiki/SQLiteJDBC). Most of what is said in here can equally well be applied to any other database connection; the reason SQLite is used is because of its exceedingly low and lightweight costs, and because there is a freely available front end for further investigation of data and data structures.

In summation then, you need:

* a reference copy of SQLite from http://www.sqlite.org/
* a JDK
* a SqLite jar file 

A basic explanation of JDBC drivers and their usage is available on Wikipedia at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Principles of GI Function==
===Neural Control of GI Function===
The gut is controlled by its own nervous system the Enteric nervous system, as well as the parasympathetic and the sympathetic systems
====Enteric Nervous System====
The GI system has its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system with about 100 million cells, the same number as the spinal cord! This nervous system lies entirely within the gut, and can function quite independently of the central and autonomic nervous system. Bowel removed from any contact with an animal is capable of rhythmical contractions! It starts in the esophagus and runs the entire length of the gut down to the anus.

It consists of two plexuses, the submucosal, which runs  by the muscularis mucosa, and the myenteric plexus that runs between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers. The two plexuses are connected to each other.

The myenteric plexus is mainly organized as longitudinal chains of neurons. when stimulated this plexus increases the tone of the gut as well as the velocity and intensity of contractions. This plexus is concerned with motility throughout the whole gut. Inhibition of the myenteric system helps to relax sphincters. 

The submucosal plexus is more involved with local conditions and controls local secretion, absorption, as well as local muscle movements.

The mucosa and epithelium also have sensory nerve endings that feed signals to the both layers of the enteric plexus as well as sending information back to the sympathetic pre-vertebral ganglia, the spinal corn and to the brain stem. This arangement is shown in the following diagram.
 
[[File:Neural control gut.png]]

Numerous transmitters seem to be involved, the more important of which are '''acetylcholine''' and '''norepinephrine'''. The former exites gut activity, the latter inhibits it.

====Parasympathetic Innervation====
The effect of parasympathetic stimulation is to increase activity in the entire enteric nervous system
The proximal half of the nervous system is innervated from the '''cranial parasympathetic''' nerve fibers via the '''Vagal Nerve'''. The distal half is innervate via the Sacral Parasympathetic nerves. The later gives a rich supply to the Sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, and are important in controlling defecation.

====Sympathetic Innervation====
The fibers originate in the sympathetic ganglia of T-5 to L-2 and terminate mainly on the enteric plexuses, but also a few nerves terminate  in the mucosa it self. Stimulation of the enteric nerves by the sympathetic system ''inhibits'' GI activity. It does this in a minor way with the direct effect of its secreted norepinephrine, and in a major way by inhibiting action in the enteric plexuses.

====Afferent Sensory Innervation====
Numerous afferent sensory fibers innervate the gut.  Some have their cell bodies in the enteric plexus, and some in the Spinal cord. As well as sending information concerning irritation and over distension, they can also pick up the presence of chemical signals in the gut. 80% of the fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent, and these send signals all the way to the medulla for processing.

====Gastrointestinal Reflexes====
GI reflexs can be considered:
#Local
#Regional
#Systemic
'''Local reflexes''' are processed entirely within the enteric system and control secretion, local motility, mixing contractions etc.

'''Regional reflexes''' go back to the sympathetic ganglia, and are important for reflexes at a distant, such as the '''gastro-colic''' reflex causing evacuation of the colon, and messages from the intestine to the stomach to inhibit emptying, the '''entero-gastric''' reflex, or the '''colono-ilial''' reflx that inhibits emptying of the ilial contents into the colon.

'''Systemic reflexes''' are processed in the spinal cord or brainstem and will control overall activity of the GI system, for example pain reflexes that will inhibit the entire GI system.

===Hormonal Control of Gastrointestinal Function===
Here is a brief overview of the hormones affecting Gastrointestinal mobility. They will be further reviewed in the sections on motility and digestion.
====Gastrin====
Secreted by the 'G' cells of the antrum of the stomach in response to an ingestion of a meal, Gastrin stimulates Gastric acid secretion and the growth of Gastric mucosa
====Cholecystokinin====
Secreted by the 'I' cells of the duodenum and Jejunum in response to the the digestive products of fatty acids, Cholecystokinin causes contraction of the gall bladder. To a lesser extent it also decreases emptying of the stomach.
====Secretin====
The first GI hormone to be discovered, Secretin is secreted by the 'S' cells of the duodenum in response to the presence of acidic chyme. It acts to increase pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate to neutralize the acid chyme. 
====Gastric Inhibitory peptide====
Secreted in the mucosa of the upper small intestine in response to the products of digestion. It inhibits motility in the stomach, thus delaying stomach emptying.
====Motilin====
Secreted by the duodenum during fasting, it increases gastrointestinal motility causing ''hunger pangs''.

===Gastro-intestinal blood flow===
Blood supply is via. the Splanchnic circulation (see Anatomy Chapter above).
====Local Factors affecting Blood flow====
Normally blood supply to the gut is controlled by local factors which match supply with activity. During absorption blood supply to the mucosa will be increased; during increased motor activity blood supply to the muscles will be increased. this is accomplished by several local factors:
#Vasodilator substances relesed from the mucosa during digestion which include cholesystokinin, secretin, and gastrin.
#Kinin release including kallidin and bradykinin which are powerful vasodilators. These are released by some glands when they secrete into the lumen.
#decreased O&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tension due to metabolic activity will also cause increased blood flow.
====Nervous control of GI Blood flow====
'''Parasympathetic''' stimulation will increase overall blood flow to the gut as well as increasing secretions and general gut activity.

'''Sympathetic''' stimulation will have the opposite effect. The effect of sympathetic stimulation often only lasts a few minutes, then an autoregulatory effect takes over restoring the blood supply to normal. However this shutting off of the blood supply acts to increase flow to other areas of the body in time of stress. Sympathetic stimulation can also cause contraction of the Splanchnic veins, making as much as half a liter of volume available to the general circulation.

==Business Intelligence and Business Intelligence System==

Rapid advances in computer technology allow business intelligence (BI) systems to provide managers with access to a tremendous amount of data.  To function these systems combine complex front-end software with ETL capabilities that extract enormous amounts of data.  At the heart of these systems are huge enterprise data warehouses that can populate a possible infinite combination of advanced reports, OLAP cubes and datasets for data mining.  The underlying belief is that technically advanced systems are the most important drivers of effective decision making.  Based on this belief BI vendors focus on technologically advanced systems while paying relatively little attention to whether these systems meet the needs of decision makers.

The drive towards technological sophistication and away from improving decision making is one of the reasons for the low success rates (50%), high costs and time overruns associated with BI projects.   While vendors and information technology departments get the technology right they often fail to deliver a product that is useful to management.  Executives and managers will reject BI systems that do not facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve strategic and operational effectiveness.  What practitioners fail to understand is that technologically advanced software, by itself, does not allow management to perform these vital functions.

Effective business intelligence systems must account for the goal oriented behavior of decision makers.  One way to incorporate the purposive behavior of decision makers in BI systems is the use of the frame as the basic building block of a pervasive BI system architecture.  It does this since a frame is a &quot;scheme of interpretation&quot; in which the particulars of events and activities are organized and made sensible (Goffman 1974).  The frame organizes the world according to the goal oriented behavior of the frame owner.  Specifically, the frame captures the two parts of decision makers' goal oriented behavior.  The first are the objectives disseminated from the ESM in the form of scorecards.  These provide the goals that guide the activities of the business unit.  The other part is the experience of the business unit leader.  It is their experience that provides the guidance for how to achieve the objectives.  The goal oriented behavior of the frame owner is codified in a business unit strategy map based on the objectives that the unit must achieve along with the means of achieving those objectives.

At the heart of this system are strategy maps and scorecards.  We propose strategy maps can be used to organize the company as a system since each scorecard contains the necessary elements to create a control system.  A control system requires a measuring unit, norm, comparator and correction unit.  The analogs in a scorecard are the measures, budgets, reports and initiatives.  The importance of the control system is that it allows the business unit leader to evaluate and correct issues that impede operational effectiveness.  Once management is certain they are operating effectively they can report to executives.

An important aspect of this system is that each BI subsystem can operate independently of all other subsystem.  As a system each BI subsystem is both unique and complete.  For this reason the creation of a pervasive BI system begins with the creation of BI subsystems at all levels of the organization.  Each one can function as a distinct unit prior to the creation of the system.  Further, it is possible to fix problems in any one subsystem without interfering with the operations of the whole system.   

Upon completion of the subsystems these frames are then combined into a framework.  A framework stacks frames horizontally and vertically.  Executives can use the framework to determine if all business units are operationally effective.  Each executive can have a BI system that allows him/her to access information from any subsystem.  This is because they have a system built based on their frame.  They use this subsystem to control other subsystems.

This pervasive business intelligence system provides two important contributions.  First, it significantly increases the likelihood that they system will not only be deployed but will be accepted by users.  The system is design for decision makers based on their needs as outlined in their business unit strategy map.  They outline the reports that are necessary based on the combination of objectives from their superiors' strategy map and their experiences.

The other important contribution is the ability to evaluate both strategic and operational effectiveness.  As Porter (1996) argues operational and strategic effectiveness are both necessary for success.  However, it is first necessary to achieve operational effectiveness.   Each subsystem facilitates the analysis and reporting of business unit operational effectiveness.  After ensuring operational effectiveness executives can then examine strategy effectiveness.

Finally, it is easy to make changes to the system if it is not effective.  For instance, if a business unit is not achieving operational effectiveness then executives can determine why it is not successful.  Remedies can be taken, such as allocating further resources or attempting to align frames in the case that operations does not share the same beliefs as management.  If the organization is operationally effective but strategically ineffective then executives need to reformulate the strategy.  Once they make the necessary strategic changes they then disseminate a new strategy map and cascade scorecards.  This allows the system to change.

Most definitions agree that BI &quot;refers to skills, technologies, applications and practices used to help a business acquire a better understanding of its commercial context. Business intelligence may also refer to the collected information itself.&quot;  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence]

In addition, &quot;Common functions of business intelligence technologies are reporting, OLAP, analytics, data mining, business performance management, benchmarks, text mining, and predictive analytics.&quot;   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence]
Finally, &quot;Business intelligence often aims to support better business decision-making.  Thus a BI system can be called a decision support system (DSS).&quot; [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence]

These definitions focus on the skills and functions.  However, prior to engaging in the activities involved in BI or using the technologies there must be a system in place.  There is a difference between BI ''activities'' and BI ''systems''.  We take the comprehensive view that building and maintaining a BI system are closely tied with using the system.

==Business Intelligence==

Business Intelligence allows the decision maker to understand their business and the business environment in order to make informed decisions.  Decision making requires evaluating performance (what happened), testing hypotheses (why and how things happened) and predicting future events (what may happen).  Stated simply management needs to know if their strategies are sound and if they are being carried out.  Most formally a Business Intelligence system allows the user to answer any of the following questions:

#Why did it happen?: X--&gt;Y 
#* Did X cause Y to happen?
#* If we do X then will Y happen?
# How did it happen?: X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
#* How did X produce Y?
#* Can we be certain that X will produce Y, or that Z is actually producing Y?
#What happened?: Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; versus Y&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
#* What happened versus what we expected to happen
#* Assuming X produces Y, are we really doing X?
#What may happen?: X&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; 
#* If X&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in the future then will Y&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; also occur?
#* Assuming we did X and it produced Y, can we assume that continuing to do X will continue to produce Y?

'''Definitions''':
&lt;li&gt;X: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable Independent variable]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable Dependent variable]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: Specific instance of X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Specific instance of Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;: X in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;: Y in the future&lt;/li&gt;


The purpose of this wikibook is to present a process for developing a Business Intelligence (BI) system that will allow the analyst to ask and answer these questions.  The process of creating this system is outlined in sections 1 and 2 of this book.  This book takes the reader through each stage (planning, development and production) of the process, step-by-step, in detail.  

Before moving forward it is necessary to define some concepts.  It is important to understand exactly what is meant by a system.  One way to look at a system is that it is composed of both an architecture (blueprint) and infrastructure (people, process and technology).  Architecture is &quot;the set of rules or structures providing the framework for the overall design of a system or product.&quot;  (Poe et al. 1998)  Technical Infrastructure is defined (Poe et al. 1998) as the &quot;technologies, platforms, databases, gateways, and other components necessary to make the architecture functional within the corporation.&quot;  Other components are assumed to mean the people and processes necessary to deploy and maintain the infrastructure.  This book therefore defines infrastructure as the people, process and technologies necessary to implement a BI architecture.

This book adopts the current methodology of building a Business Intelligence system from the top-down.  Top-down refers to understanding the business strategy and then building the system so the decision makers can determine if the strategy is effective and that the strategy is being successfully implemented.  The framework approach explicitly embeds strategy in the Business Intelligence system architecture.  This is accomplished by first formalizing the strategy in the form of diagrams and using these diagrams to create the system.  In this way the diagrams become part of the Business Intelligence architecture.  

The explicit statement of strategy is crucial because the purpose of Business Intelligence is to test formal theories and hypotheses about strategy in order to validate the strategy or to monitor performance.  As each part of the strategy diagram is verified the company can have confidence that aligning the day-to-day activities with the strategy will help the company create value.  Once this is accomplished the system allows management to monitor business performance.  Further, if the company is not profitable and the strategy is indeed being executed effectively then management can take steps to determine reformulate the strategy.

==Definition of BI==

The purpose of Business Intelligence (BI) is to provide decision makers with the information necessary to make informed decisions.  The information is delivered by the Business Intelligence system via reports. This book focuses on the architecture and infrastructure needed to deliver the information.  An architecture is a set of rules or structures providing a framework for the overall design of a system or product (Poe et al. 1998). The BI system includes the following parts:

*Interested parties and their respective information needs 
*Input of data
*Storage of data
*Analysis of data
*Automatic and selective dissemination of information

A BI system includes the rules (architecture) providing a framework for the organization of the technologies, platforms, databases, gateways, people and processes. To implement an architecture the Business Intelligence architect must implement an infrastructure.  Technical infrastructures are the technologies, platforms, databases, gateways, people and processes necessary to make the architecture functional within the corporation (Poe et al. 1998).  

In sum, decision makers need reports that deliver the information that allows them to understand his/her organization and the world in order to make better decisions.

Given these functions of the BI system the most enduring definition focuses on the system, tools, technology, process, and techniques that compose these four elements that help decision makers understand their world.  BI augments the ability of decision makers to turn data into information by aiding in extracting data from data sources, organizing the data based on established business knowledge and then presenting the information in a manner that is organized in a way to be useful to the decision maker.  It merges technology with knowledge in order to provide useful information to management as quickly as possible.

In sum, Business Intelligence system includes the rules (architecture) that outline how to organize the parts of the system (infrastructure) to deliver the information needed to thrive in a competitive market (business) or to provide the best service to the people (government) (Poe et al.1998).  Regardless of the technology, which are simply tools, the core of a Business Intelligence system has and will not change.  

==History of BI==

''In the beginning...''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Leonardo da Vinci, the famous Italian know-it-all, toyed with the idea of an open source BI platform, but abandoned the project when he discovered that open source and Business Intelligence needed to be invented first.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Pentaho website, largest open source Business Intelligence provider''

In reality, H. P. Luhn (1958), in writing on Business Intelligence systems, wrote “The system described here employs rather advanced design techniques and the question arises as to how far away such systems may be from realization.”  The system needed techniques and technologies much more advanced than were available at the time.  He noted:

{{cquote|The availability of documents in machine-readable form is a basic requirement of the system.  Typewriters with paper-tape punching attachments are already used extensively in information  processing and communication operations.  Their use as standard equipment in the future  would provide machine-readable records of new information.  The transcription of old records would pose a problem, since in most cases it would be uneconomical to perform this job by hand.  The mechanization of this operation will therefore have to wait until print-reading devices have been perfected.|||H. P. Luhn}}

In 1989 Howard Dresner proposed BI as an umbrella term to describe &quot;concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems.&quot; It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread (Wikipedia).  

The most rapid (but not important) developments in the history of BI focus on vendor innovation.  Architecture changes very slowly and existed before the technology was available to create BI systems.  The creation of the technology, and the subsequent rapid development of tools by BI vendors, requires 

==Vendors==

Business Intelligence infrastructures rely on technology to turn data into intelligence.  Vendor innovations are the heart of innovation.  The rate of innovation has continued to rise since the 1990's.  Not only do vendors create new products and improve on existing ones but immitation means technology diffuses quite quickly between companies.

At the same time vendor products are becoming more advanced ease-of-use is also increasing.  These seemingly counterveilling forces are actually complementary.  This is because there is general agreement the needs of the user has not changed substantially.  For instance, as Poe et al. (1998) note &quot;While the products and technologies surrounding and complementing data warehouse implementation have become much more refined, the process of actually building a data warehouse has not significantly changed.&quot;  The same can be said of most Business Intelligence system components.  User needs and architecture changes much slower than technology but technology must be tailored to the needs of the user.  Therefore, the focus should always be on the enduring parts of the BI system without focusing on any one vendor or technology.

==Vendor Products and Tools==

Business intelligence begin to evolve in 1990's.  Business intelligence is now a mature field.  Mature in this context means that there are a core set of products and services offered by vendors.

{{cquote|Business intelligence tools are a type of application software designed to report, analyze and present data. The tools generally read data that have been previously stored, often, though not necessarily, in a data warehouse or data mart.|||Wikipedia (Business intelligence tools)}}

The key general categories of business intelligence tools are (Wikipedia Business intelligence tools):

* Spreadsheets
* Reporting and querying software - are tools that extract, sort, summarize, and present selected data 
* OLAP 
* Digital Dashboards 
* Data mining 
* Process mining 
* Business performance management 

Each tool can be sold in a variety of ways, include as standalone tools, within a suite of tools, as components of software targeted to a specific industry, within a web-based Business Intelligence 2.0 infrastructure, or packaged into data warehouse appliances.

The most important development in the vendor space is acquisitions.  The recent trend in the marketplace is for larger companies to acquire smaller companies (Richardson et al. 2008).  This has consolidated the BI market share.  The largest include:

*2008 - IBM purchases Cognos for $5 billion 
*2008 - SAP purchases Business Objects for € 4.8 billion 
*2007 - Oracle purchases Hyperion for $3.3 billion

Note that a few business intelligence vendors own a substantial share of the market.  The following figure shows market share by vendor between 2006 and 2007.

==Purpose of businesses==

Finally, this text makes a simple assumption regarding the purpose of for-profit businesses.  The purpose of businesses is to generate profits.  The best companies achieve superior profitability over time.  They do this through strategic positioning, meaning performing different activities from rivals' or performing similar activities in a different way.  Specifically, to achieve profits companies can focus two different types of activities.  The first is for companies to provide goods or services with greater value, charge higher prices, thereby increasing revenue.  The second type of activity aims to provide goods or services at a lower cost, reduce costs, thereby increasing profitability (Porter 1997).

This approach is also useful for existing systems.  The goal of this book is to present a way to think about BI systems.  Companies and their business environment constantly change.  Competitive businesses must change in order to remain viable.  BI systems allow companies to determine if the environment is changing and if their strategy will remain effective in the new landscape.  BI should be considered a constantly evolving system and the process presented in this book should be applied iteratively in order to continuously update the BI system.

==Future of BI==

The Gartner Group makes a couple predictions about the future of BI.  First, between 2009 and 2012, more than 35 per cent of the top 5,000 global companies will regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets ([http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Group]).  Faced with the need to make better decisions companies will seek to increase their investments in BI systems.  

Another important prediction is that business units will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for BI despite the fact that IT departments are responsible for building and maintaining the BI infrastructure ([http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Group]).  The reason for this situation is that business users have lost confidence in the ability of IT departments to deliver the information they need to make decisions ([http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Group]).  Faced with these problems it is no wonder that the business unit will take it into their own hands to create the BI infrastructure.  A BI system that does not meet the users' needs will fail.  This is because the failure of a BI system to deliver useful information can have a strong, negative impact on decision making.

However, IT departments are charged with building and maintaining IT infrastructures they are better suited to this role.  Again, although IT organizations excel at building BI infrastructures, business users have lost confidence in their ability to deliver the information they need to make decisions.  

Not surprisingly there are risks when business units create their own BI infrastructures.

{{cquote|By making purchases independently of the IT organization, business units risk creating silos of applications and information, which will limit cross-function analysis, add complexity, and delay to corporate planning and execution of changes...IT organizations can overcome this by encouraging business units to use existing assets and create standards for purchasing classes of packaged analytic applications that minimize the impact of isolated functions.|||Garner Group|http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714}}

Building on existing resources is an excellent way to develop a BI system.  However, this does not solve the problem.  An important step is that business units and IT departments must accept that BI systems are composed of architecture and an infrastructure.  The business unit should lead the creation of the architecture whereas the IT department should lead the creation of the infrastructure.  Ideally, the company will have a cross-function BI unit that creates, maintains and updates all BI systems.  This allows each group to perform the function they are best at and use resources as efficiently as possible.

This book presents a methodology to build this type of system.  By dividing the building of frames and frameworks into three distinct stages it allows the business unit and IT department to focus on what they do best.  Further, this approach encourages and demonstrates a process by which business units and IT departments can work together to build a BI system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I decided to add extra info on the importance of leadership because I feel that it is the most important aspect of any group or organization. I felt that more needed to be said about the importance of leadership and the way it affects a group. In the SMASH club for instance, their numbers were smaller than previous years because their leader had graduated and no one had taken his place. So the group is without proper leadership and that shows in their smaller numbers and lack of organization.</text>

      <comment>EDIT D</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I made a change to a paragraph about the club I investigated (Women in the Woods). This edit was made in Chapter 6, under the Leadership section. In the original paragraph, the flow didn't really make sense. I felt like the grammer could be changed and more things could be added becuase it was only a short paragraph and some things weren't mentioned. I added input on why when leaders graduate they need to choose a new leader that posses fantatic leadership qualities. Because if a strong leader isn't chosen clubs and their information could be potentially lost. I felt like this was a good contribution becuase if current club leaders at WWU look at our wikibook they will see that choosing a leader that has the same qualities (if not better) than them, then their club will succeed and the legacy will not be lost.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added my contribution to the indroduction about how animals also use music becuase I beleive that, althoguh music is recreational for most people, we tend to use music for the same things as animals sometimes. Sometimes a boy/girl will write a song for the one they love and sing it the same way a bird will sing for a potental mate.</text>

The '''social sciences''' are a group of academic disciplines that study the human aspects of the world. They diverge from the [[Wikibooks:Art bookshelf]] and [[Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf]] in that the social sciences emphasize the use of the scientific method and rigorous standards of evidence in the study of humanity.

      <comment>/* Direct contradiction with the Quran */ polarity of emphasis</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Islam in the United States}}
== Direct contradiction with the Quran ==
* Lax laws about morality. Permits the public expression of sexual acts to a certain degree.
* Permits torture. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almoslim.net/node/111400 التعذيب الديمقراطي,موقع المسلم]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Does not prohibit alchohol (though has an age limit on its consumption).
* Economic model [[w:Riba|not in accordance]] with the Quran.

== Opinions of muslims ==
* Many Muslims perceive the US cultural, political and economic hegemony as enemy number one.
* Muslims have more freedoms in the USA than in some Arab or Muslim countries.

== Opinions on Islam ==
Just as the opinions of Muslims on the United States, there is a wide spectrum of opinions on Islam amongst Americans.

After the September 11, 2001, terrorism acts hostile attitudes towards Muslims became noticeable and hate-crimes rose. Muslim communities and the government quickly intervened to educate the population and down-play some of the &quot;crusade&quot; talk first noticeable in the president's speech. This bore considerable fruit and only a minority sees Islam inherently violent, while most see it as vulnerable to &quot;misinterpretation&quot; as Christianity.

There is also the view that while Islam may not be inherently evil, its current manifestation is intolerant and promoting violence and intolerance, the latter being the foundation of peaceful coexistence.

Sharia law is viewed negatively as an unjust form of law, pitted against those who in lower social ranks, women in particular. This is largely tainted by the fact that most news reports of Sharia verdicts are those that Westerners will in general find shocking. Examples are the stoning of adulterers, in particular those where there is no breech of wedlock (e.g. two unwed people have sex) where even those Americans who consider it a sin would argue that it still was not a crime, and those where the victim of rape will be stoned as punishment while the perpetrators walk free.

[[File:Straciatella - bowl.JPG|thumb]]
Straciatella is an Italian egg-drop soup. It uses a chicken broth base, and adds flavour with fresh parsley, parmesan cheese, and pepper.

==Ingredients==
*4 cups of [[Cookbook:Chicken Broth|chicken broth]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*1/2 cup of shredded [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan cheese]]
*fresh chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] (~1/4 cup)
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Black pepper]] to taste (~1 tsp.)

===Optional===
Optionally, add some or all of the following for additional flavour:
*~1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*semolina
*red chili flakes, or chili powder

==Procedure==
*Put the broth in a large pot, and bring to a boil
*Separately, combine eggs, cheese, and parsley, and beat until the cheese and parsley are wet
*Once the broth is at a rolling boil, use a whisk to set the fluid whirling
**Slowly add the egg mixture, keeping the broth at a boil so the egg cooks quickly
**Remove from heat, and add pepper
**Serve immediately, or reheat and serve very hot.

If the egg flakes instead of forming ''stracciatelle'' (long, wispy and cloud-like shreds), then do something differently. I dunno what &lt;tt&gt;:)&lt;/tt&gt;

Since parmesan cheese is salty, it's unlikely you'll need to add more salt for flavour.</text>

&lt;h1&gt;Networking in Schools&lt;/h1&gt;

[[Image:YTSS_0758.JPG|left|250px|thumbnail]]
Networking is simply the act of connecting multiple computers together for the purpose of sharing information. A network also connects computers to printers, servers, other hardware, and to the Internet. There are different types of computer networks, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Network Wide Area Networks] (WAN) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area_network Metropolitan Area Networks] (MAN), but the type that is commonly used in a school setting is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN Local Area Network] (LAN). The types of networks are different because of their size and their reach. A LAN is suited for computers in close proximity to one another. While a LAN is the smallest type of computer network, it can easily accommodate thousands of computers. The proximity of the computers is what differs among the different types of networks. Most LANs are wired but schools are starting to use wireless networks more frequently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A school's computer network controls many functions of a school - e-mail, storage of private and public files, Internet access, human resources records, payroll, and student grades, to name a few. Because of this, it is vitally important that a school network is set up correctly and according to the school district's needs. A technology director should assess the needs of the people using the school network before designing and implementing the network infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are advantages and disadvantages to using computer networking in a school environment. It allows schools to cut costs because software licenses can be shared. It gives staff and students a central location to store files that can be accessed from any computer on the network. Also, as mentioned above, a network makes it easier to manage staff login accounts and integrate them into all password protected areas (like e-mail) - an example of this is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory Active Directory]. Some disadvantages include cost of network implementation and maintenance, and the need for experienced IT staff to manage the network. There is also the risk of hardware or software failure that could disrupt network access across the school district.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Networking Terminology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A networking cable is what connects the various types of hardware on a computer network. Many various types of cable can be used in a computer network, including unshielded twisted pair (UTP, commonly known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable CAT5]) or shielded twisted pair (STP) cable, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable. However, as mentioned above, some computer networks have gone wireless and may use less cables than before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ethernet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ethernet is the networking technology most commonly used for LANs. It connects the different parts of a computer network with twisted-pair (CAT5) cables, hubs and/or switches. Many computers currently are pre-configured to support Ethernet, where once it was required to purchase a network card to use the technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;IP Address&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An IP address is a unique identifier for a node in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol to communicate (IP stands for Internet Protocol). An IP address looks like this: 167.76.48.1. There are billions of possible IP address combinations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MAC Address&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A MAC address is assigned to a piece of network hardware when it is manufactured. It identifies network ports on a computer network, so a computer can have more than one MAC address if it has multiple network ports - for example, a wireless card and a port for an Ethernet cable will each have a MAC address. A MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number and looks like this: 00:B0:C9:17:C3:27. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Node&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A node is anything that is connected to a network - a computer, printer, server, modem, etc. On a LAN, every node has a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address MAC address], which is a unique number used to identify each node on a computer network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Proxy Servers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A proxy server allows a network administrator to filter what goes in and out of the network; it is a go-between between different servers. One example is a web proxy server, which allows schools to keep students from accessing unauthorized or inappropriate Web sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server&lt;/ref&gt; [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Directing_Technology/Network#Proxies View more information about proxies below]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Routers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A network router connects multiple networks to one another. It allows the computers to share information with each other, as well as share connections to other peripherals, such as printers. Routers also connect the computer network to the Internet, via a cable modem, broadband modem, or another similar device. For wireless networks, a wireless router will connect all of the devices on the network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Servers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A server is a specific computer (or multiple computers) on a network designed to handle the different functions of a network. Servers are usually equipped with extra memory and processing capabilities. Different types of servers include file servers, which store files and allow users to upload and download; web servers, which host Web site content and mail servers, to house a network's e-mail activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Switches and Hubs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A network switch connects the computers in a network together. A hub is similar, but in a network of four or more computers, it does not perform as well as a switch and it uses more bandwidth, especially in busy networks. Because of this, switches are used more often. The reason for the difference is that hubs pass network traffic through all of the computers connected to it, while switches are able to selectively route the traffic where it needs to go. Also, when there are many computers in a network, switches can be connected to each other if needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wireless&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A wireless network allows nodes to connect to the network without using cables. The node needs to be equipped with a wireless network card, and the network needs to have wireless routers. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi Wi-Fi] is a widely used wireless network that allows people to connect to the Internet. One disadvantage of a wireless network is that the connection speed is slower than a wired network. However, it allows for easier expansion of the network using laptops and other wireless-enabled devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Network Configurations&lt;/h1&gt;
[[Image:NetworkTopologies.png|200px|thumbnail|Diagram of different network topologies]]
The configuration of a computer network is referred to as topology. It is the arrangement of the nodes in the network and how they are connected. Different types of network topology include bus, star, tree, line, mesh, and ring. They are depicted in the diagram at the right, and described below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Bus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A bus topology is set up in a linear configuration, where all nodes are laid out in a line and are connected to a singular &quot;backbone&quot; cable. A failure in the backbone cable will bring down the whole network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Star&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A network using the star topology has a central hub to which all of the nodes are connected. It physically resembles the spokes of a bicycle tire. All of the nodes send their data to the central hub, but the nodes are not connected to each other, so if one node fails the others will not be affected. This topology is easy to set up, but requires more cable than the other configurations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Tree&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A tree topology configures the network in a hierarchy; combining characteristics of the bus and star topologies. One backbone cable (the top level of the hierarchy) connects multiple groups of nodes (the second level of the hierarchy). Each group of nodes is then arranged in a star topology configuration. This topology allows for more nodes to be added easily. But as in the bus topology, if the backbone cable fails, the whole network will go down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When a network is configured with the line topology, nodes are connected to each other as depicted in the diagram - a line of nodes connected to their two neighbors, with a node at each end only connected to one other node.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Mesh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A full mesh network has nodes that all connect to each other, so data can pass through the network in many ways. A partial mesh network may have some nodes that do not connect to others. It is a complex setup and may only be desired for small networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Ring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a ring topology network configuration, each node is connected to two other nodes. The data sent from each node travels in a circular manner through the nodes, and any problems with a single node can bring down the whole network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

These topologies can be combined to create more complex networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edrawsoft.com/Network-Topologies.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://compnetworking.about.com/od/networkdesign/a/topologies.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Monitoring Your Network&lt;/h1&gt;

It is crucial to constantly monitor network activity to discover problems such as slow connections, outages, or security issues. Things to monitor include connection and response times across the network, availability of nodes/routers/switches/etc., or a successful test of a Web server or e-mail server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A network can be monitored in many ways. A low-tech idea would be to manually time different network functions, such as how long it takes to open a document stored on the network. For large networks, many operating systems have built-in monitoring software. There are also many tools that can be purchased to monitor a network and notify the network administrator of any issues. [http://www.monitortools.com/networksystem/ MonitorTools.com] is an example of a Web site that lists many of the different options for network monitoring tools. A tool should be chosen only after the monitoring needs of a network are identified by network administrators or other IT professionals or administrators in the school district.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When a tool is in place for network monitoring, a network administrator must then review performance logs generated by the monitoring software to identify any problems. Performance logs can be scheduled to run at any time of day and should be run at different times during the day to identify busy network times.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, D. (2007). Networking for Dummies. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Firewall&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:World War 2 Memorial.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]A network firewall is a system or a device that is designed to limit, control or prevent access to a network connection. A firewall is the first device that is encountered when the connection is made from outside of a network that firewall resides on.  It is the last device that is being encountered when the connection is made from the inside the network that the firewall is located in. A firewall filters, enables, denies, encrypts, decrypts, or proxy all incoming our outgoing network traffic. The technology director will be responsible for purchasing or upgrading to an appropriate hardware of software that will operate the firewall. He will collaborate with a network administrator for installing and overseeing the functionality of the system. A firewall must be a solid and proven system that will withstand a high volume traffic, process and log the IP information, block and secure possible DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. For more information about Firewall consider the following resources.&lt;br&gt;

Wikipedia - &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(networking)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
HowStuffWorks - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.howstuffworks.com/firewall.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Barracudanetworks -&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howstuffworks.com/firewall.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Firewall Ports&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A firewall typically operates by restricting TCP and UDP ports. For example a firewall may be set up let any communication ports to be transmitted to a specific IP address. This is called a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone_(computing)&lt;/ref&gt;forward. Instead of exposing entire network to incoming port requests, a DMZ is set up to establish connections directly with designated IP. A firewall is typically set up to allow requests through port 80. Port 80 is a default port for web service such as HTTP protocol. Below is the sample table listing of some other common protocol ports.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Port || Description || Status
|-
| 20/TCP || [[File transfer protocol|FTP]] - data || Official
|-
| 21/TCP || [[File transfer protocol|FTP]]—control (command) || Official
|-
| 22/TCP,UDP || [[Secure Shell]] (SSH)—used for secure logins, [[file transfer]]s ([[Secure copy|scp]], [[SSH file transfer protocol|sftp]]) and port forwarding || Official
|-
| 23/TCP || [[Telnet]] protocol—unencrypted text communications || Official
|-
| 25/TCP || [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP)—used for e-mail routing between mail servers || Official
|-
| 80/TCP,UDP || [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) || Official

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Firewall Structure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hardware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There has been a long controversy of the software vs hardware firewall effectiveness. Most of the hardware firewalls provide a strong security protection from the Internet and require a minimal configuration or set up. A hardware firewall is a device that attaches between the incoming internet connection and the router that computers are connected to.  It acts like a guard at the gate, checking every bit of data coming and going.  If an unauthorized user or restricted type of data attempts to enter or exit the network, it is blocked. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.antivirus-firewall-spyware.com/firewalls.html&lt;/ref&gt;A hardware firewall then controls the flow of network by packet filtering. A packet filtering is also referred to as static packet filtering. It controls access to a network by analyzing the incoming and outgoing packets and letting them pass or halting them based on the IP addresses of the source and destination. Packet filtering is one technique, among many, for implementing security firewalls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/packet_filtering.html&lt;/ref&gt; A hardware firewall was originally designed for use on large corporate networks, hardware firewalls are made for networks of all types and sizes now.  Large hardware firewalls designed for big business use can cost thousands of dollars, but many good hardware firewall products designed especially for home and small office use are very affordable. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Software&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A software firewall, also known as a personal firewall, is a program that is installed on your computer.  It protects only the computer it is installed on, so if a software firewall is the only type of firewall used on a network, each computer must have a personal firewall installed.  There are many good software firewall products available, and all are reasonably priced for the degree of protection they provide.  Some include the following: &lt;br&gt;

Avanquest ZoneAlarm Pro 2006 - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avanquest.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PC Cillin - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pccillinsecurity.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sygate Personal Firewall - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.symantec.com/norton/sygate/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Armor2net Personal Firewall - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.armor2net.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sunbelt Personal Firewall - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunbeltsoftware.com/home-home-office/sunbelt-personal-firewall/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
AVG - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avg.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Anti-Virus / Anti-Spyware&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An antivirus is a software used to prevent, detect, and remove malware, including computer viruses, worms, and trojan horses. Such programs may also prevent and remove adware, spyware, and other forms of malware.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software&lt;/ref&gt;
The increasing demand on security and protection of personal computers has led to a massive development of antivirus software protection. Today there are hundreds of antivirus software manufactured. The most popular list includes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Norton Internet Security &lt;br&gt;
McAfee VirusScan Plus &lt;br&gt;
Panda Antivirus Pro&lt;br&gt;
AVG &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There are no best and worst virus detection programs. It may depend on the network infrastructure or the size of business to choose appropriate virus protection. All products provide excellent detection and removal of malware infections. Some include a WebGuard addon to protect against malicious or compromised websites, some include scanners that provide the ability to make an antivirus rescue CD for your system, some may include a real time scanning of computers and provide real time protection of email, Web browsing and so on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;h1&gt;Physical Security&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 8.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]

&lt;b&gt;Restricted Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because of the high importance and valuable networking equipment in a control room, -- a restrictive access is installed. Only authorized people will have physical access to network systems. Why would a network control room be so important you might ask? Well, devices such as computers are unavoidably vulnerable to physical attack. Routers allow their passwords to be reset, server software-based security can be easily bypassed, and user passwords can be cracked and stolen. All of this is possible with a reasonable amount of physical access to the system. Therefore usually a password combination lock or card swipe access is the best solution. Only the technology director and selective IT staff such as network administrator would be allowed to access this room. Very commonly network administrator would perform a backup or copying of the sensitive data in the network room. Sometimes those who are gaining access to a system are just curious employees who want to learn more about the systems or perhaps play with some settings to see if they can allow themselves a greater ability to control their PCs. The room itself or outside may be monitored to ensure security of valuable equipment. &lt;ref&gt;http://archive.is/20130102123047/http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5054057.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Proxies&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Royal Ballet School twisty bridge over Floral Street - geograph.org.uk - 890842.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]
A proxy is a bridge between a client and a server. Proxy takes incoming packets and reconfigures them in a requested manner governed by the set of filter policies. These set of policies can include file requests, web access, e-mail and so on. A proxy's main purpose is to allow accessibility to inaccessible (blocked or denied by a firewall) services. It's goal is to bypass the set rules and provide successful connection from the client to the server. A proxy can also provide anonymous connection to the server by hiding the true IP address of the client. For example if a client requests a connection with a specific server by using proxy, the only IP that is visible is the proxy's IP not the client's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Caching proxy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
A caching proxy is a server that collects requested data from servers and stores it for later requests. Most of the time the data collected is the most frequent accessed information. For example this information might include frequently accessed files that are large in size. The purpose of caching proxy is to eliminate the wait time and reduce stress on the bandwidth traffic. Common installations of a caching proxy are included with major ISP's, large corporations and search engines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Web-proxy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A web proxy is a server that provides filtering for World Wide Web services. The most common use of a web proxy is to enable access to denied services. Some public schools and corporations may deny access to selected web services. Sometimes it is possible to bypass these rules by using a web proxy that will fully enable access to those services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Anonymizing proxy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A anonymizing proxy is a server that hides or disguises client's IP with an IP of that proxy server. It's purpose is to provide cyber security and protect a client from being seen online. However the information that is transmitted to the server is not hidden to the proxy server. Thus a set of policies and rules may exist between a client and a proxy that will provide assurance of true anonymous identity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added an introduction to Hosting events because as i read down the page, many groups talked about different places that they held events. However, they didn't discuss a strategy such as what places that attract most attention. Therefore I added what places on Western's campus would be a good fit for any club that wants/needs to host an event. I just wanted to add a more brief description for the introduction so it helps readers understand what they are going to read about.</text>

&lt;u&gt;My Life&lt;/u&gt;

My life is pretty much spent on the computer. When I am not on the computer, I am at school, the library, or in the living room sitting with my parents watching boring shows. When I am on the computer, I usually work on batch files or I look up famous people that are dead like George Washington. One of my favorite things to do with my family is to show them what I can do on the computer. I am a christian and I am the grandson of Bro. Mike Shupp. He preaches at First Baptist Church of Blossom. It is in Texas. The link to it is [http://www.fbcblossom.com First Baptist Church of Blossom Site].

      <comment>moved [[Biological Machines/Appendix]] to [[Sensory Systems/Appendix]]: The wikibook &quot;Biological Machines&quot; is moved to the more appropriate title &quot;Sensory Systems&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Biological Machines/Appendix A}}

==History of ''Sensory Systems''==
This Wikibook was started by engineers studying at ETH Zurich as part of the course Computational Simulations of Sensory Systems. The course combines physiology with an emphasis on the sensory systems, programming and signal processing. There is a plethora of information regarding these topics on the internet and in the literature, but there's a distinct lack of concise texts and books on the fusion of these 3 topics. The world needs a structured and thorough overview of biology and biological systems from an engineering point of view, which is what this book is trying to correct. We will start off with the Visual System, focusing on the biological and physiological aspects, mainly because this will be used in part to grade our performance in the course. The other part being the programming aspects have already been evaluated and graded. It is the authors' wishes that eventually information on physiology/biology, signal processing AND programming shall be added to each of the sensory systems. Also we hope that more sections will be added to extend the book in ways previously not thought of.

The original title of the Wikibook, ''Biological Machines'', stressed the technical aspects of sensory system. However, as the wikibook evolved it became a comprehensive overview of human sensory systems, with additional emphasis on technical aspects of these systems. This focus is better represented with ''Sensory Systems'', the new wikibook title since December 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Spectrum==

If light passes through a prism, a colour spectrum will be formed at the other end of the prism ranging from red to violet. The wavelength of the red light is from 650nm to 700nm, and the violet light is at around 400nm to 420nm. This is the EM range detectable for the human eye.

[[Image:Prisms_with_high_and_low_dispersion.png | thumb | 300px | right |Colour spectrum produced by a prism]]

==Colour Models==

The colour triangle is often used to illustrate the colour-mixing effect. The triangle entangles the visible spectrum, and a white dot is located in the middle of the triangle. Because of additive colour mixing property of red (700nm), green(546nm) and blue(435nm), every colour can be produced by mixing those three colours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I edited the first two paragraphs of this section. There were a lot of spelling errors and the grammar was also wrong. I also added in more information about the clubs and change much of the word usage.

I added a couple of things onto ways the clubs organize themselves, recruitment and funding. I think in the opening page it is important to have an overview of all the things this particular Wikibook talks about.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I tihnk you need to add a Question Tracker section to consolidate all the information about how to use it and its functions...... Perhaps all the existing pages can stay where they are but if someone wants to learn more specifically about the tracker service it could be good to have a section title here in the contents page.

I found on the blogs this http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2009/03/ important information relating to the Tracker that I think should be included here in the Manual. This could also be expanded to include how althoguh the ID can be included in the token you can still get the Quiz taker to enter their other details: So when you look at the tracker after the candidate has sat the quiz you will see both.....the details th candidate entere themselves and the unique ID that you included in the Token writen in brackets ((...)) beside the first</text>

= Teaching the teachers...about using technology in the classroom=


== Introduction==
A director of technology at a school or a district must wear many hats. 
Some of the jobs that they have to do include budgeting and planning, dealing with many aspects of the computers for administrators,faculty and staff members, network administration and desktop support. But what about training personnel on the use of the equipment? It is important to remember that just because a school has lots of cool technology, not everyone is going to use it. Teachers may feel uncomfortable with their level of technology skill or perhaps they are unfamiliar with the equipment and don't know where to start. Some teachers regularly use technology in the classroom but they need (and want) refreshers on what is new and how can it be used.

Teachers like most people when they encounter a new way of doing things or a new technology will embrace or adopt it is in different ways. Everett Rogers in his book ''Diffusion of Innovations'' presented the concept of ''Adopter Categories'' in 1962. &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwitr/docs/diffusion/&lt;/ref&gt;. These five categories:innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards  can easily be applied to the adoption of technology in a school. Innovators and to a lesser extent, early adopters have jumped into technology use headfirst and will need little if any training. Some of them may even be able to assist in training initiatives. Users in the remaining three categories are the ones who will probably need assistance with the integration of technology into their lessons or their work.

==The Tech Director's Role==
[[Image:testWikiImage.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]
The tech director is in an excellent position to deliver training to a school's faculty or administrators. After all, he or she probably researched and installed most of the hardware and software used at the school and has probably communicated with the vendors so they will probably know a great deal about it. This makes them an excellent in house source of information on most of the software and hardware devices that the organization purchases and also an excellent individual to train end users on how to use the tools.

Everyone involved in technology training in a school should remember a few important things. IT trainers must remember why schools have expensive technology and an IT staff in the first place. Both are to support the teachers in their quest to educate the students. Teachers must be aware that technology will not make a bad lesson good, and that good classroom management is crucial to technology use in the classroom. Patience from both parties is important too.

==Authentic Instruction==
In 2007, Pennsylvania rolled out the Classrooms for the Future Initiative (CFF). CFF drastically increases the level of technology available to Pennsylvania teachers and students thus setting the stage for more effective preparation of students for modern high tech careers. Pennsylvania policy makers felt that if Pennsylvania workers are prepared for these careers, businesses that need employees like this will move their facilities to their state. One approach to preparing students for high tech jobs is ''Authentic Instruction'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.edportal.ed.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/classrooms_for_the_future/475/overview__background%2C_purposes%2C___outcomes/202800#DA_76244&lt;/ref&gt;.

The CFF initiative also has an intense professional development program designed to modify teaching methods to accommodate the new technology in the classrooms. Through this training, teachers develop skills needed to transform their traditional classrooms into authentic learning environments. Authentic instruction features real-world application of key concepts. It is more meaningful and relevant using real-world problems with the teacher acting more like a facilitator or a coach who supports the students as they learn. The computer along with other classroom technology is a crucial component in this process because in the authentic learning model, there is a heavy concentration on research of the real-world problems and analysis of data with a final presentation of the young researchers findings. 

Authentic Instruction is just one example of many models teachers may follow in their quest to improve their student's twenty first century skills, but whatever model they use, it is crucial that teachers know and understand how technology can be used in their classroom. They also need to be innovative in the use of the technology and confident in their technology skills and this is where the director of technology can play an important role, assuring that the educators in the institution know and understand the equipment and software they have access to.

==How to do it==
Because it is not always so obvious where the users stand in the adoption continuum, it may be wise to have them complete a survey. There are plenty of free tools available on the Web that can be used to determine skill levels of the users. In the survey, it may be best to ask questions like &quot;can you copy and paste information from a Word Document into a PowerPoint&quot; or &quot;Can you make a movie using Windows MovieMaker.&quot; Those taking the survey should be given a range of answers to choose from. With this information, the Tech Director can pin point who needs the most help, and who can wait. A focus group could provide valuable insights to the skill levels of the teaching staff also.

It may also be a good idea to not necessarily offer a training on a particular tool, like Microsoft Word or Excel. It might be better to offer training on using technology within a particular subject area like Language Arts or social studies. The trainer could even ask for a typical topic and create a lesson which demonstrates several tools like a Wiki for collaboration. Copyright friendly images could be selected using search techniques and the Web. These images will address different learning styles and another tool like Glogster could be used to display them. Websites could be saved and shared using a tool like Diigo or Delcious or they can be rated and commented upon using a tool like Dweeber. This approach will also direct future initiatives as the trainer can determine where the learner's interests are and target future lessons appropriately. 

It is also wise to demonstrate the integration of other subjects into training programs. For instance, why not perform an analysis on a historic primary source document using methods more commonly used by Language arts teachers. A virtual discussion of the source could take place using a blogging tool. Another idea could be to demonstrate math concepts and perform statistical analysis and graph/chart creation using election data or census data.

This is how technology should be used in the classroom and this is how training should be delivered and targeted.

==Organizing the Training==
Scheduling training at times and in the form which will benefit the most teachers is often a tremendous challenge. With papers to grade and lessons to write, a teacher's time is always at a premium. It is also important to note that once and done training is generally ineffective, so training and assistance in the use of IT in the classroom should be ongoing. Collaboration between teachers in the use of technology in the classroom is quite effective too, especially when teachers share their best practices with one another. So an appropriate tool and a procedure on its use should be set up to help the learners share their training ideas. Below are some other approaches which a tech director may want to consider when developing a training program for teachers. 

'''Workshops'''

The workshop model of training offered either during in-service days or after school is the traditional way of providing professional development for teachers. During an in-service day, a larger time period can be provided for teacher learning about technology and time can also be offered to teachers for collaboration, sharing and brainstorming. The difficulty is that there are always many other training or administrative topics competing for in-service time. Scheduling a workshop for some time after school is an option that may better suit busy schedules. In either case, outsiders can be brought in to conduct the training, but this may be prohibitively expensive. It would probably be a better idea to identify teaching or IT staff members who would be willing to conduct training, and then later, take on the role of coach or mentor for the teachers who can then follow up later and provide guidance as the teachers implement the technology into their lessons. 

What ever method that may be selected by a school, it is important to remember that training cannot be effective when it is executed on a once and done basis. It may also be a good idea to conduct some sort of survey in order to pinpoint what should be covered and who should be invited to attend training, especially when training funds are limited.

'''Coach or mentor model'''

A coaching or mentoring program is another option which a school could choose. Technology coaching is part of the Pennsylvania CFF program and it has proven to be very successful for the schools who have received these technology funds. The CFF coaches carry a reduced class load and many do receive extra pay for the extra IT and training work that they do. Coaches should help teachers plan and execute lessons that incorporate technology. They should critique and if possible team teach with teachers in an effort to build confidence in the use of technology in the classroom. These coaches should be knowledgeable and outgoing. They must be highly motivated and eager to implement the change in teaching styles that technology in the classroom requires. 

'''Tech expert on each wing''' 
Teacher comfort and confidence could be bolstered by the presence of a technology expert who works nearby. The tech expert would be the go to person on that wing or in that section of the building, to whom a teacher could go to if questions arise when lessons are being written or if an issue arises in the middle of a lesson. 

Some schools actually place students into this role as well. In fact a program called Gen YES started in Olympia, Washington in 1996 is actually organized as a class or club in the school and the students provide assistance to teachers as they plan and implement technology into their lessons.  At this time, the program has spread to 1200 schools in 47 states and it provides student run helpdesk support and students gain technology and organizational skills and most importantly take charge of their own learning &lt;ref&gt; http://www.genyes.com/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Technology Wiki'''
Establishing a way for teachers to share and post useful websites could encourage more collaboration between members of the teaching staff. A Wiki would be the obvious choice for this task. Teachers often are frustrated by restrictions placed upon them by firewall software which is necessarily in place to satisfy Federal CIPA requirements. To these teachers it may seem like all of the good sites that they need are blocked when in reality, other teachers in the same institution have found, and successfully used websites which would fulfill that very same need. These same teachers who posted websites they have used in class could briefly discuss the pros and cons of the use of the site and otherwise prepare new users for their first time experience. After all, not all sites do what they are supposed to do and knowledge about any issues associated with the website would prove valuable to new users.

Another section of the Wiki could be set up for teachers to share their success stories and tips that may prove valuable for those teachers who are not so tech savvy.

''' Quick Reference cards'''
While it is best to demonstrate the use of tools within a subject area, some novice users or those who yet lack confidence may benefit from a quick reference card which show the highlights of how to use a particular tool. These are usually not very deep in their discussion of a tool and it's use, but they serve the purpose of refreshing the memory on how to use the tool or do some minor trouble shooting when problems arise.

==Additional Comments==
'''Good communication between IT and teachers'''

An attitude of openness and mutual respect should exist between teachers and IT personnel. This includes good communications between both parties. Both have the same ultimate goal, preparing young people for a useful and productive life as good citizens, so both parties should be working towards that end. Good communication includes plain language and not IT jargon from the tech people, and prompt reporting of problems or issues with technology by teachers with the inclusion of as many useful details as possible when something goes wrong with equipment. When teachers have an upcoming event which may put extraordinary demands on equipment or the network such an in school election or a video conference event, they should give the IT staff plenty of advance notice so that they can prepare and schedule effectively.  

'''Administration buy in''' 

Administration buy in is crucial to the success of any training initiative. Teachers are going to have to change the way they do things in their classrooms and this change will not take place unless the school's administration is completely on board with the training program. In the past, training initiatives in schools have often been once and done events. That is, things are taught and not revisisted or reviewed in any way ever again. IT training for teachers must be ongoing and principals must work to be sure that teachers are implementing what they learned. It may be a good idea for principals to collect artifacts of technology implementation such as student generated products and lesson plans. Good lesson plans which utilize technology should be shared and celebrated, while poor lesson plans should be adjusted to be more effective.

&lt;big&gt;'''Tumor Lysis Syndrome'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Usually occurs in bulky, rapidly growing tumors, which are sensitive to chemotherapy (e.g. high grade lymphoma, acute leukemia)
*Extremely uncommon as a result of RT in solid tumors
**Three cases in adult patients reported (medulloblastoma, metastatic breast cancer, NSCLC)
*All 3 cases had RT dose &gt;= 3 Gy/fx
*Typically develops early during RT (within 4 days)
*Treatment with vigorous hydration
*Urinary alkalinization should probably be avoided, since it may predispose patient to urinary calcium phosphate percipitation, and subsequent worsening renal failure


*'''Korea Cancer Center, Seoul; 2008''' 19029410 -- &quot;Fatal tumor lysis syndrome during radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Noh GY, PMID J Clin Oncol. 2008 Dec 20;26(36):6005-6. Epub 2008 Nov 24.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">VOX: Voices For Planned Parenthood has a very strong leader at the moment, but she will be graduating this fall. The position of club leader is also a paid job at the Mt. Baker Planned Parenthood, so the new leader will have to apply and undergo summerlong training to fill this void, which creates plenty of scheduling problems.

Although I was not sure how to edit this paragraph as I am not knowledgeable regarding VOX, I felt that it was far too concise. It is in dire need of some background information and elaboration regarding the organization itself. Perhaps a summary of the organization's objectives could lend a helping hand; as it stands, it is more of a bullet point than a complete paragraph.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added to the section about club advertising. I added an introduction paragraph because the original entry started very abruptly with a reference to the Sexploration club. This creates a more fluid reading of the section.

Effective advertising is crucial for promoting club events. A variety of advertising methods are utilized, from print ads in the school newspaper to hand-made pamphlets and fliers. Social networking websites such as Facebook and Myspace allow club members to spread the word about upcoming events quickly and efficiently. Advertisements get the word out to fellow students and inspire potential club members.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added: 
Beyond finding a specific identity in a club, it is important to know the bottom line that club members are given an opportunity to identify with each other in the first place. Although there may be auditions or 'rights of passage' to official positions in the club, everyone can identify with one another in their share of interest for that specific club. These clubs offer a sense of community to nourish their passions and create identification with one another...

to the identity section of recruiting and membership. I added this because there was discussion of identity witin a club but there wasn't any discussion of identifying with a club. Both of which are different but important.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I took this paragraph 

While some clubs find creative ways to not only recruit new members, but also keep current members in contact with each other, such as the Strongman club -utilizing Facebook- other clubs suffer from lack of members.  

An example of a club suffering from the lack of new members is the Cycling Club and Swing Dance club.  Both clubs have a strong leadership position with people who are willing to put in their time to help members, along with strengthening their communication that kept their groups somewhat organized.  However, a top priority was to acknowledge members who were interested in joining the Cycling and Swing Dance club and to recognize reasons why people were hesitant to join. This way, the Cycling and Swing Dance club can target these areas such as informing students that no experience is needed along with not being afraid to approach the club unknown.  The two clubs could benefit from studying other clubs that have successful recruitment and communication, and brainstorm what they could do to make their clubs more effective.

out of the recruitment section because it was talking about faults the group had, and put it in the problems with retaining section because I felt it was a better place for it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have added a section, Professional Sport Salaries, because I feel it helps quantify the sums of money which professional sports athletes actually earn. I feel it is also important because it may shed some insight on the fact that becoming a paid athlete is extremely rare and few and far between to say the least. Many of our youth these days have wild aspirations of being the next Kobe Bryant, kids should be realistic and aware that school is a better mode towards upward mobility. If it were easy to get paid to play your favorite sport, everyone would do it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, sorry i'm a little late, but I couldn't find the talk box. Anyway, I made the revision to the article because atheism is often presented by those who are usually not convincing, and who don't often explain just why they are atheists or why they believe what they do. And organized religions do everything they can to maintain their power over 80% of the population. It can be said that religion still plays a major part in elections in this country, and to some that is cause for alarm.</text>

== Welcome message ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Sorry this info was so late but it will help you understand how things work on the project. If the VFD succeeds in deleting your project stub, learn from the discussion and attempt a new approach. Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:36, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assuming that you have a Java environment correctly configured, and that you can run up a simple HelloWorld program, etc, the first thing is to locate your JDBC jar file and add it to your classpath. 

===Classpathing Windows===

In Windows environments this is typically done by entering your Control Panel, available from the Start menu, clicking the System icon, and then selecting the Advanced System settings option, selecting the Advanced tab, followed by hitting the Environment Variables button. This is marginally different in the various Windows OS environments but at the end of the day you need to be able to set your environment variables. If you share the computer, probably the best thing to do is to create a CLASSPATH variable in your local user settings, unless, of course you want other users to also be able to access the jar file.

If one already exists you can just append the fully qualified path and file name to the existing entries in the CLASSPATH variable, using a semi-colon as a separator e.g. where you had a CLASSPATH string which looked like:

:c:\workDir;c:\jars\jfugue.jar

and you had renamed and put the SqlLite jar file in the same directory as the existing entry, as c:\jars\SqliteJdbc.jar, your amended CLASSPATH string will now look like:

:c:\workDir;c:\jars\jfugue.jar;c:\jars\SqliteJdbc.jar

You can check the status of your CLASSPATH environment variable by typing SET CLASSPATH at the command prompt.

NB if you are already working in a DOS command box, changes will not become apparent in that session, you will need to start a new command box for the changes to be realised.

===Classpathing Unix shells===

The syntax for your classpathing will depend on the shell you are using, and can be fully discovered by using the &quot;man {shellname}&quot; command.

bash &amp; ksh syntax:
:export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/java/classes:/home/jars/SqliteJdbc.jar 

csh syntax:
:set CLASSPATH = ($CLASSPATH /java/classes /home/jars/SqliteJdbc.jar) 

To view your CLASSPATH environment variables, &quot;echo $CLASSPATH&quot; will show you what you need to know.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assuming that your classpath is now established, and your JDK is ready to go, we can have a quick and dirty attempt to throw together a very simple database with only one table in it. As this is something of a disposable 'HelloWorld' mini-app on steroids, let's call it 'HelloDatabase'.

You really need to know one thing about the JDBC driver: its registered DriverName. For SqlLite this is:

:''org.sqlite.JDBC''

This value is used to register the driver in Java. Different JDBC drivers for different database implementations have different registered  DriverNames. While it is entirely possible to discover DriverNames from the containing jar file(s) programatically, this lies outside the scope of this document and they can be looked up fairly quickly on the Internet e.g. at [http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/28818].

Now we come to constructing the URL string which is used in establishing the connection to the database. Different JDBCs for different database types have different URL definitions; the SqlLite URL string really just needs to know that it is a jdbc of the type 'sqlite' and the name of the target database which we wish to use. If for example we wish to connect to a new database called ''order.db'' we would need to compose a string comprised of the string 'jdbc', the database type name, in this case 'sqlite' plus the name of the database, separated by colons, i.e.:

:''jdbc:sqlite:order.db''

other examples

:''jdbc:sqlite://dirA/dirB/dbfile''
:''jdbc:sqlite:/DRIVE:/dirA/dirB/dbfile''
:''jdbc:sqlite:///COMPUTERNAME/shareA/dirB/dbfile''

an in-memory option is also available.


As a minimal set of imports for this mini-app (and for most simple JDBC connectors), you will want the following set of imports available as shown in the following code. The two .*MetaData imports are useful and often necessary for debugging and investigative purposes, as well as being handy for abstraction and ultimate reduction in the quantity of hard code that your programs will require.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.ResultSetMetaData;
import java.sql.DatabaseMetaData;
 
public class HelloDatabase
{
    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception
    {
        // register the driver 
        String sDriverName = &quot;org.sqlite.JDBC&quot;;
        Class.forName(sDriverName);
 
        // now we set up a set of fairly basic string variables to use in the body of the code proper
        String sTempDb = &quot;hello.db&quot;;
        String sJdbc = &quot;jdbc:sqlite&quot;;
        String sDbUrl = sJdbc + &quot;:&quot; + sTempDb;
        // which will produce a legitimate Url for SqlLite JDBC :
        // jdbc:sqlite:hello.db
        int iTimeout = 30;
        String sMakeTable = &quot;CREATE TABLE dummy (id numeric, response text)&quot;;
        String sMakeInsert = &quot;INSERT INTO dummy VALUES(1,'Hello from the database')&quot;;
        String sMakeSelect = &quot;SELECT response from dummy&quot;;
 
        // create a database connection
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(sDbUrl);
        try {
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            try {
                stmt.setQueryTimeout(iTimeout);
                stmt.executeUpdate( sMakeTable );
                stmt.executeUpdate( sMakeInsert );
                ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sMakeSelect);
                try {
                    while(rs.next())
                        {
                            String sResult = rs.getString(&quot;response&quot;);
                            System.out.println(sResult);
                        }
                } finally {
                    try { rs.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {}
                }
            } finally {
                try { stmt.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {}
            }
        } finally {
            try { conn.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {}
        }
    }
 
}

&lt;/source&gt;

You should now also find that you have a file called ''hello.db'' in your working directory, (or whatever else you called it in the database name component for the URL). If you attempt to run this code more than once, you will get a SQL Exception error since you will be trying to create a table that already exists; you can delete the .db file, or use SqLite to drop the table, or insert a new String with a drop table statement in it and use stmt.executeUpdate to run the drop string before attempting to create the table...

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? YES
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? YES
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) YES
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) NO
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? NO

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:  THE LEARNING TARGET ITSELF IS A GOOD GOAL.  HOWEVER, GRAMMER AND MECHANICS NEED REVIEWED.  SUBTOPICS BELOW LEARNING TARGET ARE CONFUSING.  NOT ORGANIZED WELL.

[edit] Introduction
A philosophy of education refers to a methodology behind teaching practices. These range from classical âpreconceived methodsâ to newer more experimental thoughts about teaching. Teaching is one of the oldest and most powerful professions known to man. Throughout time we have sought to improve methods of teaching in order to improve the quality of our population. One of the guiding forces in education are teaching philosophies. As ways of thinking about education change and evolve so does the practice and profession of teaching.

[edit] Learning Target
Readers of this section should gain a sense of the ever changing nature of educational philosophies at all levels of education.

[edit] US:The Business of Higher Education
This article is particularly poignant considering the nature of this âtext-bookâ,(WHAT ARTICLE IN WHAT TEXTBOOK? GOT TO CITE PROPERLY) it concerns the new business models being brought to Universities throughout the country. With the economic crash, and the uncertainty and underfunding that it brings with it, colleges and universities have begun adapting a more capitalist approach. One such example is Colorado State University, who elected Joe Blake as its system counselor, not on academic merit but rather on his business prowess.

âSearch committee members were chosen for their knowledge and understanding of complex, billion dollar businesses.â Said, Michelle McKinney, a public relations representative for the board of Colorado State. As colleges grow more geared towards profit margins and capital gains the problem is further compounded by reduced public funding and rising education costs. These fiscal burdens are now being passed onto individual students, leaving many students in âhome mortgage sized debtâ. In todayâs modern world a college degree is in ever increasing demand but the ability to obtain one grows more and more difficult. Could this emphasis on finance be a novel approach to these growing problems or will turning education into a for-profit venture only exasperate the situation?  TOO WORDY.  POINT COULD BE MADE MORE BRIEFLY.  SENTENCE STRUCTURE NEEDS WORK.

[1] The Full Article


[edit] Spitting in the Eye of Mainstream Education
This article concerns a California charter school called, American Indian. (Charter schools are schools which are publicly funded, but are allowed to work outside the constraints of the public school system) American Indian is a school that represents the âEssentialistâ philosophy of education in the extreme. The curriculum is strict, the levels of liberal bashing almost caricature, and the discipline is as severe as it can get without having nuns involved (OPINION?). Their educational philosophy âdoes not preach or subscribe to the demagoguery of tolerance.â(Lansberg, 2009) The results however, are amazing and the âAmerican Indianâ schools have some of the best scores in all of California. In American Indian there are no non-essential courses, any course not tested on does not exist, the arts in general are scoffed at, and testing, not practical application is the emphasis. There are no T.Vâs or computers all learning is done strictly by the book. To go with this rather utilitarian approach to learning the school has equally strict punishments for misconduct. Humiliation is often used as an enforcement tool, in one situation a student caught stealing had his head shaved in front of the entire school, in another a young lady was forced to clean the male restroom. The article goes on to explain the possibility of cherry-picking being used to artificially inflate the schoolâs test scores. (Cherry-picking in this situation would be seeking out successful students for the school and denying âtroubleâ cases) However, no definitive proof is offered either way in the article and in lieu of actual proof of âcherry-pickingâ American Indianâs draconic education philosophy seems to be paying off. OPINIONATED, NOT CITED PROPERLY.

[edit] Students Benefit From Writing Project
This article concerns more the formation of teachers, teaching philosophies rather than an actual education philosophy itself. It describes a writing program offered at the graduate level during the summer at MSU university, made specifically to help teachers formulate and refine their philosophies of education. Through the program teachers engage in a variety of âcutting edge âlearning techniques including acting out parts of plays, writing creatively, and acting out murder mysteries. The program is free, relatively intense, and its main goal is to help teachers by exploring why they teach, hopefully leading to better teachers. The program is tailored to help teachers find new meaning within their careers and hopefully bring that new knowledge and invigoration back to the classroom.  CHECK SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND PUNCTUATION.  ARTICLE NEEDS TO BE CITED CORRECTLY...APA FORMAT.  WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM AGAIN?

[edit] Conclusion
Right now, this moment,(REDUNDANT) education is changing, evolving. Someone out there, in the nether is contemplating a new way to teach. In our state of Virginia many are still reconciling their teaching methods with the importance of the S.O.Lâs, or standards of learning, the S.O.Lâs are standardized tests used as a yard stick to measure whether or not students are prepared to move on to the next grade level(RUN ON SENTENCE). These tests have changed the curriculum for everyone and helped define what can be seen as âsuccessâ within the classroom(OPINIONATED). They represent a teaching ideology(NOT AN IDEOLOGY) that places importance upon testing well and less upon innovative teaching methods.

Throughout the new methods of education are being explored and enacted (HUH? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?). In large states with an urban population(COMMA) charter schools are being created in order to utilize more radical teaching methods in the hopes of raising the passing rates of underprivileged minority students(WORDY). Across the country, colleges and universities are looking for ways to make colleges profitable by hiring new staff, consulting marketing teams, and merchandising themselves in the same way successful corporations do. Our definition of education and our ideologies surrounding it are fluid, ever changing things. (THIS IS KIND OF ALL OVER THE PLACE.)

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;'''A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion'''.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;'''Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing'''.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.'''
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;'''Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented'''
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content

&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed'''.
&lt;li&gt;'''All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.'''&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included'''.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation'''.
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;'''Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;. IDEAS BEHIND ARTICLES INTERESTING.  
&lt;li&gt;. I DON'T LIKE GIVING CRITISM TO WRITING.  I HAD TO DO THIS ASSIGNMENT.  I HAD A FRIEND REVIEW YOUR PAPER AS WELL.  THE ARTICLES, IF CITED PROPERLY, WITH ADDITIONAL SCHOLARLY REFERENCES, WOULD HAVE GIVEN AN INTERESTING TAKE ON EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHIES.  TRY OUTLINING AND ADDING MORE THAN ONE SOURCE FOR EACH SUBTOPIC.  ALSO, IF YOU ARE WRITING ON EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHIES, PERHAPS THAT COULD BE BETTER DEFINED IN YOUR INTRODUCTION.  I HOPE THIS HELPS.      

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NEEDS REVISION...SENTENCE STRUCTURE, GRAMMAR, PUNCTUATION, MECHANICS..   
&lt;li&gt;.REVIEW SOURCES FOR CREDIBILITY.  CITE PROPER APA FORMAT.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

1.'This article is particularly poignant considering the nature of this âtext-bookâ ...': THROUGH SOME OF THE TEXT THESE SYMBOLS APPEAR AND COULD BE CONFUSING. NO BIG DEAL BUT COULD BE CORRECTED.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.

&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. ARTICLE WAS WELL DEVELOPED. GREAT VOCABULARY USE. 
&lt;li&gt;. UN-BIASED VIEWS BUT GOT A GREAT POINT ACROSS.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. PROOFREADING IS SUGGESTED.
&lt;li&gt;. TRY TO MAKE SOME SENTENCES SHORTER, SOME SEEM TO CARRY OUT TOO LONG.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

=== Grammar and Mechanics Review''' ===

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ECD872;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;For more information and easy to understand definitions of these five main philosophies check out this website&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit:put a comma before check)&lt;/font&gt;: [http://www.school-for-champions.com/education/philosophies.htm &quot;http://www.school-for-champions.com/education/philosophies.htm&quot;]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



When looking for a simple definition of educational philosophies, I realized there isn't one! Educational philosophies are a diverse subject, with many opinions. There is not one simple, correct answer to this question. Teachers seem to work better when using a variety of educational philosophies. This is because if a teacher stays locked into just one philosophy&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; students are not able to grow and learn from different ideas&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;; &lt;/font&gt;they are stuck with one idea and way of learning, when they might have learned better from a different method. The variety of educational philosophies is&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit:are)&lt;/font&gt; pulled from the five main philosophies of: Perennialism, Idealism, Realism, Experimentalism and Existentialism. For more information and easy to understand definitions of these five main philosophies check out this website: [http://www.school-for-champions.com/education/philosophies.htm].&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: redundant w/ the sidebar?)&lt;/font&gt;

There are several different ways of accessing &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: assess)&lt;/font&gt;studentsâ progress. We learned about four main ways of accessing &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: assessing)&lt;/font&gt;students during our in-class lecture. The four main assessment methods are selected response, extended written response, performance assessment and personal communication. Selected response would be using multiple choice, true/false, matching and fill-in-the-blank on a test. Extended written response would be having the students show all their work in an essay or math problem. Performance assessment is the ability to perform tasks/skills. Some examples are P.E., music, foreign language, speech, measuring or creating products, art, research paper, lab report, timeline, or diorama. Personal communication is writing in journals, questioning, discussions, interviewing, observations, or oral exams.

Another way to access &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: assess)&lt;/font&gt;studentsâ progress is to use the student progress monitoring system. There is an official site for teachers and parents from The National Center on Student Progress Monitoring. There definition of progress monitoring is, âa scientifically based practice that is used to assess studentsâ academic performance and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction. Progress monitoring can be implemented with individual students or an entire class.â For more information about this project go to. &quot;The National Center on Student Progress Monitoring website&quot; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: I'd make this link a sidebar)&lt;/font&gt;

Encourage &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(delete one?)&lt;/font&gt;encourage thoughtful discussion among students.

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? '''No''' and use at least 2 scholarly sources? '''Yes'''
#Are the citations in APA format? '''No, the references are though.'''
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? '''Yes'''
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? '''Yes'''
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? '''Sure.'''
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? '''No'''

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment: '''This isn't a final version, but the citations weren't directly in the body of the paper. There were links at the end in almost a sidebar like format, pointing out where to read more, but no APA citation. I'm not too critical about the sources being current on this topic as teaching philosophies have been floating around for a while, and there are some current ones in there.'''

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 '''Knowledge'''
##Question 2 '''Knowledge'''
##Question 3 '''Reasoning'''

Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? '''Yes'''
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? '''Yes'''
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question? '''Yes'''
#Do the questions assess the learning target? '''Sure.'''
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? '''Yes'''

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education)''' 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;'''At least two perspectives were presented'''
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;'''Some good points are made and explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.'''
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.'''   
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''Good job of synthesizing information for a FAQ.'''
&lt;li&gt;. '''Effective breakdown of constructivism.'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''Perhaps break down a few more teaching philosophies in such a manner, and expand the article?'''
&lt;li&gt;. '''Work on citations.'''
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? __YES____
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? ___YES____
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) _YES_____
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) __YES____
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? _YES_____

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:

I WOULD JUST MAKE ONE SUGGESTION, FOR THE STATEMENT MENTIONED IN THE LEARNING TARGET &quot;SOME WAYS TO ACCESS STUDENTS' PROGRESS&quot; MAYBE USE A DIFFERENT WORD CHOICE BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT STATEMENT. I WOULD ALSO ADD ADDITIONAL LEARNING TARGETS SINCE ONLY TWO TOPICS WERE ADDRESSED FROM THE ARTICLE IN THE CURRENT LEARNING TARGET MENTIONED.

When looking for a âsimpleâ definition of educational philosophies, I realized there isnât one! (CHECK THE FORMATTING OF THE WIKI CODE)

 What are some ways to access studentsâ progress?( SHOULD BE ASSESS NOT ACCESS--THIS IS WHY I WAS CONFUSED WITH YOUR LEARNING TARGET AS WELL)

some suggested characteristics of a constructivist teacher:(CAPITALIZE &quot;SOME&quot;).

IN GENERAL, DOUBLE CHECK THE FORMATTING OF THE WIKICODE. THERE WERE MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH IT CREATED ERRORS IN THE ARTICLE.

Comment:

CHANGE QUESTIONS THREE AND FOUR TO REASONING(APPLICATION)QUESTIONS. USING A SCENARIO TO APPLY A SPECIFIC TERM OR THEORY TO IT AND THEN ALLOW THE READER TO INFERE WHAT TERM OR THEORY IT IS REFERRING TO. FOR EXAMPLE, SUSIE DOES THIS AND THIS, WHAT IS SUSIE DOING? OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT!

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;

:I rated this article _5__ on interest because THE INFORMATION PRESENTED WAS INTERESTING, AND THE ADDITION OF THE SIDEBARS ADDED TO THE INTEREST OF THE ARTICLE.
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article _4__ for credibility because ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MORE THAN 5 SOURCES LISTED, ONLY TWO WERE SCHOLARLY..MAYBE ADDING ONE MORE SCHOLARLY SOURCE WOULD ADD TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INFORMATION.


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 5___ on writing because THE INFORMATION WAS WELL WRITTEN AND WITH FEW GRAMMATICAL/MECHANICAL ERRORS. THE ONLY SUGGESTION I WOULD MAKE REGARDING WRITING WOULD BE TO FIX THE ERRORS WITH THE WIKICODE IN THE ARTICLE.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read'''

&lt;li&gt;'''Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.'''
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.

&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors'''
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures and maintains attention throughout'''
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments

1. THE ARTICLE WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN, IT WAS EASY TO FOLLOW AND PROVIDED INTERESTING INFORMATION FOR TEACHERS TO KNOW.

2. THE SIDEBARS WERE DEFINITELY A GREAT ADDITION, THE COLORS AND INFORMATION PRESENTED ENHANCED THE ARTICLE.


&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions

1. I WOULD DOUBLE CHECK THE WIKICODE FORMAT SO THE ERRORS WITH THAT CAN BE RESOLVED, BUT OVERALL FEW ERRORS!

2. PUTTING THE REFERENCE LIST IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER WOULD INCREASE THE CREDIBILITY APPEARANCE OF THE REFERENCE LIST.

3. REWORDING THE LEARNING TARGET, OR ADDING ADDITIONAL LEARNING TARGETS SO THE READER DOES NOT FOCUS JUST ON TWO IDEAS MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE!!

OVERALL, IT WAS A GREAT ARTICLE WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION AND GREATLY WRITTEN! :)
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? YES, THE LEARNING TARGETS ADDRESS THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT IS IN THE ARTICLE AND TEST QUESTIONS
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? NO, THE LEARNING TARGET IS NOT VERY SPECIFIC. IT IS A GENERAL STATEMENT AND DOES NOT MENTION THE THREE PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE ADDRESSED.  IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO MENTION THE THREE IDEAS/ THEORIES IN THE LEARNING TARGET TO GET THE READER INTRODUCED TO AND EXCITED ABOUT THE INFORMATION.
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) YES, IT IS AN APPROPRIATE SKILL LEVEL QUESTION.
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) YES, THE INFORMATION ADDRESSED BY THE LEARNING TARGET CAN BE FOUND IN THE ARTICLE.
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? YES

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:

IT MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL TO MENTION THAT THE STUDENT SHOULD IDENTIFY SIMILARITIES/ DIFFERENCES FROM PAST TO PRESENT (IN THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION) AS A LEARNING TARGET- THEN YOU COULD EXPLAIN A FEW IN YOUR ARTICLE TO GIVE AN IDEA OF HOW SPECIFIC THINGS HAVE CHANGED/ STAYED THE SAME.

Different methods have been used to help improve the way education is looked at (DO NOT END A SENTENCE WITH A PREPOSITION)

The reader will be able to describe the different interpretations of The History of Education (HISTORY OF EDUCATION DOES NOT NEED TO BE CAPITALIZED)

As the world evolves and changes so does the way that education is looked at (DO NOT END A SENTENCE WITH A PREPOSITION)

Edward J. Power's article Persistent Myths in the History of Education says that the reason to study it is &quot;that the History of Education will sharpen students' professional study with precisely the same objective as, say, techniques of teaching or classroom management.&quot;(Powers, pg.142) (UNDERLINE OR ITALICIZE THE TITLE. NO NEED TO CAPITALIZE THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION; PERIOD OUTSIDE THE PARENTHESES)

Basically what he is saying that learning about the past is just as important, if not more important, than just learning about the hands on aspect of the profession. (REFERENCE THE AUTHOR BY NAME OR &quot;THE AUTHOR&quot;)

&quot;In recent years the history of education has been treated as educational philosophy's untitled and undistinguished cousin.&quot; (Powers, pg. 142) (INTRODUCE THE QUOTE USING THE AUTHORS LAST NAME; PERIOD OUTSIDE THE PARENTHESES)

The teaching styles of today are very similar to those of fifty years ago. (THIS SENTENCE IS LATER CONTRADICTED. YOU STATED EARLIER THAT EDUCATION IS EVER CHANGING AND LATER GO ON TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENCES. POSSIBLY ELABORATE ON SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES IF THERE ARE ANY)

For instance, there was a point in time when everyone that was attending school was taught in one big room at the same time no matter the age. (THEIR SHOULD BE SPELLED THERE)

The evolution of the history of education has drastically improved the way that school is thought about. (DO NOT END THE SENTENCE WITH A PREPOSITION)

Charles Webster says in his article Changing Perspectives in the History of Education that the main reason for the study of the history of education is &quot;to familiarize intending teachers with notable steps in the development of the modern system of public education.&quot; (Webster) (UNDERLINE OR ITALICIZE THE TITLE; PERIOD OUTSIDE THE PARENTHESES)

The Encyclopædia Britannica describes the history of education as &quot;tracing the evolution of the formal teaching of knowledge and skills, from prehistoric and ancient times to the present, and considering the various philosophies that have inspired the resulting systems.&quot; (Britannica) (PERIOD OUTSIDE THE PARENTHESES)

It is also saying that many different philosophies have lead to the education curriculum being the way it is today. (LEAD SHOULD BE SPELLED LED)

This is because every one in the teaching profession has their own opinion on what the important aspects of &quot;the history of education&quot; actually consist of. (DONT END THE SENTENCE WITH A PREPOSITION)

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? YES and use at least 2 scholarly sources? YES
#Are the citations in APA format? NOT ALL ARE (YOU MUST ALSO INCLUDE DATE RETRIEVED FOR THE WEBSITES)
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? NO, IT IS LABELED SOURCES. THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED TO REFERENCES
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? YES, THERE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN ANOTHER, MORE RECENT, SCHOLARLY SOURCE LISTED. EACH OF THE JOURNALS/PERIODICALS WERE 30 YEARS OLD OR MORE- MAY WANT A MORE RECENT VIEW ON THE SUBJECT FROM A SCHOLARLY SOURCE.
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? YES
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? NO (ALL THREE SCHOLARLY SOURCES ARE 30+ YEARS OLD)

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment:

THE SOURCES SEEMED RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE. YOU MAY WANT TO FIND ANOTHER SCHOLARLY SOURCE (WITH A PERSPECTIVE ON THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION) FROM A MORE RECENT SOURCE.


-----------------------

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 KNOWLEDGE
##Question 2 KNOWLEDGE
##Question 3 KNOWLEDGE
##Question 4 KNOWLEDGE


Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? YES
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? YES
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question? NO- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH #2 MAY BE BIASED. AS STATED IN THE ARTICLE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO WHY TEACHING HISTORY OF EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT- THERE IS NO CLEAR ANSWER HERE. 
#Do the questions assess the learning target? YES, ONE QUESTION DOES
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? YES
#Are the foils (the response options that are NOT the answer) reasonable i.e. they are not very obviously incorrect answers? MAYBE, I AM NOT SURE OF THE ANSWER FOR #1. I DO NOT SEE THAT TOPIC ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY IN THE ARTICLE.
#Are the response options listed in alphabetical order? NO
#Are correct answers provided and listed BELOW all the questions? YES, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE, BELOW THE SOURCES.

Please make a comment about the multiple-choice questions. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve the question/s.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because...IT INCLUDED RELEVANT INFORMATION. IT PROVIDED A FEW DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW WITH SOME KEY IDEAS. 

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 3 on interest because...THE SIDEBAR WAS A BIT DISTRACTING. ALTHOUGH I LIKED THE PICTURE, I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE TOO BIG- MADE IT DIFFICULT TO READ THE TEXT BECAUSE IT COVERED A FEW WORDS. SOME NEW, INTERESTING IDEAS IN THE ARTICLE. SOME KEY POINTS WERE MADE BUT NOT ALWAYS ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED/ DISCUSSED.
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 4 for credibility because...THE SOURCES SEEMED RELIABLE, FEW FORMATTING APA ERRORS WITH THE WEBSITES, NO RECENT SCHOLARLY SOURCES, GENERALLY CREDIBLE BECAUSE HE STATED WHEN IT WAS THE AUTHORS OPINION SEVERAL TIMES


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 2 on writing because... MANY OF THE SENTENCES WERE DIFFICULT TO READ, ALL FOUR MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS WERE KNOWLEDGE, INTERESTING INFORMATION BUT DISTRACTING SIDEBAR (PICTURE) WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO READ TEXT
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I THOUGHT THE INFORMATION WAS VERY INTERESTING AND LIKE HOW YOU OFFERED SEVERAL IDEAS, THINGS I HAD NOT READ BEFORE!
&lt;li&gt;. I LIKE THE PICTURE YOU CHOSE THAT REPRESENTED AN OLDER STYLE CLASSROOM, IT FIT THE IDEA OF YOUR ARTICLE

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I SAW SEVERAL MECHANICAL/ GRAMMAR ERRORS, BE SURE TO PROOF READ
&lt;li&gt;. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO READ THE TEXT TO THE LEFT OF THE PICTURE, MAYBE TRY TO MAKE IT SMALLER WITH A LARGER MARGIN ON THE SIDE SO THAT WORDS WILL NOT BE CUT OFF.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? Yes
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? Yes
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) A bit too easy, for my tastes.
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) Yes
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? No

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment: This learning target and the formation of the article itself do not match up very well. You state that, &quot;The reader will be able to describe the different interpretations of The History of Education.&quot; Which is fine, for the most part. Aside from the fact that the article itself is not formatted very well to present these facts to your reader. I would suggest splitting up whatever these &quot;different interpretations&quot; are under different headings, and better delineating what,exactly, each interpretation is. You can name them according to the different authors you mention within your article, just as a suggestion. 

As an additional improvement, I would consider expanding the scope of your learning target, maybe including why these different interpretations are valid/important. 



-----------------------

=== Grammar and Mechanics Review''' ===

*Please either paste the entire body of the article here or any sections that you feel need to be revised. 
*To do this:
**go back to the module page for the article
**select &quot;edit this page&quot;
**highlight all the text, hit control &quot;c&quot; (or &quot;copy&quot; from the edit menu)
**navigate back to your peer review page
**click edit this page and paste the text into this window (use control &quot;v&quot; or paste from the edit menu)
**You may want to have Wikibooks open in two windows/tabs to make this process easier.
*Type your comments in ALL CAPITALS or in &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; another color &lt;/font&gt; so the author can easily find them.

The reader will be able to describe the different interpretations of The History of Education. NO NEED FOR CAPITALIZATION HERE OF &quot;THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION&quot;

Edward J. Power's article Persistent Myths in the History of Education says that the reason to study it is &quot;that the History of Education will sharpen students' professional study with precisely the same objective as, say, techniques of teaching or classroom management.&quot; PLACE THE TITLE OF THE ARTICLE WITHIN QUOTATION MARKS

Whether it be from the size of the classes or the way that people with special needs are taught. SENTENCE FRAGMENT

While on the other hand the high school students would become bored with the subject matter of the first grade class. COMMA AFTER &quot;WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND&quot; INTRO STATEMENT

Why are their so many ways to say basically the same thing? WRONG &quot;THERE&quot;

If you compare the three authors philosophies above, you will be able to identify their different interruptions. I ASSUME THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE &quot;INTERPRETATIONS&quot; 




-----------------------

=== Sources ===

For each source listed in the &quot;References&quot; section of the article, name the type of source (scholarly or popular) and the perspective it provides (research, expert opinion from educator, popular news source, parent organization, personal contact, etc.)
#.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education  Type: Popular, Perspective: General Research

List the range of publication years for all sources, e.g. 1998-2006: 1962-2009

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? Yes. and use at least 2 scholarly sources? Yes
#Are the citations in APA format? Nope. 
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? No
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? I think so.
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? Probably not, but it's an intrinsic part of this topic. This is, after all,&quot;the experts take sides&quot;. 
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? No

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment: First thing first, just fix the APA formatting issues, when you cite your websites. I hereby introduce you to the magic of bib me: [http://www.bibme.org/] you can paste in your sources, easy peasy, and choose the formatting style of your choice. It's pretty excellent. As for the dating of these sources, I would suggest you scour newer news articles, I understand that this isn't the &quot;in the news&quot; section, but you should be able to find some more recent information regarding expert opinions on the history of education pretty easily through the use of news articles.
 



-----------------------

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 knowledge
##Question 2 knowledge
##Question 3 knowledge
##Question 4 knowledge


Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? Yep
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? Yes
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question? Yes
#Do the questions assess the learning target? Kinda, I think they cover a broader swath of information. 
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? Sure
#Are the foils (the response options that are NOT the answer) reasonable i.e. they are not very obviously incorrect answers? Most of them
#Are the response options listed in alphabetical order? Yep
#Are correct answers provided and listed BELOW all the questions? Yep

Please make a comment about the multiple-choice questions. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve the question/s.


Comment: Mostly, my concern as to your assessment of the &quot;learning target&quot; is related to the overall construction of your article. My previous statements about your learning target and article, once applied would fix most of the problem. Right now, there don't appear to be any different &quot;interpretations&quot; being explored during the article. (None that are clearly named as such, at least.) I would suggest making the questions a bit more involved as well, to better represent a college level of difficulty. Perhaps testing on more specific information, or crafting these questions to be more specific in their concern to the broader subject.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because... I think you got pretty boned on your topic, regarding this aspect, and you did your best to drive the point home that it is a relevant subject. So kudos for that. 

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 2 on interest because... Even with the mitigating circumstances of your subject matter, I just couldn't focus because of the way everything was written. It was much more of an information dump rather than an article. A very confusing, information dump. I could tell, in essence, what you wanted to represent within the article, which is fantastic, but overall the way it was done was just not very exciting. The information needs to have some &quot;teeth&quot; as it were, and be presented in a clearer manner. Once again, simply reformatting would help greatly. 
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 4 for credibility because... Overall, it's pretty credible. Just fix the APA citations, and grab some more recent perspectives. I think you did a good job of including your information within the article without succumbing to bias. 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 2 on writing because...  The language used throughout is very awkward, and the overall organization of the information is not done very well. You should really avoid things like directly telling the reader how to interpret information presented during the article. This lessens both interest and impact, being spoon fed information is never fun. Also, the way that this was done was very awkward/confusing, I'm referring to the repeated use of the phrase, &quot;what this is saying&quot; throughout the article. With some very minimal rewording, that entire section could flow much, much better. Overall, I would do the following to start with: Read this whole thing out loud to yourself slowly, and the awkward parts of speech should jump out at you. Go back through and amend your sentences accordingly.  Second: I would split up the main body of the article into easily digested portions and clearly head each section, in some uniform manner. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors''' 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;'''It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.

&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I really liked the overall effort to make this information relateable/easily digestible. 
&lt;li&gt;. Overall, I thought the ideas presented throughout were sound, they had sufficient support and a measure of passion behind their representation. 

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. Reformat the main body of the article into separate sections and re-evaluate your learning target. 
&lt;li&gt;. Try to make the information more engaging, and please evaluate the clunky/repetitive language used throughout the article. (Using the method of reading it out loud, if you so desire. I don't mean for that specific suggestion to seem condescending, it's something I do with everything I write, unless I'm extremely rushed. I find it to be endlessly helpful.)  
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;

**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

THIS IS BEGINNING OF SENTENCE NEEDS TO BE CAPITALIZED &quot;REGARDS&quot;  

regards to the widespread education of our children in the 20th century we can thank the industrial revolution.  Before the spread of urban life and mass industry very few children had the opportunity to go to school for any length of time.  Children were required to work the fields on the family farm or help with the family business.  In the beginning of the 20th century more people were moving to cities and the need for education became greater than ever.   The children who were educated usually came from wealthy families.  

I BELIEVE THAT THIS WHOLE PARAGRAPH NEEDS WORDED DIFFERENTLY, A LITTLE CONFUSING AND DOES NOT SOUND CORRECT.

The curriculum in the beginning of the 20th century was consisted of basic knowledge skills that could be used to work or run an industrial company such as math, reading, writing, and science.

AGAIN I THINK THIS WHOLE SENTENCE NEEDS TO BE WORDED DIFFERENT.  GRAMMAR AND MECHANICS ARE OFF. MAYBE THIS &quot;THE CURRICULUM IN THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY WHICH CONSISTED OF BASIC KNOWLEDGE SKILLS SUCH AS MATH, READING, WRITING, AND SCIENCE WERE BENEFICIAL IN WORKING OR RUNNING AN INDUSTRIAL COMPANY.&quot;

'''So, much like our curriculum today?'''

Yes, however students today have the opportunity of electives.  Foreign language, music, art, technical education, and clubs were not available to the average public school child.  In fact most students never made it to the high school level. 
	
THIS QUESTION IS A LITTLE CONFUSING.  ACCORDING TO THE PREVIOUS ANSWER THAT IS NOTHING LIKE OUR CURRICULUM TODAY.  THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE AND LEARN IN THE CURRENT SCHOOL SYSTEM.  

'''What other major changes to the education system have occurred in the 20th century?'''

The invention of the car led to more children having access to school.
Desegregation affected the public school system ensuring that all children receive the same education.
Post WWII the increase in children led to the government spending more on education than ever before.
-New schools were built. Older schools built additions
-Programs like Head Start were formed to help weld the link between poverty and education.

THIS TEACHER BEING INTERVIEWED IT SAID AT TOP OF ARTICLE HAS BEEN TEACHER FOR 20 YRS. THIS ANSWER DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.  THE THINGS IN THE ANSWER ARE NOT REALLY RELEVANT IN THE PAST 20 YEARS CONCERNING THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE 20TH CENTURY.  THE THINGS LISTED IN ANSWER WERE WAY LONGER THAN 20 YEARS.  I DON'T BELIEVE THE QUESTION WAS REALLY ANSWERED PROPERLY.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Information is not relevant to future teachers.'''&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''No side bar included.'''&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;'''Nothing new.'''&lt;li&gt;'''No analysis or interpretation included'''&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.'''
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.'''&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or '''unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets'''&lt;li&gt;'''Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention'''&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;'''Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.'''&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. THERE IS A GOOD START TO THE ARTICLE.
&lt;li&gt;. LEARNING TARGETS ARE SPECIFIC.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. NEED TO ADD MORE CONTENT IN ARTICLE, QUESTIONS, SOURCES.
&lt;li&gt;. ADD SIDEBAR, COULD MAKE MORE RELEVANT TO TODAY.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

I will accomplish this by interviewing Mrs. Ann Poorman &lt;s&gt;who is a&lt;/s&gt; HAS BEEN A well respected teacher at Southern Cayuga High School for the past twenty years. Mrs. Poorman is an English teacher who holds an interest in history and the education system. She is a well studied and knowledgeable person to ask about the history of the U.S. Education system. (WHY?, WHAT HAS SHE STUDIED? WHAT KIND OF DEGREE DOES SHE HOLD? DOES SHE BELONG TO ANY EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION OR SOCIETEY?)


THE INTERVIEW


When did the U.S. really begin to form a public education system?

&lt;u&gt;regards&lt;/u&gt; sHOULD AHVE BEEN CAPIATL STARTING A SENTENCE to the widespread education of our children in the 20th century we can thank the industrial revolution. Before the spread of urban life and mass industry very few children had the opportunity to go to school for any length of time (MORE INFOMATION FROM ANOTHER SOURCE ABOUT THIS POINT, NAME SOURCE AS WELL). Children were required to work the fields on the family farm or help with the family business (WHY?). In the beginning of the 20th century more people were moving to cities and the need for education became greater than ever. The children who were educated usually came from wealthy families. (WHY?, MORE INFORMATION SENSUS FACTS AND SOURCES)

So, much like our curriculum today?

Yes, however students today have the opportunity of electives. Foreign language, music, art, technical education, and clubs were not available to the average public school child. In fact most students never made it to the high school level. (WHY?, LIST FACTUAL INFORMATION OF THIS TIME BACKING UP THE STATEMENT)

What other major changes to the education system have occurred in the 20th century?

The invention of the car led to more children having access to school. Desegregation affected the public school system ensuring that all children receive the same education. Post WWII the increase in children led to the government spending more on education than ever before.(SOURCE OTHER THAN TEACHER) -New schools were built. Older schools built additions -Programs like Head Start were formed to help weld the link between poverty and education.](MORE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED ABOUT THIS TOPIC, LIST RESOURCES)

Comment:
THE ARTICLE WAS ONLY DONE BASED ON ONE INTERVIEW. I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE EXPERTS TO INTERVIEW TO BE ABLE TO GET DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ABOUT THE TARGETED QUESTIONS AND ALSO INCLUEDED EXPERT DATA WITH THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED. iF THE AUTHOR WOULD AHVE HAD EXPERT DATA THAT COULD AHVE BEEN USED WHILE GIVING THE INTERVIEW, I THINK THE ANSWERES WOULD AHVE BEEN MORE INTERESTING AND DETAILED BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPARED WITH FACTUAL INFORMATION.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education)

&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information ''' 
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
'''Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; '''One useful point'''
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;'''Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated

&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article

&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;'''Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented'''&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;'''All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.'''&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;'''Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention'''
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. THE ARTICLE WAS NOT CROWDED WITH DISTRACTING OR OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE WHICH MADE IT VERY EASY TO READ AND FOLLOW.
&lt;li&gt;. THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ASKES WERE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER WHICH WERE GOOD BECAUSE THEY FOLLOWED THE HISTORY OF THE CHANGE IN EDUCATION.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;. INCLUDE FACTUAL DATA FROM THE EDUCATION BOARD AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT CAN BE PRESENTED TO THE EXPERTS. INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION ALONG WITH THE ANSWERS FROM THE EXPERTS.
&lt;li&gt;. STATE YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE ANSWERS PROVIDED BY THE EXPERTS, ADD SOME COLOR AND DESING TO THE ARTICLE TO MAKE IT MORE PRESENTABLE AND APPEALING TO THE EYE.
&lt;li&gt;. GET ONE OR MORE EXPERTS TO INTERVIEW AND THAT CAN OFFER DIFFERENT VIEWS AND PERSPECTIVES ON THE TOPIC.
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? __No____
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? __No_____
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) __No____
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) ____No__
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? __No____

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:Edgar, you should create four things that you expect the reader to understand based on your article.  Your questions at the end should correlate to those learning targets.  You have a lot of great information, and because you have already done your questions, just identify the overall target that you met in the questions and use those at the start of your paper.

PASTE TEXT HERE

In CNN, America's scapegoat for news, there was a report from a student named Marcia Hutchinson who faced stereotypes and discrimination in a British classroom, being from Jamaican decent ( Hutchinson, 2009).
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Make sure that you are using a neutral point of view when doing your article.&lt;/font&gt;

Foreign language education though ignored by many is becoming more of a requirement as the population of the United States increases annually. Diversified classrooms could be very beneficial for students in the long-run. Why? well as the United States becomes more diverse culturally, students are faced with the fact that employment opportunities are going to be offered to that bilingual student.
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The first sentence needs commas between education, and after many.  Try not to use the question in the paragraph &quot;Why?&quot;  You can take out Why? and well and the sentence starting with &quot;as the...&quot; will still make sense.  I think that separating your paragraphs with smaller headings will also bring some points out instead of a lot of paragraphs of information. &lt;/font&gt;

Comment:
You need more sources to really round out the paper.  You referenced CNN and Oprah in the paper, I know those are popular sources but they may have some articles or multi-media sources that you could put in your article.  Maybe you could also use some government educational policies that would relate to changes in diversity training.  You also need to make sure that your reference list is in APA format.  You can go to MS Word and it will help to organize your  references and cite them as you go in your paper.  I am not sure about the Black Magazine, I am wondering if there may be bias in that publication.

Comment:
In the first question, in the article it stated that the reference was to &quot;preschool&quot; without clear definition as to the ages.  If you are just using personal knowledge that could encompass ages 0-5, which could be two answers.
In the third question, the question is not easy to understand based on the article and no answers seemed to fit.
In the fourth question, there is more than one answer to the question and the answer is not clearly found in the article.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article __4_ for importance because... there were any valid points that are relevant to teachers.  There was also some researched information that was provided.  The content was applicable to today's schools.

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article _2__ on interest because...there was no clear difference between paragraphs and key points.  There was no visual interest and although you included a sidebar it needed to be included in the piece and in a box of color and distinction.  There was also a biased view in the paper that needs to be revised.
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article __2_ for credibility because...there was only 4 sources listed and there could be bias in one of the sources.  I also did not rely on the information fully due to the age of some of the sources.


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article __1_ on writing because... there was no learning target and there were some awkward sentence structures.  
&lt;/ul&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I see that you have a great grasp on what it takes to make teachers understand the importance of diversity awareness.
&lt;li&gt;.  There is a lot of valid information that you have included in the article and many parts were well written.


&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;li&gt;. I think that including more sources and some attention to organization in the piece would really make the piece interesting and balanced.  Make sure that you go on other articles to see how they made their sidebars and used the wikicode, which I know is difficult to understand, so that you make your piece more visually appealing.
&lt;li&gt;.The inclusion of the learning targets will also help to take you back through the article and ensure that you have clear questions that have answers that are easily found from reading the article.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

== Diversity: Revolving Change in America's Classrooms ==

'''Learning Target'''
 Reader should be able to review the work of different media outlets, when it comes to diversity in the classroom. Reader will be faced with world wide opinions and measures being taken in classrooms all over America that deal with diversity.


== Diversity in the Classroom ==


As the nation we live in changes, so does the classrooms in which learning is taught(I WOULD CHANGE THIS TO &quot;SO DOES THE CLASSROOMS IN WHICH WE LEARN&quot;). Diversity is often encountered in the classroom whether it is by ethnicity, race, or gender of the students. Many of these diverse situations often encounters (ENCOUNTER) problems with stereotype (STEREOTYPES) and makes (MAKE) it that much more difficult for teachers to conduct an inclusive classroom. Reports by major newspapers such as the New York Times and media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have carried out developing stories occurring not only in Virginia but in classrooms throughout the United States and even the world which deals with diversifying classrooms.

The New York Times reported on April 22, 2009 in an article titled &quot;Diversity in the Classroom&quot; that due to heavy immigration of people, student demographics have changed in 17,000 counties in the United States ( New York Times, 2009).   This article also states that Hispanic and Asian student enrollment in schools has increased by 5,000,000 since the 1990's. This demographic of student enrollment increase automatically makes a diverse classroom, ethnic wise and race wise. (POSSIBLE REVISION: THIS INCREASE OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES A DIVERSE CLASSROOM, ETHNICALLY AND RACIALLY.) Author Judith Shulman wrote a book to help teachers carry out lessons that help every student: no matter race,country of origin and/or language (Shulman, 2007). GOOD USE OF NUMBERS INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE. 

Some students have more difficulties (DIFFICULTY) than others (,) if they do not understand the language. Schools throughout America have taken this immigration issue seriously by incorporating a curriculum that has mandatory English classes for non-English speakers. Foreign language education though ignored by many is becoming more of a requirement as the population of the United States increases annually. Diversified classrooms could be very beneficial for students in the long-run. Why? well (CAPITALIZE FIRST LETTER OF WELL) as the United States becomes more diverse culturally, students are faced with the fact that employment opportunities are going to be offered to that bilingual student.  

In (ON) CNN, America's scapegoat for news, there was a report from a student named Marcia Hutchinson who faced stereotypes and discrimination in a British classroom, being from (OF) Jamaican decent (Hutchinson, 2009). This type of bullying could lead to the student suffering severe psychological damage and therefore teacher training should not be taken lightly. (POSSIBLY SEPARATE THIS INTO TWO DIFFERENT SENTENCES)  Teachers in every classroom around the world are going through what is called &quot;training&quot; in order to learn how to deal with a diverse set of students, enhancing the change to have an inclusive classroom. This not only applies to classrooms in Europe this also applies to America's classrooms. 

Author and early childhood education expert Barbara Biles write an article about how cultural diversity first starts with each individual's cultural and self-awareness (Biles, 1994). She promotes the use of skin-colored crayons in her teaching techniques for preschool students so that they are more self-aware but most importantly, more aware of those around them. This is a process in which the child learns that people are not all the same. Some will be much more different, other will be more alike, nonetheless they need to know that just because someone is different, prejudice should come into role. (NOT RELLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING HERE. THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN NOW MAKES IT SOUND NEGATIVE.) When cultural and racial awareness is established in the classroom, it will help teachers bring up some classwork and/or (LEAVE OUT AND/OR) activities to help children &quot;accept themselves and accept others&quot; (Biles, 1994). This awareness will ultimately unify the classroom, but create a person who is less likely to bully others in the future. 

Ultimately, teachers should always be aware that never will they (THEY WILL NEVER) conduct a classroom where each child is exactly the same to the one sitting besides them.( TO THE ONE SITTING BESIDES THEM CAN BE LEFT OUT) Since classrooms across the United States are becoming more diverse as the days pass, teachers (NEED TO) take into consideration learning new teaching techniques in order to accommodate each child's learning needs and ways. No child learns the same. Some learn my (BY) repetition, other by visualizations, others by auditory lessons (NEW SENTENCE TAKE OUT THE WORD AND) and (CAPITALIZE THE FIRST LETTER IN THESE) these techniques should be incorporated in an inclusive classroom. 

Diversity is often to blame and the scapegoat to children teasing others, bullying and deep psychological issues brought upon an individual, in this case, a student. Bullying and that sort of hurtful accusations made towards others are often the center of media delight. It has been heard of in popular prime time shows like Oprah, or late night documentaries like Dateline or CNN. It is up to the teachers, the head of the classroom, to incorporate a friendly environment for all. Make sure that students get along not only between classroom walls but outside in the playground as well. America could be stronger starting by the classroom.

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know'''
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''No side bar included'''.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references''' or only 1 scholarly source was used
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets'''
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;.THE ARTICLE OVERALL WAS GOOD. I ENJOYED THE TOPIC AND THE WAY YOU LAYED IT OUT.
&lt;li&gt;. GOOD USE OF INFORMATION 

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. PROOFREADING IS A MUST
&lt;li&gt;. SPELLING AND GRAMMAR NEEDS TO BE CHECKED.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

[edit] Sexual Education: Reducing teen pregnancy and raising awareness or promoting âsafe sexâ activity among the youth.
By Bianca N. Penny-Harley





[edit] Learning Targets:
To have a clear understanding of what sex education implements in the school system.

Understand the targeted objective of the sex education course.

Determine for yourself if sex education is actually a positive or negative impact in schools.





[edit] Introduction
So what exactly is sex education suppose to teach the students in the schools today.&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;? instead of period.&lt;/font&gt; Sex education started with a goal to increase knowledge to our children about their bodies and how the sexual organs work. At this present day are we aiming towards the same objective? The sex education curriculum has shifted from being an introduction to sexuality for students to a more explicit class about how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases because of the mayor.&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;major&lt;/font&gt; sexual activity we see today among the youth. The main topic has shifted from promoting total abstinent to âsafe sexâ. .&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;I don't know why this keeps happening?&lt;/font&gt;What is the message we really are conveying to the students teaching this class. Are schools taking over the roles of parenthood in some cases discussing in detail sexuality in the schools. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;maybe reword this sentence. &lt;/font&gt;The focus of sex education has come a long way and whether you are in favor or against it, you should be able to have a better understanding on what both sides believe is correct about the class and where it is headed in the future.




â&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;take the a out at the beginning. The quote is nice. Just be sure to put it in quotation marks if needed.&lt;/font color&gt;I am convinced that it's of primordial importance to learn more everyday than the year before. After all, what is education but a process by which a person begins to learn how to learn?Peter Ustinov


[edit] Schools and sex education: Does it work?
Sex education curriculum has come a long way, from having as &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;add it's before as.&lt;/font&gt; main focus the promotion of abstinence, decrease of masturbation and prevention of intercourse to adjusting its point of view to the culture of the schools today promoting safe sex it has become a controversial topic among the youth. Along the years the development of the sex education curriculum has been looked at &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;as&lt;/font&gt; a positive instruction for students not only to gain the knowledge to be able to refrain from inappropriate sexual activities but also as a diseases prevention matter. The implementation of sex education curriculum was thought to be directly linked to the increase of sexual activity in the younger population but this has not been fully proven. It is more likely to believe that there are other more influential factors such as parental sex education and socioeconomic status.


[edit] Condom Nation: Government Sex Education Promotes Teen Pregnancy
Sex education courses have helped to increase the use of contraceptives; in contrast it has also had greatly helped to increase higher rates of sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen pregnancies. Premarital sex and premarital pregnancy has been rising since the 70's even though the availability of contraceptives was greater. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;maybe put sentence one like ; in contrast it has attributed to higher rates in sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen pregnancies. Sentence two: have been rising since the 70's even though contraceptive availability has increased.&lt;/font&gt;


&quot;One of every 10 teenage girls in the United States now becomes pregnant each year &quot;, &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Be sure to cite quotes according to the APA format.&lt;/font&gt; according to one study by government family planners. In the midst of these findings the Clinton administration still urged an expanding of sex education from kindergarten through college. In addition, sex education courses have branched off into an exploratory look into alternative forms of sexual behavior such as masturbation and homosexuality.





[edit] Conclusion
In conclusion I believe that sex education does have a direct influence on sexual activity among teens. I do see how other factors such as economic status and parental education do affect the decisions of the students and what they engage in, however it has been proven that children that are not exposed to this information at such a young age are more likely to refrain from sexual activity in the future. '''There is a great importance in teaching sexuality in the schools it gives the needed knowledge and the hope to prevent certain situations but I think that this should be at an appropriate age where along with parental involement the students can fully understand the consequences instead of investigating these for them selves. Children should remain innocent until they are ready to understant what sex entails.'''
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Put a period at the end of IN in the second sentence. Cap the H in however and start a new sentence. It sounds like a run on sentence without the break. The last sentence needs some work as well. It needs a period after schools. It is just too wordy.I think you will pick up on this too after reading it again.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.

&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.

&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented

&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article

&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.'''
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.

&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.

&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;'''Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention'''
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.THE QUOTES GAVE THE ARTICLE MORE LIFE. THE INSIGHT WAS QUITE NICE!!
&lt;li&gt;.NOT THAT MANY SPELLING ERRORS AND THE BOLD HEADINGS WERE UNDERLINED INDICATING A NEW SECTION.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.THERE ARE A FEW SENTENCES THAT NEED REVISED THAT ARE TOO WORDY. 
&lt;li&gt;.TWO MORE REFERENCES NEED TO BE CITED AND IN APA FORMAT.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

I BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THIS AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE. YOU HAVE A GOOD FOUNDATION TO BUILD UPON. GOOD LUCK.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===

Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article?   '''Yes for first two; no for last target'''
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific?  '''Yes for first two; no for last target'''
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) '''Yes, except for last target...see comment'''
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) '''NO'''
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? '''NO'''

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
The first two targets use the word &quot;understand&quot; so the reader knows what they should be able to do after reading the article. The last article seems lost in the wording. It is somewhat confusing because it is really not clear what the writer wants the reader to be able to do after reading the article. Changing the wording on the last target to read &quot;To determine if sex education is creating a positive or negative impact on schools&quot;. The article does not seem to provide adequate information for readers because there is only one study that is not referenced. There seems to be a lot of facts, but the confusing part is deciding whether they come from experts or personal knowledge and/or opinion.

== '''Introduction''' ==

&lt;s&gt;So&lt;/s&gt; what ex&lt;s&gt;strikeout text&lt;/s&gt;actly is sex education &lt;u&gt;suppose&lt;/u&gt; '''(add a &quot;d&quot;)''' to teach the students in the schools today. Sex education started '''(when)''' with a goal to increase knowledge to our children about their bodies and how the sexual organs work. &lt;s&gt;At this present day&lt;/s&gt; '''(Today)''' are we aiming towards the same objective? The sex education curriculum has shifted from being an introduction to sexuality for students to a more explicit class '''(. Today students are taught more)''' about how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases because of the &lt;s&gt;mayor&lt;/s&gt; sexual activity we see &lt;s&gt;today&lt;/s&gt; among the youth '''(of today).''' The main topic '''(?)''' has shifted from promoting total abstinent to âsafe sexâ. What is the message we really are conveying to the students teaching this class. Are schools taking over the roles of parenthood &lt;s&gt;in some cases&lt;/s&gt; '''(by)''' discussing in detail, sexuality &lt;s&gt;in the schools&lt;/s&gt;.  The focus of sex education has come a long way '''(.)''' &lt;s&gt;and&lt;/s&gt; whether you are in favor or against it, you &lt;s&gt;should&lt;/s&gt; '''(need to)''' be able to have a better understanding on &lt;s&gt;what&lt;/s&gt; both sides &lt;s&gt;believe is correct&lt;/s&gt; '''(of the issue)''' &lt;s&gt;about the class&lt;/s&gt; and where it is headed in the future. 
''âI am convinced that itâs of primordial importance to learn more everyday that the year before. After all, what is education but a process by which a person begins to learn how to learn?â âPeter Ustinov''


== '''Schools and sex education: Does it work?''' ==


Sex education curriculum has come a long way, from having &lt;s&gt;as main focus the promotion of&lt;/s&gt; abstinence '''(as the main focus.)''' '''(From a)'''decrease &lt;s&gt;of&lt;/s&gt; '''(in)''' masturbation and prevention of intercourse '''(,)''' to adjusting its point of view to &lt;s&gt;the culture of the schools today&lt;/s&gt; promot&lt;s&gt;ing&lt;/s&gt; '''(e)''' safe sex '''(;the schools today have)''' &lt;s&gt;it has&lt;/s&gt; become a controversial topic among the youth. Along the years the development of the sex education curriculum has been looked &lt;s&gt;at&lt;/s&gt; '''(on as)''' a positive instruction for students not only to gain the knowledge to be able to refrain from inappropriate sexual activities but also as a diseases prevention matter.  The implementation of sex education curriculum was thought to be directly linked to the increase of sexual activity in the younger population but this has not been fully proven. It is more likely to believe that there are other more influential factors such as parental sex education '''(?)''' and socioeconomic status.

== '''Condom Nation: Government Sex Education Promotes Teen Pregnancy''' ==



Sex education courses have helped to increase the use of contraceptives; in contrast it has also had greatly helped to increase higher rates of sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen pregnancies.  Premarital sex and premarital pregnancy has been rising since the 70's even though the availability of contraceptives was greater. '''(Need some statistics)'''


&quot;One of every 10 teenage girls in the United States now becomes pregnant each yearâ('''reference?),''' according to one study by government family planners.  In the midst of these findings '''(,)''' the Clinton administration still urged an expanding of sex education from kindergarten through college. '''(reference?)'''  In addition, sex education courses have branched off into an exploratory look into alternative forms of sexual behavior such as masturbation and homosexuality.



== '''Conclusion''' ==

In conclusion I believe that sex education does have a direct influence on sexual activity among teens. '''(why?)''' I do see how other factors such as economic status and parental education do affect the decisions of the students and what they engage in, however '''(,)''' it has been proven that children that are not exposed to this information at such a young age are more likely to refrain from sexual activity in the future. '''(statistics?)''' There is &lt;s&gt;a great&lt;/s&gt; importance in teaching sexuality in the schools '''(, because)''' it gives the needed knowledge and the hope to prevent certain situations '''(.)''' &lt;s&gt;but&lt;/s&gt; I think that &lt;s&gt;this&lt;/s&gt; '''(sex education in school)''' should be at an appropriate age where along with parental involement '''(,)''' the students can fully understand the consequences instead of investigating &lt;s&gt;these&lt;/s&gt; for themselves. Children should remain innocent until they are ready to understant what sex entails.
'''''âIt is what we think we know already what prevents us from learningâ â Claude Brenaro'''''

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment:
The author could use a couple of sources that are a contrast to the one's used. This will help the reader with the last learning target. The titles must be cited because they are copied word-for-word off of the websites.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints:
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; '''Note: I do not like basing my comments solely on the rubric because it does not give much wiggle room.'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''I found the topic of your article to be interesting and the information you presented about &quot;1 in every 10 girls&quot; is a scary fact. What amazed me too, was the information you presented about the Clinton administration...wow...I did not realize that!'''
&lt;li&gt;. '''I see that you posed a few questions for the reader to ponder...nice touch!'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; '''Type your article on a WORD doc. so that you can use the spellcheck for grammar'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''Give the reader some more background information on the subject'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''Play devil's advocate and incorporate some pros and cons'''

&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

'''Poverty, bullying and media violence, and peer pressure all effect the students and the schools around us on a daily basis.'''
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;I'm not sure but maybe it should read: Poverty, bullying, media violence, and peer pressure....&lt;/font&gt;

'''Poverty is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions. In today's schools poverished children are often lacking the basic nessesities to allow them to learn in an effective way. According to the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (2007), poverty affects the overall well-being of children, from health to behavior, to social environment and education. Poverished children are at times lacking in their educational abilities. The following article is based out of Porstsmouth, Virginia and identifies a school that could possibly be closing because of low test scores.'''
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;This is an excellent paragraph and the link &amp; story fit very well. However, the end of the article might need a little more to it. It seems as I was reading about poverty and suddenly switched to media (one sentence). Maybe you could tie them together or start talking about media a little before introducing the link.:)&lt;/font&gt;

'''Nansel ''et al.'' (2001) reported on the results of a nationally representative survey of 15,686 United States youth in grades 6-10. Findings indicate the 29.9% of the sample reported moderate to frequent involvement in bullying. The following news article shows proves that anyone can be a victim of bullying, and can overcome the effects of being bullied.'''
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Maybe the first sentence should read...Nansel ''et al.'' (2001) reported on the results of a nationally representative survey of 15,686 United States youth in grades 6-10 and his findings indicated that 29.9% of the sample reported moderate to frequent involement of bullying. (If this is applicable) On the second sentence you have both shows and proves. Either use one or the other or link them with and.&lt;/font&gt;

'''CLICK ON THIS LINK http://books.google.com/books?id=4B-J0U2TIwcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=media+violence+and+children'''
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;this link would look better if it was  center of the box like your other ones.&lt;/font&gt;

'''They can be pressured into negative situations such as trying drugs an/or alcohol, having sex, stealing, cheating, lying among many other negative situations.'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;after cheating, add '''and''' lying among many other negative things.
In that same paragraph, I am not sure youths is a word. I think it would read better as teens and youth.&lt;/font&gt;

''''''1. The term poverty is defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as

'''A) The state of one who gains an acceptable amount of money. B) The state of one who loses an acceptable amount of material possessions. C) The state of one who lacks an acceptable amount of money or material possessions. D) The state of one who loses an acceptable amount of money due to a gambling problem.'''




'''2. What percentage of youths in grades 6-10 reported moderate to frequent involvement in bullying?'''
A) 22.3% B) 29.9% C) 29.4% D) 27.6%''''''
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Align your choices vertically like 3 &amp;4&lt;/font&gt;

Answer Key: 1)A 2)B 3)B 4)C
&lt;font color=&quot;#FFOOFF&quot;&gt;Maybe put this vertical also.&lt;/font&gt;

Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read'''
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;'''Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.'''&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic'''&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.'''&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.'''   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;'''The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.There are links that enable the reader to watch and read related information.
&lt;li&gt;.Words were not difficult to understand and no spelling errors were found!

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.I see the multiple choice answers need to be aligned verically instead of horizontally.
&lt;li&gt;.I see that some sidebars have headings while others don't. Maybe include headings for the other sidebars.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE. 

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included'''; '''a couple of formatting errors''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from a variety of sources is included'''. '''Most sources are reasonably reputable'''; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;'''The author''' occasionally (1-2 times) '''states his own opinion as fact'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Most of the cited information is discussed or explain'''ed.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; I loved how visual the author's article was with the colorful sidebars, and varying colors in the fonts.
&lt;li&gt;. I also liked how she reinforced each section with a website to visit or video to watch.  That was really creative.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; I would be more aware of spelling errors.
&lt;li&gt;. Make sure when designing Target objectives there is a means to measure them by.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? _YES
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? _NO
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) __YES____
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) __NO____
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? __YES____

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
For the learning target mentioned, it states the reader should be able to &quot;comprehend some questions&quot; when regarding the information to be learned. I feel that different wording should be used here, because the word choice of &quot;some&quot; is vague, it does not let the reader know what information they should be able to comprehend over other information that is presented. Also, the learning target itself is not very specific because different reader(s) may comprehend the information in different ways, so maybe using a different word like &quot;answer&quot; for the questions may be more appropriate because that may be more observable. In addition, using &quot;answer&quot; for the questions will allow the learning target to be more observable because it will enable the teacher to look at the students' answers to the question(s), allowing to see if the student(s)answered the material adequately.

What this author found to be of interest is while trying to find some scholarly information on racism and education became a challenge, one that I will continue to research (THIS SENTENCE NEEDS TO BE REWORDED, TO STATE SOMETHING LIKE THE AUTHOR FOUND TRYING TO FIND INFORMATION TO BE BOTH INTERESTING AND A CHALLENGE, BUT FELT ...).

Because racism appears to be the Elephant in the room no one wants to point out.(REWORD-INCOMPLETE SENTENCE).

&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article __4.5_ for importance because I BELIEVE THAT THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IS IMPORTANT FOR THE READER TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE SOCIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCES IN SCHOOLS. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IS A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION WAS EXPANDED ON, THEN THE READER WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A WIDER RANGE OF INFORMATION TO RELY ON.

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article _4.5__ on interest because THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IS INTERESTING. THE DIFFERENT TERMS, PERSPECTIVES AND THEORIES PROVIDE INSIGHT ON THE TOPIC AND MAINTAIN THE INTEREST OF THE READER.
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article __3.5_ for credibility because ONLY FOUR SOURCES WERE USED, NOT FIVE. AND EVEN THOUGH THE TWO SCHOLARLY SOURCES WERE MENTIONED, MAYBE HAVING ONE OR TWO MORE SCHOLARLY SOURCES WOULD HAVE ADDED TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INFORMATION.


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article _4__ on writing because THERE WERE MULTIPLE GRAMMATICAL AND MECHANICAL ERRORS THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED ON.

&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;'''A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; 1. THE ARTICLE HAS VERY INTERESTING AND RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR FUTURE TEACHERS TO KNOW.
&lt;li&gt;.2. THE ARTICLE FLOWS NICELY AND THE SIDEBARS ADD INTERESTING LINKS TO INFORMATION.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; 1. THE ARTICLE MAY NEED TO BE LOOKED OVER FOR GRAMMATICAL/MECHANICAL ERRORS.
&lt;li&gt;.2. THE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE REVISED TO INCLUDE TWO KNOWLEDGE AND TWO REASONING QUESTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE QUESTIONS LISTED DO PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION TO KNOW!
     3. ADDING AN ADDITIONAL SCHOLARLY SOURCE WILL ALSO HELP TO ADD TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INFORMATION AND PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE TOPIC!

&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant information 
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information. 
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.

&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt; ==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
* Hints: 
** Focus on the work, not the person
** &lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. VERY WELL ORGANIZED, ARTICLE WAS INTERESTING FROM BEGINNING TO END.
&lt;li&gt;. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WAS USEFUL AND IT TAUGHT THE READER SOMETHING NEW AND IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. PROOFREADING. SPELLING AND RUN-ON SENTENCES.
&lt;li&gt;. CREDIBILITY: FIND MORE SOURCES SO IT ADDS MORE INFORMATION TO YOUR ARTICLE. THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT EXPANDS TREMENDOUSLY, AND MORE INFORMATION COULD BE PROVIDED IN YOUR ARTICLE! 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

PASTE TEXT HERE

After viewing each of these articles and others, it is clear that &lt;s&gt;there are&lt;/s&gt; very few''',''' if any articles &lt;s&gt;that&lt;/s&gt; argue that we should fully embrace NCLB exactly as it was first articulated and received. The first article presented above leaned more on the side that NCLB should be completely rejected and that our country should adopt a completely alternative plan for action that is perceived as more conducive to certain goals such as access to a greater range of information and more freedom for diverse methods of teaching and learning.'''THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE COULD BE CUT AND REDUCED TO MAKE TWO SHORT SENTENCES.''' The second and third articles above did not explicitly reject NCLB in its entirety but argued that there have been some problems that have resulted from NCLB that need to be addressed and corrected as well as possible. &lt;s&gt;One fact that does remain&lt;/s&gt;THE FACT REMAINS   that the United States &lt;s&gt;has a closer&lt;/s&gt; KEEPS A CLOSE eye &lt;s&gt;to&lt;/s&gt;ON certain kinds of student achievement than it ever has before. This kind of awareness is something that is either directly or indirectly acknowledged in each article. The majority of articles set out to show problems that exist with NCLB and how to possibly respond to these problems, without necessarily discarding NCLB in its entirety. NCLB has not been in place for more than 10 years. As NCLB is given a longer time to work, such problems can be discussed more and proposed solutions for dealing with these problems can be given time to work. Adjustments can be made. With time, then, it seems that NCLB can bring nothing but improvement for student education. If we do not meet NCLB’S lofty goal of a 100% passing rate in 2014, it is not unreasonable to aim for an improvement in overall student performance and a smaller gap for achievement according to the preset categories.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.

&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers''''''Bold text'''
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/'''ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;'''At least two perspectives were presented'''&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one clear point is made and supported'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.

&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors'''.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. YOU REPRESENT THE INFORMATION IN THE NCLB ACT VERY WELL.
&lt;li&gt;. YOU KEPT AN UNBIASED OPINION AS YOU WROTE THE FACTS.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. MORE VISUALS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT I KNOW WIKI IS HARD TO CREATE IN.
&lt;li&gt;. MORE DIFFERING OPINIONS ON THE ACT MAYBE PARENTS VIEWS.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

'''INTRODUCTION''':

Unfortunately, while total reform may be necessary, this is a multifaceted issue entrenched in debates at the federal, state, and local municipal levels. The argument has been over vouchers, magnet schools, charter schools, home-schooling, and presently there seems to be no agreeable solution. So much time is spent debating that we ignore brilliant research right in front of us; shining bright lights on successful instructional methods. We ignore our teachers and their needs, as money gets irresponsibility shuffled to administrators and then totally lost to local school districts. This is not a problem that we can simply throw dollars at without oversight. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Real solutions are needed that prepare students to be competitive in the global marketplaces of the 21st century and need a system that ensures an equal and quality education for all.&lt;/font&gt; What are these solutions? Should we look more closely at creating a federal curriculum? Should we operate schools more like traditional businesses with &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&gt; a&lt;/font&gt; healthy free market competition? Can we eliminate schools that do not maintain standards and provide extra funding for those who do? Can we provide teachers with a structured accountability system that purges jobs for those who do not make the cut, but increases salary for those who excel? Although these are valuable questions, no one seems able to move past typical bureaucratic red tape. Nevertheless, it is up to us to decide whether information in today's news will force us to engage change and become activists for reform.

'''FEDERAL CURRICULUM?''':
There is much controversy surrounding the establishment of a federal curriculum, &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;compared&lt;/font&gt; to other countries models of successful education. States argue that NCLB is already the largest federal encroachment, where education has always been primarily &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;the &lt;/font&gt;state's jurisdiction. The federal government argues that our children cannot afford to have such disparities in instruction between state's guidelines. Nonetheless, Arne Duncan is still pushing for national standards in math and language arts instruction. How is this different from our current NCLB standards? If a national uniformity is passed, &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;then &lt;/font&gt; students from every state would be tested the same way in chosen subject disciplines. According to the Washington Post (2009), &quot;Forty-six states and the District of Columbia have already announced an effort to craft a single vision for what children should learn each year from &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Kindergarten &lt;/font&gt;through high school.&quot;

'''IT'S ALL ABOUT TEACHERS''':
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Regardless of these issues, the job must still go on. &lt;/font&gt; While legislative debates may continue forever, teachers still need to be able to work harder and smarter for their students. They need to leave the controversy out of the classroom and remain focused on the one thing that is most important, the students! There is a plethora of free online resources to help teachers with planning and activities.

'''FINAL THOUGHTS...''':
At the end of the day, we can all do our very best to aide or participate in the educational reform process. However, all that really matters is that our future generation is safe, happy, and learning the skills necessary to survive successfully in this ever-changing world. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Policies will be debated, students will grow up and move on, changes will occur. &lt;/font&gt;All that is left is whether we have done the best we can for our students and our communities.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article '''4''' for importance because '''it shows the recent developments of federal curriculum. Education in America has always been headed by the state, however teaching could change forever if it is headed by the national govermnet. It is also important to know the economic status of education, as many teachers' jobs may be in jeopardy. '''

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article '''4''' on interest because '''it gave facts on how much money will be spent on education. It also showed the impact NCLB has on issues still present from 10 to 20 years ago. The article also encompassed all levels of education, including education from local newspapers.'''
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article '''4''' for credibility because '''the article included sources and references from local, state, and national newspapers. There was also information from both state and national Departments of Education. 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article '''2''' on writing because '''the article itself was very well written, but some sections were also very short. Questions at the end of the article were also very easy to answer for the intended readers of the article.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;

About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals add to the article'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least two perspectives were presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the information/ideas are new'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Some good points are made and explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''The article is very detailed and specific with its information. '''
&lt;li&gt;. '''I see the article address how NCLB is affect schools at a local, state and national level.'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''I would try to lengthen the article itself, as it seems a little short.'''
&lt;li&gt;. '''Two of the questions could be rewritten as application questions instead of knowledge questions. 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

Comment:

I thought your first learning target was great!  It was very clear and specific.  You might want to change &quot;gain an understanding&quot; and &quot;be briefed&quot; to something more specific.  I don't think your fourth learning target is a learning target.  Maybe phrase it &quot;Readers will know where to access additional...&quot;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.I think this is a very well presented article and very well written.  It has a natural &quot;flow&quot; to it and ends with a solid conclusion.
&lt;li&gt;.The layout of your article is very eye catching and interesting to read.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.Make your learning targets more specific.
&lt;li&gt;.Make one more of your questions &quot;reasoning&quot; and tie them in more specifically with your learning targets.

The only other suggestion I would make is in your &quot;It's All About Teachers&quot; section, end it at &quot;...the students!&quot; and put the next sentence in your sidebar box.  
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? 
Yes the learning targets are very specific, each being measurable. (identify, list, or define specific topics covered in the article)
 
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? 
As stated above, the learning targets are very specific being either definitions, listing, or identifying particular topics covered within the article.

*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) 
A couple of the learning targets are quite elementary (For example: &quot;Readers should be able to define school vouchers.&quot;), however the other 4 are much more appropriate for 301 level students. You could possibly incorporate that simple target into another in order to &quot;beef&quot; it up.

*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) 
All of the targets are easily verifiable because they are mostly definition, lists or identification of specific topics covered in the article. (&quot;Readers should be able to list at least one pro and one con of homeschooling&quot; - easily assessed)
  
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? ______
Yes, there is a plethora of information, while still maintaining a sense of brevity in order to not overload reader. (For example: One learning target is &quot;Readers should be able to list at least one pro and one con of homeschooling&quot;. In the article there is an entire paragraph dedicated to just the pros of homeschooling, and then another to just the cons of homeschooling.) More than sufficient information was provided to achieve the learning targets.


Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
&quot;Readers should be able to define school vouchers.&quot; - This learning target seems very elementary, however you could try incorporating it into a more advanced question, or another of the targets to avoid such simplicity. You could say for instance, &quot;The reader should be able to define school vouchers and give at least one argument either for or against them.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Effective integration of technology is achieved when students are able to select technology tools to help them obtain information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, and present it professionally. The technology should become an integral part of how the classroom functions -- as accessible as all other classroom tools.&quot; 

--National Educational Technology Standards for Students, International Society for Technology in Education.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''What is Technology Integration?'''

Technology Integration is the use of technology resources, such as computers, software applications, the Internet, cameras, etc., in daily classroom practices. Technology must be routine and apparent for integration in the classroom to be achieved. Using TECHNOLOGY  as A RESOURCE IN THE CLASSROOM helps the student to blend their learning techniques (Bledsoe, 2008). When integration is used, students seem to more actively engage themselves in the learning process. Technology Integration in the classroom requires reshaping, redesigning, and re-visioning traditional teaching and learning relationships (Georgina and Olson, 2008). 
What are some types of technology integration?
Along with computers and software programs, there are several different ways that teachers integrate technology into the classroom. Below are a few examples along with a description of each.

Podcast: a program, as of music or talk, made available in digital format over the Internet (Merriam Webster, 2009).

PowerPoint Presentation or Slideshow: a display of a series of chosen words and/or pictures done for artistic or instructional purposes (Merriam Webster, 2009). 

IPOD: a pocket size device used to play music files (Merriam Webster, 2009).

Instant Messaging: a means or system for transmitting electronic messages instantly (Merriam Webster, 2009). 

Webcam: a camera used in transmitting live images over the World Wide Web (Merriam Webster, 2009).

== '''Magnet Schools and Charter Schools''' ==


'''What is a magnet school and what does it offer?'''

A magnet school is part of the public school system and exists outside of zoned school boundaries. Instead of attending the school they are closest to, students may choose to attend a magnet school. Magnet schools attract students because they generally have something special to offer over a regular school, which makes attending them an attractive choice to many students. Most Magnet Schools concentrate on a particular area of study, and offer an alternative mode of instruction (Rossell, 2005).

'''What is a charter school and what does it offer?'''

A charter school is a publicly funded school that has been granted a charter (WHAT IS A CHARTER?) exempting it from selected state or local rules and regulations. It is a new, innovative public school that is accountable for student results. It delivers programs for educational excellence and the needs of the community. A SCHOOL'S charter is reviewed every three to five years and can be revoked if certain guidelines are not met (National Education Association, 2009).

== '''Vouchers''' ==


'''What is a voucher?'''

A voucher is a coupon that is issued by the government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a CHILD'S education in either a public or private school (Merriam Webster, 2009). With a voucher, parents can pay for the education of their child at the school of their choice, rather than the public school to which they are assigned. (WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT ISSUE VOUCHERS AND TO WHOM?)

'''Why is there controversy SURROUNDING vouchers?''' 

Vouchers are a subject of heated controversy because there are many variables to be considered. The main question that arises is who should receive school vouchers? Should specific groups be targeted, or is every child eligible? 

'''What are the supporting arguments for vouchers?'''

Supporters of school vouchers believe that parents should be given the right to choose the best educational environment for their children. ADVOCATES argue that vouchers would give all parents, REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, the opportunity for their child to receive a better education (Costrell, 2009). By making the educational system a FREE MARKET enterprise, the public educational system would then be forced to provide a higher level of education to compete with other schools. Supporters also state that school vouchers would bring more diversity and equality into the schools (WHY WOULD THERE BE MORE DIVERSITY?) (Bolick, 2008).
 
'''What are the opposing arguments for vouchers?'''
 
ONE CENTRAL argument AGAINST vouchers is that they violate the first AMENDMENT, SPECIFICALLY the separation of church and state. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE PREDOMINATELY RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, WHICH MAKES ANY GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO THESE SCHOOLS A VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. (Bolick, 2008). Opponents also argue that there is no need for school vouchers because public schools are generally on equal footing with private schools.  When completing the same coursework, opponents say that students perform equally in both institutions. Because of this, they argue that there is no need for the public to send any child to a private school. Another argument is that the voucher program will drain money from the schools that need it most, and public schools may become DUMPING SCHOOLS for the difficult to educate (THAT SOUNDS AKWARD. IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS THEN CALLING STUDENTS DIFFICULT TO EDUCATE? DIFFICULT TO HANDEL MAYBE?) (Costrell, 2009).

== '''Homeschooling''' ==


'''What is homeschooling?'''

Homeschooling IS TO teach (ONE'S children) at HOME (Merriam Webster, 2009), and also means to be taught in a particular culture. With homeschooling, the parent is the teacher and along with academics, they can teach certain philosophies to their children that they believe are valuable. 
'''
What is the GOVERNMENT'S role in homeschooling?'''

Virginia state law requires that a homeschooling parent meet at least one of four specific requirements. Virginia Code 22.1-254.1 outlines these four requirements:
The teaching parent holds a high school diploma.
The teaching parent meets the qualifications for a teacher prescribed by the Board of Education.
The teaching parent provides a program of study or curriculum which may be delivered through a correspondence course or distance learning program or in any other manner.
The teaching parent provides evidence that the parent is able to provide an adequate education for the child (The Virginia Department of Education , 2008). 

'''What are the pros of homeschooling?'''

Homeschooling is valued by many parents for a variety of reasons. Parents are able to teach their children academic material as well as values, beliefs and philosophies. Children can also be taught at their own pace, and can sometimes accomplish more in a few hours than what a regular classroom can accomplish in one week. Homeschooling provides the child with educational, emotional and physical freedom (Shaw, 2009) . 

'''What are the cons of homeschooling?'''

Homeschooling is not for everyone. There MAYBE time restraints on the family, as learning outside of a school environment can consume valuable time. There may also be financial restraints, as there is often at least one unemployed parent with the time and ability to homeschool.   There are limited sports and other extracurricular activities for the child to participate in, and a homeschooling family must be willing to LIVE outside the BOX (WHY ARE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES IMPORT? MAYBE PUT IN A COMMENT ABOUT THE SOCIALIZATION OF THE CHILD? ALSO NO COMMENT ABOUT THE PREDOMINATELY RELIGIOUS CONNOTATIONS OF HOMESCHOOLING) (Shaw, 2009).

== '''The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)''' ==


'''What is the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)?''' 

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was signed into law in January 2002 by President Bush. It is a federal law to improve education for all children. This law challenges states and school districts to improve the academic achievement of public schools considered to be at risk for failure (US Department of Education, 2009). 

'''What are the standards of the NCLB?'''

There are four main standards, or pillars, of the No Child Left Behind Act. They are: stronger accountability for results, more freedom for states and communities (IN WHAT WAY DO SCHOOLS GET MOR FREEDOM? THE NEXT PARAGRAPH SAYS THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH FEDERAL CONTROL?), proven education methods, and more choices for parents (US Department of Education, 2009). 

'''Why is there controversy behind the NCLB?'''

There are teachers, schools, and educational organizations that believe the No Child Left Behind Act is flawed and ineffective. (WHY IS IT INEFFECTIVE?) Money concerns are a main factor, as adequate funding to support this law is essential. Another issue leading to this controversy is the fact that some teachers feel the need to sacrifice one subject for another under the NCLB testing requirements. (TEACHING TO THE TEST, INSTEAD OF TEACHING FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN) Too much federal control is a concern, as well as some necessary changes that need to be implemented to the law (WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE?) (HOW to FIX, 2007).

Comment:

The application questions seem very straight forward. You could try to make them a little more challenging.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because there was discussion on the topics presented but only a few of those topics were fully explained. Some of the key explanations were lacking like says in the NCLB section that the gov't has too much control, but then not explaining how. 

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 4 on interest because again there were some good points that were explained but not all as throughly as they could be. Also the picture and side bar are nice except they are both at the beginning. By the time the reader gets to the middle of the article there are just large blocks of text. Maybe you could spread out the side bar and picture, or put some of your links into a side bar to make it more visually stimulating. 
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 5 for credibility because many diverse and recent credible sources. Due to the nature of the article not really any opinion necessary (FAQ). 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 3 on writing because not to be offensive, but the article was very dry. The tone is very matter of fact, and does not capture the readers attention. Even in the &quot;controversy&quot; sections the article did not really play up the &quot;dramatic&quot; issues. Some of the information brought up is not really explained, just stated. Some of the sentence structure was very repetitive and at times hard to follow.  (Example: The supports say..., Supporters ....)   
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;'''Mostly based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and '''discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals add to the article'''
&lt;li&gt;At least t'''wo perspectives were presented'''
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;S'''ome good points are made and explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.'''
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions ('''2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Parts of the article capture attention'''
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the cited information is discussed'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. Very well researched article, loads of great sources. 
&lt;li&gt;. Well formatted article. The lay out makes it easier to follow, and lets read know exactly where to look for particular information. 

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. Explain more of the information. Many of the sections may general overview statements without much explanation. For a person not familiar with this topic matter, it maybe hard to follow without more explanation.
&lt;li&gt;. Put the added links at the bottom of each section into sidebars to help break up the chunks of information and added visual appeal to the article for more interest. 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;li&gt;'''Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented

&lt;li&gt;'''Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate'''.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions''' (&lt;s&gt;2 application&lt;/s&gt; &amp; 2 knowledge)  '''align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines''' (see R4)

&lt;li&gt;'''Captures and maintains attention throughout'''
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors'''. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.'''The learning targets are easy to read and find in the article'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''The whole article flows and was very interesting to read'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.'''Would like to see a conclusion'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''Take out a couple of the sources that you offer the reader to investigate on their own so it is not distracting away from the main point of the article'''

'''Excellent Job!!'''
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

In most schools around the country, teachersâ salaries are based almost completely on their educational background as well as experience (Schencker, 2009)....TEACHERS NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED

An article in the Salt Lake Tribune states, âThe amount of pay will depend on each schoolâs plan. According to the law, the programs must base 40 percent of the pay on student progress, which will likely be measured by test results; 40 percent on instructional quality; and 20 percent on parent, student or community satisfactionâ (Schencker, 2009). In my opinion, this new âPay for Progressâ plan definitely has the potential to not only increase the quality of education for students but also raise the standard and motivation for teachers....THE SPOTS WITH THE SQUARES NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT

In most schools around the country, teachersâ salaries are based almost completely on their educational background as well as experience (Schencker, 2009). For five elementary schools in Utah, this story is beginning to change. Recently, lawmakers in Utah passed a bill that will allow these selected schools to receive a total of $300,000 per year for two years in an effort to increase the quality of education for the students (Schencker, 2009). The money is to be divided between the five chosen schools. During the first year of the program, each school will use a portion of the funds to create a plan that will measure teacher and student successes (Schencker, 2009)...THESE FIRST FEW SENTENCES ARE A BIT CONFUSING ONLY BECAUSE THE FIRST SENTENCE TALKS ABOUT SALARAIES BEING BASED ON THE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE THEN THE NEXT SENTENCE SAYS THIS STORY IS GOING TO CHANGE FOR FIVE SCHOLLS.  THESE ARE FINE BUT THE THIRD SENTENCE SAYS THESE CHOSEN SCHOOLS ARE GETTING THE MONEY TO INVREASE THE QUALITY EDUCATION.  I MAY BE READING IT WRONG BUT POSSIBLY JUST READING OVER THE BEGINNING TO SEE THAT IT IS CLEAR.

âNational disgrace.â These are words used by U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, to explain the Detroit Public School System (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). This Michigan school district is in dire need of radical changes, according to Duncan, emergency financial manager Robert Bobb and Mayor Dave Bing, to name a few (Mrozowski&amp; Esparza, 2009). Due to problems like decreased enrollment, low graduation rate and financial fraud, the cityâs school system has been under intense scrutiny by federal, state and local education officials (Dawsey, 2009). Duncan has $5 billion available in stimulus money to offer to those school districts making drastic changes; included in these changes, he admits he would like to see mayoral control of the Detroit school system. (Dawsey, 2009) ....CHECK FOR ALL OF THE SQUARES.  ALSO AT THE END OF THE LAST SENTENCE I PASTED THE PARIOD GOES AFTER THE PARENTHESIS.

Duncan has $5 billion available in stimulus money to offer to those school districts making drastic changes; included in these changes, he admits he would like to see mayoral control of the Detroit school system. (Dawsey, 2009) ....POSSIBLY WITH THIS SENETENCE CHECK TO SEE IF YOU NEED QUOTATION MARKS OR NOT.

National disgrace.â These are words used by U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, to explain the Detroit Public School System (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). This Michigan school district is in dire need of radical changes, according to Duncan, emergency financial manager Robert Bobb and Mayor Dave Bing, to name a few (Mrozowski&amp; Esparza, 2009). Due to problems like decreased enrollment, low graduation rate and financial fraud, the cityâs school system has been under intense scrutiny by federal, state and local education officials (Dawsey, 2009). Duncan has $5 billion available in stimulus money to offer to those school districts making drastic changes; included in these changes, he admits he would like to see mayoral control of the Detroit school system. (Dawsey, 2009) On Wednesday, May 13, 2009, Bobb requested that the federal government place the school district under special circumstances and grant additional emergency financial support to help facilitate rapid changes (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). These emergency funds are generally reserved for areas that have been struck by natural disasters; because this is not the case in Detroit, it could mean that the request will not be honored (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). A mayoral takeover of the Detroit Public Schools is one suggestion to help aid in the struggling situation. Duncan has supported this idea, although many others are very hesitant to believe that this is the answer to the problems (Dawsey, 2009). The choice could be that for the people of the city of Detroit to decide if the bill makes its way to the ballot for a November vote (Dawsey, 2009). Those who support this idea look to recent changes for hope; Bobb has already begun making transformations that include closing 29 schools, firing principals at low-performing schools as well as diminishing $305 million from the district deficit (Dawsey, 2009). On the other hand, those who oppose this suggested change see the previous mayoral takeover that was supported by Gov. John Engler, in 1999, as a failure (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). In a similar situation to today, after the mayor took control of the school district in 1999, the condition of the district worsened with the leadership change. The possibility of a mayoral takeover of the school system continues to be a highly debated issue with lawmakers, politicians and interest groups all weighing in (Dawsey, 2009). One thought, however, remains agreed upon, serious measures must be taken to revamp the Detroit Public School System to bring it to a functioning level without corruption and failure (Dawsey, 2009). ....I THINK WITH THIS WHOLE PARRAGRAH YOU SHOULD JUST CHECK WHETHER YOU NEED QUOTATION MARKS OR NOT.  THERE WERE SOME SPOTS THAT I THOUGHT WERE A LITTLE QUESTIONABLE AS TO WHETHER THEY WERE PARAPHRASED OR QUOTED.

I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND SCHOLARLY ARTICLES.  I NEJOYED THE SOURCES THAT YOU DID PROVIDE AND YOU HAD THE FIVE THAT WERE REQUIRED  I MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN BUT CHECK OVER THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT TWO ARE SCHOLARLY.  ALL OF THE IN TEXT CITATIONS WERE CORRECT FOR PARAPHRASING.  THE CITATIONS OF THE RESOURCES NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO FIT THE FORMAT.  I DID BELIEVE YOU HAD A NICE BALANCE OF REFERENCES HAVING TO DEAL WITH CONTENT BUT I DID NOT FIN SCHOLARLY.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article __4_ for importance because I THOUGHT YOU HAD A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS AND GREAT INFORMATION.  I LIKED HOW YOU CITED EVERYTHING NICELY.  I THOUGHT THERE WERE A FEW SPOTS WEHRE INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUOTED BUT STILL YOU QUOTED IT AS PARPHRASING.  YOU DID PROVIDE VALID SOURCES THAT DID HAVE RESEARCH IN THEM.  INFORMATION WAS RELEVANT TO THE WHAT IS GOING ON IN 2009.  I THOUGHT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMATION POSSIBLY WITH MORE IDEAS.  I LIKED HOW YOU ADDED YOUR OWN THOUGHTS.


&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article _3__ on interest because YOU MADE A LOT OF GREAT POINTS THAT I THOUGHT COULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO OR EVEN HAVING MORE POINTS INCLUDED IN YOUR SECTION.  I FELT YOUR PIECE WAS WELL DONE BUT COULD HAVE HAD A BIT MORE INFORMATION JUST TO GIVE THE READER/AUDIENCE A LITTLE MORE.  YOU INCLUDED NICE SIDEBARS.  
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article _4__ for credibility because...I THOUGHT YOU PUT YOUR WORDS TOGETHER VERY WELL.  JUST A BIT MORE EDITING WOULD MAKE YOUR PART EVEN BETTER.  YOU COULD HAVE ADDED A FEW MORE PARTS AND OPINIONS TO YOUR PAPER TO MAKE IT HAVE A WIDER RANGE OF INFORMATION.  I DID ENJOY READING ABOUT THE FEW POINTS YOU DID MENTION. THERE WERE A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDED.  I DID MENTION BEWFORE POSSIBLY FINDING SOME SCHOLARLY RESOURCES.  EVEN WITHOUT THEM THOUGH YOU DID FIND CREDIBLE SOURCES AND CITED EVERYTHING IN YOUR PAPER WELL.  YOU DID NOT TRY TO PASS OFF ANY INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT YOUR OWN.  AS I MENTIONED BEFORE JUST CHECK OVER YOUR PIECE TO MAKE SURE SOME PARTS DO NOT NEED TO BE QUOTED. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article _4__ on writing because YOUR MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS WERE PUT TOGETHER WELL.  YOU ADDED THE TWO KNOWLEDGE AND APPLICATION.  YOU ALSO MADE THEM TOWARDS THE LEARNING TARGETS.  PERIODICALLY YOUR SECTION CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.  YOU DID DISCUSS THE CITED MATERIAL WELL.  POSSIBLY A BIT MORE CAN BE ADDED.  THE ARTICLE FLOWED WELL AND IT REALLY HAD FEW MECHANICAL ERRORS EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL BOXE THAT APPEARED BUT I WOULD BELIEVE THAT IS JUST A CRAZY THING HAPPENING WITH WIKIPEDIA AND WOULD NOT TAKE LONG TO FIX.

&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers&lt;/big&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple &lt;big&gt;(2-3) new ideas or pieces of information&lt;/big&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.&lt;/big&gt;   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; THE ARTICLE WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN WITH FEW GRAMATICAL ERRORS.  THE SIDEBAR QUOTES WERE GREAT TO READ.
&lt;li&gt;. THE QUESTIONS WERE WELL FORMATTED TO FIT THE TARGET GOALS.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; CHECK OVER THE ARTICLE FOR THE QUOTATION CHANGES.
&lt;li&gt;. POSSIBLY ADDING MORE INFORMATION THAT ONE MIGHT FIND IN THE NEWS.  I AM SURE THERE IS A GREAT AMOUNT.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? '''Yes'''
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? '''Yes''' 
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) '''I think they're right in the middle.'''
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) '''Yes'''
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? '''Yes'''
Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:

'''Though objectives #1-3 are okay, I think objective #4 should be re-evaluated.  How does a name broaden awareness about this topic?  I think it would work better as a multiple choice question to test one's comprehension rather than making it a learning target.  One should walk from this article and remember primary examples versus names.'''

PASTE TEXT HERE

1. Students will be able to name the state that has adopted the 'Pay for Performance' program and note at which school level it is being tested

2. Students will be able to explain the three criteria used to determine teacher's success and amount of additional pay in the 'Pay for Performance' programs

3. Students will be able to list three examples of failure in the Detroit Public School System

4. Students will be able to identify U.S. Secretary of Education and his position on mayoral control of the Detroit Public School System

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; None of the objective targets have periods. &lt;/font&gt;

&quot;In most schools around the country, teachersâ salaries&quot; 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I'm not sure what the &quot;a&quot; is following the word &quot;teachers&quot; but it is all throughout the article.  &lt;/font&gt;

&quot;After the completion of the first year, using the methods decided upon by the school, teachers will be awarded additional money for the success of their students.&quot; 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;  What about: &quot;Following completion of the first year&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

&quot;I also believe that through this program, highly qualified teachers may find interest in these, and other schools, after realizing that not only will experience and educational background play a factor in their salary, but their efforts and success in the classroom could also land them extra pay.&quot; 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; This is a run on sentence, how about:  &quot;In addition, I believe this program will attract highly qualified teachers. Not only will their experience and educational background reflect their salaries, but their efforts and success in the classroom as well.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;  

&quot;The choice could be [[that]] for the people of the city of Detroit to decide if the bill makes its way to the ballot for a November vote&quot; 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I wish I had some suggestions I just don't know what is meant by this...especially the placement of the word &quot;that.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

3. ''If Mrs. Smith is in favor of the mayoral control in Detroit Public Schools because she believes [[is]] will increase the quality of education for her son John, which mayor would she be trusting to take contol of this important position and make changes?'' 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Did you mean &quot;it&quot; ? &lt;/font&gt;

4. ''If Mr. Nixon's child was a student in the Detroit Public School System, which of the following describes [[what his child likely to be]] experiencing in school?'' 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Is it supposed to be &quot;what his child [[is]] likely to be experiencing?&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because...the information was relevent to the teachers of today and tomorrow and was applicable to schools today.  She also provided a good general overview of the information though it lacked organization, the point still came across.

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 3 on interest because...The sidebar did include new information related to the topic, new perspectives were presented but there was not a conclusion that synthesized the information presented.  
 

&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 2 for credibility because...Though she had 5 sources, none of them were scholarly which 2 were required.  The sources she did have lacked diversity because a majority of them were popular news sources where no authors were even listed.  
 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 2 on writing because...The 4 multiple-choice questions were included, at least one part of the article was interesting but the information was put together with minimal explanation.  The organization was difficult to follow, some sentences were akward and there were several grammatical and general errors. 
 
 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;'''Sources lack diversity''' OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. '''Some sources are untrustworthy''' or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Missing two or more sources''' OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 '''multiple-choice questions are included'''.
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;. I think the author did well on informing the audience of the topic and the varying sides.
&lt;li&gt;.She also did well at organizing and executing her multiple choice questions by provoking thought and reasoning skills on the readers behalf.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;. It seemed to me that the article lacked flow and organization. There was no real feeling of a beginning, middle, and end.  Perhaps, one topic could be the focus versus two, that way the author has the room to really delve into the topic and provide a beginning(Introduction), middle (body), and end (conclusion).


&lt;li&gt;. I also observed that the author's sentiments were expressed in the first paragraph on the first topic but not the second.  If the article is condensed to one topic area her opinion will have more of an impact, particularly at the end of the article.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

&quot;Fools!&quot; (His clenched fist striking the lectern before him.) &quot;We must prepare today's youth for a world whose terrors are etched upon ancient clay tablets recounting the fever-dreams of the other gods—not fill their heads with such trivia as math and English. Our graduates need to know about those who lie beneath the earth, waiting until the stars align so they can return to their rightful place as our masters and wage war against the Elder Things and the shoggoths!&quot;– Fictitious Arkham school board member, Charles West.  (NOT LISTED IN REFFERENCES)

The American school has traditionally &lt;u&gt;served all young people in one neighborhood and aims to develop local community&lt;/u&gt;(IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE SOMETHING IS MISSING)  awareness and to offer the acquisition of knowledge and skill in all areas relevant to an adult citizen.

. In Japan, the curriculum has been as standardized and external as any in the world, with prescribed textbooks as well as national content; though, student assessment is still left to teachers.(MAYBE THESE TWO SENTECES SHOULD BE IN DIFFERENT PARAGRAPHS) There has been a movement to encourage more individuality and student choice since 1992 with the introduction of life environment studies in primary schools to encourage creativity and independent learning. 

Beane feels that schools have an obligation to promote democratic social integration. In place of a capitalistic, competitive structure, the classroom should be based on democracy, diversity and equality. (THIS IS A  QUOTE SHOULD BE IN QUOTATION MARKS AND CITED )

. &quot;This has weakened academic quality in general, and made the federal government’s grip on the education system tighter. Local control over education is always better than centralized federal control. We are extremely concerned by any calls for nationalized standards, especially since it is unclear what room would be left for educational freedom, or how homeschoolers will be affected.&quot; (NO CITATION FOR THIS QUOTE)

There’s the inkling that if the federal government gets more involved that &lt;u&gt;things&lt;/u&gt;( MAYBE USE A MORE DISCIRTIVE TERM) will just get worse, but they’re(THEY'RE ?  MAYBE TRY -THE CURRICUIUM )  certainly didn’t get any better in my scholastic lifetime in the state’s hands.

3. Bill argues that different states and different school districts all being on their own programs makes it nearly impossible for those children to keep up in school. He also believes there needs to be a national core base of knowledge that all Americans share so that people in our country can read and communicate intelligently. What is Bill most likely an a proponent of?
A. The Communism Party
B. A national curriculum
C. Free ice cream and zombie costume holiday, every second &lt;u&gt;Saturday&lt;/u&gt; (SATURDAY SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED) of the month for all eternity
D. Keeping schools the way they have traditionally been

Comment:

Although short on citing sources those missing were most likely over looked. The use of scholarly sources was light, maybe the use of scholarly or trade journals could have been considered. Maybe one more source for the Adversaries could have been used.

&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.

&lt;li&gt;'''Sources lack diversity''' OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors'''. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.  ''' &lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.I enjoyed the opening quote I had to read it a couple times. 
&lt;li&gt;.I also enjoyed the creativty you used in the conclusion.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.The use of scholarly sources can make this article more credible.
&lt;li&gt;.Try not to use &quot;things&quot; as a discriptive term. It is a bad habit that I myself am working on.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Very &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Kind of. . . &lt;/font color&gt;
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The learning targets for this article are very good. They are specific and written at such a reading level that makes the reader think and not just read. For the most part, the targets are observable, but they could be a little less figurative and a little more specific. &lt;/font color&gt;




-----------------------

=== Grammar and Mechanics Review''' ===

*Please either paste the entire body of the article here or any sections that you feel need to be revised. 
*To do this:
**go back to the module page for the article
**select &quot;edit this page&quot;
**highlight all the text, hit control &quot;c&quot; (or &quot;copy&quot; from the edit menu)
**navigate back to your peer review page
**click edit this page and paste the text into this window (use control &quot;v&quot; or paste from the edit menu)
**You may want to have Wikibooks open in two windows/tabs to make this process easier.
*Type your comments in ALL CAPITALS or in &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; another color &lt;/font&gt; so the author can easily find them.

A National Curriculum is a framework used by some country's schools to ensure that teaching and learning is balanced and consistent. It lays out a guideline for the subjects taught, the knowledge, skills and understanding required in each subject, and the standards or attainment targets in each subject. Teachers are to use these to measure a child's progress and plan the next steps in their learning. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; [ &lt;/font color&gt;The government also regulates how your child's progress is assessed and reported.&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ]  this sentence seemes a little awkward and doesn't flow well. &lt;/font color&gt;


&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; When it comes to these points, could they all be written the same way? Ex: all are questions, or all are fragments, etc. &lt;/font color&gt;
Pros of such a system in the US:

- Establishes a unified educational system. All states are on the same page. If a student moves to a different school district, it is much less troublesome to catch up.

- It would allow adequate state by state education comparisons, because all standards would be the same.

- Certifications for teaching could be nationwide, due to standards being the same.

- Bring about new forms of assessment for post-secondary education outside of SAT, SOL, ACT, etc.


The Dreaded Cons:

- Unavoidable disagreements about who decides what information is important to teach, and what isn't. (Question: Do you think this would differ from how it is now?)

- This would potentially effect private schools, charter schools and homeschoolsâ by dictating what must be taught.

- Other aspects, especially teacher salaries, would need to become uniform and regulated.

- Allows the federal government more control over school funding instead of the state.

- Different regions would value different cultural aspects of education over others.


&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Everything else looks really good. I found a lot of the article very enjoyable to read. The only thing is that there are weird little &quot;a's&quot; in some random places, so you should go through and take those out. I think they pop up when you try to put in an apostrophe.&lt;/font color&gt;


-----------------------

=== Sources ===

For each source listed in the &quot;References&quot; section of the article, name the type of source (scholarly or popular) and the perspective it provides (research, expert opinion from educator, popular news source, parent organization, personal contact, etc.)
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, online encyclopedia &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, online encyclopedia &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, blog &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, parent organization &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, reference &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, encyclopedia &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, news source &lt;/font color&gt;
 
List the range of publication years for all sources, e.g. 1998-2006: &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 1993 &lt;/font color&gt; - &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 2009 &lt;/font color&gt;

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt; and use at least 2 scholarly sources? V
#Are the citations in APA format? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment:

&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; All of the sources are good and appropriate. &lt;/font color&gt;


-----------------------

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; knowledge &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 2 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; knowledge &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 3 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; reasoning &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 4 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; reasoning &lt;/font color&gt;


Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt; 
#Do the questions assess the learning target? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the foils (the response options that are NOT the answer) reasonable i.e. they are not very obviously incorrect answers? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the response options listed in alphabetical order? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; no &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are correct answers provided and listed BELOW all the questions? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the multiple-choice questions. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve the question/s.

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Mostly based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals add to the article'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least two perspectives were presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the information/ideas are new'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Some good points are made and explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions '''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; I found many parts of this article to be amusing; especially &quot;Assessment!&quot; &lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Your writing is excellent. &lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; A clever picture somewhere in the article would be nice. &lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Some sidebars included would add some interest to the layout. &lt;/font color&gt;
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? Yes
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? No, they are not very specific
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) Yes, they are appropriate and reasonable
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) Yes
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? Yes

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:

The learning targets should be more specific. Instead of &quot;The reader will be able to define all terms&quot; you could say &quot;The reader will be able to define formal curriculum and hidden curriculum&quot;. You should make your second learning target more specific as well. Instead of saying that that the reader should easily be able to answer the review questions, maybe say something like students should easily be able to define the four &quot;R&quot;'s.

[edit] Frequently Asked Questions
What are &quot;The &quot;Three R's&quot; and how do they relate to teaching?&quot;

In this case, the &quot;Three R's&quot; were originally quoted as being &quot;reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic&quot;(American Heritage). Reading, writing, and arithmetic were originally thought to be the basis of all education. Since then, teaching has evolved to a point where these are the core, but many other equally important subjects are taught.

For more information on the Three R's of the Environment, click:

http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0775891.html
 




&quot;Is there a &quot;Fourth R?&quot;&quot; THERE ARE TWO QUOTATIONS HERE INSTEAD OF ONE

The concept of a &quot;Fourth R&quot; is debated among teachers. Some of the suggestions relating to academics are Relationship, Rhythm (music), and Art (Olah, 2009). Most teachers see all of these as being equally important to the original &quot;Three R's.&quot; These three hopeful additions are things that are necessary for one to become a well-rounded individual. Three other very well known R's that many teachers present to their students are &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.&quot; The environment is one of the most pertinant topics today and is discussed in many classrooms between a teacher and his or her students (Olah, 2009).

PERTINENT IS SPELLED INCORRECTLY IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH



&quot;What is &quot;Formal Curriculum&quot;? What is a &quot;Hidden Curriculum&quot;? How do they differ?&quot;

A formal curriculum is the typical lesson plan that a teacher makes on any given day which covers all of the academic topics that will be covered in class. A &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; (also referred to as informal curriculum or character education), on the other hand, is an implied curriculum which addresses character traits. Formal curriculum is expicit to the student because it's goals are made clear by the teacher before teaching begins. &quot;Hidden curriculum&quot; is considered implicit because it happens beneath the surface of a lesson and is meant to subconsciously improve students' character (Bibbs, Jr, 2009).

To read a blog entry about Hidden Curriculum by a Georgetown professor with comments from her students, click:

https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/phil-157-fall2008/2007/09/15/the-hidden-curriculum/

EXPLICIT IS SPELLED WRONG IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH. &quot;IT'S&quot; IS USED INCORRECTLY; THERE SHOULD BE NO APOSTROPHE. 



&quot;How does &quot;hidden cirriculum&quot; affect students?&quot; CURRICULUM IS SPELLED INCORRECTLY

&quot;Hidden curriculum&quot; allows teachers the ability to not only teach their chosen lesson, but also other life skills. &quot;Hidden curriculum&quot; is often referred to as &quot;character education&quot; because that is precisely what it does (Bibbs, Jr, 2009). Through this implicit instruction, teachers can impart important relationship, time management, and social responsibility skills on to their students.




&quot;What is a standardized test&quot; THERE SHOULD BE A QUESTION MARK AFTER THE WORD TEST

A standardized test is a &quot;standard&quot; test on specific subject matter that is given and graded in a uniform way (Jones, 2009). Examples of such tests are the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL's), the ERB, the PSAT, the SAT, the PRAXIS I and the PRAXIS II, and AP exams. These types of tests never differ no matter what school, city, or state they are administered in.




&quot;What are the pros and cons about standardized testing?&quot;

In the academic world, there are many arguments for and against standardized testing. Some feel that the tests are &quot;too standard&quot; to truly assess students, while others feel that all students need to be assessed the same way. The main argument for standardized testing is cooperation; cooperation not only at the teacher:student level, but at many other levels (Jones, 2009). The main argument against standardized testing is the view that schools narrow their curriculum to support the test (Jones, 2009).




&quot;What are AP and IB classes? How do they affect students and teachers?&quot;

AP classes, or Advanced Placement classes, are classes in which high school students complete college level work for the chance to receive college credit (based on a qualifying test score) (Gauss, 2009). IB classes, or International Baccalaureate classes, are those in which the students study multiple topics and see how they relate (Gauss, 2009). Both of these types of classes are at a much higher level than typical high school classes and require not only brighter students but better teachers as well.

For a specific College Board description of AP classes, click:

http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/about.html
 
For the International Baccalaureate Organization official website, click

http://www.ibo.org/
 




&quot;What is College Preparatory education? Who are its main targets?&quot;

College preparatory education a course of study that prepares students for learning at a college level and sets them up to be successful in college (Lewis, 2009). Its main targets are low-income and minority students because those groups are the two that are least likely to attend college (Lewis, 2009). The goal of college prep programs is to help these and all students succede in college. Classes that are typical to the college prep course work would be Honors and AP classes.

THE FIRST SENTENCE IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH IS A FRAGMENT. THE WORD 'IS' NEEDS TO BE PLACED AFTER EDUCATION.


&quot;What is Vocational education? Who are its main targets?&quot;

Vocational education teaches students skills that will help them attain careers (Lewis, 2009). Vocational education is for students who will not be attending college immediately after high school or attending college at all (Lewis, 2009). Classes that are typical to the vocational education course work would be Cosmetology and Nursing classes.

For the US Government website about vocational education, click:

http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/index.html
 



&quot;What are advantages and disadvantages to college prep courses?&quot;

The main advantage of college prep courses is that they truly prepare the students for the difficulty and amount of work that they will encounter in college (Filson, 2009). Another advantage is, if the student scores well enough on his or her AP exam, he or she can receive college credit for that course. The main disdavantage of college prep courses is that some students find that they are still not prepared to handle college courses (Filson, 2009).

IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH, THE WORDS 'AMOUNT', 'RECEIVE' AND 'DISADVANTAGE' ARE SPELLED INCORRECTLY.


&quot;What are advantages and disadvantages of vocational education courses?&quot;

The main advantage of vocational education is that it is a perfect option for those students who are not interested in attending college, but want a job instead (Filson, 2009). The main disadvantage of vocational education is that is often receives a negative connotation because the students who chose this track often did not do as well in high school as their colleg prep counterparts (Filson, 2009).

IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH, 'RECEIVES' AND 'COLLEGE' ARE SPELLED INCORRECTLY. 


&quot;What is the view of those who support standardized testing?&quot;

There are many who support standardized testing as the best way to assess students. One point of support is the small amount to time that it takes to grade these types of tests, espeially when using Scantron sheets which are read by a computer (Marcotte, 2009). Supporters also believe that standardized tests create the highest levels of accountability for teachers.

For a Washington Post article about the history of standardized testing, click:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/13/AR2006111301007.html
 
IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH, 'AMOUNT' AND 'ESPECIALLY' ARE SPELLED INCORRECTLY. 


&quot;What is the view of those who oppose standardized testing?&quot;

There are also many who oppose standardized testing. The main view of the opposition is that a single test is not enough to assess the depth of students' knowledge (Marcotte, 2009). Those who oppose feel that students who only experience standardized testing are denied access to a more diverse curriculum (Marcotte, 2009). Many people feel that standardized testing has caused a “dumbing” down on the American education system (Kohn, 2000, p29).

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because this article included relevant ideas for future teachers. It is based on researched information and is applicable to schools. There is a good general overviwew of the 3 &quot;R&quot;'s, formal and hidden curriculums, standardized and AP tests, college prep courses, and vocational education courses. There could be a few more questions related to curriculum included in the article.

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 4 on interest because it captured my attention and there was a great visual picture included. The sidebars provided information that enhanced the understanding of the curriculum, but it does not include new information that is motivating to read. Different perspectives are provided to standardized testing and vocational education courses. 

&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 5 for credibility because all sources are properly APA cited and included in the reference list. There is information from diverse soruces that represents multiple perspectives. 

&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 4 on writing because the multiple choice questions included two application and two reasoning questions. The learning targets are reasonable but not too specific. The article captured my attention, and there are few mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''

&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.'''
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed

&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. The article is very well written and organized. The multiple sidebars with the web links provide excellent further information on each topic discussed. There is a great use of color and font. 

&lt;li&gt;. The multiple choice questions are well-written and included two knowledge and two reasoning questions. They address key topics disussed throughout the article.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. The learning targets could be more specific and focus on 1-2 main topics discussed throughout the article. 
&lt;li&gt;. The multiple choice questions could be alphabatized and the few mechanical errors I noted could be corrected. 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? '''Yes'''
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? '''No'''
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) '''Yes'''
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) '''Yes'''
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? '''Yes'''

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment: The learning targets could be a bit more specific. The first learning target, ''The reader will be able to define all terms found within this article, is a little broad''. It could be rewritten as ''The reader will be able to define terms about curriculum''. The second learning target could also be changed or erased entirely since it is similar to the first learning target.

'''Learning Targets'''
The reader will be able to define all terms found within this article. THE READER WILL BE ABLE TO DEFINE ALL TERMS ABOUT CURRICULUM. 

The reader will be able to easily answer the review questions that accompany the content articles in this chapter. REMOVED CHARACTERS SINCE THEY WERE NOT SHOWING AS BULLETS. 

FOR SOME REASON, AT THE END THE FONT CHANGES. IF YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY SEEING SPECIFIC CHANGES PLEASE EMAIL ME.

FOR EACH QUESTION, REMOVED QUOTATION MARKS, NOT NEEDED. 
'''What are &quot;The &quot;Three R's&quot; and how do they relate to teaching?'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The &quot;Three R's&quot; were originally quoted as being &quot;reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic&quot;(American Heritage). Reading, writing, and arithmetic were thought to be the basis of all education. However, teaching has evolved to a point where these are core subjects, but so are many other equally important subjects. &lt;/font&gt;


'''Is there a &quot;Fourth R?&quot;'''  THESE ARE MORE LIKE OTHER SETS OF THE 3 R's. MAY WANT TO REWRITE THE QUESTION AS &quot;ARE THERE OTHER SETS OF THE THREE R's&quot;? 

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;These three hopeful additions are things that are necessary for one to become a well-rounded individual. &lt;/font&gt; MAY WANT TO REVISE THIS BECAUSE THE WORD &quot;HOPEFUL&quot; AND &quot;NECESSARY&quot; CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. 


'''&quot;What is &quot;Formal Curriculum&quot;? What is a &quot;Hidden Curriculum&quot;? How do they differ?&quot;''' REWRITE AS: WHAT IS FORMAL CURRICULUM AND HIDDEN CURRICULUM? HOW DO THEY DIFFER?

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;A formal curriculum is the typical lesson plan that a teacher makes on any given day and covers all of the academic topics that will be covered in class. A &quot;hidden curriculum&quot;, also referred to as informal curriculum or character education), is an implied curriculum which addresses character traits.  Formal curriculum is expicit to the student because it's goals are made clear by the teacher before teaching begins. In contrast, hidden curriculum is considered implicit since it occurs beneath the surface of a lesson and is meant to subconsciously improve students' character (Bibbs, Jr, 2009). &lt;/font&gt;


'''How does hidden cirriculum affect students?''' CIRRICULUM SHOULD BE SPELLED AS CURRICULUM

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Hidden curriculum allows teachers the ability to not only teach their chosen lesson, but also other life skills. It is often referred to as &quot;character education&quot; because of its lessons in life skills(Bibbs, Jr, 2009). Through this implicit instruction, teachers can impart important relationship, time management, and social responsibility skills unto their students. &lt;/font&gt;


'''&quot;What is a standardized test&quot;''' REWRITE AS: WHAT IS A &quot;STANDARDIZED TEST&quot;?

A standardized test is a &quot;standard&quot; test on specific subject matter that is given and graded in a uniform way (Jones, 2009). Examples of such tests are the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL's), the ERB, the PSAT, the SAT, the PRAXIS I and the PRAXIS II, and AP exams. These types of tests never differ no matter what school, city, or state they are administered in.
WRITE OUT THE REST OF THE TESTS. 


'''&quot;What are the pros and cons about standardized testing?&quot;''' REWRITE AS: WHAT ARE THE ADVATAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF STANDERIZED TESTING?

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; There are many arguments for and against standardized testing in the educational community. Advocates feel that the tests are &quot;too standard&quot; to truly assess students, while critics feel that all students need to be assessed the same manner. Supporters mainly argue for cooperation, not only at the teacher:student level, but at many other levels [MAY WANT TO LIST SOME MORE LEVELS](Jones, 2009). Those who oppose standardized testing is the view that schools narrow their curriculum to support the test (Jones, 2009). &lt;/font&gt;

MOVED QUESTIONS HERE FOR CONSISTENCY. ALSO RECOMMENDS COMBINING THE FOLLOWING 2 QUESTIONS IN THE PREVIOUS QUESTION OR HAVE TWO SEPERATE QUESTIONS. (WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF STANDARDIZED TESTING? WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF STANDARDIZED TESTING?)


'''What is the view of those who support standardized testing?'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; There are many who support standardized testing as the best method to assess students. Administrators spend a small amount of time to grade these tests, especially when using Scantron sheets which are read by a computer (Marcotte, 2009). Supporters also believe that standardized tests create the highest levels of accountability for teachers. &lt;/font&gt;


'''What is the view of those who oppose standardized testing?'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; There are also many who oppose standardized testing. The primary view is that a single test is not enough to assess the depth of students' knowledge (Marcotte, 2009). They feel that students who only experience standardized testing are denied access to a more diverse curriculum (Marcotte, 2009). Many people also feel that standardized testing has caused a &quot;dumbing down&quot; on the American education system (Kohn, 2000, p29). &lt;/font&gt;


'''What are AP and IB classes? How do they affect students and teachers?'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; AP classes, or Advanced Placement classes, are classes in which high school students complete college level work for the chance to receive college credit, based on a qualifying test score (Gauss, 2009). IB classes, or International Baccalaureate classes, are those in which the students study multiple topics and see how they relate with each other (Gauss, 2009). Both of these types of classes are at a much higher level than typical high school classes and require not only brighter students but better teachers as well. &lt;/font&gt;



'''What is College Preparatory education? Who are its main targets?''' REPLACE &quot;WHO&quot; WITH &quot;WHAT&quot;

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; College preparatory education is a course of study that prepares students for learning at a college level and sets them up to be successful in college (Lewis, 2009). Its main targets are low-income and minority students because these groups are least likely to attend college (Lewis, 2009). The goal of college preparatory programs is to help these, and all students succede in college. Classes that are typical to the college preparatory course work would be Honors and AP classes. &lt;/font&gt; MIGHT WANT TO DEFINE WHAT HONORS IS.


'''&quot;What is Vocational education? Who are its main targets?&quot;'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Vocational education teaches students skills that will help them attain careers in different workforces(Lewis, 2009). Also known as trade school, it is for students who will not be attending college immediately after high school or attending college at all (Lewis, 2009). Classes that are typical to the vocational education course work would be centered around &quot;trades&quot; such as Cosmetology, Nursing or Automobile classes. &lt;/font&gt;


'''What are advantages and disadvantages to college prep courses?''' SPELL OUT PREP.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The main advantage of college preparatory courses is that they truly prepare students for the difficulty and amount of work that they will encounter in college or higher education(Filson, 2009). Student who score well enough on their AP exam can receive college credit for that course. However, some students discover that they are still not preparted for college or higher edcation courses (Filson, 2009). &lt;/font&gt;


'''What are advantages and disadvantages of vocational education courses?''' 

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Vocational education is an ideal option for those students who are not interested in attending college, but still want to enter a career or workforce(Filson, 2009). The main disadvantage though, is that it often receives a negative connotation because students who chose this track often did not do as well in high school as their colleg preparatory counterparts (Filson, 2009). &lt;/font&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article '''4''' for importance because '''it is very important to know the different types of curriculum used in education. It is also important to understand both perspectives of standerized testing since it is a very controversial topic among teachers, students, parents, school adminstrators, and professionals.'''

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article '''4''' on interest because '''many terms that I did not know or had misconceptions about were made clear, such as the difference between College Prepartory education and Vocational education. This article addressed how students percieve these types of education, which is informative since most of the time it is from a teacher's perspective.''' 
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article '''4''' for credibility '''because the author did a lot of research; at least two perspectives were shown for different aspects and the sources used had strong credibility. The majority of sources were also very recent, as early as this year.''' 

&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article '''3''' on writing because '''it had some spelling and mechanical errors, as well as some grammar errors. There was also some inconsistency with the placement of questions.'''

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.

&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.

&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

'''&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
'''&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;'''Parts of the article capture attention'''
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the cited information is discussed'''&lt;li&gt;'''A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized.''' '''There were a few distracting errors'''.'''&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;'''

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''There are pros and cons on debatable issues, such as standerized testing, college preparatory courses and vocational education.''' 
&lt;li&gt;. '''The article included the views of not only educators but of studetns as well.''' 

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''There could be more information on the word Honors classes. '''
&lt;li&gt;. '''There could be another word for &quot;job&quot; in the Vocational section.''' 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Comment:

I believe the titles of the books need to be italicized.  I was unsure what the reference &quot;Effective School Products&quot; was or where it came from.  Also, I was confused when reading the last three references as there were double spaces that I think should be eliminated.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints:
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.  The learning target aligns with the content and multiple-choice questions well.
&lt;li&gt;.  There are many FAQs in the article and they are relevant and answered clearly and thoughtfully.  Many scholarly sources are used.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.  There are only approximately 528 words in the content of the article and the Wikibook Article Guidelines call for 800-1000.  More content and in-depth discussion would raise the &quot;important&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; ratings on the Rubric.
&lt;li&gt;.  Please double check about italicizing the book titles and spacing on the references. 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? Yes
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? Yes
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) They are reasonable.
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) Yes, they are observable. 
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? Yes

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
I think that the learning target is effective because it describes what the student will be able to do by the end of the Chapter. It may only be one learning target, but I think that it is enough because it covers the entire section adequately.

The student(s) will be able to discuss and analyze the characteristics associated with an effective school as demonstrated through the performances of students, teachers, and administrators.


== Introducation == (MISSPELLING: INTRODUCTION)

As we enter the world of education in the twenty first century schools(I THINK IT SHOULD READ &quot;AS WE ENTER THE WORLD OF EDUCATION IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY, SCHOOLS ARE FACED WITH MANY CHALLENGES.) today are faced with many challenges.  These challenges are all encompassing.  They include effective teaching, safe and orderly environment, classroom management, planning and instruction, and the overall professionalism and attitude of people in a school building.  Today's schools are a reflection of the community that they serve.  With the laboring economy that effects us all (MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A COMMA HERE?) the work that has to be accomplished to create an effective school is more difficult then ever in the history of education.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Chapter FAQ's ==
&lt;big&gt;Q: What are effective schools?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  &quot;Effective Schools are schools that can, in measured student achievement terms, demonstrate the joint presence of quality and equity.  Effective Schools demonstrate high overall levels of achievement and no gaps in the distribution of that achievement across major subsets of the student population&quot; (Lawrence, Lezotte, &amp; McKee,(2002). (I DONT THINK THAT THIS IS CORRECT APA FORMAT FOR A QUOTATION. THERE SHOULD BE A PAGE # OR PARAGRAPH #)

&lt;big&gt;Q: What is a Mentor?&lt;/big&gt;

A: A mentor is someone a student can look up to and role model after.(MAYBE IT COULD BE WORDED &quot;..CAN LOOK UP TO AS A ROLE MODEL)  I (A) mentor is someone who is a trusted counselor or teacher and/or an influential senior and supporter (M SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED IN MENTORING)(mentoring, 2009).

&lt;big&gt;Q: What are Effective Teachers?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  &quot;An effective teacher has three characteristics defines as having positive expectations for student success, is an extremely good classroom manager, and knows how to design lessons for student mastery&quot; (Wong, H., &amp; Wong, R., 1998).  These three characteristics associated with an effective teacher are considered extremely important and must be put into place before an effective classroom can be achieved (Wong &amp; Wong, 1999). (CHECK APA FORMAT FOR QUOTATION)

&lt;big&gt;Q: What is a Safe and Orderly Environment?&lt;/big&gt;

A: The Student Wellbeing Branch (2006) states that safe schools are effective schools.  Safe schools include a (MAYBE IT COULD READ: SAFE SCHOOLS HAVE AN ESTABLISHED DEFINITION OF BULLYING??) definition of bullying, an anti-bullying policy, and strategies for schools and parents on prevention and management. 

&lt;big&gt;Q: What is Classroom Management?&lt;/big&gt;

A: Effective schools have teachers who are effective with their classroom management skills.  Classroom management is the ability of a teacher to organize everyday tasks, lessons, and assignment in such a way that students are actively engaged throughout the class period. (CHECK APA FORMAT FOR IN-TEXT CITATIONS. USE ONLY LAST NAME, NOT INITIALS) Wong, H., &amp; Wong, R., states that &quot;classroom management refers to all of the things that a teacher does to organize students, space, time, and materials so that instruction in content and student learning can take place&quot;(1999). (CHECK APA FORMAT FOR QUOTE, PAGE NUMBER, ETC?)

&lt;big&gt;Q: How to have effective planning?&lt;/big&gt; (THIS IS NOT A QUESTION, NEEDS TO BE RE-WORDED)

A:  In effective schools everyone include (SHOULD BE INCLUDING) all professonal and classified staff members have to develop a plan.  Those who do not plan find the school will have many behavior problems, off-tasked (OFF TASK) students, and general caious(SP=CHAOS)(Breaux, 2003).   

&lt;big&gt;Q: Is attitude everything?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  Attitude is everything!!  In effective schools(COMMA?) all building level personel(SP?) must have the attitude that all students will learn and be successfully(SUCCESSFUL).  &quot;Studnets should be treated with dignity while teachers carry themselves as a professional at all times and be the most enthusiastic person in the classroom&quot; (Breauz, 2003). (APA FORMAT FOR IN-TEXT QUOTE?)

&lt;big&gt;Q: How the community is affected?&lt;/big&gt;

A: Good school and community relations are an essential need (MAYBE IT SHOULD READ &quot;...COMMUNITY RELATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISH..&quot;) to establish an effective school environement.  Teachers and students must feel the support of their community.  &quot;Why is parent involvement so highly valued? (SHOULD THIS BE A NEW QUESTION HEADING?) Research shows that a correlate of increased levels of parent involvement is an increase in student achievement (REWORD?) (Epstein, 1995; Flaxman &amp; Inger, 1992; Hickman, Greenwood, &amp; Miller, 1995), as well as improved student attendance and reduced dropout rates (Berger, 1991; Greenwood &amp; Hickman, 1991). (CHECK APA FORMAT, I THINK YOU SITE THE AUTHORS AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE?) These are desirable outcomes from an &quot;educentric&quot; perspective, however they fall short of fully addressing the National Educational Goal to &quot;increase parental involvement and participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic growth of children&quot; (APA QUOTE FORMAT?) (Dunlap &amp; Alva(COMMA) 1999).

#. 1. popular news, but I am unsure. I do not see a journal, volume #, etc. (however, this may be a apa format issue)
#. 2. most likely scholarly, but I am still unsure because I do not see a journal #, etc. that you normally find in peer-review articles. 
#. 3. scholarly, not sure

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? Yes and use at least 2 scholarly sources? Yes, but it is hard to tell because I believe there are some APA format issues (no journal name, volume #, page #s, etc.)
#Are the citations in APA format? No, they need to be re-checked
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? No, they need to be re-checked

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic

&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the information/ideas are new'''&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors'''.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures attention initially and periodically throughout''' &lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;'''Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals'''&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;'''A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; I liked the introduction to the article, I thought that it grabbed the readers attention. 
&lt;li&gt;.It is very neat and attractive and well-organized. 

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; I think that you just need to go back and proofread for erros. 
&lt;li&gt;.Recheck the APA format, there were several APA erros. APA is tricky sometimes, and I find myself having to check and re-check everytime I use it! 
 

 
&lt;/ol&gt;
Overall, I think the article just needs a some proofreading and a some editing. Good flow, good organization, and a very attractive paper!

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

PASTE TEXT HERE

Teachers must find new and more effective methods to present the material, to allow the new generation of students the ability to learn and apply then information to different scenarios.

I BELIEVE &quot;THE&quot; SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF INFORMATION - GRAMMAR
 
The education system must ensure that teachers have all the tools necessary to be effective in this the new generation classroom

HERE I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO SAY THIS:  &quot;TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THIS NEW GENERATION OF CLASSROOMS.&quot;  

However, the challenge is on with the implementation of the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; to promote a quality of standards in 

HERE I THINK &quot;ON&quot; SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF SENTENCE.  MAKE MORE SENSE TO SAY &quot;THE CHALLENGE IS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION'

We are bombarded with politicians and lawmakers are thinking up new ways to improve our current education system starting with how effective our teachers are.

GRAMMAR NEED TO ADD;  WE ARE BOMBARDED WITH POLITICIANS AND LAWMAKERS &quot;THAT&quot; ARE THINKING UP NEW WAY....

According to Associated Press education writer, Libby Quaid, &quot;President Barack Obama intends to use $5 billion to prod local officials to close 

ADD &quot;THE&quot; IN FRONT OF ASSOCIATED - SOUND BETTER?

Keeping this in mind, are teachers solely to blame or our school districts failing teachers by not providing adequate resources and environments to teach? 

THIS SENTENCE A LITTLE CONFUSING;  KEEPING THIS IN MIND, ARE TEACHERS SOLELY TO BLAME OR &quot;ARE THE&quot; SCHOOL DISTRICTS FAILING TEACHERS BY NOT PROVIDING....

Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I enjoyed reading the quotations.  This really added to article.
&lt;li&gt;. This article covered topics beneficial to future teachers...good learning targets.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. There are a few grammar errors. Better proofreading.
&lt;li&gt;. Multiple choice questions, I thought they were all more knowledge questions, instead of 2 applications.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Introduction

The news regarding education these days is scary. Budget cutting, loss of teaching jobs, lack of programs,&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;and&lt;/font&gt; increased classroom sizes are some of the forefront topics. Where does this leave our children?

Unfortunately, too much emphasis seems to be placed on &lt;s&gt;performance standards of teachers and student passing a standardized test&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;standardized test scores&lt;/font&gt;. This&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; along with a generation of students who have the internet at their beckon &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;call&lt;/font&gt; and have come to expect a rapid barrage of information, that from video games and the internet, give teachers a new hurdle to overcome.&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Run-on sentence, consider making multiple sentences&lt;/font&gt; Teachers are all to&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;o&lt;/font&gt; often forced to teach to a test&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;s&gt;and&lt;/s&gt; not &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;able&lt;/font&gt; to ensure that students understand the material&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;s&gt;and can&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;or able to ensure that they&lt;/font&gt; apply the information to everyday situations. Teachers must find new and more effective methods to present the material, to allow the new generation of students the ability to learn and apply the&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt; information to different scenarios. The education system must ensure that teachers have all the tools necessary to be effective in this &lt;s&gt;the&lt;/s&gt; new generation classroom.


Characteristics of an effective teacher

The overall expectations of teachers may seem daunting at first. However, the challenge is &lt;s&gt;on with&lt;/s&gt; the implementation of the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; to promote a quality of standards in our schools. We are in a race as a nation&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; to provide the best form of education to our children. Every week in the news, education seems to be at the forefront of topics. We are bombarded with politicians and lawmakers &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; thinking up new ways to improve our current education system&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; starting with how effective our teachers are. Keeping up to date with new technology has made a major impact on the art of becoming an effective teacher and rising to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The challenge of becoming an effective teacher is to teach students using a variety of methods. One professor at Kent State suggests, &quot;using classroom parties to teach students about measurement.&quot; (McLean, J., 2009). There is a new course at Kent State this year, according to Jackie McLean, that &quot;is designed to help future English teachers learn how to use new technology in their classrooms...students will learn how to use blogs, wikis, podcasts and Nings&quot;( McLean, J., 2009). In this age of technology, in order to effectively teach and reach students on their levels, teachers must keep up with the times and keep learning about new things themselves so that they can provide a quality education to their students.


A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.
HENRY B. ADAMS

Accountability Measures

In 2002, former President Bush signed into law, an accountability &lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;ct to promote equal education for all called the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot;. (Wikipedia, 2009). Under this act, teachers and schools in general are being held to a higher standard when it comes to test scores. In order for schools to receive federal funding, their students must show an improvement in their test scores. The ball is placed back in the court of the educators and their effectiveness at teaching the required subjects to promote understanding and greater retention of knowledge to succeed on required tests mandated at the federal, state, and local level.

In the news, President Obama is taking on the challenge of fixing the American education system by expanding on the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot;, called the &quot;Federal School Turn-Around Program&quot; (MMIX. The Associated Press, 2009). According to Associated Press education writer, Libby Quaid, &quot;President Barack Obama intends to use $5 billion to prod local officials to close failing schools and reopen them with new teachers and principals&quot;. (Quaid, L. 2009). This sends a clear message to all teachers and schools, that they must improve or face the consequences of losing their jobs.


America's future walks through the doors of our schools every day.

Mary Jean LeTendre


Helping teachers become effective &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Be consistent with the capitalization of your headings&lt;/font&gt;

Keeping this in mind, are teachers solely to blame or our school districts failing teachers by not providing adequate resources and environments to teach? &lt;s&gt;The&lt;/s&gt; George Mason University in Virginia along with other school districts, developed a network called &quot;The New Science Teachers' Support Network, whose main goal is to &quot;help uncertified science teachers succeed at teaching and remain in the profession.&quot; (Sterling, D. &amp; Frazier, W. (2008). After researching different aspects that teachers face, they found that part of the problem of retaining effective teachers is because the teachers do not get the support they need from the administration whether it is in resources, the classroom environment, or leeway for curriculum to be taught.

Evaluating an effective Teacher

How can we tell if a teacher is effective? Are there set standards that measure teacher effectiveness? Should we have a federally mandated set of standards that measure teacher effectiveness? Since the NCLB was introduced, many states have been scrambling to provide their interpretation of higher standards for education, prove&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt; records of teacher effectiveness as shown in test scores, and &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;prove&lt;/font&gt; worthiness of federally funded monies to provide much-needed sources for their schools. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Run-on sentence, consider revising&lt;/font&gt; However, how can we be sure that they are not inflating their competency in order to receive the compensation for improvement? Kevin Carey suggests that &quot;requiring every state, district or school to approach professional development [for teachers] in the same way, makes little sense.&quot; (Carey, K. 2006) He bas&lt;s&gt;i&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;s his theory on the fact that our students are not a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; type of &lt;s&gt;learners&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;demographic??&lt;/font&gt;.


Test scores show a result of effective teaching

The New York Times released &lt;s&gt;the&lt;/s&gt; statistics &lt;s&gt;for&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;that showed big improvement in math for New York City's public schools. &lt;/font&gt; &lt;s&gt;the year in New York City's public schools and showed a big improvement in math.&lt;/s&gt; Mayor Michael Bloomberg &quot;trumpeted the results as evidence that mayoral control had produced revolutionary improvements and brought city students within spitting distance of state averages after years of mediocrity.&quot; (Hernandez, J. 2009)


Concluding thoughts

We all have our own preconceived notions about what makes effective teaching and what the federal government says that we should be doing to promote learning with high standards. However, do we have a right to throw out creativity in favor of higher test scores? Everyone learns differently and at different rates. Do we want to have a future society of robotic humans, who have been pushed throughout their school years to accelerate at the same speed &lt;s&gt;and course&lt;/s&gt; or do we want to have a future of &lt;s&gt;individualities&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/font&gt; that are in constant motion to learn new things and ways to accomplish them? That is the question of today and tomorrow.

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals are included but have minimal effect'''
&lt;li&gt;'''One interesting or new perspective is presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information'''
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.'''
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. There were good concluding thoughts.
&lt;li&gt;. I saw good information about current and impending federal education reform plans. 

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. There is a need for the learning targets to be adequately addressed.
&lt;li&gt;. I thought the content of the article was hard to read because of the number of run-on sentences. 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

'''THE LEARNING TARGETS SECTION AND SIDEBARS HAVE INCORRECT CODE. NEED TO LOOK THROUGH AND REPLACE THE CODES WITH APPROPRIATE ONES SO THE QUOTATION MARKS SHOW CORRECTLY.'''

&quot;What makes an effective teacher? Teachers and parents and administrators alike have been asking that question for many years and the truth of the matter '''''is is''''' '''ERASE AN IS''' that there is no one answer.&quot; ''''NO ONE ANSWER' SOUNDS A LITTLE AKWARD'''

 '''âWhat''' Makes a Teacher Effective?&quot; 

California State University at Northridgeâs article '''âTeachers'''  

 '''Thatâs''' a really good question! There are two thought provoking articles entitled '''âAre''' Teachers Born or '''Made?â''' in this chapter. 

'''studentâs''' scores  

 '''âis''' a model for teaching that emphasizes well-developed and carefully planned lessons designed around small learning increments and clearly defined and prescribed teaching task'''s.â''' '''CHECK QUOTATION MARKS'''

'''â'''powerful instructional approach that guides and motivates learners to explore information and concepts in order to construct new ideas, identify new relationships, and create new models of thinking and behavior'''â'''. '''CHECK QUOTATION MARKS'''

from the mid '''1980âs''' to the present.

'''classmateâs''' weaknesses and work together 

This theory can have a far-reaching effect on every '''studentâs''' learning achievement.

'''GRAMMAR IS FINE. IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE WIKI CODE JUST NEEDS REVISION SO THE QUOTATION MARKS AND APOSTROPHES WORK CORRECTLY. WOULD ALSO LOOK THROUGH REFERENCES TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE! :-)'''

Comment:

'''Well thought-out multiple choice questions. Might want to try listing the response options in alphabetical order. Also, question number four, might work better if the correct answer is not the longest choice to pick from.'''

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article '''4.5''' for importance because '''the information was based on research and provided an excellent overview of the questions chosen. It also included ideas relevant to future teachers, however some of the answers to the questions could have been expanded upon.''' 

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 4.25 on interest because the points are clearly made and elaborated on. Good use of examples within the answers to the questions. The sidebars were nice, and the colors were visually appealing. There were not very many different perspectives added to the answers and perhaps there could have been more images, because the image of the little kids was great!
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 5 for credibility because the APA formatting was correct, there were plenty of scholarly sites with quite a few extras, and almost all of the sources were recent. 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 4.75 on writing because the multiple-choice questions were well written, with only a few ideas for improvement. The learning targets were clearly stated and the goals were met. All of the cited information seemed to be introduced and elaborated on in the article. The article captures attention, but doesn’t hold it entirely and the article flowed well, with a few mechanical errors (just needs work on the code so the quotation marks and apostrophes appear correctly). The article could keep attention perhaps if it were a bit longer.
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold

&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.

&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures attention initially and periodically throughout''' 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;'''The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; '''Good job writing the questions and answers. The material was well written and answered the questions.'''
&lt;li&gt; '''The sidebars and the colors were a nice touch. I really enjoyed the picture of the students reading!'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; '''There were a couple of things that could be done to revise the multiple choice questions: the resource options put in alphabetical order and number four options edited so they were all close to the same length.'''
&lt;li&gt; '''It would not hurt if the answers to the questions were a bit longer and more in-depth. I liked the examples, maybe more of them would be beneficial?'''
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment: &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The learning targets are well written and easy to understand.  After reading the article, readers should easily identify information to verify target achievement. &lt;/font color&gt;

=== Grammar and Mechanics Review''' ===

*Please either paste the entire body of the article here or any sections that you feel need to be revised. 
*To do this:
**go back to the module page for the article
**select &quot;edit this page&quot;
**highlight all the text, hit control &quot;c&quot; (or &quot;copy&quot; from the edit menu)
**navigate back to your peer review page
**click edit this page and paste the text into this window (use control &quot;v&quot; or paste from the edit menu)
**You may want to have Wikibooks open in two windows/tabs to make this process easier.
*Type your comments in ALL CAPITALS or in &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; another color &lt;/font&gt; so the author can easily find them.

&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''The are several coding problems for apostrophes, quotation marks, and other punctuation. Also, check those side bars.  Please check your coding to correct these problems.''' 

Examples include:

...report entitled âWhat Makes a Teacher Effective?&quot; .http://www.ncate.org/public/teachereffective.asp?ch=48 (quotation marks)

Thatâs a really good question! (apostrophe)

&lt;/font color&gt;


Teachers and parents and administrators &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Teachers, parents, and administrators) &lt;/font color&gt; alike have been asking that question for many years and the truth of the matter is is&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (remove an 'is') &lt;/font color&gt;  that there is no one answer.

Direct Instruction&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (instruction) &lt;/font color&gt; âis a model for teaching that emphasizes well-developed and carefully planned lessons designed around small learning increments and clearly defined and prescribed teaching tasks.

Discovery Learning&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (learning) &lt;/font color&gt;, according to Rezak ...

Examples of this&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (replace with dicover learning) &lt;/font color&gt; include interactive and hands on experiences such as planting and growing seeds into plants.

To learn more about direct instruction and discovery learning, visit the following links&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (make links signular) &lt;/font color&gt;:

Differentiated Instruction&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (instruction) &lt;/font color&gt; is defined as recognizing that...

Cooperative Learning&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (learning) &lt;/font color&gt; is defined as ...

common goals.&quot; (Berk, 2008) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Don't forget..the period goes AFTER the citation) &lt;/font color&gt;

Each member of a group is held accountable &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (accountable) &lt;/font color&gt;for a portion of the assignment.

how well they worked with each other. (A Guide to Cooperative Learning). &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Check this citation, it needs a date.) &lt;/font color&gt;

Jigsaw, developed by Elliot Aronson, Professor Emeritus at the University of California in Santa Cruz&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (citation info?) &lt;/font color&gt;, places students into groups with various social and ethnic differences each with the same goal to succeed, and so the hostility becomes muted as the students are forced to work together to achieve success.



&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''References...'''
Please check your APA formating for your reference list.  Specifically, pay attention to article titles (use lowercase letters) and journal titles and volume numbers (in italics).   &lt;/font color&gt;






-----------------------

=== Sources ===

For each source listed in the &quot;References&quot; section of the article, name the type of source (scholarly or popular) and the perspective it provides (research, expert opinion from educator, popular news source, parent organization, personal contact, etc.)
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, academic organization. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, news source. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, news source. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, expert opinion. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, expert opinion. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, research. &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research. &lt;/font color&gt;

 
List the range of publication years for all sources, e.g. 1998-2006: &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 1968-2009 &lt;/font color&gt;

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt; and use at least 2 scholarly sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the citations in APA format? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No.  Problems were brought to the author's attention in the grammar and mechanics section. &lt;/font color&gt;
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No. Again, problems were brought to the author's attention in the grammar and mechanics section. &lt;/font color&gt;
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment:

&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Great variety of resources.  Please take some time and look over the APA guidelines for the formating fo citations and references.   &lt;/font color&gt;


-----------------------

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; knowledge &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 2 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; knowledge &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 3 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; application &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 4 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; application  &lt;/font color&gt;


Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Do the questions assess the learning target? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the foils (the response options that are NOT the answer) reasonable i.e. they are not very obviously incorrect answers?&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;   
#Are the response options listed in alphabetical order? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are correct answers provided and listed BELOW all the questions? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the multiple-choice questions. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve the question/s.


Comment:
&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The questions are well written and address the learning targets.  For each question, the answers could be place in alphabetical order. &lt;/font color&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 5 &lt;/font color&gt;for importance because &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;the article presents information relative to the topic that is applicable new teachers.  New teachers could use this research to assist them in honing their own teaching methods.&lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 4.5 &lt;/font color&gt; on interest because &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;the article layout, side bars, and photo make this an appealing read.  Getting the reader's attention is half the battle! Plus, I love the old-school B/W photo...makes me think of a one room schoolhouse! &lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 3 &lt;/font color&gt; for credibility because&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;though there were several excellent sources, citation and reference formatting needs work.&lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 4.5 &lt;/font color&gt; on writing because &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; the article was well-written and clearly organized which made it easy to understand. The questions clearly addressed the author's learning targets. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education)''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read'''
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;'''Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples'''.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;'''A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information'''
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.

&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.'''
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.'''
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures and maintains attention throughout'''
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;'''Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The article is visually appealing because of its layout and the addition of sidebars and a photo.  It is easy to match information with the learning targets, and provides clear, concise examples when needed.&lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Key terms are defined and supported with research, making them easier to understand.&lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;While there are several excellent resources, please take time to review APA formatting for citations and references.  &lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;I enjoy the layout of your article.  To make it more visually appealing, you could take the bold off of the text to make it a less &quot;aggressive&quot; read. &lt;/font color&gt;
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

* Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? '''Yes, I felt they were actual learning targets.''' 
* Is/are the learning target(s) specific? '''Yes, especially the first 2, the third was a little more broad.''' 
* Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) '''Not at all, I think they are quite appropriate. ''' 
* Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) '''Yes, but again I felt the 3rd one was too broad. What is realistic v/s unrealistic.'''
* Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? '''Yes, it was very informative.''' 
Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
'''Add some more details of what is unrealistic/realistic expectations of a student. '''

** You may want to have Wikibooks open in two windows/tabs to make this process easier.
* Type your comments in ALL CAPITALS or in &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; another color &lt;/font&gt; so the author can easily find them.


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Before a student steps into the classroom, a teacher has begun to formulate expectations of not only the individual student, but perhaps the entire class. Recent studies have shown that teachers have both high and low expectations for all students and there is a great possibility that these expectations are teacher centered (Rubie-Davies, 2006). According to Brophy's study (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006)) there is a +/-5% achievement difference per year based on student reaction to teacher expectations. Through out a student's academic career this would add up to a significant impact on overall achievement.

Factors that influence teacher expectations are often socio-economic, race, or gender biased. However, many also formulate expectations based on student achievement level. Weinstein ''et al.'' (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) used the ''Teacher Treatment Inventory'' to investigate student perceptions of the differential treatment of classmates considered to be high and low achievers. Based on response, students felt that teachers had a positive relationship and greater interaction with high achieving students compared to low achieving students. 

Contrary to Wienstein's research, Babad (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) has shown that teachers felt they show more compassion and emotional support for low achievers. Babad (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) discovered that students '''perceive''' (SPELLING ERROR) these interactions as being exaggerated and pretentious. It is perceptions like these that lead to the formation of unfair expectations. &lt;/font&gt;


-'''I think where the Rubie-Davies text is cited I would group the information more effectively in paragraphs so you won't need to keep writing the source. Maybe try to list it just once per paragraph'''

Comment:
'''As I stated above, I would consider removing sources older than 20 years. It seems there would be more information found elsewhere that you could use that would be more current. ''' 

'''In the article you have written &quot;as cited&quot; within the citations. I would remove that and just leave it as &quot;(Rubie-Davies, 2006)&quot;'''
'''I don't see all of the references used anywhere in the article. '''

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant information 
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.

&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented

&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt; ==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
* Hints: 
** Focus on the work, not the person
** &lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;'''I really liked the formatting you used in the article. It was eye catching. I especially like how it was used in the mulitple choice questions.''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''I liked the topic that you used, and the how you interviewed the child, the parents, and a teacher. The whole article was written in a educated manner. You could tell by reading it that you knew the subject matter well.'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Cite the references in the article.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Some spelling improvements needed. ''' 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? THE LEARNING TARGETS STATE WHAT THE READER SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR UNDERSTAND AFTER READING THE ARTICLE
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? THE FIRST LEARNING TARGET IS A LITTLE BROAD, BUT CAN BE ANSWERED EFFECTIVELY, THE SECOND AND  THIRD ARE SPECIFIC.
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) THE FIRST LEARNING TARGET IS A LITTLE EASY, HOWEVER, THE SECOND AND THIRD TARGETS ARE MORE DETAILED.
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) YES THE LEARNING TARGETS ARE OBSERVABLE THROUGH READING THE ARTICLE.
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? I FEEL AFTER READING THE ARTICLE I WAS ABLE TO ADEQUATELY ANSWER THE LEARNING TARGETS.

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:

I FELT THE LEARNING TARGETS WERE ADEQUATE AND I WAS ABLE TO ANSWER THE LEARNING TARGETS AFTER READING THE ARTICLE. I WOULD POSSIBLY CHANGE THE FIRST LEARNING TARGET FROM IDENTIFYING FACTORS TO IDENTIFYING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FACTORS, FOR EXAMPLE IDENTIFY THREE FACTORS. THIS GIVES THE READER THE DUTY TO LOOK THROUGH THE ARTICLE TO FIND A MORE SPECIFIC LEARNING TARGET.

PASTE TEXT HERE

Before a student steps into the classroom, a teacher has begun to formulate expectations of not only the individual student, but perhaps the entire class. PRIOR TO STUDENTS STEPPING INTO A CLASSROOM, TEACHERS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO FORMULATE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE STUDENTS.

Through out a student's academic career this would add up to a significant impact on overall achievement. THROUGHOUT

 However, many also formulate expectations based on student achievement level. HOWEVER, MANY TEACHERS ALSO FORMULATE EXPECTATIONS BASED ON STUDENTS ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS.

Babad (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) discovered that students perceive PERCEIVE these interactions as being exaggerated and pretentious. It is perceptions like these that lead to the formation of unfair expectations.  PERCEPTIONS SUCH AS THESE LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF UNFAIR EXPECTATIONS.

In the following interviews, we will learn how a fifth grade student with a learning disability perceives himself in his classroom and discusses his feelings on OF his teacher's expectations
towards TOWARD himself and 

Dysgraphia, a learning disability that affects how well students use written language and is characterized CHARACTERIZED by disabled handwriting, often accompanies dyslexia (IDA, 2008).

 Mrs. Crowder says I rush and forget to read directions closely, THEN Then I make careless mistakes.

 I think I passed, AND And you know I won honorable mention in the &quot;Letters for Literature&quot; contest this year.

Gloria R.: I do believe BELIEVE that there are teachers 

He bases these EXPECTATIONS on feedback 

I perceive PERCEIVE that extra push to be symbolic

&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education)''' 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
'''Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice'''
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed '''
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic'''
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;'''At least two perspectives were presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the information/ideas are new'''
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)'''
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures attention initially and periodically throughout''' 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;'''The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. THE INTERVIEWS THAT WERE CONDUCTED WERE DONE IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY AND KEPT THE READER INTERESTED INTHE ARTICLE.
&lt;li&gt;. THERE WERE A VARIETY OF SOURCES THAT WERE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE ARTICLE.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.  SOME OF THE ARTICLES WERE OLDER AND PERHAPS SOMEWHAT OUT OF DATE.
&lt;li&gt;.  ONE OF THE LEARNING TOPICS WAS A BIT BROAD AND WITH WORD CHANGING COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

=== Grammar and Mechanics Review''' ===

*Please either paste the entire body of the article here or any sections that you feel need to be revised. 
*To do this:
**go back to the module page for the article
**select &quot;edit this page&quot;
**highlight all the text, hit control &quot;c&quot; (or &quot;copy&quot; from the edit menu)
**navigate back to your peer review page
**click edit this page and paste the text into this window (use control &quot;v&quot; or paste from the edit menu)
**You may want to have Wikibooks open in two windows/tabs to make this process easier.
*Type your comments in ALL CAPITALS or in &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; another color &lt;/font&gt; so the author can easily find them.

PASTE TEXT HERE
Unlike the Interventionist style, minimal &lt;u&gt;authoriry&lt;/u&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I think this was a misspelled word, if it is not then you may want to pick a different word that may be more common. &lt;/font&gt;is administered, providing the student more control of their environment and behavior.

This model may prove beneficial to children who have an established &lt;u&gt;locus&lt;/u&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I thought that this word seemed awkward and possible using another word to relay the meaning may work better. &lt;/font&gt; of control, and can be trusted to self-regulate. It affords them freedom, and is most rewarding.

&lt;u&gt;As observed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I think that if you used a different introduction phrase it may work better.  If you want to use observed, possibly reference where was it observed, like as observed in the works by Dr. Mitchem, etc. &lt;/font&gt;, positive outcomes in classroom management require a combined effort from both the instructor and student.

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education)''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read'''

&lt;li&gt;'''Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.'''
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals '''
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures and maintains attention throughout'''
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. This article is very well written and researched.  
&lt;li&gt;. There was great use of the sidebars and font to grab the readers attention.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I think including some links to web sites that would show examples of the classroom management would add to your article.
&lt;li&gt;. I see that there are no pictures, maybe adding one in also may enhance the article.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? YES
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? YES
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) YES
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) YES
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? YES

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:

I FEEL THE LEARNING TARGETS ARE APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE.  I WOULD POSSIBLY CHANGE THE IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS TO IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS.  THIS WILL MAKE THE STUDENTS HAVE TO READ THROUGH THE ARTICLE THOROUGHLY TO FIND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS.  I PARTICULARY THINK THE FIRST LEARNING TARGET IS VERY THOROUGH AND  WILL ALLOW THE STUDENTS TO PROCESS THE MAIN INFORMATION IN THE ARTICLE.

PASTE TEXT HERE

Therefore, proper methods must be in place to keep STUDENTS IN classrooms controlled, engaged

As a result, these instructors assume full control of the students' environmentS by setting strict rules and following through with consequences if inappropriate behavior occurs. 

This model may prove beneficial for children with behavioral problems who MAY require routine, clarity, and clear expectations to perform well.

They believe students' behaviorS ARE a direct reflection of internal processes that need to be expressed.

Unlike the Interventionist style, minimal authoriTy is administered

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;'''Based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed''' 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;'''At least two perspectives were presented'''
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;'''Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Some good points are made and explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.'''
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals '''
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures and maintains attention throughout'''
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;'''Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.'''
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;li&gt;. THE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS REQUIRE THE READER TO KNOW THE INFORMATION AND APPLY IT.
&lt;li&gt;. THE ARTICLE WAS WELL WRITTEN AND CATCHES THE READERS ATTENTION WITH BOLD COLORS AND SIDEBARS.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. POSSIBLY INCORPORATE SOME NEWER MORE RECENT SOURCES.
&lt;li&gt;. LOOK OVER THE ARTICLE TO FIND ONLY A FEW GRAMMATICAL ERRORS.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? Yes
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? Yes
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) Yes
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) No
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? Yes

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
The first one is to identify which can be observed. However, the 2nd and 3rd are to recognize and understand, which I think are a little vague and need to say something more specific. (i.e. something more external than understanding; understanding seems like it would be hard to observe. HOW do you measure understanding?)

'''Introduction'''

----
The news constantly informs us of current events that happen instantly. Since the introduction of the World Wide Web and cell phones, people have instant access to news every second. We rely heavily on news presentations or articles to be accurate and reliable as possible. However, sometimes news stations or sites have bias embedded within themselves. We as readers/listeners need to recognize bias and learn how to discard of it. Overall news that is delivered is helpful, insightful, and most of the time justified. It is what most of us wake up to in the morning and how we learn of life changing events. Everyday we are related to news, either by telling it, posting it, or reading it. Fortunately for educators we have access to other teachers (TEACHERS' TO INDICATE POSSESSION) postings, comments, or suggestions that enable us to become better at our profession. One of the greatest assets that we must possess is to have our classrooms in order. Today's technology allows us to manage our classroom easier while the suggestions of other educators enables us to have control. I was once told that if you don't have control over your classroom then you don't have a chance as an educator.


'''Disciplinary Deficit'''

----
Recently an excelling high school senior stated that classroom management needed to be improved in his school. This statement received high reguard from a retired high school teacher who was shocked at the boys opinion. He pondered the thought of why classroom management was not getting enough attention. He came up with several reasons ranging from parental discipline to No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Here are some statements he made concerning his reasons, &quot;The partnerships that used to exist between teachers and parents are fast becoming a fading memory.&quot; &quot;Ironically, when school discipline is weakened to accommodate state and federal No Child Left Behind goals, students ultimately pay a great price for our acquiescence.&quot; (Udel, 2009). (WHEN YOU USE QUOTATIONS, I BELIEVE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO INDICATE PAGE NUMBERS, ETC IF POSSIBLE. YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK THE APA FORMAT?) These are two powerful statements that are total opposite of each other. One concerns parents while the other concerns state/federal guidelines. He also touched on the fact that elminating consequences is a problem for classroom management as well. If there aren't any consequences then why not break the rules? Even though he sounded dishearted about the situation he still felt as though many educators are working hard to eliminate classroom disruptions and that not all classes have these problems. (Udel, 2009)


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF0080;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;There are impressive accomplishments taking place in our schools and there are many devoted and creative teachers, staff and students working together to make them happen. Certainly not all classes are marred by interruptions. However, we should have the wisdom to listen to our students when they tell us that there is a problem and the courage to act in their support.&quot;

'''Edward Udel'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''War &amp; Court'''

----
&lt;font color=&quot;#&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Some educators may describe their classroom management practices as stern and compare them to other classrooms but I discovered two educators who had completely different terms. (&lt;---MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE TWO SENTECES?)The first educator explained that she conducted court sessions in her classroom. One day every other week different students, who act as lawyers,defendants, and jury members, go to court. These court sessions were designed to have students monitor their own behaviors. It mocked the &quot;three strikes your (YOU'RE) out&quot; policy(COMMA) whereas the third appearance in court lost your role. The teacher stated the following, &quot;With roles, came the expectation of being above disruptive behavior.&quot; (Artiles, 2009) (MAY WANT TO CHECK APA FORMAT FOR QUOTATION?) The second educator compared his class to war. His chief  (CHIEF) belief was that you must have your students on your side. He said that if you have 28 out of 30 students under control then you will not have discipline troubles.(Genghis, 2004) He also suggested having students fill out questionares (SPELLING?) at the beginning of school so you can get to know them. He said you can use this to your advantage in many different ways. These are two very different ways of implementing classroom control, but seem to work well for the teacher. 
&lt;/font&gt;

CANI: Constant And Never-ending Improvement 

(Genghis, 2004)
 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''Technology'''

----
Technology allows us to access more information from farther distances around the world. In most of today's (MAYBE USE THE WORD MODERN INSTEAD?) classrooms you will find computers, smartboards, and other electronic devices that aid in different types of learning. Recently a community college in Oklahoma integrated Moodle(an online classroom management system, like blackboard) into the classroom. The Learning Resource Center director, Katherine Combs, stated &quot;This system keeps students and instructors connected, so that if a student struggling with the material and the instructor is unavailable, he or she can connect with other students and/or additional resources from home.&quot; (Harper, 2009) LanSchool is a classroom management software provider that allows teachers to randomly select a student and start classes in seconds, not minutes. (Business Wire, 2009) The educator that mentioned war earlier in the article said that technology such as a camcorder, thermostat, and bull horn work effienctly to get your classroom under control. (Genghis, 2004)This just (SP?) proves that there are '''many''' things that you can use in your classroom that would aid in management and control.

Comment:

I LIKE THE NEWS SOURCES THAT YOU USED. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT THE FIRST FOUR ARE POPULAR NEWS SITES AND I AM NOT SURE ABOUT #5. YOU MAY NEED TO FIND ANOTHER SCHOLARLY SOURCE. YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK YOUR APA FORMAT FOR THE IN-TEXT QUOTATIONS AND THE REFERENCE PAGE.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know'''
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;'''Highly relevant to current educational practice''' (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;'''Mostly based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view'''&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read'''&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed''' &lt;li&gt;'''Mostly new information/ideas''' &lt;li&gt;'''Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.'''&lt;li&gt;'''Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.'''&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or '''only 1 scholarly source was used''' 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures and maintains attention throughout'''
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated;''' the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt; I THOUGHT THAT YOUR ARTICLE WAS VERY NICE AND FLOWED VERY WELL
&lt;li&gt;. I ESPECIALLY LIKED YOUR QUOTATIONS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FROM THE TEXT
&lt;li&gt;. YOUR MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS WERE WELL-WRITTEN!

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK APA FORMAT FOR IN-TEXT CITATIONS, QUOTATIONS AND REFERENCE PAGE AND POSSIBLY ADD ANOTHER SCHOLARLY SOURCE. I APPOLOGIZE IF I HAVE INCORRECTLY CATEGORIZED ONE OF YOUR SOURCES, IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO TELL.
&lt;li&gt;. RE-CHECK THE LEARNING TARGETS TO MAKE THEM OBSERVABLE
&lt;li&gt;. GENERAL PROOFREADING. 

OVERALL, I THOUGHT THAT YOUR ARTICLE WAS VERY INTERESTING AND WELL-WRITTEN! 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

Introduction

The news constantly informs us of current events that happen instantly. Since the introduction of the World Wide Web and cell phones, people have instant access to news every second. We rely heavily on news presentations or articles to be accurate and reliable as possible. However, sometimes news stations or sites have bias embedded within themselves. We&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; as readers/listeners&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; need to recognize bias and learn how to discard of it. Overall&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; news that is delivered is helpful, insightful, and most of the time justified. It is what most of us wake up to in the morning and how we learn of life changing events. Everyday&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; we are related to news, either by telling it, posting it, or reading it. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Fortunately, &lt;/font&gt; for educators&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; we have access to other teachers&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt; postings, comments, &lt;s&gt;or&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;and&lt;/font&gt; suggestions that enable us to become better at our profession. One of the greatest assets that we must possess is to have our classrooms in order. Today's technology allows us to manage our classroom&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;s&lt;/font&gt; easier while the suggestions of other educators enable&lt;s&gt;s&lt;/s&gt; us to have control. I was once told that if you &lt;s&gt;don't&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;do not &lt;/font&gt; have control over your classroom then you &lt;s&gt;don't&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;do not&lt;/font&gt; have a chance as an educator.


Disciplinary Deficit

Recently&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; an excelling high school senior stated that classroom management needed to be improved in his school. This statement received high reg&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;ard from a retired high school teacher who was shocked at the boy&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;s opinion. He pondered the thought of why classroom management was not getting enough attention. He came up with several reasons ranging from parental dis&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;c&lt;/font&gt;ipline to No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Here are some statements he made concerning his reasons, &quot;The partnerships that used to exist between teachers and parents are fast becoming a fading memory.&quot; &quot;Ironically, when school discipline is weakened to accommodate state and federal No Child Left Behind goals, students ultimately pay a great price for our acquiescence.&quot; (Udel, 2009). These are two powerful statements that are total&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;ly&lt;/font&gt; opposite of each other. One concerns parents while the other concerns state/federal guidelines. He also touched on the fact that el&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;i&lt;/font&gt;minating consequences is a problem for classroom management as well. If &lt;s&gt;their&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;there&lt;/font&gt; &lt;s&gt;aren't&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;are not&lt;/font&gt; any consequences then why not break the rules? Even though he sounded disheartened about the situation&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; he still felt as though many educators are working hard to eliminate classroom disruptions and that not all classes have these problems. (Udel, 2009)


&quot;There are impressive accomplishments taking place in our schools and there are many devoted and creative teachers, staff and students working together to make them happen. Certainly not all classes are marred by interruptions. However, we should have the wisdom to listen to our students when they tell us that there is a problem and the courage to act in their support.&quot;

Edward Udel

War &amp; Court

Some educators may describe their classroom management practices as stern and compare them to other classrooms&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;. &lt;s&gt;but&lt;/s&gt; However, &lt;/font&gt;I discovered two educators who had completely different terms. The first educator explained that she conducted court sessions in her classroom. One day every other week different students, who act as lawyers,defendants, and jury members, go to court. These court sessions were designed to have students monitor their own behaviors. It mocked the &quot;three strikes your out&quot; policy whereas the third appearance in court &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;resulted in losing &lt;/font&gt; &lt;s&gt;lost&lt;/s&gt; your role. The teacher stated the following, &quot;With roles, came the expectation of being above disruptive behavior.&quot; (Artiles, 2009) The second educator compared his class to war. His chief belief was that you must have your students on your side. He said that if you have 28 out of 30 students under control then you will not have discipline troubles.(Genghis, 2004) He also suggested having students fill out &lt;s&gt;questionares&lt;/s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;questionnaires&lt;/font&gt;at the beginning of school so you can get to know them. He said you can use this to your advantage in many different ways. These are two very different ways of implementing classroom control, but &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;both &lt;/font&gt;seem to work well for the teacher.


Teaching is a great job if you can do two things: 1) Teach the students to be kind and polite. 2) Manage the paperwork.

Technology

Technology allows us to access more information from farther distances around the world. In most of today&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;s classrooms&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; you will find computers, smartboards, and other electronic devices that aid in different types of learning. Recently&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; a community college in Oklahoma integrated Moodle(an online classroom management system, like blackboard) into the classroom. The Learning Resource Center director, Katherine Combs, stated &quot;This system keeps students and instructors connected, so that if a student&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;is&lt;/font&gt; struggling with the material and the instructor is unavailable, he or she can connect with other students and/or additional resources from home.&quot; (Harper, 2009) LanSchool is a classroom management software provider that allows teachers to randomly select a student and start classes in seconds, not minutes. (Business Wire, 2009) The educator that mentioned war earlier in the article said that technology such as a camcorder, thermostat, and bull horn work &lt;s&gt;effienctly&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;efficiently&lt;/font&gt; to get your classroom under control. (Genghis, 2004)This &lt;s&gt;just&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;just&lt;/font&gt; proves that there are many things that you can use in your classroom that would aid in management and control.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals are included but have minimal effect'''
&lt;li&gt;'''One interesting or new perspective is presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information'''
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.'''
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. Article was a interesting read.
&lt;li&gt;. Article provided good technology ideas to aid in classroom management.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. There is a need to spell check and grammar check article prior to submission.
&lt;li&gt;. I see a need for scholarly sources to provide more creditability.  
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

PASTE TEXT HERE
A: &quot;Positive discipline(or PD) is a discipline system used by schools that focuses on the positive points of behaviour...SPELLING BEHAVIOR.

Asking for students' input, using encouraging body language, ignoring actions that are undesirable, using consistency, encouraging children to redirect negative behaviors to positive behaviors, and making positive comments are all additional ways in which positive discipline can be implemented in the classroom (Doescher and Burt, 1995).
...POSSIBLY USING A QUOTE IF NOT PARAPHRASED.

Extrinsically motivated behavior is defined as engaging in an activity to obtain an outcome that is separable from the activity itself&quot; (deCharms, 1968; Lepper &amp; Greene, 1978). ...CAPITALIZING THE D IN DECHARMS.

&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Based on researched information&lt;/big&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation.&lt;/big&gt; Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Visuals add to the article&lt;/big&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions&lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout&lt;/big&gt;&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors&lt;/big&gt;. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;.GREAT OVERALL WORK.  IT WAS GREAT READING THE INFORMATION PRESENTED.  
&lt;li&gt;.  USED A GREAT WIDE RANGE OF INFORMATION AND CITED APPROPRITAELY.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. THERE WERE JUST A FEW CITATIONS TO LOOK AT AND MAKE SURE A QUOTATION IS NOT NEEDED.
&lt;li&gt;. POSSIBLY USING SIDEBARS THAT WOULD ADD MORE.  THE VISUALS WERE GREAT AND ADDED TO THE PAGE.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''''THERE WERE NOT VERY MANY GRAMMATICAL/MECHANICAL ERRORS! HERE ARE A FEW I FOUND:'''''


The first answer: &quot;A: &quot;Positive discipline(or PD)&quot;  '''NEED A SPACE AFTER DISCIPLINE'''

in the sidebar: &quot;One professor at Old Dominion University, Katharine Kersey, created 101 principles of positive discipline to use in the classroom, at home, wherever.&quot; '''MIGHT NEED TO REPHRASE SO IT'S A COMPLETE STATEMENT ... IN THE CLASSROOM, AT HOME, OR WHEREVER ...'''

&quot;A: Proponents of intrinsic motivation argue that internally motivating factors that motivate an individual can be considered an effective tool for learning.&quot; '''THIS SENTENCE IS AKWARD. I READ IT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE UNDERSTANDING IT FULLY ... I THINK IT IS BECAUSE MOTIVATE IS USED SO MANY TIMES IN SUCH A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK IT JUST NEEDS TO BE REWORDED.'''

Comment:

'''Good multiple choice questions! My only comments would be to try putting your choices in alphabetical order and to put the correct answers after references so students can't &quot;cheat&quot; while trying to answer the questions on their own.'''

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article '''4.5''' for importance because '''it covered the key ideas crucial for future teachers to know and provided an excellent overview of the topic. The questions were all answered appropriately and it is applicable to today’s schools. However, there are some older sources that may not reflect current practice.'''



&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article '''4.5''' on interest because '''the multiple perspectives were portrayed and discussed well. There were mostly new information and ideas and the points were clearly made with examples. The sidebar was good, however I would have liked to see more relevant sidebars throughout the article. The visual aids added to the article and the images were a nice touch, more of this would have been nice to see as well as longer, more in-depth answers to some of the questions.'''
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article '''5''' for credibility because '''your article was quite credible. The required sources were properly sited and in APA format, the information was from diverse sources with a wide range of scholarly sources to choose from, and your identified the different opinions and ideas within each answer to the questions.'''


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article '''4.5''' on writing because '''the multiple-choice questions were well written and thought-out. The learning targets were met and all of the cited information was introduced in the article. The article captured my attention, but did not quite keep it through the whole article. Some of the questions had rather short and to the point answers, I felt they needed more. Expanding upon the answers would make them more understandable.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold

&lt;li&gt;'''Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals''' 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures attention initially and periodically throughout''' 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''The article was well researched and well written. There were many scholarly sources to back up the answers to the questions.'''
&lt;li&gt;. '''The sidebar and images were nice and helped keep the page interesting. The multiple choice questions were also well written and well thought-out.'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. '''Some of the answers to the questions were a bit short, after reading the answers I was seeking more information. Perhaps a more in-depth answer, or more sidebars to websites were I can find more information would be beneficial.'''
&lt;li&gt;. '''Some of the sources were a little dated. It would be nice to see a newer source that agreed or credited the older sources.'''  
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

Introduction
As teachers, we all have an educational philosophy in our mind pertaining to the classroom. How the environment will feel and what it will look like. Classroom management which is managing both student behavior and the physical learning environment is an important issue. This is a main concern for all teachers. As teachers, we need to make sure that lessons run smoothly despite disruptive behavior by students.
REVISE... AS TEACHERS, WE ALL HAVE EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHIES IN OUR MINDS PERTAINING TO OUR CLASSROOMS.  HOW WILL THE ENVIRONMENT FEEL?  WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE?  CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT MEANS MANAGING BOTH STUDENT BEHAVIOR AND THE PHYSICAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT.  IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IS A CONCERN FOR ALL TEACHERS.  WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT LESSONS RUN SMOOTHLY, DISPITE DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR BY STUDENTS.  
Areas of Classroom Managemant
According to Karen Zauber, from the National Education Association, teachers need to consider four areas of classroom management:
1.	Establishing classroom climate - the look and feel of your room 
2.	Conducting class efficiently - managing time and students 
3.	Reaching all students - delivery, encouragement, teaching techniques 
4.	Establishing discipline - creating an atmosphere of consistency and mutual respect. 
(Management Tips for New Teachers)
Research has shown that (NEEDS QUOTATIONS) “teachers' actions in their classrooms have twice the impact on student achievement as do school policies regarding curriculum, assessment, staff collegiality, and community involvement(ELIMINATE PERIOD). (Marzano, 2003a).” (USE PERIOD AND END QUOTATION ON THIS SIDE OF PARENTHESIS) One of the A teacher's most important jobs is managing the classroom effectively. Students cannot learn in a chaotic, poorly managed classroom.
Teachers can establish clear expectations for behavior in two ways: by establishing clear rules and procedures, and by providing consequences for student behavior. Reinforcing acceptable behavior, (USE COMMA) while providing consequences for unacceptable behavior.  (STILL NOT A COMPLETE SENTENCE.  SHOULD NOT START WITH VERB.)
Sample Rules
Be kind to others
Raise hand to talk
Work quietly
Also, TEACHERS SHOULD establish rules for basic situations to keep order in THEIR classroomS. Examples: HOW TO passing papers, going to bathroom PROTOCOL, sharpening pencils, and safety routines.
Disruptive Students
Being a new teacher with a class of 20 students can be overwhelming. But, usuallyHOWEVER, just a small number of students will USUALLY disrupt class. This is a difficult situation for teachers and more so for other students. Time spent on inappropriate behavior takes time away from teaching and causes distractions.(ELIMINATE PERIOD HERE) (Teaching and Learning: Disruptive Students). (PERIOD STAYS HERE.  IF THIS IS INFORMATION FROM A SOURCE, WHERE ARE THE QUOTATIONS, YEAR, AND AUTHOR?)
There are 3 key ideas in handling disruptive students: (ACCORDING TO WHO?)
•	Know your students 
•	Use the schools resources (RESOURCES COULD BE LISTED HERE) 
•	Use practical application in discipline (WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?  WHERE DID YOU FIND A PRACTICAL DEFINITION?)
(How to deal with disruptive students) REPHRASE.  HOW TO HANDLE DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS.  
Knowing your studentS and being able to relate to them is very important. Their background, family life, interests, hobbies, talents, COMMA etc. will help with IN the communication process. Parental involvement is also important. Talking with the guidance counselors, and previous teachers can also help ONE UNDERSTAND THEIR students and MAY shed some light on their  PROBLEMATIC behavior. Using these resources can help you to better understand how to handle a disruptive student. Finally, apply practical discipline. Find something &quot;important&quot; for the student to do and take the focus off of  THE inappropriate behavior.
Example: If a student is running down the hall instead of staying in line with OTHER classmates walking to lunch, give him/her a job as the &quot;leader.&quot;
Praise the child in front of classmates.
Scoop From Someone Who Knows
Beth Close has been a Kindergarten teacher for 12 years. (WHERE?) I asked her the following questions. What is the hardest part about managing your classroom? She said, &quot;Meeting the individual needs of each student at the same time. Every child is different, and THEY learns in different ways.&quot; How do you handle disruptive students? She said there was IS a variety of strategies she has used over the years. One that has worked well for her is using a piggy bank with pennies as a reward system. The student receives a penny each day for good behavior. At the end of the week, (COMMA) they get to buy something out of the treasure chest. This gives students an incentive to have good behavior. She said, &quot;Students with inappropriate behavior first receive a warning, THEN A time out, THEN A note senT home, THEN A phone call home, and finally THEY ARE removed from the class.&quot; She also useS the old fashioned name on the board routine, and a color system...red light/green light. I also asked her, (INSERT COMMA) What would DO you do WHEN a student refuses to do what you ask? Beth said this automatically calleS for A 5 MINUTE time out. for 5 minutes. She said there was SHE HAS no tolerance for this kind of behavior. The last question I tossed at her  ASKED was concerning how students treat each other. What would DO you do if WHEN students were being ARE disrespectful to each other? This situation callS for the A child to be removed from the classroom and to sit alone for a few minutes. Beth saYS that consistency IS THE key, (INSERT COMMA) as well as THE same punishment and reward for each student.  (NEED TO WATCH TENSES... IS VERSUS ARE AND WAS, HAVE VERSUS HAS.)
It is refreshing to get the scoop from someone already out in the field, (COMMA) living the experience everyday. We imagine what the classroom setting will be like, but will not really know until we are there ourselves. The information provided is meaningful in thatBECAUASE she already knows what works and what does not. It was nice to see that all of her answers were ARE parallel to what the research says.(WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY?) Being consistent and fair and it was interesting to hear about all the different ways to promote good classroom discipline. REPHRASE...NOT A PROPER SENTENCE.
Conclusion
It seems that the phrase &quot;expect the unexpected&quot; really applies in managing a classroom. As teachers, we need to be flexible in responding to the unexpected. We also need to be consistent in the application of discipline, not raise our voiceS and try to remain calm and rational. WE NEED TO Be fair to all students. The combination of establishing clear expectations for rules and procedures, and providing consequences with incentives or by punishment and learning the best ways to handle disruptive behaviors are the important issues in managing an effective classroom. (RUNON, REPHRASE) We need to evaluate each circumstance and THEN ensure that punishment fits the crime.  DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN PUNISHMENT?  WHAT DOES RESEARCH SAY ABOUT PUNISHMENT’S EFFECTIVENESS?

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
'''About half of the information is the author’s opinion.'''
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
'''Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues''''''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.

&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained

&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.

&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation'''.
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.''''''&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;.  THE ORIGINAL TOPIC IS SIGNIFICANT AND THE LEARNING TARGETS ARE ON POINT.
&lt;li&gt;. THE ORGANIZATION IS GOOD.  THE SUPTOPICS COVERED ARE NOT TOO BROAD.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;. REVISE WORDING, MECHANICS, AND GRAMMER.  
&lt;li&gt;.BE MORE SPECIFIC AND PROVIDE BETTER SOURCES.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;

As teachers, we all have an educational philosophy in our mind pertaining to the classroom.  How the environment will feel and what it will look like.  Classroom management which is managing both student behavior and the physical learning environment is an important issue. This is a main concern for all teachers. As teachers, we need to make sure that lessons run smoothly despite disruptive behavior by students. THIS IS A GREAT INTRO, IT REALLY GRABS YOUR ATTENTION AND LETS YOU KNOW RIGHT OFF THE BACK WHAT EXACTLY YOU WILL BE TALKING ABOUT. IT COULD ALSO BE REVISED A LITTLE BIT SO THAT IT FLOWS A LITTLE BETTER. YOU POSE TWO QUESTIONS WHEN ASKING HOW THE ENVIRONMENT WILL FEEL LIKE BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY POSE THEM AS QUESTIONS BUT AS STATEMENTS. 

&lt;big&gt;'''Areas of Classroom Managemant'''&lt;/big&gt;
 
According to Karen Zauber, from the National Education Association, teachers need to consider four areas of classroom management:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing classroom climate - the look and feel of your room &lt;li&gt;Conducting class efficiently - managing time and students &lt;li&gt;Reaching all students - delivery, encouragement, teaching techniques &lt;li&gt;Establishing discipline - creating an atmosphere of consistency and mutual respect.&lt;/ol&gt;(Management Tips for New Teachers)

Research has shown that teachers' actions in their classrooms have twice the impact on student achievement as do school policies regarding curriculum, assessment, staff collegiality, and community involvement.(Marzano, 2003a). THE PERIOD SHOULD FOLLOW THE CITATION.  One of the teacher's most important jobs is managing the classroom effectively.  Students cannot learn in a chaotic, poorly managed classroom. GOOD POINT. 

Teachers can establish clear expectations for behavior in two ways:  by establishing clear rules and procedures, and by providing consequences for student behavior.  Reinforcing acceptable behavior while providing consequences for unacceptable behavior. I MIGHT ADD SOMETHING &quot;LIKE IN SHORT&quot; OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sample Rules&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Be kind to others&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Raise hand to talk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Work quietly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Also, establish rules for basic situations to keep order in classroom.  Examples:  passing papers, going to bathroom, sharpening pencils, and safety routines. SOME EXAMPLES WOULD BE...... INSTEAD OF JUST EXAMPLES: PASSING PAPERS.........

&lt;big&gt;'''Disruptive Students'''&lt;/big&gt;

Being a new teacher with a class of 20 students can be overwhelming.  But, usually just a small number of students will disrupt class.  This is a difficult situation for teachers and more so for other students.  Time spent on inappropriate behavior takes time away from teaching and causes distractions. (Teaching and Learning: Disruptive Students).

There are 3 key ideas in handling disruptive students: 

* Know your students
* Use the schools resources
* Use practical application in discipline
(How to deal with disruptive students) WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

Knowing your studentS and being able to relate to them is very important.  Their background, family life, interests, hobbies, talents etc. will help with the communication process.  Parental involvement is also important.  Talking with the guidance counselors, and previous teachers can also help in knowing your students and might shed some light on their behavior.  Using these resources can help you to better understand how to handle a disruptive student.  Finally, apply practical discipline.  Find something &quot;important&quot; for the student to do and take the focus off of inappropriate behavior.

border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Example:  If a student is running down the hall instead of staying in line with classmates walking to lunch, give him/her a job as the &quot;leader.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Praise the child in front of classmates. THIS STATEMENT COULD BE ADDED TO THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH. IT'S CURRENT PLACEMENT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S OUT OF PLACE.

&lt;big&gt;'''Scoop From Someone Who Knows'''&lt;/big&gt;

Beth Close has been a Kindergarten teacher for 12 years.  I asked her the following questions.
''What is the hardest part about managing your classroom?''  She said, &quot;Meeting the individual needs of each student at the same time.  Every child is different, and learns in different ways.&quot;  ''How do you handle disruptive students?''  She said there was a variety of strategies she has used over the years.  One that has worked well for her is using a piggy bank with pennies as a reward system.  The student receives a penny each day for good behavior.  At the end of the week they get to buy something out of the treasure chest.  This gives students an incentive to have good behavior.  She said, &quot;Students with inappropriate behavior first receive a warning, time out, note send home, phone call home, and finally removed from the class.&quot;  She has also used the old fashioned name on the board routine, and a color system...red light/green light. I also asked her ''What would you do if a student refuses to do what you ask?'' Beth said this automatically called for time out for 5 minutes.  She said there was no tolerance for this kind of behavior.  The last question I tossed at her was concerning how students treat each other.  ''What would you do if students were being disrespectful to each other?''  This situation called for the child to be removed from the classroom and to sit alone for a few minutes.  Beth said that consistency was key as well as same punishment and reward for each student.

It is refreshing to get the scoop from someone already out in the field living the experience everyday.  We imagine what the classroom setting will be like, but will not really know until we are there ourselves.  The information provided is meaningful in that she already knows what works and what does not.  It was nice to see that all of her answers were parallel to what the research says.  Being consistent and fair and it was interesting to hear about all the different ways to promote good classroom discipline.        

&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;

It seems that the phrase &quot;expect the unexpected&quot; really applies in managing a classroom.  As teachers, we need to be flexible in responding to the unexpected.  We also need to be consistent in the application of discipline, not raise our voice and try to remain calm and rational.  Be fair to all students.  The combination of establishing clear expectations for rules and procedures, and providing consequences with incentives or by punishment and learning the best ways to handle disruptive behaviors are the important issues in managing an effective classroom.  We need to evaluate each circumstance and ensure that the punishment fits the crime.

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I thought that your article was put together very well. 
&lt;li&gt;. It also consisted of very good points, and your use of situations made the article very interesting.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. There were a couple times when you could have combined sentences but you made them two separate sentences. 
&lt;li&gt;. Your sources could have been different
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

Ethics and law in the public school domain often carries a negative view in todayâs media. The news, in &lt;u&gt;current&lt;/u&gt; (RECENT) years, focuses more on the denial of(STUDENTS) rights &lt;u&gt;to students&lt;/u&gt;(CONSIDER MOVING) than any other legal issue that public schools face. Increasing violence in contemporary schools is a serious problem, but one that the media often only covers after an incident has occurred.

Other significant issues in the current media include: a teacherâs code of ethics, &lt;u&gt;where is the line drawn on the extent of a teacher-student relationship&lt;/u&gt; (I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY HERE MAYBE CONSIDER USING ( ) OR REDUCING TO TEACHER-STUDENT RELATIONSHIP), and censorship versus free speech, the denial of first amendment rights.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints:
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.Your passion for each of the articles was clear. 
&lt;li&gt;.You had a good variety of topics that gave nice balance to your article.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.I felt there were too many personal or biased comments throughout
&lt;li&gt;.I found the dark blue color used in the side bars made it difficult to read them, maybe try a lighter color something easier on the eyes.

&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;'''Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.'''&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? Yes
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? Yes
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) Yes
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) Yes. Well– if you asked them a question pertaining to the information they should've learned.
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? Yes

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment: This is a FAQ, so learning targets are rather limited I'd imagine. But I have the tendency to want to read a learning target along the lines of &quot;Reader should review and better grasp the concepts associated with technology and some of the more frequent dilemmas, questions that arise blah blah blah..&quot; Poor example, but eh.

&lt;big&gt;'''What is Technology Integration?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Technology Integration is allowing students to use technology and computer skills in meaningful ways to enhance education.  Integrating technology into the classroom improves not only the learning process, but the outcomes as well. These classrooms use a more student-centered approach and are much more engaged in classroom activities. They are not being âtaughtâ&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: taught)&lt;/font&gt; technology, it has been integrated in such a way, that it is transparent. (&quot;Technology Integration&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)

Shaffner (2002) defines technology integration as &quot;the use of technology resources -- computers, digital cameras, CD-ROMs, software applications, the Internet, etc. -- in daily classroom practices, and in the management of a school.&quot; 



&lt;big&gt;'''What kind of skills does technology integration build?&lt;/big&gt;

Technology integration in the classroom helps build many 21st Century Skills. These skills include personal and social responsibility, planning, reasoning, critical thinking, communication skills, cross-cultural understanding, decision-making, and knowledge of when and how to use technology appropriately. (Shaffner, 2002)


&lt;big&gt;'''What are the teacher standards for intregration &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: integration)&lt;/font&gt;technology into classrooms?'''&lt;/big&gt;

The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has issued five standards that teachers should uphold to successfully integrate technology into classrooms.
These include: &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(Edit: Separate and bold these out like bullets. It looks like you intended to anyway.)&lt;/font&gt;
1. Facilitate and Inspire Student Learning and Creativitiy&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: Creativity)&lt;/font&gt;
2. Design and Develop Digital-Age Learning Experiences and Assessments
3. Model Digital-Age Work and Learning
4. Promote and Model Digital Citizenship and Responsibility
5. Engage In Professional Growth and leadership

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; font size=2&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''What is project-based learning?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Wikipedia defines &quot;project-based learning&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: I would just bold this and drop the quotations or use parentheticals)&lt;/font&gt; as &quot;the use of classroom projects, intended to bring about deep learning, where students use technology and inquiry to engage with issues and questions that are relevant to their lives. These classroom projects are used to assess student's subject matter competence compared to traditional testing.&quot; (&quot;Project Based Learning&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)


&lt;big&gt;'''What is Web 2.0?'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;&quot;Web 2.0&quot; &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: again– I'd just bold)&lt;/font&gt;refers to what is perceived as a second generation of web development and web design. It is characterised &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: characterized, though I'm inclined to believe characterised is the British spelling– much like realize and realise.)&lt;/font&gt; as facilitating communication, information sharing, interoperability, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. It has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, hosted services, and web applications. Examples include social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs and folksonomies.&quot; (&quot;Web 2.0&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)
[[Category:Foundations and Assessment of Education]]


&lt;big&gt;'''What is a &quot;Wikiversity&quot;?'''&lt;/big&gt;

According to a definition from Wikipedia.org, a Wikiversity &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;(edit: bold maybe?)&lt;/font&gt;is an online community that allows users can find and share information, answers to questions, and general knowledge. (&quot;Wikiversity&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)


&lt;big&gt;'''How are student written texts created?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Students, along with teachers or professors, come together to write a text which others can read and learn from. The students are learning while they teach. The students do not have the purchase expensive textbooks and it has been proven very effective. They are able to peer-review each other to get the best possible text. 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Foundations_and_Assessment_of_Education/Edition_1/Foundations_Table_of_Contents/Chapter_13/Content_Articles/13.3.1


&lt;big&gt;'''What is a virtual school?'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;The most accepted definition of a virtual school is an entity approved by a state or governing body that offers courses through distance delivery â most commonly using the Internet.&quot; (Barbour &amp; Reeves, 2008, p. 402)

There are many benefits from virtual schooling, such as better access, positive learning opportunities, more flexibility and better efficiency (Barbour &amp; Reeves, 2008)


&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;What does the term 'digital natives' mean and can our classrooms keep up with them?&quot;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Digital natives, or the &quot;Net generation&quot; are the youth of our society that have been using technology all their lives. This gives them better technical skills and learning preferences geared to a digital age. 

However, traditional education will not be adequate to support digital natives. Education reform is needed to keep up with the ever-changing &quot;Net generation&quot;

Comment: '''These are pretty well-done. I did intentional foils on mine to tie in with the humor I tried to present, and it looks as if that could be problematic– but these are pretty straight forward and understandable.'''

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article '''4''' on interest because... '''The visual at the top was pretty sweet. The sidebar correlates with letting the reader explore a particular branch more. But there could've been more.''' 
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article '''5''' for credibility because... '''Being a FAQ/review, most likely quite a bit of information was already present on other articles.'''


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:

&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   '''
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;'''Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.'''Fairly straight forward presentation.'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''Simple, effective format. The questions at the end were a good match to what's presented.'''

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.'''A little too short. Expand a little. Broaden the FAQ.'''
&lt;li&gt;.'''Add some personal insight.'''

They are not being âtaughtâ technology, it has been integrated in such a way, that it is transparent. I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSES THE CRAZY A SYMBOLS. I'M ASSUMING IT'S FROM THE USE OF QUOTATIONS, SINCE MY ARTICLE WAS ALSO PLAGUED BY THEM. 


he International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has issued five standards that teachers should uphold to successfully integrate technology into classrooms. These include: 1. Facilitate and Inspire Student Learning and Creativitiy 2. Design and Develop Digital-Age Learning Experiences and Assessments 3. Model Digital-Age Work and Learning 4. Promote and Model Digital Citizenship and Responsibility 5. Engage In Professional Growth and leadership   I WOULD SUGGEST SPACING THESE OUT MORE AND SUCCESSFULLY IS SPELLED INCORRECTLY.

There are many benefits from virtual schooling, such as better access, positive learning opportunities, more flexibility and better efficiency (Barbour &amp; Reeves, 2008) REQUIRES A PERIOD.

Education reform is needed to keep up with the ever-changing &quot;Net generation&quot; PERIOD REQUIRED

&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic'''
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;'''Some good points are made and explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.'''
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;'''All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors.''' 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. Really effective presentation throughout. The information was presented clearly. 
&lt;li&gt;. The citations are used to their full effect throughout the article to provide an authoritative voice on the subject matter. (This is a lot harder to do than one would think.)

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. Mix in more with the use of citations, the majority of the article is cited material. Include some personal opinions/touches. 
&lt;li&gt;. Provide more background information, or current information on subjects. Right now they are presented clearly, but not as in depth as they could be. 
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''Yes''' &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific?  &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''Yes''' &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''Yes''' &lt;/font color&gt;
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''Yes''' &lt;/font color&gt;
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''No''' &lt;/font color&gt;
Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:  &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The learning targets are very specific, oberservable, and appropriate for the topic.  Unfortunately the article does not provide adequate information about the specific technology tools.  While the author mentions them by name and gives limited examples of each, there needs to be further explanation of each item.  Don't assume that readers know what SMART boards or virtual field trips are.   By defining and/or explaining each of them, in addition to giving a clear example, readers can achieve the specified targets.  &lt;/font color&gt;

Technology in the classroom has changed in many ways since I was in high school. The internet &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Internet) &lt;/font color&gt; did not exist,&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( remove ,)&lt;/font color&gt;  and computer classes were not required &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( a requirement)&lt;/font color&gt; . As I study to become a teacher, technology is &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( has become)&lt;/font color&gt; cutting-edge and an integral part of almost every classroom today &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (today's classrooms) &lt;/font color&gt;. Teachers use different &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (a variety of) &lt;/font color&gt; tools to assist them in the classroom, such as Smartboards, virtual field trips, Webcasts, and of course the Internet &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (including SMARTboards, virtual field trips, webcasts, and the Internet) &lt;/font color&gt; .

To better understand what role technology serves in the classroom, I spoke with my sister Dorri Herrmann-Smith. She is a High&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (high)&lt;/font color&gt;  school English teacher in Somerset, Pennsylvania. I chose to interview her because she has told me on several occasions about all of the technology she uses in her classroom&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (condsider rewording to eliminate awkwardness) &lt;/font color&gt; .



&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; '''Throughout the article there are numerous mistakes in regards to apostrophe usage (as shown below). Please proofread your article and correct these mistakes.'''  &lt;/font color&gt;

'''Examples''':  ...&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;youâre &lt;/font color&gt; connecting with them.

Ms. Herrmann-Smith: I just got a SMART Board! I love it,&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; itâs &lt;/font color&gt; so much fun! &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;Iâm &lt;/font color&gt; going to training for it because &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;Iâm &lt;/font color&gt; not familiar with half it can do. You can play games with the students, show PowerPointâs. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;Itâs &lt;/font color&gt; very interactive for the students. The kids love it!



Ms. Herrmann-Smith: Everything! Internet searches, emails, Podcasts &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (e-mails, podcasts) &lt;/font color&gt;, navigation of the Internet in general.

Ms. Herrmann-Smith: I just got a SMART Board &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (SMARTboard) &lt;/font color&gt;!

You can play games with the students, show PowerPointâs &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( no apostrophe needed..not showing possession) &lt;/font color&gt;. Itâs very interactive for the students. The kids love it!

We visited the Globe Theater in London and looked all around one afternoonâ¦it was amazing &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (one afternoon.  It was amazing.) &lt;/font color&gt;. 

The other week we had a homebound student and we Skyped&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Skype'd) &lt;/font color&gt;  with him during class.

Me: Do you feel that things like computers and the internet&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Internet) &lt;/font color&gt; are necessities in todayâs classroom?

Ms. Herrmann-Smith: Yes, definitely necessitiesâ¦&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (necessaties.) &lt;/font color&gt; I use email &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (e-mail) &lt;/font color&gt; all day long with other teachers. Grading is all done on the computer. Like I said, Iâm getting ready to get a Wikispace. Students can email&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (e-mail) &lt;/font color&gt; me night or day with questions, whereas in the past they may have been intimidated to call us teachers on the phone. Of course, parents also email&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (e-mail) &lt;/font color&gt;  me quite a bit. I often find interesting websites online that I get the students to look at and incorporate them into homework or classroom assignments. There is a website called turnitin.com &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( change color and underline to denote it is a website) &lt;/font color&gt;where it will catch plagiarizers. I use that all the time. Itâs not free, but I caught two cheaters!

Me: So, are students required to access the internet&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Internet) &lt;/font color&gt; for classes? What if they donât have the internet&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Internet) &lt;/font color&gt; at home?

Ms. Herrmann-Smith: I think that everything will be online, more than it already is. Kids will be more responsible for getting online to check things for classes. It will be expected for them to have internet&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (Internet) &lt;/font color&gt; access and check their individual email&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (e-mail) &lt;/font color&gt;  for schoolwork.

I think it was interesting speaking with my sister regarding all&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (delete all) &lt;/font color&gt; the&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (insert various)&lt;/font color&gt; types of technology that she uses daily. It gave me&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;(has given me) &lt;/font color&gt;  insight about how teaching is different from what I witnessed while attending school years ago. In our school, we were treated to usually one or two field trips a&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (per) &lt;/font color&gt; year. I can only imagine how simple and enjoyable a virtual field trip would be. According to American Teacher Magazine&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (citation year 2009) &lt;/font color&gt;, it is cost effective and not only is it possible to see museums and events in other cities and towns, it is also possible to look into the past!&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( virtual field trips are cost effective in addition to  providing students with a look into the past through museaums across the nation.) &lt;/font color&gt; Colonial Williamsburg offers an online tour that allows students to take part in a scavenger hunt and learn a little&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (while learning) &lt;/font color&gt;  about history in the process. (American Teacher Magazine, 2009)

My sister mentioned to me in our interview that they had used Skype to communicate with a homebound student. I have heard of this tool to keep in touch with out of town family and a tool to use for internet chats&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (I was aware of this tool being utilized for long distance communication and Internet chatting) &lt;/font color&gt; , but I&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (delete I) &lt;/font color&gt;  had never considered its place in the classroom. Not only is this software free, it can be used to record conversations to be played back at another time. Imagine how interesting it could be to connect an English class to an author of a book that they read, or an art class to a work of art that a class has studied!&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (New paragraph?) &lt;/font color&gt;  My sister also mentioned Webcasts. Webcasting is becoming more and more popular.&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; ( among whom?) &lt;/font color&gt;  Although there can be costs involved with on-demand learning programs that teachers can order for their classrooms, the ease of ordering up any education program one can imagine&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (any kind of educational program imaginable) &lt;/font color&gt; is indispensable for the modern classroom. (Miller, 2006)

SMARTboard technology is a very unique learning tool. According to Michele Davis of Education Weekâs Digital Directions&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (cite year 2007) &lt;/font color&gt;   , itâs possible to write with a special pen, erase what you wrote with a digital eraser, and even move objects around. Your work can be saved into easily saved documents such as&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (into document formats including) &lt;/font color&gt; Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. It looks just like a regular whiteboard, but the pens and board are digital. (Davis, 2007)

How will technology evolve in classrooms? Did anyone think fifty years ago that technology would exist that would enable teachers to teleconference with other educators across the country, or even the globe? Perhaps, but now we know itâs a reality and many of us will have the opportunity to use these advances with our own classrooms when we begin teaching&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (in our own classrooms) &lt;/font color&gt; . One interesting forward-thinking platform for education is entire 3-D&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (three dimensional (3-D)) &lt;/font color&gt; worlds where characters can exist in a different world&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (reality) &lt;/font color&gt;. Gilly Salmon, a professor of elearning in Britain, explains that in the virtual reality game Second Life &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (colorize or italicize) &lt;/font color&gt; actual colleges and other learning environments are created by users in the game&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (delete in the game) &lt;/font color&gt; (Salmon, 2009). One learning tool I have discovered in the game is the language classes. The&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (in which the)&lt;/font color&gt; professor and students all have speakers and microphones and can communicate in real time&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (which allows for real time communication) &lt;/font color&gt;.

Decades ago, videoconferencing was the stuff &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; (don't use jargon) &lt;/font color&gt; of science fiction movies. Today, it is commonplace in our homes and in our classrooms. What does the future hold for technology in school? Many advanced tools are available to todayâs teachers. No matter what the subject, students can learn and excel with technology that their parents could never have dreamed of!

=== Sources ===

For each source listed in the &quot;References&quot; section of the article, name the type of source (scholarly or popular) and the perspective it provides (research, expert opinion from educator, popular news source, parent organization, personal contact, etc.)
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Scholarly, research &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, expert opinion from an educator &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, opinion from an educator &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, news source (WWW) &lt;/font color&gt;
#. &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Popular, news source (WWW) &lt;/font color&gt;
#.
#.
 
List the range of publication years for all sources, e.g. 1998-2006: &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 2006-2009 &lt;/font color&gt;

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources?&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No &lt;/font color&gt;  and use at Scholarly, research least 2 scholarly sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the citations in APA format? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes, however some of the information needed additional citation information which was corrected in the mechanics section. &lt;/font color&gt;
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes, with the exception of some minor punctuation mistakes.&lt;/font color&gt;
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No &lt;/font color&gt;
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment:

&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt;Resources were very up to date.

I did not find any cited text regarding the Foote reference.  Was it overlooked?  If not, the reference needs to be removed from the list.

The majority of the resources were popular therefore included no peer-reviewed research.  This is a great topic and I know that there are many more sources, including academic journals, that could provide valuable information on technology in the classroom.  The dependence on popular sources (specifically those that were Web-based) makes it difficult to provide bias-free information.  Please take a second look for quality resources and be careful when you cite and format these sources. &lt;/font color&gt;


-----------------------

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; knowledge &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 2 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; knowledge &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 3 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; application &lt;/font color&gt;
##Question 4 &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; application &lt;/font color&gt;


Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Question 3 is based on individual opinion.  Consider rewording in order make the question and answer clear.  Otherwise, the other questions are fine. &lt;/font color&gt;
#Do the questions assess the learning target? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the foils (the response options that are NOT the answer) reasonable i.e. they are not very obviously incorrect answers? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are the response options listed in alphabetical order? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; No &lt;/font color&gt;
#Are correct answers provided and listed BELOW all the questions? &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Yes &lt;/font color&gt;

Please make a comment about the multiple-choice questions. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve the question/s.


Comment:

&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; Question 3 appears to be opinion based which makes each of the answers possible.  Consider rewording the question and answers for clarification which would remove any opinionate responses.  

Also, it seems that all of the answers for question 4 could be a possibility.  Maybe the answers could be modified to be more specific. (And then again, maybe its just me!) &lt;/font color&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 4 &lt;/font color&gt;for importance because&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; the author's topic is highly relevant to both new and veteran teachers in addition to identifying examples of technology in the classroom. &lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 3 &lt;/font color&gt;  for interest because&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; the photo addes visual interest to the article.  However, there was no side bar included and the mechanical errors (coding problems?) made it difficult to read. &lt;/font color&gt;
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 2 &lt;/font color&gt; for credibility because&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; there were not enough scholarly sources and one resource was not cited in the article.  It needs additional peer-reviewed research data in order to adequately support the topic. &lt;/font color&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article &lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; 2 &lt;/font color&gt;  for writing because&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; the article was awkward to follow due to error.  While I realize that this article is actually an interview, the responses were choppy and gave me the impression that it was put together hastily. &lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals add to the article'''
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the information/ideas are new'''
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''No side bar included.'''
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.'''
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The photo adds interest to the article which makes it visiually appealing &lt;/font color&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The article provides the reader with a variety suggestions of ways to incorporate technology into the classroom.  The interview provides a first-hand account of how a teacher incorporates technology into her own lessons. &lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; There are great examples of different types of technology.  You could define or explain each type in addition to providing examples, which would improve learning target achievement in addition to providing valuable information to the reader. &lt;/font color&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=#0066CC&gt; The photo adds a great deal of interest to the article.  Additional photos or graphics that show technology at work in the classroom would heighten reader interest.  Sidebars that provide weblinks to valuable teacher resources would be helpful and reinforce the use of technology in the classroom &lt;/font color&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article

&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.

&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

==&lt;CENTER&gt;'''Part 1 - Article Components'''&lt;/center&gt;==

=== Learning Target(s) ===
 
Answer the following questions regarding the learning targets:

*Is/are the stated learning targets actual learning targets i.e. they state what the reader should know or be able to do after reading the article? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes. &lt;/font&gt;
*Is/are the learning target(s) specific? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; No. &lt;/font&gt;
*Is/are they appropriate and reasonable? (Are they too easy or too difficult for ECI 301 students?) &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I think it is fine. But slightly vague. &lt;/font&gt;
*Is/are they observable? (You wouldn't have to look inside the readers head to know if they met this target.) &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes. &lt;/font&gt;
*Does the article provide adequate information for readers to achieve these targets? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Not really. &lt;/font&gt;

Please make a comment about the learning target(s). If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve them.

Comment:
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Since there is only one learning target, it is hard to know what the reader is really supposed to take away from the article. I answered &quot;no&quot; to the question about the specificity of the learning target because I found the learning target to be written in a very confusing way. I answered &quot;no&quot; the last question because I also found the article very difficult to understand. &lt;/font&gt;

 == &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; WHY IS THIS RANDOM SIDEBAR HERE? &lt;/font&gt;



Learning Target: Readers will be able to identify the different types of assessments and the best one &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;  (VERB TENSES DON'T AGREE)&lt;/font&gt;  to use when it comes to assessing students.
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF HOW YOUR SIDEBARS GO ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE PAGE, THEY ARE VERY DISTRACTING.
 &lt;/font&gt;                         Students should be involved in the process
                        of assessments when it comes to monitoring
                        their progress. ==
 

== What is an assessment?  Wikipedia says,&quot;an assessment is the process of documenting, usually in measurable terms, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; DON'T FORGET YOUR CLOSING QUOTATION MARKS  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assessment

There are four types of assessments that I will identify.  They are: 
1) formative and summative
2) objective and subjective 
3) criterion-referenced and norm-referenced, and
4) informal and formal ==
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; THESE WOULD LOOK BETTER IF THEY WERE FORMATTED IN A LIST RATHER THAN A STRAIGHT LINE.
ALSO, CAN YOU CAPITALIZE EACH TERM? &lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; WHERE IS ONE? &lt;/font&gt; == 2) What are formative and summative assessments?  Formative assessments are used when information is used to adapt teaching and learning to meet the student's needs. Examples would be: teacher observations and classroom discussions. 
   Summative assessments are assessments that are used for final exams, statewide tests (FCAT), national tests, and entrance exams (SAT &amp; ACT).
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; DON'T USE TAB, SO YOUR TEXT WON'T GO ACROSS THE PAGE.
ALSO, WHY IS THE DEFINITION IN A SIDEBAR, BUT THE FIRST ONE WASN'T? &lt;/font&gt;
                To learn more about formative and summative

                Assessments Improve Learning by Thomas R. Guskey. ==


== 3) What are objective assessments?  Objective assessments are questions that has one correct answer.  These assessments include true/false, multiple choice, and matching questions.  
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; WHY DO SOME OF THESE HAVE &quot;==&quot; BEFORE THEM BUT OTHERS DON'T? &lt;/font&gt;
4) What are subjective assessments?  Subjective assessments can have more than one correct answer.  These assessments are usually extended-response questions and essays. ==


== 5) What are criterion-referenced assessments? Criterion-referenced assessments are tests that measures a student's competence, such as taking a driving test.

6) What are norm-referenced assessments? Norm-referenced assessments are better known as &quot;grading on a curve.&quot;  Examples would be IQ tests and entrance exams.

7) What are formal assessments? Formal assessments are quizzes, tests, or papers.  Students receive a grade on informal assessments based on their performance. ==


== 8) What are informal assessments? Informal assessments include teacher observations, rubrics, peer evaluations, self-evaluations, and discussions.


                        Rather than sorting students into
                        winners and losers, assessment for
                        learning can put all students on a
                        winning streak.
                                         Rick Stiggens ==


== Assessment Through the Student's Eyes &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; CAN YOUR HEADINGS BE DISTINCTIVE IN SOME WAY? &lt;/font&gt;
     Teachers and students can learn from assessments.  Assessments give understandable information in a way they &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; (WHO?) &lt;/font&gt; can use to improve their &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; (WHO?) &lt;/font&gt;performance, and when teachers and students improve their performance they can only enhance their learning. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; THE PRONOUN USAGE IN THIS SENTENCE NEEDS WORK. &lt;/font&gt;
     According to Black &amp; Wiliam, &quot;extensive research conducted around the world shows that by consistently applying the principles of assessment for learning, we can produce impressive gains in student achievement, especially for struggling learners.&quot; ==
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; DON'T TAB SO YOUR TEXT DOESN'T EXTEND PAST THE PAGE. &lt;/font&gt;
                            
==                        THE ASSESSMENT EXPERIENCE 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; WHY IS THIS THE ONLY DISTINCTIVE HEADING SO FAR? &lt;/font&gt;
The assessment experience gives a look into how a student feels when they are assessed.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; THE ENTIRE FOLLOWING SECTION MAKES NO SENSE &lt;/font&gt;
FOR STUDENTS on WINNING STREAKS              FOR STUDENTS on LOSING STREAK

                       Assessment results provide:
-continual evidence of success               -continual evidence of failure

                           The student feels:
-hopeful and optimistic                      - hopeless
-empowered to take productive action         - initially panicked, giving up

                           The student thinks:
-It's all good. I'm doing fine. I            - this hurts. I'm not safe here
want more success.                             I'm confused
-Feedback helps me.                          - Nothing I try seems to work.
-Public success feels good                   -Public failure is embarrassing

                  The student becomes more likely to:
-seek challenges                              - seek what is easy
-seek exciting new ideas                      - avoid new concepts ==


== -take initiative                              - avoid initiative

                         These actions lead to:
-self-enhancement                             - self-defeat,self-destruction
-acceptance of responsibility                 - denial of responsibility
-feeling that success is its own reward       - no feeling of success
-curiosity, enthusiasm                        - boredom, frustration, fear
-resilience                                   - yielding quickly to defeat
-strong foundations for future success        - failure to master

== THE FIVE KEY DIMENSIONS OF CLASSROOM ASSESSMENTS
     According to Stiggens, Arter, Chappuis, and Chappuis, there are five key dimensions of sound and productive classroom assessments.  They are:

1) Quality assessments arise from and are designed to serve the specific information needs of intended user(s). Assessments are used by teachers, administrators, and students to help them find out what kind of strategies to use.

2) Quality assessments arise from clearly articulated and appropriate achievement targets.  Simply put, students need clear and specific instructions as to what is wanted from them to help them learn.


3) Quality assessments accurately reflect student achievement. No matter what kind of assessment that is used it should be one that gears toward achieving student success.

4) Quality assessments yield results that are effectively communicated to their intended users. Teachers, administrators, and students should be able to understand the results that are made. ==

5
== ) Quality assessments involve students in classroom assessment, record-keeping, and communication of result. Students are more involved and held accountable for what they learn.

-----------------------

=== Sources ===

For each source listed in the &quot;References&quot; section of the article, name the type of source (scholarly or popular) and the perspective it provides (research, expert opinion from educator, popular news source, parent organization, personal contact, etc.)
#. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; None of the sources seems to be cited correctly, so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to figure out what type of source they are. &lt;/font&gt;
#.
#.
#.
#.
#.
#.
 
List the range of publication years for all sources, e.g. 1998-2006: ______ - ________

Answer the following questions about the sources used in the article:

#Did the author CITE at least 5 sources? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Maybe. It's very hard to tell when the author is  &lt;/font&gt; and use at least 2 scholarly sources? ______
#Are the citations in APA format? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; No &lt;/font&gt;
##''Here are two examples of citations in APA format, one for a paraphrase and one for a quotation:''
###Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon '''(Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007)'''.
###Unfortunately impoverished children are often attending “low-performing schools staffed by ill-equipped teachers” '''(Murnane, 2007, p. 34)'''.
#Are all the sources listed in APA format in a Reference list labeled &quot;References&quot;? ______
##''Here is an example of a reference written in APA format:''
###'''Bailey, J., &amp; Barnum, P. (2001). The colon and its rise to prominence in the American circus. ''Journal of American Punctuation, 34''(5), 2-3.'''
#Taken together do the 5 sources represent a good balance of potential references for this topic? ______
#Does the author consider potential bias in the sources? ______
#Are most of the sources current (less than 5 years old)? ______

Please make a comment about the sources. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve.

Comment:
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The way in which the author cited the sources is very confusing and makes it difficult to anser any questions about the references. &lt;/font&gt;



-----------------------

=== Multiple Choice Questions ===

#What does each question assess: knowledge or reasoning (application of knowledge)?
##Question 1 &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Knowledge &lt;/font&gt;
##Question 2 &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Knowledge &lt;/font&gt;
##Question 3 &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Reasoning &lt;/font&gt;
##Question 4 &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Reasoning &lt;/font&gt;


Answer the following questions about the multiple-choice questions. 

#Are there 4 multiple-choice questions? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes &lt;/font&gt;
#Do they each have four answer choices (A-D)? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes &lt;/font&gt;
#Is there a single correct (not opinion-based) answer for each question?&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes &lt;/font&gt; 
#Do the questions assess the learning target? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; No &lt;/font&gt;
#Are the questions appropriate and reasonable (not too easy and not too difficult)? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Appropriate &lt;/font&gt;
#Are the foils (the response options that are NOT the answer) reasonable i.e. they are not very obviously incorrect answers? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes &lt;/font&gt;
#Are the response options listed in alphabetical order? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes &lt;/font&gt;
#Are correct answers provided and listed BELOW all the questions? &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Yes &lt;/font&gt;

Please make a comment about the multiple-choice questions. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to any of the questions above, please explain how the author can improve the question/s.


Comment:
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; I only answered &quot;no&quot; to the question concerning the learning target because the learning target is s confusing &lt;/font&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because...&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The content of the article is good, but not extraordinary enough to warrent a 5 &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 2 on interest because... &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The sidebars are distracting, there are no visuals, and the text that is in the sidebars doesn't always warrent that placement. &lt;/font&gt;
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 3 for credibility because... &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The references aren't cited properly. &lt;/font&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 2 on writing because... &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; Much of the article (including, specifically, the learning target) is writting in a very confusing way. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold  



===''Wiki Article Rubric'' ===


&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Includes ideas relevant to future teachers'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Mostly based on researched information.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Applicable to today’s schools'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar repeats what is already in the article'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included '''
&lt;li&gt;'''Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''One new idea or bit of information'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one clear point is made and supported.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''4 multiple-choice questions are included.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Learning targets generally related to the content are stated'''
&lt;li&gt;'''At least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The colors are very calm and nice and not too distracting. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The multiple choice questions are very good. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; The formatting could use some work &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; A visual would be nice. &lt;/font&gt;
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

  THE ASSESSMENT EXPERIENCE
The assessment experience gives a look into how a student feels when they are assessed.

FOR STUDENTS on WINNING STREAKS FOR STUDENTS on LOSING STREAK

                      Assessment results provide:
-continual evidence of success -continual evidence of failure

                          The student feels:
-hopeful and optimistic - hopeless -empowered to take productive action - initially panicked, giving up

                          The student thinks:
-It's all good. I'm doing fine. I - this hurts. I'm not safe here want more success. I'm confused -Feedback helps me. - Nothing I try seems to work. -Public success feels good -Public failure is embarrassing

                 The student becomes more likely to:
-seek challenges - seek what is easy -seek exciting new ideas - avoid new concepts ==


== -take initiative - avoid initiative

                        These actions lead to:
-self-enhancement - self-defeat,self-destruction -acceptance of responsibility - denial of responsibility -feeling that success is its own reward - no feeling of success -curiosity, enthusiasm - boredom, frustration, fear -resilience - yielding quickly to defeat -strong foundations for future success - failure to master

                                               prerequisites for future 
                                               success

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Covers key ideas crucial ]] [[for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.]]&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;[[Applicable to today’s schools]]&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;  IT COMPLIES WITH MUCH OF THE INSTRUCTIONS
&lt;li&gt;. IT SHOWS THAT THE AUTHOR DID NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THE ASSIGNMENT WHICH SOMETIMES CAN BE A PROBLEM
&lt;li&gt;.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. ADD SOME MORE DETAILS
&lt;li&gt;. MAKE MORE SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO CONTENT OF SOURCES USED
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

The VAAP is an alternative to formal Standards of Learning (SOL) testing and is available to students in grades 3 through 8 and grade 11 who are working on academic standards that have been reduced in complexity and depth. (SHOULD SPELL OUT THREE, EIGHT AND ELEVEN.)

Introduction of âexpertâ (CHECK THE FORMATTING)

She holds a Masterâs of Science in Education with a concentration in Special Education from Old Dominion University. (CHECK THE FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- MASTERS)

The VAAP consists of five componentsâ (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- COMPONENTS)

VAAP Content Area Cover Sheet-The studentâs COE must include a cover sheet for each content area within the collection. (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- STUDENT'S)

Work samples must address all concepts stated in the ASOL and must be graded correctly so that the studentâs proficiency on the content is clear. (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- STUDENT'S)

Anecdotal records should include the date of performance, a description of the observed skill or procedure, and the studentâs level of achievement (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- STUDENT'S)

An example of a good anecdotal record would be, âOn March 1, 2009, John Doe sorted a box of 20 objects by size, shape, and color with 100% accuracy. John was able to complete this activity independently.â (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT QUOTATIONS APPEAR)

Data charts and graphs submitted should contain specific information regarding the targeted ASOL, the date of performance, and the studentâs level of achievement. Photographs submitted must be captioned with a statement indicating student performance of ASOL knowledge and skills. The statement should be a detailed summary of the activity occurring and the studentâs level of achievement. (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- STUDENT'S)

They are used to show a studentâs progress over time and improvement in specific areas. (CHECK FORMATTING SO THAT IT READS- STUDENT'S)

Comment:

I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS FOLLOW YOUR LEARNING TARGETS WONDERFULLY. YOU NEED TO LIST THE ANSWERS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER. OTHER THAN THESE CHANGES, I THINK THE EXAMPLES YOU LIST FOR THE APPLICATION QUESTIONS ARE GREAT.  

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because...

THE INFORMATION IN THE ARTICLE IS RLEVANT TO FUTURE TEACHERS, IS MOSTLY BASED ON REASEARCHED INFO AS WELL AS FROM THE INTERVIEW, AND OFFERS A FEW PERSPECTIVES AND KEY IDEAS ON THE ISSUE. 

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 4 on interest because...

THE SIDEBAR ENHANCED THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPIC BY ALLOWING THE READER TO EASILY FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT. THE FORMATTING/ COLORS WERE NICE AND NOT TOO OVERWHELMING. TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WERE GIVEN ALTHOUGH NOT DISCUSSED IN GREAT DETAIL. MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS NEW TO ME!
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 3 for credibility because...
ALTHOUGH THE AUTHOR HAS ONLY PROVIDED 3 SOURCES, THE INFORMATION AND SOURCES OFFER A FEW POINTS OF VIEW (NOT ALWAYS ELABORATED ON THOUGH). BE SURE TO EMPHASIZE WHEN THE INFORMATION WAS MS. STREET'S OPINION OR YOUR OWN. THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE &quot;DISADVANTAGES&quot; SECTION SEEMED TO BE YOUR OPINION, BUT LATER YOU GAVE CREDIT TO MS. STREET. BE SURE TO CLARIFY. POSSIBLY ELABORATE MORE ON OTHER VIEWPOINTS TO OFFER BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT FAIRLY.



&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 4 on writing because... 
&lt;/ul&gt;

OVERALL, I THINK THE WRITING WAS GREAT. OFFERED BOTH APPLICATION AND KNOWLEDGE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS; THE LEARNING TARGETS ALIGNED WITH THE ARTICLE; INTERESTING FACTS AND EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT; MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS EXPLAINED- POSSIBLY ELABORATE MORE ON IEPs. I KNOW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM, BUT NOT ALL READERS WILL AND I THINK ITS A CRUCIAL PART OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROCESS. (DONT NEED MUCH, JUST A SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION) THE ARTICLE FLOWED WELL WITH VERY FEW GRAMMATICAL ERRORS.

&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;One interesting or new perspective is presented
&lt;li&gt;A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. 
&lt;li&gt;Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. I THOUGHT THE INFORMATION COVERED IN THE ARTICLE WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE. THIS IS A TOPIC I AM NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH AND I THINK IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR FUTURE TEACHERS. 

&lt;li&gt;. THE SIDEBAR OFFERED A GREAT ADDITION TO THE ARTICLE. IT ALLOWED THE READER TO SUPPLEMENT WITH ADDITION INFORMATION IF NECESSARY. REALLY ENJOYED IT!

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK FORMATTING ISSUES. THE FORMATTING ERRORS MAKE IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO READ SMOOTHLY.
&lt;li&gt;. BE SURE TO CITE FIVE SOUCES, ESPECIALLY THE INTERVIEW. I REALLY ENJOYED LEARNING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PERSPECIVES (ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE PERSON INTERVIEWED) SO BE SURE TO GIVE THEM CREDIT.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

=== Grammar and Mechanics Review''' ===

*Please either paste the entire body of the article here or any sections that you feel need to be revised. 
*To do this:
**go back to the module page for the article
**select &quot;edit this page&quot;
**highlight all the text, hit control &quot;c&quot; (or &quot;copy&quot; from the edit menu)
**navigate back to your peer review page
**click edit this page and paste the text into this window (use control &quot;v&quot; or paste from the edit menu)
**You may want to have Wikibooks open in two windows/tabs to make this process easier.
*Type your comments in ALL CAPITALS or in &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; another color &lt;/font&gt; so the author can easily find them.

'''Background''':
The Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (VAAP) is a portfolio assessment designed to evaluate the performance of students with significant cognitive disabilities &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; and&lt;/font&gt; an alternative to formal &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt; the&lt;/font&gt; Standards of Learning (SOL) testing (Virginia Department of Education, 2008). &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;It&lt;/font&gt; is available to students in grades 3 through 8 and grade 11&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;,&lt;/font&gt; who are working on academic standards that have been reduced in complexity and depth. The content, derived from SOLs, is modified and referred to as the Aligned Standards of Learning (ASOLs). Individual student achievement of academic skills is the &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/font&gt; focus of this portfolio assessment.


'''&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Expert on the VAAP&lt;/font&gt;''': 
Wendy Street is a special education teacher for Louisa County Public Schools (LCPS), located in Louisa, Virginia. Ms. Street is the 2009 Educator of the Year for Louisa County &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;and&lt;/font&gt; holds a Master’s of Science in Education with a concentration in Special Education from Old Dominion University. She serves as the Special Education department chair for Thomas Jefferson Elementary School and as a Louisa County Public Schools Peer Reviewer for VAAP portfolios and Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). In the classroom, &lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Ms. Street also &lt;/font&gt;teaches students with significant cognitive disabilities who fall on the autism spectrum.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Might want to change &quot;Interview Questions&quot; to &quot;The Scoop From Someone Who Knows&quot;. Might also want to change &quot;What are the benefits of using portfolio assessments such as the VAAP?&quot; to &quot;What are the advantages of using portfoilo assessment such as the VAAP?&quot; to be consistent with the following question.

The article could use some conclusion, like a summary of the interview. Could also include how this information is useful to teachers, compare this to other states or a national program, or improvements that could be made.&lt;/font&gt;

Comment:
Although the questions are good, it is recommended that order of the answers change. Currently, the multiple choice answers are C, D, D, and C. May want to change it C, A, D, B so it does not seem obvious.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 4 for importance because it is very important to know the standards and assessment used in special education, for both special education and general education teachers. 

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 3 on interest because it was helpful to know of an assessment program in Virginia, however, it would have also been beneficial to have the program compare to other state or national programs. 
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 3 for credibility because the information came directly from the Virginia Department of Education and a person who is highly specialized in Education. However, there could have been another side or possibly opposers of portfolio assessments or the VAAP. 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 3 on writing because the article could have been a little more detailed overall and some sentences could have been fleshed out. While reading the article, some sentences felt too short or too direct. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Visuals are included but have minimal effect'''
&lt;li&gt;'''One interesting or new perspective is presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A couple (2-3) new ideas or pieces of information'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is not a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented. '''
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included; APA format is not used or has many errors.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.'''
&lt;li&gt;'''The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;Sources lack diversity OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals'''
&lt;li&gt;'''Parts of the article capture attention'''
&lt;li&gt;'''About half of the cited information is discussed'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;At least one part of the article is interesting
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, sentence structure and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The article addresses a very important program in Virginia and how it relates to special education.
&lt;li&gt;The interview is with an expert who has a strong academic foundation in special education and has great knowledge of the VAAP.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing could be more detailed and not so direct.
&lt;li&gt;The article could address some oppistion to the issue to show an unbiased perspective or offern soem flaws to the VAAP.
 
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Compliment: I completely and totally agree with your points. I wrote the article in haste, and it really does show. I was unsure of how things should have looked and sort of just winged it. 

Suggestion: A little bit more specific critique would be appreciated in the future. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 05:54, 22 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Compliment: Your feedback was pretty specific and very motivating. Reading it makes me want to improve my crappy article. 

Suggestion: You were almost too nice to me. Turn up the harsh just a little bit in the future for more impact in your critiques. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 05:59, 22 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

I thought that all of the feedback provided was very understandable. The way it was all worded was very easy to understand, which made my revision very easy.

I guess it was necessary because i did it more than once, but you didn't necessarily have to list the same thing more than once.

The majority of the feedback i received was very helpful. It was easily understood.

The link that was inserted wasn't very clear as to what I was to use it for, but other than that it was good.

Compliment: Thanks for the review, it helped greatly. Your feedback was clear and to the point and it made me realize I could have done a better job. 

Suggestion: You stated that some sentence structures needed work on my suggestions. How so? What could I re-written? You did a great job on detailing where it was confusing, but it could be more specific. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 18:41, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Compliment: Thanks for the review! Not only did it help but both reviews will make my article better. You make great points across that I need to address.

Suggestion: On your (2+2) section of the review, I felt it could have been more specific. Thanks again though! [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 18:45, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</text>
