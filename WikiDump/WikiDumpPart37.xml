      <text xml:space="preserve">''''Mold Testing''''
*There are many methods to mold testing which enables detection in the air, on surfaces and  in dust. Testing for mold in many cases is unnecessary. Simply identifying if mold is present is inexpensive and allows for more money for mold removal.

''''Mold Identification Process''''

*Select an spot where the mold is boldly spoted, wall, cabinet, ceiling.
*Check the color of the Mold, some colors represent diffrent species, black,red,green.
*Look at the texture to see if is lumpy, hard, grainy.
*Mold should be also checked on diff growth surfaces, such as drywall room,and painted areas.
*Make sure you use visible lighting area to spot mold.

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|partial}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The special identifier {{C sharp|partial}} is used to allow ''developers'' to build ''classes'' from different files and have the compiler generate one class, combining all the partial classes. This is mostly useful for separating classes into separate blocks. For example, Visual Studio 2005 separates the UI code for forms into a separate partial class that allows you to work on the business logic separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditionally, arithmetic is described as using variables to solve equations, where a variable just represents some number.  Algebra is traditionally regarded as the generalization and abstraction of such arithmetic, such as using those arithmetic operations on the complex numbers, or using &quot;clock arithmetic&quot; on the integers modulo some number.

      <comment>/* What is the purpose of this Wikibook? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Announcing/Preview|This chapter of the wikibook contains information about the wikibook itself.  If you've never read a wikibook, this chapter can help you understand what a wikibook is, and what this particular wikibook is all about.}}

== What is a Wikibook? ==

At the risk of stating the utterly obvious, let's begin with a simple definition: '''A wikibook is a book made with a wiki.'''  Like most simple definitions, this one would benefit from some clarification, so let's break it down into three parts.  A wikibook is:

# '''...a book...'''  You are probably reading this on a computer screen right now, or perhaps a portable device like a tablet or &quot;smart phone.&quot;  So it may not feel like you are reading a book, at least not a traditional one with paper pages that you turn as you read it.  But really, isn't a book much more than just paper and printer's ink?  Isn't the important part of a book--the reason why you read a book--contained in the book's ''message'', and the ''meaning'' you derive from that message? So broadly defined, a book doesn't have to be a physical object you buy in a bookstore or borrow from a library.  Indeed, many books today are available in alternative formats, such as audiobooks and e-books.  Granted, the book you are reading now is presented differently than a traditional book.  But give it a chance.  You might find you like reading wikibooks.  You might even want to help write a wikibook someday.  Which brings us to the second part of the definition...
# '''...made...'''  When we make something, we take things that already exist and combine them to fashion a new thing.  When we make a book, we take things that already exist in our heads--ideas, thoughts and concepts--and combine them in an organized, systematic way to create a new thing--a coherent, sustained message expressed in language.  That's pretty much what happens when we make a wikibook as well, but with at least two important differences.  First, a wikibook is an '''open collaborative effort'''.  That means that authorship is not fully embedded in one author, or even a group of identified authors.  Rather, a wikibook reflects the entire community of people who write, edit, discuss or otherwise contribute to the development of it.  Second, a wikibook is never really finished in the sense of a tradition book.  A wikibook remains continually available for anyone to add to, update and correct.  It is, by design, a &quot;work in progress.&quot;  Both of these distinctive qualities of wikibooks are enabled by the technology used to create them, which brings us to the last part of the definition...[[Image:wikipedia-logo.png|thumb|right|With well over a million articles, [[w:|Wikipedia]] may be the world's largest encyclopedia.]]
# ''' ...with a wiki.''' A wiki is a kind of collaborative website.  That is, it is a website where multiple people can easily add to or change the content on the site.  Most wikis, including this one, are open, in the sense that anyone that visits the web site can participate in its development.  And most wikis, including this one, have content that can be freely used and redistributed, released to the public under the terms of some kind of &quot;open source&quot; licence such as the [[GNU_Free_Documentation_License|GNU Free Documentation License]] and the various [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ Creative Commons Licenses].  In a sense, a wiki is a kind of social networking website, like [[w:Facebook|Facebook]] and [[w:Twitter|Twitter]], but with more of a focus on the shared structuring and organizing of information. Perhaps the most famous wiki is [http://en.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia], which bills itself as &quot;the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.&quot;  Wikipedia, as well as [[Main_Page|Wikibooks]], the wiki you are now using, are projects of the [http://wikimediafoundation.org/ Wikimedia Foundation].


The wikibook you are now reading could also be called a Wikibook, with a capital &quot;W,&quot; because it is hosted on the Wikibooks wiki.  Some might prefer to call it a &quot;WikiBook,&quot; using the [[w:CamelCase|CamelCase]] style common to earlier wikis, or even a Wiki Book.  But whatever you call it, it's still a '''book made with a wiki'''.  And hopefully, it's a book you'll want to read...and perhaps help write.

== How do I use this Wikibook? ==

This may seem like a silly question, since if you're reading this, you're already using this wikibook.  But to get the most out of this wikibook, you should be aware of a few things:

# '''Navigation.'''   To help you &quot;turn the pages&quot; of this wikibook, some navigational aids are provided.  Near the top right corner of every page is a set of two links, one that links to the previous page and one that links to the next page.  Near the bottom of every page is another set of links, which includes the previous and next links, as well as a third link that takes you directly to the table of contents page.  There is also a link to the table of contents page near the top left corner of every page (just below the phrase &quot;From Wikibooks, the open-content textbook collection.&quot;
# '''Links.'''  Many of the words in this wikibook are clickable links.  Some links take you to other pages in this book, and some links take you to other pages on this wiki that are not part of this book (like this link: [[Main_page|Wikibooks]]).  Some links take you to pages on Wikipedia: for example, [[w:announcer|announcer]] takes you to the Wikipedia entry about announcers.  Some links take you to pages on other web sites; these have a small arrow symbol after the link.  And there are a few special purpose links, like the ISBN number links below, which take you to a page where you can search for that book online.  You don't have to follow every link, of course, but you might want to follow some to learn more about a topic.  Just remember that if a link takes you outside of this wikibook, you may need to use your browser's back button to return back to this wikibook.  Many browsers allow you to open links in a new window or tab, which can be a useful feature when reading a wikibook.
# '''Discussion.'''   Each page in this wikibook has a discussion page (also called a talk page).  If you want to make a comment about something on a page, here's where you can do it.  If you would like to make a suggestion, argue a point, offer a criticism or give a compliment, the talk page is the place to do so.  The talk page can also serve as a kind of &quot;guestbook,&quot; where readers can &quot;sign&quot; their names (using three or four tilde characters). And the talk pages can be a tool for courses that use this wikibook as a textbook.  For example, instructors could post activities related to the wikibook on the talk pages.  They could also include quiz or discussion questions that can help students review the material.   
# '''Editing.'''   If you find a typo in this book, please feel free to fix it!  You can edit every page in this book, simply by clicking the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab near the top of the book.  This will open the entire page in an editing window where you can make changes.  At the bottom of that window are buttons to &quot;save page&quot; (to save your changes), &quot;show preview&quot; (to show you what your changes will look like without saving) and &quot;show changes&quot; (to show you a comparison of the original version with your edited one).  The editing window also has a tool bar above it to help you do things like add '''bold''' or ''italic'' text, as well as add links to other pages or other web sites.  You can even add pictures and sound files, although if you do so, please make sure they don't violate the terms of the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|Wikibooks license]].  '''Tip''': because it's often easier to edit just a section of a page, each section of each page has its own &quot;edit&quot; link near the right edge of the top of each section.  In most cases, it's a lot easier to correct a typo or make a quick edit by clicking on a section's edit link than to open the entire page in the editing window.

== Why a Wikibook on Announcing? ==

That's a good question. After all, as of August 2011, there are at least three well-established textbooks on announcing published by the major textbook publishers:

# ''Television and Radio Announcing'' (11th edition), by Stuart W. Hyde (ISBN 020556304X).  The 11th edition of this text was published by Allyn &amp; Bacon in 2008. Hyde's book is a classic, and has been used in broadcast performance courses for decades; his first edition was published in 1959.    
# ''Announcing : Broadcast Communication Today'' (5th edition), by Carl Hausman, Philip Benoit, Frank Messere and Lewis B. O'Donnell (ISBN 0534563104).  The 5th edition of this text was published by Wadsworth in 2004.  This book has also been around a long time; the first edition was published in 1987.  
# ''Broadcast Announcing Worktext: Performing for Radio, Television, and Cable'' (3rd edition) by Alan R. Stephenson, David E. Reese and Mary Beadle (ISBN 0240810589).  The 3rd edition of this text was published by Focal Press in 2009.  It is a relatively recent addition to the literature on announcing; its first edition was published in 2000.

There are also books related to specific announcing skills and specializations.  For example, ''Broadcast Voice Handbook'' (4th edition) by Ann S. Utterback and Michael G. Freedman (ISBN 1566252725) provides an in-depth examination of voice development for broadcasters.  Another notable book, and a fun read, is ''How to Make a Million Dollars With Your Voice (or Lose Your Tonsils Trying)'' by Gary Owens and Jeff Lenburg (ISBN 0071424105).

All of these are fine books, and each has its unique strengths.  But none of them have four qualities that this wikibook has:

# This book is free.
# This book can include hyperlinks.
# This book can be updated continuously.
# This book can include contributions by anyone.

Now the first point is hard to quibble with.  It's hard to beat free.  The second point is also a big advantage of a wikibook, since you can embed in the text itself links to other web pages, including other wikibooks and entries in other wikis (like Wikipedia entries).  The third advantage can be a bit iffy, as a wikibook is only as good as the community of contributors who help keep it current.  There's no guarantee that this wikibook will stay current, of course, but the more people that get involved, the more likely it is that at least some of them will stick with it and keep the text fresh and current...at least until the &quot;next generation&quot; of contributors take over.  

But this last point may seem like a disadvantage to some people.  After all, shouldn't textbooks be written by experts?  If you let anyone contribute to a book, doesn't that make it less credible?  Maybe, but maybe not.  You see, while it is true that wikibooks (and wikis in general) can and do suffer from occasional &quot;[[w:Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]],&quot; it's not something that can't be fixed.  Any edit can be reversed.  Any contribution can be removed.  And every version of every page can be seen by anyone.  Just click on the &quot;View History&quot; tab at the top of each page, and you'll see a list of every version of that page.  This list also shows when each version was submitted, and by whom--either identified by their registered username, or by their IP address if they prefer to edit anonymously (or just forget to log in).  If you like, you can even compare different versions to see what was changed.

So while the fact that anyone can contribute to this wikibook may seem like a disadvantage, it's actually one of its greatest strengths.  (Maybe not as great as the fact that it's free, but close).   Because when you let anyone help write a book, the people who are most likely to contribute, and the people who are most likely to prevail in an &quot;[[w:Wikipedia:Edit war|edit war]]&quot; are the people who care the most about the book and its content.  The community of writers and readers serve as a built-in review system.  It isn't a perfect system, but it's a pretty good one.  And if you don't agree, you are free to edit this page right now and change it.  And if you do, anyone is free to change it back.

== What is the purpose of this Wikibook? ==

The fundamental purpose of this wikibook is to provide a free, open-content textbook on announcing.  In particular, it is hoped that this wikibook will be a valuable resource for those who seek to become announcers, or who seek to improve their announcing skills.

Another purpose is to serve as a textbook for a course taught by [[user:pthompsen|Philip A. Thompsen, Ph.D.]] at [[w:West Chester University | West Chester University]].  I'm going to revert to writing in first person just to make this clearer, and to keep from writing about &quot;Dr. Thompsen&quot; when...well, that's me.  (In general, writing in first person is not good [[w:Wiki etiquette | Wiki etiquette]], but perhaps the reader will grant me some grace to make a point in this section.)  I've been teaching broadcast performance courses for many years, and at many different universities.  I've used all three of the textbooks I mentioned above in past semesters.  They are all fine books.  And they are all expensive books (although the Focal book is the most reasonably priced).  None of them are perfect.  None cover everything I want in a textbook for my course.  So back in 2006, when I was faced with the decision as to what book to adopt for my course that fall, I couldn't decide.  I didn't really want to use any of them.  I wanted to write my own textbook.

[[image:comwiki.png|thumb|right|[http://communication.wcupa.edu/wiki/ ComWiki]]]And then in July of 2006, I taught a graduate course on communication technology where the students and I worked together on building a wiki about communication.  We called it [http://comwiki.org ComWiki: The Communication Studies Wiki].  It was a  small class, but in just a few weeks of work, we built a pretty decent little wiki, with over a hundred articles.  Not amazing, perhaps, but certainly a good start to what could potentially become a more active wiki in the future.  

This experience peaked my interest in attending a conference on wikis called [http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org Wikimania 2006].  It was a great conference, and I got to see firsthand what others were doing with wiki technology.  And after spending three days listening to the people behind much of Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects, I was hooked.  I had already contributed quite a bit to Wikipedia, and I had started my own wiki, but now I wanted to do more.  I wanted to write a wikibook.  So that's what I'm doing.

[[image:Wikimania_2006_banner.png|thumb|left|[http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org Wikimania 2006]]]I don't know what the &quot;finished product&quot; will look like, or even if it will ever be considered finished enough to warrant a printable version (like some of the other wikibooks on this wiki).  This is a wikibook, after all, so it will always be a work in progress.  But if my effort to get this wikibook started helps just a few people learn about a profession I once called my own (and still do to some extent), then I think the effort will be worth it.

== How can I contribute to this Wikibook? ==

That's easy.  Click on the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top of any page and add, change, correct, delete or update as much (or as little) as you like.  You don't even have to be a registered user to do so.  But if you are going to be making some major contributions, it would be nice to know at least a little bit about you.  Please consider registering for an account if you don't already have one, and log in as that user when you edit so that everyone can see what you did.  No need to be bashful.

Comments and suggestions are also welcome.  If you have something you would like to say about something in this wikibook, consider posting a comment.  Every page has its own &quot;talk page,&quot; a place to discuss what's on the module page.  Just click on the discussion tab at the top of any page to see what, if anything, has been added to the talk page.  To add something to the discussion, just click the &quot;+&quot; tab that appears near the top of the talk page.  If you are logged in, and would like to sign your comment, you can do so easily by putting three tilde characters (~) after what you've written (or four tilde characters if you also want to include a time stamp).

By the way, this use of tilde characters to add your signature is an example of using [[w:wikitext]].  It's easy to learn, but you don't need to know it to contribute.  Still, if you want to learn just a little wikitext, a good place to start is with the [[w:Wikipedia:Quick Guide]].

Also consider adding your name to the contributors section below.

== Who is contributing to this Wikibook? ==

This Wikibook was started on August 13, 2006, by [[user:pthompsen|Philip A. Thompsen, Ph.D.]]  Dr. Thompsen has taught broadcast performance classes at the university level for over two decades.  Prior to his academic career, he worked as a professional broadcast announcer.  You can read more about him at his [[user:pthompsen|user profile page]].

If you contribute to this wikibook, please consider adding a brief biographic sketch on the [[Announcing/Contributors|contributors]] page.  

It is hoped that over time, a growing number of professional announcers will contribute to the development of this wikibook.  If you are reading this, and would like to help but don't know where to start, please look at this list of [[Announcing/Wanted Modules|wanted modules]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Integrated Circuits''', also called '''ICs''' or informally, &quot;microchips&quot; or just &quot;chips&quot;, are miniature electronic circuits built onto a single (very small) piece of silicon embedded in a package that allows it to be connected to a cicuit. They can fulfill many functions, ranging from simple [[Practical_Electronics/Logic|logic gates]] and other simple devices such as [[Practical_Electronics/Counter|counters]] and [[Practical_Electronics/Shift Register|shift registers]], to computer processors.

Any device built on a single &quot;chip&quot; of silicon is said to be &quot;monolithic&quot;, from the Greek for &quot;single stone&quot;.

==Advantages of ICs==

When ICs were introduced, they represented a revolutionary paradigm shift in the construction of electronic device. Rather than everything having to be made from basic components, certain standard modules could be plugged in in the form of a &quot;microchip&quot;.

This reduces cost (a simple IC of the kind used in this Wikibook costs between 10p and £1), as opposed to the equivalent cost of potentially upwards of tens, or more likely, hundreds, of discrete components.

Also, as the devices are highly miniaturised, they take up less space, use less power, and operate faster with less noise, due to the components inside being very close together.

Modern ICs can fit up to 1,000,000 transitors onto a piece of silicon with an area of 1mm².

==Form of an IC==

All ICs have the same basic parts. At the heart of the IC is the '''die'''. This is the piece of silicon that the circuit is built on. It is generally smaller than 1mm on a side and is usually located in the geometric centre of the device.

The die is connected by fine wires (generally 20&amp;mu;m or thinner) to the '''pins'''. Pins are metal protrusions that are used to make contact with the outside circuitry. Pins usually take to form of the &quot;legs&quot; seen sticking out from the sides on most common microchips. Pins can also be vertical pins or tiny solder balls on the bottom surface of the IC.

The dies and the pins are set into the '''carrier'''. This is the body of the IC and is generally made of plastic or ceramic. To orientate the device, a notch, dot, or cut-off corner is usually included on the carrier.

For more information on IC package designs, see [[Practical_Electronics/Packages#ICs|&quot;Practical Electronics Packages&quot;]] and [http://howto.wikia.com/wiki/Howto_identify_integrated_circuit%28IC%29_chip_packages &quot;Howto identify integrated circuit(IC) chip packages&quot;].

==Scales of Integration==

The number of transistors in an IC determines the '''scale of integration''' of the IC. The higher the scale, the more complex the IC. The table below shows a rough outline of the division between scales. Bear in mind that there is no hard-and-fast rule governing the naming of the scales, and as semiconductor technology grows, the number of transistors seen as &quot;very large&quot; today will seem small.

{| class=wikitable
!colspan=2|Scale of Integration!!Number of Transistors!!Example
|-
|SSI||Small-Scale Integration||10+||[[Practical_Electronics/555|555 Timer]]
|-
|MSI||Medium-Scale Integration||100+||
|-
|LSI||Large-Scale Integration||10,000+||
|-
|VLSI||Very Large-Scale Integration||100,000+||Computer processor
|-
|ULSI||Ultra Large-Scale Integration
|colspan=2|Used to describe ICs with a significantly larger number of transistors than common at the time.
|-
|WSI||Wafer-Scale Integration
|colspan=2|ICs that use the entire silicon wafer (over 300mm in diameter). These would contain billions of transistors, but are genrellar viewed as being inpractical and have not been widely pursued by IC manufacturers.
|}

==Logic families==

The layout of the components in ICs has changed dramatically since ICs were first introduced. As more modern processes have allowed smaller and more precise components to be etched in the die, different kinds of electronics could be used, resulting in continuously changing and improving performance from the ICs. Below is a very brief summmary of the main IC families. For more information on the specifics of each family, visit the linked pages.

The earliest ICs used resistors and transistors, in a form called '''[[Practical_Electronics/ICs/RTL|resistor-transistor logic]]''' (RTL). This was very prone to noise with more than three inputs, and as such was only suitable for very small-scale devices.

Next came '''[[Practical_Electronics/ICs/DTL|diode-transistor logic]]''' (DTL). This used diodes to supplement the resistors used in RTL, but still suffered many problems, including a very long propagation delay (the time taken to change state).

'''[[Practical_Electronics/ICs/TTL|Transistor-transistor logic]]''' (TTL) was a very popular format for ICs and is still in use in places today. This basically uses only transistors to fulfil its function.

Most ICs today are '''[[Practical_Electronics/ICs/CMOS|CMOS]]''' which have a very low [[Practical Electronics/Glossary#quiescent current|quiescent current]] usage, high noise immunity, and flexible voltage supply requirements.

Other families include '''[[Practical_Electronics/ICs/ECL|Emitter-coupled logic]]''' (ECL) and '''[[Practical_Electronics/ICs/I2L|Integrated Injection logic]]''' (I2L).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== tuples and types ==

Up to this point, the reader has encountered tuples and some basic motivation for types.  Seems like we need to make the connection between tuples and what we're doing here, something along the lines of &quot;well, you already know how to make your own types; just combine things with lists and tuples; but it's still not very convenient... sometimes you want to name a type; and sometimes you have two things that look like they're the same, but for some reason or another, you want to enforce that they are of different types.&quot;  We could start off with type synonyms, actually, just make synonyms for tuples... and eventually discover that it's not quite good enough.  Then data... and then flip back and point out that synonyms can also be used on data. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 03:15, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:This was the first section that I don't feel very comfortable with. Your comment helped actually. I didn't start to realize the possible usefulness of creating your own Types until I was well into the section. I am also a little confused by constructor functions. I see now how they can be used but I feel like I'm missing the bigger picture or the logic behind some of the syntax.--[[User:Jberryman|Jberryman]] ([[User talk:Jberryman|talk]]) 02:15, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

::In the spirit of these commentaries I wrote a brief introduction. Ideally it should be a natural follow-up to the introduction of [[Haskell/Type basics]] - I even considered referring directly to the phone book example, but it would get too verbose. Also, it is maybe a little too abstract... The ideal approach would likely be a didactic step-by-step example as Kowey suggested above, but given my lack of Haskell experience I didn't feel compelled to try pulling that off.

::By the way, I believe it would be good to swap this sub-chapter with the Simple IO one. Not only because this topic is a natural continuation of Type basics, but also because having this comparatively short section at the end of the chapter and placed after the long and conceptually tricky introduction to actions makes it easy for readers to miss the point due to lack of context. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 05:50, 29 April 2010 (UTC)

:::Concerning the oder of chapters, I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to put the Simple IO after the type declarations. How about the following:
:::At the moment, the wikibook is still kinda messy. In particular, the structure behind the division of the beginner's track into four separate parts is not clear (except for the monads, those are clear). Ideally, however, I envision the following structure:
:::Part 1 - &quot;Minimal Haskell&quot;, enables the reader to ''write'' Haskell programs, in the sense that he can encode any functionality he dreams of in Haskell, albeit restricted to a subset of the syntax.
:::Part 2 - &quot;Elementary Haskell&quot;, enables the reader to ''read'' most Haskell programs and write better ones.
:::Part 3 - &quot;Haskell with Class&quot;, enables the reader to ''write Haskell libraries'', using modules, type classes and so on.
:::Part 4 - Monads

:::From this, it follows that the type declarations should go into part 2 and only type synonyms should be mentioned in part 1. Simple IO has to stay in part 1, though, because it's clearly required for doing IO stuff.

I was just wondering why this doesn't work:

=== Answer ===

Well, one thing is as the compiler complains: you can't have multiple declarations of the same type using the same constructor, so this is bad:
 data MyWonderfulType = Bar Int | Bar Char -- bad: too many Bars
Whereas this is ok
 data MyWonderfulType = Foo Int | Bar Char

Note incidentally that this too is bad...
 data MyNiceType  = Foo
 data MyOtherType = Foo -- too many Foos

The basic intuition for this is that when you say &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; in some piece of code, not the type declaration itself, but simply trying to use &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, you want the Haskell compiler to know what you're talking about.  In the case above, we have an ambiguity... was that a &lt;code&gt;MyNiceType&lt;/code&gt; you wanted or a &lt;code&gt;MyOtherType&lt;/code&gt;?

The other issue is simply a question of syntax, in that a type declaration looks like this...
 data MyType = Constructor TypeArg1 TypeArg2 ... TypeArgN
where TypeArg1..TypeArgN are themselves types.  (Incidentally, it's ok if the constructor and the type have the same name)

The implications being that a type like the below...

 data Palindrome = A Palindrome A

You've got a constructor &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, followed by arguments &lt;code&gt;Palindrome&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.  That's all well and good, except that
# It's probably not what you had in mind
# ... The type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; isn't defined anywhere else in your code

Here's something which would probably work better

 data A = A
 data B = B
 
 data Palindrome = P1 A Palindrome A | P2 B Palindrome B | P3 A A

Note how I give a constructor (P1...P3) for each alternative in the CFG, and that each constructor is different (can't have multiple declarations, remember?  Now, you might be tempted to do something like this...
 
 -- not going to work
 data Alphabet = A | B | C
 data Palindrome = P1 A Palindrome A | P2 B Palindrome B | P3 A A

Because what comes after the constructor has to be a type, whereas, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; in this case, is NOT a type (&lt;code&gt;Alphabet&lt;/code&gt; is a type, as is &lt;code&gt;Palindrome&lt;/code&gt;).   You could try something like this:
 
 data Alphabet = A | B | C
 data Palindrome = P1 Alphabet Palindrome Alphabet | P3 Alphabet Alphabet

But then we'd no longer be dealing with a CFG, would we?

Hope this helps.  For more questions, please try the haskell mailing list (or perhaps haskell-cafe), or the #haskell IRC channel on irc.freenode.net -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

== newtype ==

 data X = Y Char
 newtype X' = Y' Char

X' has 257 possible values while X has 258.

== showAnniversary ==

showAnniversary didn't work the way the text is implying it should have (I think). I got the impression it should somehow magically tie in with show, so you could just type &lt;code&gt;show smithWedding&lt;/code&gt;. But instead you have to type showAnniversary smithWedding. I find this chapter a tad confusing.... [[Special:Contributions/24.65.49.167|24.65.49.167]] ([[User talk:24.65.49.167|talk]]) 04:36, 20 March 2008 (UTC) (aka [[user:Bawolff]])

:Well, you absolutely could. Just add a &lt;haskell&gt;deriving (Show)&lt;/haskell&gt; clause to the data declaration, and it'll work like you expect.
:But the problem is, that requires two advanced ideas: typeclasses, and instance derivation. And I'm pretty sure those topics don't get covered for a while yet. Having the reader work through things the hard way serves the useful purpose of demonstrating the drudgery we can automate and abstract away later. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]]
:As a C/C++ programmer trying to learn elementary Haskell, I have to agree with the original poster. Just because it's too early to teach classes and derivation in general doesn't mean you can't use them in this case to aid this tutorial. K&amp;R doesn't have a problem with showing how to print literal text with printf() even though the concepts of how to really take advantage of or write your own printf()-style function don't come until much later. At the very least, mentioning this issue and giving a pointer toward the later subject that provides the solution would be useful.

:: It's not exactly relevant to answer messages from two years ago, but I felt like commenting anyway. I would rather strongly disagree with the &quot;C/C++ programmer&quot; above in that I can't see how mentioning deriving (Show) at this very early stage could aid the tutorial. One of the key roles of this module is introducing constructor functions in an easy to understand way for an absolute newbie - and, as far as that purpose is concerned, the less distracting syntactic sugar and advanced functionality the better. In fact, I would even consider moving the discussion about type synonyms to some other place... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 06:35, 2 May 2010 (UTC)

== Additional exercise... ==

I think the following exercise would be good to be added:

Define the following 

&lt;code&gt;myBool=True
data Test1=True|False

Question: 
# Why does the compiler complain in myBool about ''Ambiguous occurrence `True''' ?
# How would an appropriate definition of ''myBool'' look like?
# How would an appropriate definition of ''Test1'' look like?
&lt;/code&gt;

I could add it by myself, but I am not really sure about the proper answers. My guess would be:

# The values True and False are already bound to the data structure &lt;code&gt;Bool = True|False&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore a second bind of the same (True resp. False) lets the compiler question which True it should take, either from the Prelude or the newly defined.
# no real clue
# I think it could look like &lt;code&gt;data Test1=Bool&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;data Test1 = Test1 Bool&lt;/code&gt; . But to be honest, I have no clue, what the difference between the two definition is.</text>

== PDF version vs wikimarkup version ==

The PDF version of this document seems to be fairly poorly typeset, which is kind of ironic for a book on book design.  It also contains sections whose pages linked from the main module don't seem to exist anymore.  Why is the former true, and how did the latter inconsistencies come to exist?  --[[User:Drake Wilson|Drake Wilson]] 03:41, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

== The Chicago Manual Of Style ==

The text seems to constantly refer to The Chicago Manual Of Style which is worrying. Is the author around to verify that this book hasn't just been cribbed from The Chicago Manual Of Style. Is there anyway to check that there isn't a copyvio. -[[User:Axon|Axon]] 18:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:References to books aren't copyright violations. The wiki websites generally encourage referencing articles.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 18:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

::That isn't what I asked: references aren't copyvio, but the content of the book bears close resemblance to the content of The Chicago Manual Of Style, both dealing with written style. How exactly did you go about writing this? Did you crib at all from the Chicago Manual of Style? If so, by how much? For example, you sentence here:
:::''Question marks and exclamation marks go inside or outside quotations, depending on whether the quoted text used the punctuation mark.''
::Bears close resemblance to this sentence :
:::''Question marks and exclamation marks go inside or outside quotation marks, depending on their use in the sentence.''[http://www.cobb.k12.ga.us/~schoolimprovement/curriculum/langarts/ResearchGuide/quotations.html]
::Similarly, a google for your sentence ''&quot;always put periods and commas inside quotation marks&quot;'' returns quiet a few hits[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22always+put+periods+and+commas+inside+quotation+marks%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official].

Can we change the title from &lt;i&gt;Basic Book Design&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Book Design&lt;/i&gt;? The latter fits in the style of naming other wikibooks by their subject matter only.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 19:04, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Normal Force==

Why is it that we stay steady in our chairs when we sit down? According to the first law of motion, if an object is translationally in equilibrium (velocity is constant), the sum of all the forces acting on the object must be equal to zero.  For a person sitting on a chair, it can thus be postulated that a '''normal force''' is present balancing the '''gravitational force''' that pulls the sitting person down.  However, it should be noted that only some of the normal force can cancel the other forces to zero like in the case of a sitting person. In Physics, the term '''normal''' as a modifier of the '''force''' implies that this force is acting perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact of the two objects in question.  Imagine a person leaning on a vertical wall.  Since the person does not stumble or fall, he/she must be in equilibrium. Thus, the component of his/her weight along the horizontal is balanced or countered (opposite direction) by an equal amount of force -- this force is the ''normal force'' on the wall. So, on a slope, the normal force would not point upwards as on a horizontal surface but rather perpendicular to the slope surface.

The normal force can be provided by any one of the four fundamental forces, but is typically provided by electromagnetism since microscopically, it is the repulsion of electrons that enables interaction between surfaces of matter.  There is no easy way to calculate the normal force, other than by assuming first that there is a normal force acting on a body in contact with a surface (direction perpendicular to the surface).  If the object is not accelerating (for the case of uniform circular motion, the object is accelerating) then somehow, the magnitude of the normal force can be solved.  In most cases, the magnitude of the normal force can be solved together with other unknowns in a given problem.

Sometimes, the problem does not warrant the knowledge of the normal force(s).  It is in this regard that other formalisms (e.g. Lagrange method of undetermined coefficients) can be used to eventually ''solve'' the physical problem.

==Friction==

When there is relative motion between two surfaces, there is a resistance to the motion.  This force is called friction.  Friction is the reason why people may have trouble accepting Newton's first law of Motion, that an object tends to keep its state of motion. Friction acts opposite to the direction of the original force '''The frictional force''' is equal to the '''frictional coefficient''' times the '''normal force'''

Friction is caused due to attractive forces between the molecules near the surfaces of the objects. If two steel plates are made really flat and polished and cleaned and made to touch in a vacuum, it bonds together. It would look as if the steel was just one piece.The bonds are formed as in a normal steel piece. This is called cold welding. And this&lt;!-- cold welding? --&gt; is the main cause of friction.&lt;!-- Should be rewritten. --&gt;

The above equation is an empirical one — in general, the frictional coefficient is not constant.  However, for a large variety of contact surfaces, there is a well characterized value.  This kind of friction is called Coulomb friction.  There is a separate coefficient for both static and kinetic friction.  This is because once an object is pushed on, it will suddenly jerk once you apply enough force and it begins to move.

Also, the frictional coefficient varies greatly depending on what two substances are in contact, and the temperature and smoothness of the two substances.  For example, the frictional coefficients of glass on glass are very high.  When you have similar materials, in most cases you don't have Coulomb friction.

For '''static friction''', the force of friction actually increases proportionally to the force applied, keeping the body immobile.  Once, however, the force exceeds the maximum frictional force, the body will begin to move.  The maximum frictional force is calculated as follows:

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{F}_f\right| \leq \mu_s\left|\vec{N}\right|&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''The static frictional force''' is less than or equal to the '''coefficient of static friction''' times the '''normal force'''.  Once the frictional force equals the coefficient of static friction times the normal force, the object will break away and begin to move.

Once it is moving, the frictional force then obeys:

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{F}_f\right| = \mu_k\left|\vec{N}\right|&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''The kinetic frictional force''' is equal to the '''coefficient of kinetic friction''' times the '''normal force'''.  As stated before, this always opposes the direction of motion.

==Variables==

'''Normal force (N):''' The force on an object perpendicular to the surface it rests on utilized in order to account for the body's lack of movement. Units: newtons (N)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Force of friction (F&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;): ''' The force placed on a moving object opposite its direction of motion due to the inherent roughness of all surfaces. Units: newtons (N)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Coefficient of friction ('''&amp;mu;'''):''' The coefficient that determines the amount of friction.  This varies tremendously based on the surfaces in contact.  There are no units for the coefficient of either static or kinetic friction&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

It's important to note, that in real life we often have to deal with viscose and turbulent friction - they appear when you move the body through the matter. 

Viscose friction is proportional to velocity and takes place at approximately low speeds. Turbulent friction is proportional to &lt;math&gt;V^2&lt;/math&gt; and takes place at higher velocities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Federalist.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Title page of the first printing of the ''Federalist Papers'' (1788).]]
The '''Federalist Papers''' are a series of 85 articles arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution. They were first published serially from October 1787 to August 1788 in New York City newspapers. A compilation, called '''''The Federalist''''', was published in 1788. The Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation of the [[../Constitution/]], as they outline the philosophy and motivation of the proposed system of government. The authors of the Federalist Papers were not above using the opportunity to provide their own &quot;spin&quot; on certain provisions of the constitution to (i) influence the vote on ratification and (ii) influence future interpretations of the provisions in question.

The articles were written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, under the pseudonym &quot;Publius,&quot; in honor of Roman consul Publius Valerius Publicola. Madison is generally credited as the father of the Constitution and became the fourth President of the United States. Hamilton was an influential delegate at the Constitutional Convention, and later the first Secretary of the Treasury. John Jay would become the first Chief Justice of the United States. Hamilton penned the majority and Madison made several significant contributions to the series. Jay, who fell ill early in the project, wrote only five.

Federalist No. 10 and Federalist No. 51 are generally regarded as the most influential of the 85 articles; 10 advocates for a large, strong republic and includes discussion on factions, 51 explains the need for separation of powers. Federalist No. 84 is also notable for its opposition to what later became the [[../Bill of Rights/]].

==Origins==
The [[../Constitution/]] was sent to the states for ratification in late September 1787. Immediately, it was the target of a substantial number of articles and public letters written by Anti-Federalists and other opponents of the Constitution. For instance, the important Anti-Federalist authors &quot;Cato&quot; and &quot;Brutus&quot; debuted in New York papers on September 27 and October 18, respectively. Hamilton began the Federalist Papers project as a response to the opponents of ratification, a response that would explain the new Constitution to the residents of New York and persuade them to ratify it. He wrote in Federalist No. 1 that the series would &quot;endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.&quot;

Hamilton recruited collaborators for the project. He enlisted Jay, who fell ill and was unable to contribute much to the series. Madison, in New York as a delegate to the Congress, was recruited by Hamilton and Jay and became Hamilton's major collaborator. 

Hamilton also chose &quot;Publius&quot; as the pseudonym under which the series would be written. While many other pieces representing both sides of the constitutional debate were written under Roman names, Albert Furtwangler contends that &quot;'Publius' was a cut above 'Caesar' or 'Brutus' or even 'Cato.' Publius Valerius was not a late defender of the republic but one of its founders. His more famous name, Publicola, meant 'friend of the people.'&quot; It was not the first time Hamilton had used this pseudonym: in 1778, he had applied it to three letters attacking Samuel Chase, an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

==Publication==
The Federalist Papers initially appeared in three New York newspapers: the ''Independent Journal'', the ''New-York Packet'' and the ''Daily Advertiser'', beginning on October 27, 1787. Between them, Hamilton, Madison and Jay kept up a rapid pace, with at times three or four new essays by Publius appearing in the papers in a week. Hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essay in newspapers outside New York state, and indeed they were published in a number of other states where the ratification debate was taking place.

The high demand for the essays led to their publication in a more permanent form. On January 1, 1788, the New York publishing firm J. &amp; A. McLean announced that they would publish the first thirty-six essays as a bound volume; that volume was released on March 2 and was titled ''The Federalist''. (Its title page appears at the top right of the article.) New essays continued to appear in the newspapers; Federalist No. 77 was the last number to first appear in that form, on April 2. A second bound volume containing the last forty-nine essays was released on May 28. The remaining eight papers were later published in the newspapers as well.

A number of later publications are worth noting. A 1792 French edition ended the collective anonymity of Publius, announcing that the work had been written by &quot;MM Hamilton, Maddisson E Gay,&quot; citizens of the State of New York. In 1802 George Hopkins published an American edition that similarly named the authors. Hopkins wished as well that &quot;the name of the writer should be prefixed to each number,&quot; but at this point Hamilton insisted that this was not to be, and the division of the essays between the three authors remained a secret.

The first publication to divide the papers in such a way was an 1810 edition that used a list provided by Hamilton to associate the authors with their numbers; this edition appeared as two volumes of the compiled &quot;Works of Hamilton.&quot; In 1818, Jacob Gideon published a new edition with a new listing of authors, based on a list provided by Madison. The difference between Hamilton's list and Madison's form the basis for a dispute over the authorship of a dozen of the essays.

[[Image:JamesMadison.jpg|200px|thumb|James Madison, Hamilton's major collaborator, later President of the United States, &quot;Father of the [[../Constitution/]]&quot; and first author of the [[../Bill of Rights/]]]]
==The disputed essays==
The authorship of seventy-three of the ''Federalist'' essays is fairly certain. Twelve are disputed, though some newer evidence suggests Madison as the author. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.

Madison did not immediately dispute Hamilton's list, but provided his own list for the 1818 Gideon edition of ''The Federalist''. Madison claimed twenty-nine numbers for himself, and he suggested that the difference between the two lists was &quot;owing doubtless to the hurry in which [Hamilton's] memorandum was made out.&quot; A known error in Hamilton's list—Hamilton incorrectly ascribed No. 54 to Jay, when in fact Jay wrote No. 64—has provided some evidence for Madison's suggestion.

Statistical analysis has been undertaken a number of times to try to decide based on word frequencies and writing styles, and nearly all of the statistical studies show that all twelve disputed papers were written by Madison.

==Structure and form==
In Federalist No. 1, which served as the introduction to the series, Hamilton listed six topics to be covered in the subsequent articles:

#&quot;The utility of the UNION to your political prosperity&quot; – covered in No. 2 through No. 14 
# &quot;The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union&quot;—covered in No. 15 through No. 22 
# &quot;The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object&quot;—covered in No. 23 through No. 36 
# &quot;The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government&quot;—covered in No. 37 through No. 84 
# &quot;Its analogy to your own state constitution&quot;—covered in No. 85 
# &quot;The additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to prosperity&quot;—covered in No. 85. 

Furtwangler notes that as the series grew, this plan was somewhat changed. The fourth topic expanded into detailed coverage of the individual articles of the Constitution and the institutions it mandated, while the two last topics were merely touched on in the last essay.

==Judicial use and interpretation==
Federal judges frequently use the Federalist Papers when interpreting the [[../Constitution/]] as a contemporary account of the intentions of the framers and ratifiers. However, the amount of deference that should be given to the Federalist Papers in constitutional interpretation has always been somewhat controversial. As early as 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall said about the Federalist Papers that &quot;the opinions expressed by the authors of that work have been justly supposed to be entitled to great respect in expounding the Constitution. No tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit; but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government, a right to judge of their correctness must be retained.&quot;

==Opposition to the Bill of Rights==
The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are remarkable for their opposition to what later became the [[../Bill of Rights/]]. The idea of adding a bill of rights to the constitution was originally controversial because the constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or protect the rights of the people. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.

However, Hamilton's opposition to the Bill of Rights was far from universal. ''Brutus'', articulated this view point in the so-called [[w:Anti-Federalist Papers|Anti-Federalist]] No. 84, asserting that a government unrestrained by such a bill could easily devolve into tyranny. Other supporters of the Bill argued that a list of rights would not and should not be interpreted as exhaustive; i.e., that these rights were examples of important rights that people had, but that people had other rights as well. People in this school of thought were confident that the judiciary would interpret these rights in an expansive fashion.

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]|}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Mandrake''''' is an unremarkable-looking tufty sort of plant that is purple and green in color. When dug up, its root has the shape of a human being.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''''Mandrake''''' or Mandragora is a powerful restorative and is a vital component in restorative potions; as a result, it is necessary in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], where it is used to brew a potion that is used to restore those who have been attacked by the monster of the Chamber. The cry of the uprooted Mandrake will kill; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] class is repotting them on his first day back in year 2, but these are very young, almost infant mandrakes (their roots look like wrinkled and ugly babies), and their cry will only knock you out for a couple of hours.

== Analysis ==

In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', a potion based on mandrakes is used to restore those attacked by the Monster of the Chamber. As in many other places in the series, it becomes apparent that the preparation of potions takes time. In this case, before the victims can be restored, so that they can identify the monster, we must wait for the mandrakes to become mature; conveniently, they do so immediately after Harry has vanquished the monster. In this case, the delay in their maturing is used to force Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to come up with the solution to the puzzle of the nature and location of monster and the Chamber, with only extremely limited help from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]. 

Mandrakes appear again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] carrying the potted plants up to the battlements during the preparations for the Battle at Hogwarts. Apparently, they will be cast down upon the attackers, and the cry of the exposed mandrake roots will incapacitate the attacking Death Eaters.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], the author devised humorous descriptions of the maturation steps of the mandrake plants. The phases of plant maturity were analogous to the development of human children.  First the plants were described as becoming &quot;moody and secretive&quot; confirming they had reached adolescence.  Next the mandrakes started throwing loud parties indicating their teenage phase.  Finally the mandrakes were known to be fully matured when they started moving into each others' pots.

== Overview ==

The '''''Venomous Tentacula''''' is a dark red and spiky plant that has long feelers that can reach out and capture prey. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] cautions her second year class, &quot;Watch out for the venomous tentacula, it's teething.&quot; (Note that in some British / Canadian editions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets/Chapter_6|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], this is misspelled '''Venemous Tentacula'''.)

We never find out much about this plant. Professor Sprout knocks its tentacles away in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. It is commented that people are allowed to swear loudly (in contrast to the silent spell-casting being required for all other courses) in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] if the Tentacula attacks them. During the final battle near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] brings in a Tentacula that grabs a Death Eater and starts reeling him in.

We do see its seeds: small, shriveled black pods that make a faint rattling noise even when they are completely stationary. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] need these for their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Skiving Snackboxes]], but they have to get them from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], because they are a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! I'm glad to see you here. I've been busy the last few days, and haven't worked further on your project (or any other projects around here, for that matter). I apologize for that. I forget where we are with your book project, exactly. Do you like what you see so far? do you need any changes made? Let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:16, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

:There are no ways to import images directly from wikipedia. Unfortunately, images can be used here only if they are uploaded to wikibooks directly, or if they are on commons. Fair use images are acceptable, but it's a touchy subject (and they could be banned in the future). Wikibooks syntax can be a little confusing, but there is a tutorial to be found at [[Help:Contents]]. The tutorial isn't 100%, but it should answer most of your questions. As the original author, you really can go about making any changes to the text or formatting you want, and there shouldnt be a problem. Wikibookians are encouraged to '''be bold''' in making edits and changes that benefit the project. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

::Fair-use text, so long as it is properly cited, should not be a problem. I can't guarantee that, however. I'll ask around and see if i can find an answer for you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:50, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

== Decision Theory ==

Did you mean to load that to two separate spots? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:07, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

:No. I don't yet have the syntax down on how to fully describe linked sites. I was looking for a Decision Theory page as part of the Self Interest and Social Behavior wiki. From Whiteknight's reference to another chapter where this is also wanted, that seems to be a page called Self Interest and Social Behavior/Decision Theory. Is that &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Decision Theory/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? (I didn't have the slashes before.)

::You mean for leaving a link from another page? Yes.
::You mean something else? Dunno. :) 
::I'll mark the other (non-subpage) one for speecy deletion if it's not what you meant to make (or you can yourself using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Delete|REASON}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Handbook is intended to allow the reader to be able to learn the Mediawiki software well enough to make tweaks in the core software (or add extensions) which can either be added (committed) to the main branch of the code (if accepted by the development team) or simply used behind the scenes in one's own code. 

It seeks to provide a more detailed guide to its structure than the overview file (help.doc) which is included with the software provides and discuss variables, etc. not covered in the PHPDocumentator automated documentation available elsewhere online (I don't see any way that it lists all variables used--that would be a nice enhancement to the Documentor software itself). There is likely much relevant documentation already at Mediawiki sites (e.g., at http://meta.wikimedia.org/ ) but none which really can provide a tutorial for learning how to follow the flow of the code in detail (and to use this to enhance, extend, etc. the software).

      <comment>organic info for USA and PA legal juristictions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">*I think Organic farming practices are the most appropriate for this section. --MJBT 09:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
::In the USA, the term &quot;organic&quot; can only be used for produce grown in compliance with the Organic Food Production Act of 1990. You can read it at http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/NOPhome.html (click on the Act for the pdf file). State governments authorize certain groups to grant organic certification, based on various criteria. Pennsylvania's group is http://www.paorganic.org/. Per their website, &quot;The United States Department of Agriculture requires that anyone who produces, processes or handles organic agricultural products must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifier in order to sell, label or represent their products as &quot;organic.&quot; To become certified, an organic producer, processor or handler must develop, implement and maintain an organic system plan.&quot;  The site hasn't been updated in two years, but I think it's still considered current. &quot;Organic&quot; in the USA means &quot;certified&quot; -- in which growers pay inspectors for certification. It's a bit of a racket. 
::Related, there's some debate about what should be allowed under the umbrella of &quot;organic&quot; farming. Chlorine is generally considered an acceptable chemical.  The use of natural acids such as vinegar for sterilization is not accepted because it hasn't been studied or isolated or whatever.
::I'm not sure what country you're from, but I thought I'd let you know that &quot;organic&quot; is a legally-defined term in the USA, controlled by political interests, not maybe what you might think it to be.  --[[User:65.78.214.189|65.78.214.189]] 01:32, 8 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To create a parser extension for a new tag just requires a few lines of code:
&lt;PRE&gt;
if( !defined( 'MEDIAWIKI' ) ) {
  die( &quot;This file is part of MediaWiki and is not a valid entry point\n&quot; );
  }

$wgExtensionFunctions[] = 'myNewTagInit';
$wgExtensionCredits['myNewTag'][]= array(
  'name'         =&gt; 'myNewTag Extension', 
  'version'      =&gt; '1.0.0', 
  'author'       =&gt; 'Your Name', 
  'url'          =&gt; 'http://www.your.com/mynewtag/', 
  'description'  =&gt; 'This extension is for demonstration only.');

function myNewTagInit() {
  global $wgParser;
  $wgParser-&gt;setHook( &quot;myNewTag&quot;, &quot;myNewTagParse&quot; );
  }
function myNewTagParse($content, $params, $parser ) {
  return &quot;My ''''fancy'''' output&quot;;
  }
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For testing create a subdirectory ''mediawikipath''/extensions/mynewtag. Save the coding there as myNewTag.php. Add the following line to LocalSettings.php:
&lt;PRE&gt;
require_once &quot;$IP/extensions/mynewtag/myNewTag.php&quot;;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Now create a new mediawiki page
&lt;PRE&gt;
&lt;mynewtag /&gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
and save it.

The output will look like this:&lt;BR /&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Devil's Snare''''' is an extremely dangerous plant that will strangle wizards when disturbed.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

A plant of the dark and dank, it reacts to heat and light by retreating. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are trapped in it, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Hermione remembers this sensitivity, and, when prompted by Ron, manages to create fire that makes the plant retreat.

Devil's Snare appears again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. Here, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] see a small specimen delivered as a gift to one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Broderick Bode]], a long-term spell-damage patient at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. Hermione later reads in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] that Bode, encouraged to tend this plant as part of his healing, had been strangled by it.

== Analysis ==

Given their previous experience of the plant, one must wonder why Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not recognize it when they saw it delivered to Bode. Harry does admit to being made uneasy by the potted plant's swaying tendrils. It is possible that they had simply been distracted by their encounter with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]].

{{Control Systems/Stub}}
There are some nonlinearities that happen so frequently in physical systems that they are called &quot;Common nonlinearities&quot;. These common nonlinearities include Hysteresis, Backlash, and Dead-zone.

== Hysteresis ==

Continuing with the example of a household thermostat, let's say that your thermostat is set at 70 degrees (Fahrenheit). The furnace turns on, and the house heats up to 70 degrees, and then the thermostat dutifully turns the furnace off again. However, there is still a large amount of residual heat left in the ducts, and the hot air from the vents on the ground may not all have risen up to the level of the thermostat. This means that after the furnace turns off, the house may continue to get hotter, maybe even to uncomfortable levels.

So the furnace turns off, the house heats up to 80 degrees, and then the air conditioner turns on. The temperature of the house cools down to 70 degrees again, and the A/C turns back off. However, the house continues to cool down, and then it gets too cold, and the furnace needs to turn back on.

As we can see from this example, a bang-bang controller, if poorly designed, can cause big problems, and it can waste lots of energy. To avoid this, we implement the idea of '''Hysteresis''', which is a set of threshold values that allow for overflow  outputs. Implementing hysteresis, our furnace now turns off when we get to 65 degrees, and the house slowly warms up to 75 degrees, and doesnt turn on the A/C unit. This is a far preferable solution.

== Backlash ==

Eg: Mechanical gear.

== Dead-Zone ==

A dead-zone is a kind of non linearity in which the system doesn't respond to the given input until the input reaches a particular level.

== Inverse Nonlinearities ==

=== Inverse Hysteresis ===

=== Inverse Backlash ===

=== Inverse Dead-Zone ===

'''Basil''' (''Ocimum basilicum'', family Lamiaceae) is also known as '''St. Joseph's Wort''' and '''Sweet Basil'''. It is a tender low-growing herb, originally native to tropical Asia. It grows to between 20–60 cm tall, with opposite, light green, silky leaves 1.5–5 cm long and 1–3 cm broad. It tastes somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, sweet smell. Basil is very sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. While most common varieties are treated as annuals, some are perennial, including African Blue and Holy Thai basil. 

The word ''basil'' comes from the Greek βασιλευς, meaning &quot;king&quot;, as it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' quotes speculations that basil may have been used in &quot;some royal unguent, bath, or medicine&quot;. Basil is still considered the &quot;king of herbs&quot; by many cookery authors. An alternative etymology has &quot;basil&quot; coming from the Latin word ''basilicus'', meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk, but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.

==Basil, the herb==
[[Image:Basilic-spice.jpg|thumb|left|Dried basil leaves.]]
Basil is most commonly recommended to be used fresh, and in cooked recipes, is generally added at the last moment, as cooking destroys the flavour quickly. The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. Place fresh leaves in a dry jar with a pinch of salt, and cover with olive oil. The dried herb also loses most of its flavour, and what little flavour remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavour, like hay. But because most Americans either lack the dedication or resources to maintain a supply of fresh herbs, the most common household use of basil in the US is through containers of dried basil purchased from stores.

Mediterranean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines frequently use basil, the former frequently combining it with tomato. Basil is one of the main ingredients in pesto &amp;mdash; a green Italian oil-and-herb sauce from the city of Genoa, its other two main ingredients being olive oil and pine nuts. The most commonly used Mediterranean basil cultivars are 'Genovese', 'Purple Ruffles', 'Mammoth', 'Cinnamon', 'Lemon', 'Globe', and 'African Blue'. Chinese cuisine also uses fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods. In Taiwan, people add fresh basil leaves into thick soups (羹湯; gēngtāng). They also eat fried chicken with deep-fried basil leaves.

Basil is sometimes used with fresh fruit and in fruit jams and sauces &amp;mdash; in particular with strawberries, but also raspberries or dark-colored plums. Arguably the flat-leaf basil used in Vietnamese cooking, which has a slightly different flavour, is more suitable for use with fruit.

[[Image:Basil seed drink.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A can of basil seed drink]]
When soaked in water the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous, and are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as falooda or sherbet. Such seeds are known variously as ''sabja'', ''subja'', ''takmaria'', ''tukmaria'', or ''falooda'' seeds. They are used for their medicinal properties in Ayurveda, the traditional medicinal system of India.

==Other basils==
Several other basils, including some other ''Ocimum'' species, are grown in many regions of Asia. Most of the Asian basils have a clove-like flavour that is generally stronger than the Mediterranean basils. In China, the local cultivar is called 九層塔 (''jiǔcéngtǎ''; literally &quot;nine-level pagoda&quot;), while the imported varieties are specifically called 羅勒 (''luólè'') or 巴西里 (''bāxīlǐ'').

Basil is also very popular in Thai cuisine, which uses cultivars of two different species: the type known in the west as Thai Basil, which is a cultivar of ''O. basilicum'', and Holy Basil (''Ocimum sanctum'').

'Lemon basil' has a strong lemony smell and flavour very different from those of other varieties, because it contains a chemical called citral. It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called ''kemangi'' and served raw, together with raw cabbage, green beans, and cucumber, as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, broken up, are a zesty salad condiment.

== Cultivation ==
Basil thrives in hot weather, but behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. In Northern Europe, the northern states of the U.S., and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a peat pot, then planted out in late spring/early summer (when there is little chance of a frost). It fares best in a well-drained sunny spot.

Although basil will grow best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a south-facing windowsill (in the Northern Hemisphere). It should be kept away from any draughts, and must be able to get plenty of sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or cloche is ideal if available. 

If its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location. Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant needs more sunlight or less fertilizer.

In sunnier climates such as Southern Europe, the southern states of the U.S., the North Island of New Zealand, and Australia, basil will thrive when planted outside. It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States, but dies out when temperatures reach the low thirties, to grow again the next year if it was allowed to go to seed. It will need regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates.

Basil can also be propagated very reliably from cuttings in exactly the same manner as &quot;Busy Lizzie&quot; (Impatiens), with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop.

Leaf production slows or stops on any stem which flowers, so you can pinch off any flower stems to keep the plant in production, or pinch off some stems while leaving others to bloom for decoration or seeds. Once you do let the plant flower, it will produce seed pods containing small black seeds which you can save and plant the following year. Picking the leaves off the plant helps &quot;promote growth&quot;, largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems.

May be we should change the explanantion of methane and ethane to a lower level, where these molecules are once again discussed. 
Also, indeed, alkanes are relatively useless.... One of their uses is in a cracking reactor; naphta (a mixture of alkanes distilled from crude oil) is literally cracked to give smaller unsaturated, more useful chemicals. [[User:131.174.15.158|131.174.15.158]] 13:14, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

==Preparation of Alkanes==
I am an undergraduate student studying University Sophomore Level Organic Chemistry. Just noticed that nowhere in alkanes was their preperation methods,like wurtz synthesis,kolbe's electrolysis,etc. mentioned. I would like to add these,but I dont know where?
If someone could start the section 'Prep of alkanes' I would like to contribute.
New here,hope I can help
-xC

:I just looked through two modern organic chemistry textbooks I have and neither reaction is covered. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be, but I think it should probably come later. We'll probably cover conversion of alkyl-halides to alkanes via Grignard reagent in the Haloalkanes section. But generally, alkanes are what you don't want. There's not a lot you can do (at least in a controlled, laboratory way) with them, so they're chemically uninteresting. I'm not dismissing the idea. I'll definitely consider it. And if nothing else, I think the fact that they're not very useful in the laboratory is worth mention as well. But I don't know that adding it this early would make much sense, especially since the reactants in those reactions are more advanced structures that haven't been discussed yet. Perhaps in the chapters where we cover those classes of reactants and their reactions, it would make sense. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 14:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

::Definitely. Wurtz Synthesis/Kolbe's Electrolysis do deserve mention, partly because they are mentioned in most places. :D Atleast, the more mechanisms we can demonstrate, the more easy it is for us to emphasize that all organic reactions happen in fragments of familiar steps.
---

==Definition of Organic==
I noticed that the module currently states that for a compound to be organic it must contain both carbon and hydrogen. I just want to point out that the whole concept of organic vs. inorganic arose from a misconception that it was impossible to synthesize &quot;organic&quot; compounds from inorganic ones. We now know this is untrue.  One example I can think of offhand is the photosynthesis of glucose, a reaction we probably learned in middle school, whereby water and carbon dioxide (both &quot;inorganic&quot;) are used to C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a simple sugar that is considered &quot;organic&quot; My point is that the definition of organic vs inorganic is somewhat artificial.  My other point is that a few compounds considered &quot;organic&quot; do not contain hydrogen, due to substitution by halogen atoms.  Carbon tetrachloride (or tetrachloromethane, if you prefer) comes to mind.  I don't know the best way to explain this in the text, I'm just trying to raise the issue.

:It all goes back to Wohler's 1828 synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate which demonstrated the organic molecules were nothing special. There's now a 'Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry' - what would the early chemists have made of that?!

:On the other hand, organic chemicals do have many common properties and reactions which are unusual for inorganic substances, so it makes sense to split chemistry on inorganic/organic lines.

:The definition of organic chemistry is muddled, but I usually tell students that all organic molecules contain carbon, but that a few carbon compounds are considered inorganic. (Carbon itself, carbonates, cyanide, cyanates, carbides, etc)

==1. Play or sing a scale and know its composition. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Music/Scales}}

==2. Write a scale in both treble and bass clef. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Music/Clefs}}
==3. Know a half-tone, a whole tone, a third, a fifth, and an octave. ==
A half tone is the same as a half step (1/12 of an octave). It is basically the distance of two notes immediately next to each other, such as C to C# and B to C.
A whole tone is the same as a whole step. It is the distance of two notes separated by another, such as C to D (C# is in between) and B to C# (C is in between).
A third is an interval of three degrees (C and E). 
A fifth is an interval of five degrees (C and G).
An octave is an interval of eight degrees--the same note eight notes higher or lower (Middle C and C).

==4. Distinguish a march from a waltz and give the time of each. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Music/March waltz}}
==5. What is a quarter note? A half note? A whole note? Draw the symbols of each. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Music/Note duration}}

The information provided in this section of the Instructional Technology Book is provided by students in the Master's of Education program at the University of Mary Washington. Students are in the Leadership in Educational Technology program and are working in conjunction with Dr. Teresa Coffman in the ITEC547 Special Topics course (Integrating Technology for Meaningful Learning) during the Fall 2008 semester. 


This chapter will investigate and explore the various theories and resources on technology tools and meaningful learning.  The course also created [http://technologymeaningful.wikispaces.com/ classroom activities] that explores the idea of technology and meaningful learning.

=What is meaningful learning?=
'''What is Meaningful Learning?'''

Meaningful learning occurs when complex ideas and information are combined with students’ own experiences and prior knowledge to form personal and unique understandings.  Learning is meaningful when the student comprehends the relationship of what is being learned to other knowledge.  


The main characteristics of meaningful learning are that it is active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative.


* '''Active''' – learning occurs through interactions with and manipulations of the environment
* '''Constructive''' – learning occurs when we reflect on our learning activities in order to assign meaning to them
* '''Intentional''' – learning occurs when students can identify the learning goals and are aware of their progress toward actively achieving the goals.
* '''Authentic''' – learning occurs when context-based, complex, and relative to real-life.
* '''Cooperative''' – learning occurs through working with others and participating in a learning community (Grabe &amp; Grabe, 2007). 


Meaningful learning can be recognized through the following indicators, which were presented by the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory (NCREL).  These indicators are useful as guidelines for planning new instructional activities and lessons and evaluating current instructional methods.  


* '''Vision''' – What does meaningful learning look like?  Classes of enthusiastic learners collaborating to solve problems and gain understanding.  Students responsible for their own learning, actively defining goals and evaluating their own progress.
* '''Tasks''' – Learning tasks are challenging, cross-curricular, and authentic.  Often problem-based, collaborative, and time intensive.
* '''Assessment''' – Assessment is ongoing, generative, and equitable for all learners.   Students are assessed through diverse performance-based methods which gauge what they know and can do with their knowledge.
* '''Instructional Models and Strategies''' – Instructional strategies are interactive and constructive and involve individual and group models of instruction.  Students are interacting with, teaching to, and learning from teachers and peers.
* '''Learning Context''' – The classroom is a learning community that values diversity, fosters empathy, and builds on strengths of each learner.  The learning community extends beyond the classroom to families, social communities, and corporate communities.
* '''Grouping''' – Students are collaborating in heterogeneous groups that are reconfigured as needed by the teacher to ensure equitable, learning-centered work.
* '''Teacher Roles''' – The teacher is acting as facilitator, guide, or co-learner. Through these roles the teacher is providing the learning environment for students, coaching students, and co-investigating with students. 
* '''Student Roles''' – The students are exploring, discovering, reflecting, teaching, and contributing within the learning environment.  Students are interacting with each other and the world, advancing from apprentices to teachers themselves through integrating their knowledge (Jones, B., Valdez, G., Nowakowski, J., &amp; Rasmussen,C., 1994, ¶ 2).


The NCREL provides several tools for planning meaningful lessons (http://www.ncrtec.org/pd/lwtres/laelt.pdf) and evaluating existing lessons (http://www.ncrtec.org/pd/lwtres/eawla.pdf).



“Children derive greater meaning in their school-based academic work from three sources.  First, when they are actively engaged in the attempt to make sense of things they experience in school, they are encouraged to be meaning makers.  Second, they derive meaning from seeing the relationship of parts to the whole, rather than being left with only parts.  Opportunities to connect one concept or one skill to another increase students’ conceptual grasp of what they are doing, whether it involves communication, problem solving, appreciation of artwork, or carrying out projects.  Third, they find meaning by connecting new learning experiences to their existing body of knowledge, assumptions, and meanings, much of which is rooted in their upbringing and cultural roots.  We refer to teaching that seeks to maximize these three things as ‘teaching for meaning’” (Knapp and Associates, 1995, ¶ 2)

'''Leadership in Technology:  IT Starts at the Top'''


Technology in education is becoming a way of life behind school walls.  One major factor to the success and growth of technology education at the elementary level is proficient training and support for teachers.  Georgia State University has designed such a program for the sole purpose of teacher training.  Due to the development of NETST or National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers, a significant number of pre-service teachers at universities like Georgia State University are beginning their teaching careers with strong educational technology backgrounds.    With recent changes in the school’s curriculum and financial assistance, Georgia State’s College of Education is developing teachers with the experience, knowledge and confidence necessary to integrate technology into their instruction in meaningful ways.  According to Weinburg, Collier &amp; Rivera (2003), the Department of Early Childhood Education (ECE) remains committed to producing teachers who are “technically and emotionally” prepared to incorporate a variety of technologies into the instruction of elementary classrooms.  School administrators credit the assistance of their ITC (Instructional Technology Center), skilled faculty and a team of educators who share the vision of integrating technology into everyday learning.  
 

    

'''Learning Old Things in New Ways'''

A significant reason why technology should be present in elementary schools is to allow for effective differentiation of instruction.  Depending on a student’s learning style, multi media is an excellent way of enabling elementary students to construct their learning and enjoy the overall learning experience.   German researchers, Zumbach, Kumpf and Koch (2004) conducted a case study on an elementary school in Germany that assessed the benefits of combining PBL with technology.  Using Micro Power Point, students worked in groups to tell, infer, predict the outcome of a story about a badger.  The students were found to be engaged and focused on the task at hand.  Audio, visual effects were used in this lesson and found to be very effective to the learning experience.  Pre and post assessments found the students to be able to recall details and facts more vividly and the students appeared to be more motivated. 
 

 

'''Quality ''And'' Equity in Education?

'''A Balanced Playing Field for All Students'''

Means (1997) claims that schools that capitalize on the relationship between technology and education reform will help students to develop higher order skills and to function effectively in the world beyond the classroom. Achieving such fundamental change, however, requires a transformation of not only the underlying pedagogy (basic assumptions about the teaching and learning process) but also the kinds of technology applications typically used in classrooms serving at-risk students.



'''The NSRC's Impact on Student Achievement'''

According to the National Science Resource Center (2002), a significant amount of research indicates that quality instructional materials such as the NSRC’s Science and Technology for Children (STC elementary curriculum) enhances student achievement. 
For example, Delaware school districts base their elementary science instructional program almost entirely on the NSRC’s elementary science curriculum, Science and Technology for Children (STC). About ninety percent of Delaware public school fourth graders and seventy-four percent of its sixth graders met or exceeded state science standards on the 2002 Delaware State Testing Program (DSTP). And although the scores of minority students still lagged behind those of white students, the gap was narrower for science than any other academic area. In nearly half of the eighty elementary schools tested, there was essentially no achievement gap between white and black fourth graders.
Virtually all Delaware school districts have attended an NSRC Elementary Science Strategic Planning Institute that prepared them to base their science programs on research and best practices.

==Middle==
Middle schoolers are a breed apart.  They are breaking away from their family’s mandates toward those of their peers’.  They fear the adult responsibilities which high schoolers are beginning to embrace, but, nonetheless, are curious about the adult world they see approaching.  “Be certain that school is not just a preparation for a future world but a place where one can truly practice what one is learning; …making technological connections with real people who are part of the country in the text — in other words, using what they are learning in class to do what adults do” (Baenen, 2006).  For learning to be meaningful then for middle schoolers, it must concentrate on being ‘authentic’ (or problem-based) and ‘cooperative.’

 According to the National Educational Technology Standards (NETS), middle schoolers are able to use practical computer applications, Web tools, graphing calculators, communication delivery systems, and are familiar with ethical issues surrounding computer use (Tileston, 2004, pp. 23-27).   Middle schoolers are ready to move on to using technology to develop critical thinking skills.  However, these require metacognition.  At a time when middle schoolers tend to project outwardly, longing to be part of a group, such an introverted activity may seem anathema.  However, middle schoolers are still in a stage of vacillation from introversion to extroversion and back again.  Therefore, it behooves educators to coax the reflective state in middle schoolers by requiring them to constantly monitor their progress.  “Reflection cements the knowledge that learners construct. (Jonassen, 2000, p. 99). 
  
 Just how can instructional technology (IT) enhance meaningful learning in the middle school?  “IT enables activities like videoconferencing so that students can talk with others who are physically, intellectually, and culturally distant from them.  The technology also enables classes in different communities to collaborate on science experiments, sharing data and results to enrich each other’s findings” (Pritchard, 2002, p. 41).  As long as lesson plans can be devised to make the experience feel real to middle schoolers, learning can be meaningful to them by requiring them to define, classify, compare, contrast, challenge assumptions, project, explain, and/or reason all in an atmosphere of cooperation.  “Working with technology can help students to reach the higher levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy, especially analysis, synthesis, and evaluation” (Tileston, p. 37).

==High School==
Technology can be used in many different ways to promote learning at the high school level. However, at any level, “students do not learn from technology, they learn from thinking” (Jonassen, Howland, Moore, &amp; Marra, 2003, p. 11). Teachers often use the same material from year to year making few changes each year. When incorporating technology teachers should keep in mind their overall objectives. If the technology does not support the objectives or it takes away from the lesson, then the teacher may want to rethink the use of technology.


“The skill and interest level in technology, as well as access to handhelds, laptops, and tablet computers, means students can – and want to- use technology (Jackson, 2005, ¶12). One way to integrate technology is through authentic assessments. A Webquest is an example of an authentic assessment. “Webquests are online, interactive modules that allow students to be involved in inquiry-oriented learning” and therefore leading to a more meaningful approach (Kundu &amp; Bain, 2006, ¶8). Depending on the type of Webquest, students are not limited to the normal resources. They can take virtual fieldtrips to learn the material through the Internet.


Whatever type of technology a teacher chooses, the technology “should be used as engagers and facilitators of thinking and knowledge construction” (Jonassen, et al, 2003, p. 12).

=Theories=

=== Behaviorism (VAl)===


==== '''Definition'''====

Behaviorism is a theory of animal and human learning that only focuses on objectively observable behaviors and discounts mental activities. Behavior theorists define learning as nothing more than the acquisition of a new behavior. (Funderstanding, 2001)

===='''Theorists and Effects to Education'''====
One of the best examples of behaviorism is the story of Pavlov’s dog.  In case you are not familiar I will summarize the story: Pavlov would ring a bell every time he fed his dog so after a while the dog expected to get food when he rang the bell. Pavlov slowly started reducing the amount of food the dog received when he rang the bell and eventually the food didn’t arrive when the bell rang. Another name for behaviorism would be conditioning. 


In the 1950’s and 1960’s behaviorism was a very popular style of teaching. Students that were using correct behavior were rewarded and students that were not acting properly were punished. B. F. Skinner was a well know psychologist known for his research on behaviorism. Skinner believed this is the reason that people and animals act the ways they do. Skinner stated that a student does not passively absorb knowledge from the world around him but must play an active role, and that the action is not simply talking” (Boerre, p.5). I think that most of us agree that the more active a role a student plays in the classroom the more they are learning. An active role can be accomplished by asking questions, presenting to the class, answering direct questions, and helping out fellow students are just a few of the ways. B.F. Skinner said, “A behavior followed by a reinforcing stimulus results in an increased probability of that behavior occurring in the future.”(Boerre, p.3) When students are successful they feel good about themselves and then become more active participants in their own education. 


Direct instruction is not a lecture approach but it is an instructional model that focuses on the interaction between teachers and students. (Magliaro, Lockee, &amp; Burton, 2005, p.1) Projects that require interaction among students are very powerful. They allow the students creativity and show them that what they are learning is valuable and worthwhile. Student projects that involve multimedia assets encourage this belief even more. The students learn to take pride in their work.

=== Constructivism ===
 Constructivist learning theory believes that the student must be able to build learning processes rather than just gain knowledge.  While the latter statement may be oversimplified, it is the driving force behind constructivist learning theory and stands in stark contrast to behaviorism theory.  Many theories on education and current research have “demonstrated the importance of social interaction in teaching and learning…and highlight the ‘knowledge construction’ processes of the learner and suggest that ‘meaning making’ develops through the social process of language use over time” (Ferdig &amp; Trammell, 2004).  This research reflects Vygotsky’s educational theory (1978) that social interaction plays a fundamental role in the development of cognition.  Per Vygotsky (1978), “Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological) and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to voluntary attention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the higher functions originate as actual relationships between individuals.&quot; (p57).  Students must be able to transform knowledge gained through social interaction into something meaningful to themselves.  
Central to constructivism is its conception of learning. Von Glasersfeld (1995) argues that: &quot;From the constructivist perspective, learning is not a stimulus-response phenomenon. It requires self-regulation and the building of conceptual structures through reflection and abstraction&quot; (p.14). Fosnot (1996) adds that &quot;Rather than behaviours or skills as the goal of instruction, concept development and deep understanding are the foci (...) (p.10). Research suggests that students who are more actively engaged in the learning experience will be more responsible for their education and will be have a sense of ownership over it.  “Technology can offer ways for students to establish personal and intellectual ownership of new concepts while they visualize and interact with abstract ideas” (Ferdig &amp;  Trammell, 2004).  Students can formulate introspective analysis on materials presented and can personalize the knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them. 




====Problem Based Learning ====

'''History''' 

For at least 100 years, educators such as John Dewey have stated the benefits of experiential, hands-on, student-directed learning (BIE, 2002). Problem-based learning, the term we know it as today, began at McMaster University Medical School (Canada) over 25 years ago.


'''What is Problem-based Learning?''' 
Problem-based learning is a total approach to education; a learner-centered educational method. It is based on real-world problems. Students are involved in active learning; the problems are real-world and are seen as important and relevant to their lives.  These problems are carefully designed and selected for the learner to help build critical knowledge, problem solving skills, self-directed learning strategies and teamwork skills.  The learners encounter a problem that they must solve.  They solve these problems first with information that they already possess and then they will need to fill in what they don’t already know.  Learners may turn to information resources such as books, journals, information found online, and interviews with experts.  They will have to identify what they need to learn to understand the problem and how they are going to resolve it.  Problem-based Learning prepares students to think critically and analytically.  It also teaches students to find and use appropriate learning resources. 


'''What is the Role of the teacher?'''
The teacher has a unique role in Problem-based Learning; they act as a facilitator, coach and/or tutor.  The teacher helps to guide the students in their problem solving efforts by providing materials, guidance and evaluation.  The teacher is the guide on the side, not the sage on the stage in Problem-based learning. 
 

'''What is the Role of the Student?'''
The students assume responsibility for their own learning.  This gives them ownership of their learning and also fosters motivation to learn and feelings of accomplishment.  This helps to promote independent learners who will continue to be lifelong learners.  The student will usually work in learning groups with  five to seven members.   These group members will work together to solve the problems and learn.  They, along the way, will gain collaborative or team learning skills.  After they have solved the problem they should assess themselves and their peers.  


'''What type of problems are best?'''
Real-world, complex problem act as a motivation or stimulus for learning.  A good problem is one that is ill-structured, messy and complex in nature; requires inquiry, information-gathering, and reflection; is changing and tentative; and has no simple, fixed, formulaic, &quot;right&quot; solution (Finkle &amp; Torp, 1995). These problems are used to engage students' curiosity and initiate learning. These problems are also designed to challenge learners to develop effective problem-solving and critical thinking skills.


==== Active Learning ====
'''What is Active Learning?''' 

Active learning is just what one might guess, a method of education where students are actively participating in their own learning.  Students are not passive in the classroom listening to lectures all of the time, but are reading, writing, discussing, or otherwise engaging themselves in solving problems (Bonwell and Eison, 1991, p.1).  To be fully active in their own learning, students must be using higher-order thinking skills, including the three highest levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.  Thus, active learning activities require students to actively participate, and most importantly to think (Bonwell, et. al., 1991, p.1).


'''History''' 

Active learning has been a strategy in education for as long as man has been around.  Long ago, hunters and gatherers used a watch and imitate strategy to teach their young to survive.  In his time, Socrates used what we now call the Socratic Method to get students to interact and discuss a problem to help them discover a solution.  More recently, many different philosophers have supported active learning.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Dewey, and David Kolb all argue that experiences, whether it be Rousseau’s sensory, Dewey’s practical, or Kolb’s concrete experiences, are an essential part of learning.  (Lorenzen, 2001, p.2)


'''What is the Role of the teacher?'''

Much like in problem-based learning, the teacher is no longer an authoritarian responsible for lecturing 100% of the time.  In active learning, the teacher is responsible for facilitating experiences that will allow students to participate in their own learning and discover new information (Lorenzen, 2001, p.1) on their own and with their classmates.


'''What is the Role of the Student? '''

The active learning approach to education is built around allowing students to master ideas while developing strong thinking skills.  In order for this to happen, students must be active participants in lessons and activities.  They must be able to follow directions and take initiative during each lesson in order to learn and develop their thinking skills.


'''What are some examples of active learning techniques?'''

* Small-group discussion
* Role playing
* Hands-on projects
* Teacher driven questioning  
::(Lorenzen, 2001, p. 10)
* Writing activities (Bonwell, et. al., 1991, p. 2)
* Debates
* Demonstrations
* Simulations 
::(McAndrews, 1991, p. 40)
* WebQuests (Grabe, et. al., 2007, p. 236)

====Inquiry Learning====

Inquiry is an approach to learning that involves exploration and discovery. Inquiry encourages students to ask questions, test hypotheses, and make conclusions all in search for new understandings.  This approach is similar to problem-based learning.  Instead of children listening to a teacher and repeating back information, they are actively involved in the learning process.  Inquiry is driven by a students curoisity and interest.  (National Science Foundation, 2000). 


'''Inquiry is defined as:'''

*  seeking or requesting truth, information, or knowledge  
*  investigating 
*  inquiring or  seeking information by questioning; interrogation. 
*  question and query (dictionary.com). 


From the above definition, we can get a broad understanding of the inquiry process.  Students can not simply sit in class and absorb information, they need to be involved in activities that help them to build understanding.  Inquiry learning stresses skills development. Students learn from their experiences and from asking questions. It is an open-ended and ongoing learning process that does not concentrate upon closure or on some important process, fact, principle, or law. “Inquiry means that teachers design situations so that pupils are caused to employ procedures research scientists use to recognize problems, to ask questions, to apply investigational procedures, and to provide consistent descriptions, predictions, and explanations which are compatible with shared experience of the physical world (Dettrick, n.d. ¶.1).”

----

==Yahoo! Groups – An interactive classroom website==

Teacher web pages have become a very popular tool that educators can use to increase communication with both parents and students and increase student achievement.  As Johnson (2000) notes, &quot;genuine, regular, real-time collaboration with parents can make a positive difference in a child’s learning experience.&quot; There are many sites, free and subscription, available to assist teachers in designing and maintaining webpages. 

==='''Free Teacher Webpages'''===

* Scholastic Homepage Builder
**  http://teacher.scholastic.com/homepagebuilder/
* School Notes
**http://schoolnotes.com/
* Your Homework
**http://www.yourhomework.com/ 
* Assign-a-Day
**http://assignaday.4teachers.org/ 


These websites have basic functions – posting syllabi and homework, teacher information, etc.  While these sites are great for beginners the functions are basic and do not allow room for creativity by the teacher or students or interactivity between teacher, student and parent.   
Instead of creating a teacher webpage, teachers can create an online learning community by starting a Yahoo! Groups Page.  On a group page students and parents can interact with each other and the teacher through a message board, create shared learning tools used the database feature or the file and photo share feature, share useful resources through the links feature and much more.

==='''Online Learning Community'''===

The Yahoo! Groups pages are a free resource that can be accessed at  http://groups.yahoo.com/ Anyone can register for a new group.  The groups can be open to the public or by invitation only.  Other controls include the ability to decide which members can post messages, approve or deny posted messages and control which features members can see.  There is also a blast e-mail feature to send emails to the whole group at one time.  These control features are important when designing a webpage for student use.


The Yahoo Groups page has many useful and interactive features.  The main feature of the webpage is a message board.  Depending on the page settings, anyone can post to the board to discuss any number of topics.  Grabe and Grabe (2007) note that computer mediated communication (CMC) has many advantages,


      CMC may encourage more productive discussion by increasing the number of active 
      student participants and extending the time available for discussion.  It can 
      help those who cannot think as quickly as others, may not be as proficient in 
      using the language, or may be apprehensive of sharing when in the physical presence
      of peers (Althaus, 1997).  Even for those who have no difficulty expressing 
      themselves in class, the writing activities involved in e-mail allow the time for
      reflection not available in a fast-paced classroom discussion.
                                                                              (2007, p. 188) 


Access to a message board opens up many opportunities for students to interact with each other and the teacher digitally.  Parents can even ask questions of the teacher on the message board.  If one parent has a question it is likely that other parents have the same question.
The “files” section gives users 20 MB of file storage.  This would be an ideal place to post a syllabus, class policies, notes from the previous week, etc.  This could also be used for document sharing.  For example, students could collaborate to produce a group paper by posting the shared paper to the Groups page and allowing each group member to download the paper, make changes and re-post the paper with the changes and a new file name with the draft number.  This would allow students to easily work collaboratively on the computer and track the update/revision process. 

 
The &quot;photos&quot; section, with 30 MB of storage, could be used to give parents a peek into the classroom by posting photos taken during the day, or a place for the teacher or students to post photos for use in an assignment.  There is a “links” section for posting live links to websites that accompany the class and also a “calendar” section for keeping track of project due dates and other important events.  Lastly, there is a “database” feature that keeps databases such as phone books, class assignment lists, inventories, a FAQ and more.  There is also a blank template which users can use to create their own database.  A teacher could use this database in conjunction with an assignment.  For example, students can collect information to put in the shared database.  Once collected, students can process information into reports, graphs, or other appropriate product. 


The greatest drawback to the Yahoo! Groups page is that an e-mail address is required for membership.  This would likely restrict use of the Yahoo! Groups to high school students or as a webpage for parents.  This is yet another good reason to advocate for a district-wide e-mail system for students in order that teachers and students have the opportunity to take advantage of an online learning community with Yahoo! Groups.


Gaggle.net is a FREE e-mail system for students which has e-mail, chat, message boards, wikis and blogs as well as a digital locker for on-line storage. Gaggle assists the teacher in monitoring student e-mails with very effective administrative tools. Any e-mail communication with inappropriate language, initials, or code words will automatically bounce into the administrator's inbox instead of delivered to the recipient. The teacher can also add words or slang that may be specific to your school or region that need to be blocked as inappropriate. The default can also be set up to limit student communications to students within the class, school or district. The only drawback to Gaggle is the FREE version has limited storage space and at times there are server issues, but this is a very robust tool for no charge.

== Making Power Point a Multimedia Tool ==
 

The Microsoft program Power Point is ubiquitous today.  Almost any meeting you go to, whether you are a teacher, doctor, or lawyer the presenter will be using Power Point to display the presentation.  But have you thought of using Power Point as more than a presentation tool in your classroom?  Power Point has many features that are not often used that can make it an interactive, multimedia experience.  As DenBeste notes, with careful planning “Power Point can move beyond its static presentation by a ‘sage on the stage’ and lead to opportunities for discussion and consideration of visual sources” (2003, p. 492).


==='''Hypermedia'''===

Most Power Point presentations go in a straight line.  Click to get to the next slide.  However, it is very easy to insert an element of choice into the presentation through “action buttons.”  This tool can make presentations more interactive as teachers and students explore the presentation together, choosing the next learning objective as fits the discussion.  Teachers can also design interactive presentations that students can complete independently.  This option is an excellent way to introduce K-2 students to the art of using hyperlinks to explore a webpage without the worry of unleashing young students on the Internet.  Hyperlinks can also be used to link to an Internet site.  This option allows for many educational opportunities.  The presentation can link to further information, pictures, games for practice, etc.

For an example of a non-linear presentation with hyperlinks see the power point presentation Archaeology in this wiki. (http://technologymeaningful.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/archaeology.ppt)

==='''Multimedia'''===

One of the most powerful tools available in PowerPoint is the option to include video and sound files.  By including multiple types of media, teachers can increase student interest in the presentation while helping students to discover new ways of viewing and processing information.  As Grabe and Grabe note, “Multimedia presentation allow students more diverse experiences that may be more motivating or present information in ways that are more informative” (2007, p. 167). Additionally, this is an excellent way to differentiate instruction to meet the varied learning needs of students.

These lesson plans have been used at different levels in the art curriculum.  All can be adjusted to suit a particular grade level. 


'''Mini Masterpieces'''
SOLs listed for grades 5,8, and Art I.  Students are divided into three groups: before, during, and after computer use.
** http://technologymeaningful.wikispaces.com/Mini+Masterpieces


'''Tessellations'''
This lesson is written for middle school students but can be used with fifth graders as well.  Students create a tessellation on the computer to reproduce as a two dimensional work of art.

'''Watercolor Landscape and Haiku'''
Fourth grade students painted a fall landscape and wrote a haiku to expain the feeling autumn promotes in them.  One class period was spent in the computer lab typing the haiku.  This form of visual literacy can be added to any art project.  
** http://technologymeaningful.wikispaces.com/Watercolor+Landscape+and+Haiku


'''Alphabet Book'''
Fifth grade students created alphabet books for the kindergarten classes.  Their tasks were to create a collage and a word page for the letters of the alphabet.  One class period was spent in the lab typing their words and saving the pages for printing at a later time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thai is a tonal language with 5 different tones. The Thai script may seem complicated to foreigners, but in order to study the Thai language, one must first know the Thai consonants and vowels. This page is based on the transliteration by the Royal Institute of Thailand, so you may find many other ways of transcribing the characters from other sources.

In Thai, there are 44 characters that represent only 21 consonant sounds -- that means some of the characters share the exact same sound! The native Thai has a way to remember such numerous letters, that is by memorizing with vocabulary. This is equivalent to English's &quot;A as in Alpha&quot;, &quot;B as in Bravo&quot;, &quot;C as in Charlie&quot;, etc.

      <comment>Undid revision - the &quot;pronunciation&quot; column should not reflect English spelling but Arabic pronunciation</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a plan for propaedeutic lessons teaching the student the Arabic alphabet and its pronunciation (including letter combinations like laam-alif etc.). The goal is to introduce letters one by one so as not to overwhelm the student. In order to raise his confidence and provide feelings of success, words used for illustration and exercises shall mostly be understandable without any knowledge of Arabic: Arabic words that come from English (e. g. sandwich), Arabic words used in other languages (e. g. algebra?), common personal names (e. g. Ahmed) and names of countries or places whose name is not very different in Arabic (e. g. Iran, Hanoi). 

For now, it will just be a list of words that could be used, but eventually it shall turn into an order for letters to be introduced like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]] and then into actual step-by-step lessons like the writing lessons at [[Modern Greek]].

Please post any words that could be used here, preferably with vowel indications. Also transliterate or give the English equivalent.

'''Could somebody please add vowel signs to the Arabic words?'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Achilles was one of the best warriors &quot;If not the best&quot; of all time. His mother was a Nereid, or sea nymph. Shortly after he was born his mother dipped him into the river Styx, which made him invulnerable to all that went against him, but when he was dipped into the river his left heel was not submerged, leaving him with one weak spot. He went on to fight in the Trojan War, where he distinguished himself as the greatest warrior of both sides, defeating the Trojan hero, Hector, the oldest son of the king. In revenge, the prince's brother, Paris, threw a spear at him from the city wall, which struck him in the heel and killed him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dynamic Microphones
Dynamic microphones are versatile and ideal for general-purpose use. They use a simple design with few moving parts. They are relatively sturdy and resilient to rough handling. They are also better suited to handling high volume levels, such as from certain musical instruments or amplifiers. They have no internal amplifier and do not require batteries or external power.

How Dynamic Microphones Work
As you may recall from your school science, when a magnet is moved near a coil of wire an electrical current is generated in the wire. Using this electromagnet principle, the dynamic microphone uses a wire coil and magnet to create to create the audio signal.

The diaphragm is attached to the coil. When the diaphragm vibrates in response to incoming sound waves, the coil moves backwards and forwards past the magnet. This creates a current in the coil which is channeled from the microphone along wires. A common configuration is shown below.



Earlier we mentioned that loudspeakers perform the opposite function of microphones by converting electrical energy into sound waves. This is demonstrated perfectly in the dynamic microphone which is basically a loudspeaker in reverse. When you see a cross-section of a speaker you'll see the similarity with the diagram above. If fact, some intercom systems use the speaker as a microphone. You can also demonstrate this effect by plugging a microphone into the headphone output of your stereo, although we don't recommend it!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Notes:

Dynamics do not usually have the same flat frequency response as condensers. Instead they tend to have tailored frequency responses for particular applications.

Neodymium magnets are more powerful than conventional magnets, meaning that neodymium microphones can be made smaller, with more linear frequency response and higher output level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Condenser Microphones
Condenser means capacitor, an electronic component which stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field. The term condenser is actually obsolete but has stuck as the name for this type of microphone, which uses a capacitor to convert acoustical energy into electrical energy.

Condenser microphones require power from a battery or external source. The resulting audio signal is stronger signal than that from a dynamic. Condensers also tend to be more sensitive and responsive than dynamics, making them well-suited to capturing subtle nuances in a sound. They are not ideal for high-volume work, as their sensitivity makes them prone to distort. 

How Condenser Microphones Work
A capacitor has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser mic, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs.

A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power.

Cross-Section of a Typical Condenser Microphone


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Electret Condenser Microphone
The electret condenser mic uses a special type of capacitor which has a permanent voltage built in during manufacture. This is somewhat like a permanent magnet, in that it doesn't require any external power for operation. Therefore you don't need to worry about batteries or phantom power.

Other than this difference, you can think of an electret condenser microphone as being the same as a normal condenser.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Notes:

Condenser microphones have a flatter frequency response than dynamics.

A condenser mic works in much the same way as an electrostatic tweeter (although obviously in reverse).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Neurology is the study of neurons and their functions within the nervous system. Neurons are specially designed cells that transmit and receive messages enabling the body to perform tasks.
Neurons consist of dendrites, cell body (or soma), and an axon. 
Dendrite comes from the latin word for tree as they branch out to make connections with other neurons. Dendrites create a '''graded potential''' when neurotransmitter substance opens chemically gated channels to receive incoming messages. If the signal is strong enough it will reach the neuron's threshold (in most cells it is about 70mv) and create an '''action potential''' by opening valtage gatted channels and the neuron is said to 'fire'. A neuron will either fire or it will not - this is the '''all-or-none law'''. If a neuron reaches threshold it will fire the same electrical energy every time. 
Normally a neuron has an overall negative charge. However when an action potential is created, sodium ions rush into the cell giving it a temporary positive charge. The electrical sign travels down the axon where it reaches the '''synapse'''.
The synapse consists of the axon terminal of one neuron, the receptors on the dendrite or cell body of another neuron and the space between them (called the synaptic cleft). When the electrical signal reaches the axon terminal the energy is converted from electrical to chemical. A chemical neurotransmitter is released into the synapse where it will stimulate receptors on a postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitter fits into receptors like a lock and key - only specific neurotransmitter will stimulate a particular receptor. 
Examples of common neurotransmitter include dopamine, serotonin or acetylcholine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Free Web Based Material from HEFCE==

There is a DVD on vectors at [http://www.mathtutor.ac.uk/viewdisksinfo.php?disk=4 Math Tutor].

==Vectors==

Imagine you make a rail journey from Doncaster to Bristol, from where you travel up the West of the country to Manchester. Here you stay a day, travelling the next morning to Glasgow, then across to Edinburgh.
At the end of a day's work you return to Doncaster. Mathematically this journey could be represented by vectors, (in 2 dimensions because we are flat earthers on this scale). At the end of the 2nd journey (D-B) + (B-M) you are only a short distance from Doncaster, 50 miles at 9.15 on the clockface. Adding two more vectors, (journeys) takes you to Edinburgh, (about 250 miles at 12.00). Completing the journey leaves you at a zero vector away from Doncaster, ''i.e.'' all the vectors in this closed path add to zero.

Mathematically we usually use 3 dimensional vectors over the 3 Cartesian axes &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

It is best always to use the conventional right handed axes even though  the other way round is equally valid if used consistently. The wrong handed coordinates can occasionally be found erroneously in published research papers and text books. The memory trick is to think of a sheet of graph paper, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is across as usual and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; up the paper. Positive &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; then comes out of the paper.

A ''unit vector'' is a vector ''normalised'', ''i.e.'' multiplied by a constant so that its value is 1. We have the unit vectors in the 3 dimensions:

&lt;math&gt;{\hat {\mathbf i}}  + {\hat {\mathbf j}}  + {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}  = A_x{\hat {\mathbf i}}  + A_y {\hat {\mathbf j}}  + A_z {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

The hat on the i, j, k signifies that it is a ''unit vector''. This is usually omitted.

Our geographical analogy allows us to see the meaning of vector addition and subtraction. Vector '''products''' are less obvious and there are two definitions the ''scalar product'' and the ''vector product''. These are different kinds of mathematical animal and have very different applications. A scalar product is an area and is therefore an ordinary number, a scalar. This has many useful trigonometrical features.

The vector product seems at first to be  defined rather strangely but this definition maps onto nature as a very elegant way of describing ''angular momentum''. The structure of Maxwell's Equations is such that this definition simplifies all kinds of mathematical descriptions of atomic / molecular structure and electricity and magnetism.

==A summary of vectors==

The unit vectors in the 3 Cartesian dimensions:

&lt;math&gt;{\hat {\mathbf i}}  + {\hat {\mathbf j}}  + {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

a vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}  = A_x{\hat {\mathbf i}}  + A_y {\hat {\mathbf j}}  + A_z {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

The hat on the i, j, k signifies that it is a ''unit vector''.

===Vector magnitude===

&lt;math&gt;V_{mag}   =  \sqrt { { A_x }^2 +  { A_y }^2 +  { A_z }^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

===A constant times a vector===

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v_{new}}  = c A_x {\hat {\mathbf i}}  + c A_y {\hat {\mathbf j}}  + c A_z {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector addition===

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A}   + {\mathbf B}  = ( A_x + B_x  ) {\hat {\mathbf i}} + ( A_y + B_y  ) {\hat {\mathbf j}}  + ( A_z + B_z ) {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  B}   + {\mathbf A} = {\mathbf  A}   + {\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector subtraction===

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A}   - {\mathbf B}  = ( A_x - B_x  ) {\hat {\mathbf i}} + ( A_y - B_y  ) {\hat {\mathbf j}} + ( A_z - B_z ) {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A}   - {\mathbf B} = - ( - {\mathbf  A}   + {\mathbf B})&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar Product===

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A}   . {\mathbf B}  =  A_x . B_x   +  A_y . B_y   +  A_z . B_z&lt;/math&gt;

Notice &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  B} . {\mathbf A} = {\mathbf  A} . {\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that if &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A} = {\mathbf B} &lt;/math&gt; this reduces to a square.

If A and B have no common non-zero components in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; the value is zero corresponding to ''orthogonality'', ''i.e.'' they are at right angles. (This can also occur by sign combinations making &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A} . {\mathbf B} &lt;/math&gt; zero. corresponding to non axis-hugging right angles.)

===Vector product===

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  A}  {\rm x }{\mathbf B}  = ( A_y  B_z  - A_z B_y) {\hat {\mathbf i}} - ( A_x  B_z  - A_z B_x ) {\hat {\mathbf j}} +  ( A_x  B_y - A_y B_x) {\hat {\mathbf k}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf  B}   {\rm x }{\mathbf A} = - {\mathbf  A}   {\rm x }{\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt;

The minus sign on the middle term comes from the definition of the determinant, explained in the lecture. Determinants are defined that way so they correspond to right handed rotation. (If you remember our picture
of &lt;math&gt;\cos^2 + \sin^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; going round the circle, as one coordinate goes up, ''i.e.'' more positive, another must go down. Therefore rotation formulae must have both negative and positive terms.) Determinants are related to rotations and the solution of simultaneous equations. The solution of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; simultaneous equations can be recast in graphical form as a rotation to a unit vector in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space so therefore the same mathematical structures apply to both space and simultaneous equations.

Hi!

Would be nice to see some pictures, if possible. Look in the wikimedia-Collection or make your own drawings. In
&quot;Non-Human Language - Animal Communication&quot; needs a bit trimming, you could make some more paragraphs and subheadings. If you can fill the rest, it will be a good chapter :D

if you are so brave to quote Schmalhofers model, I would encourge you to put him into reference *cough* Otherwise is it stupid.;p

This is a simple guide to brewing one cup's worth of Chai.  To brew more than one cup, see the Advanced Brewing section.
==What You'll Need==
*A pot or pan to brew in
*Ingredients from the [[Cookbook:Chai Tea|Ingredients List]].  Here are some common ones, with recommended amounts.  Keep in mind you should always change the amounts to suit your taste!
**3/4 cup of water
**1 tablespoon milk
**1 tablespoon honey
**1 teaspoon grey tea
**6 cardamom seeds
**8 cloves
**3 black pepper corns
**1 cinnamon stick (or 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon sugar)
**15 minutes of free time
**A stove top with functioning burners
**Two pans, two pots, or a pot and a pan.
**A strainer (or sieve)

==Procedure==
#Fill a pan with 3/4 cup of water and put it on a stove top.  Put the stove on the lowest setting, or just below a boil.  3/4 cup is not a lot of water, and we don't want it to evaporate.  On the other hand, the more you let evaporate, the stronger the Chai's flavor will be.
#If you have a mortar and pestle, then mash the cardamom seeds, cloves, and black pepper corns together.  If you do not have a mortar and pestle, then de-shell the cardamom seeds and consider using a pepper-shaker.  If you have cinnamon stick, break it into four pieces, if you have Cinnamon Sugar, put it in the water now.  Put all of the spices in the water, as well as the honey.  Mix well so that the honey dissolves into the water.
#Stir, occasionally smell or taste (if it's for ''you'') a bit of the Chai.  If the spices are not strong enough, then let it brew longer or add more spices.  Usually, it takes five to ten minutes for all of the spices to let their flavor out.
#Once you are satisfied with the spices, add the tea.  Depending on how long you leave the tea in, it will be stronger.  Usually, I wait until most the tea sinks into the water.
#At this point, the Chai is probably a bit strong and may have a bitter flavor (though the honey will often make it a bit sweeter).  We are going to add milk soon, so I usually bring the Chai to a simmer at this point, so that the milk doesn't make it too cold.  Don't cook it too much though- it may all evaporate or the spices may overpower it!
#Take the pot off of the stove top.  Put the strainer or sieve on top of an empty pot or pan.  Dump your concoction into the strainer, so that all the liquid pours into the pot or pan below it.  Put the hot pan or pot back on the stove so it doesn't crack or melt your counter top.  ''Turn the stove off''.
#Pour some milk in a mug/teacup.  I don't use too much milk, as the ingredients list above states.  Then pour the strained tea into the milk (we do this so the milk is not scalded and flavorless).  Drink your Chai!  If it is too bitter, consider adding a little bit of honey or making changes to the ingredients list.

==Notes==
*There may be some spice residue floating around in your Chai.  You can get rid of it using a finer sieve, but it adds flavor and isn't going to hurt anyone.</text>

There is a DVD on trigonometry at [http://www.mathtutor.ac.uk/viewdisksinfo.php?disk=5 Math Tutor].

== Trigonometry - the sin and cosine rules ==

[[File:Trigonometric Triangle.svg|frame|right|Trigonometric triangle]]

In the following trigonometric identities, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c &lt;/math&gt; are the lengths of sides in a triangle, opposite the corresponding angles &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. 

* The sin rule &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}&lt;/math&gt;
* The cosine rule &lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2 -2ab \cos C&lt;/math&gt;
* The ratio identity &lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Trigonometric identities ==

&lt;math&gt; \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Remember this is a consequence of Pythagoras' theorem where
the length of the hypotenuse is 1.

&lt;math&gt;\sin ( \theta + \phi ) = \sin  \theta \cos \phi  + \cos  \theta \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos ( \theta + \phi ) = \cos  \theta \cos \phi  - \sin  \theta \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

The difference of two angles can easily be generated by putting &lt;math&gt;\phi = -\phi&lt;/math&gt; and remembering &lt;math&gt;\sin -\phi = - \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos -\phi =  \cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the double angle formulae are generated by induction. &lt;math&gt;\tan ( \theta + \phi )&lt;/math&gt; is a little more complicated but can be generated if you can handle the fractions! The proofs are in many textbooks but as a chemist it is not necessary to know them, only the results.

== Identities and equations ==

Identities and equations look very similar, two things connected by an equals sign. An identity however is a memory aid of a mathematical equivalence and can be proved. An equation represents new information about a situation and can be solved.

For instance,

&lt;math&gt;
\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

is an identity. It cannot be solved for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. It is valid for all &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. However,

&lt;math&gt;
\cos^2 \theta = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

is an equation where &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arccos \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If you try and solve an identity as an equation you will go round and round in circles getting nowhere, but it would be possible to dress up &lt;math&gt;\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1&lt;/math&gt; into a very complicated expression which you could mistake for an equation.

== Some observations on triangles ==

Check you are familiar with your elementary geometry. Remember from your GCSE maths the properties of equilateral and iscoceles triangles. If you have an iscoceles triangle you can always dispense with the sin and cosine rules, drop a perpendicular down to the base and use trig directly. Remember that the bisector of a side or an angle to a vertex cuts the triangle in two by area, angle and length. This can be demonstrated by drawing an obtuse triangle and seeing that the areas are &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 \frac 1  2 .R.h&lt;/math&gt;.

== The interior angles of a polygon ==

Remember that the interior angles of a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sided polygon are n * 180 -360,

(&lt;math&gt;n \pi - 2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;).

For [[w:en:Benzene|benzene]] there are six ''equilateral'' triangles if the centre of the ring is used as a vertex, each of which having an interior angle of 120 degrees. Work out the the angles in azulene, (a hydrocarbon with a five and a seven membered ring), assuming all the C-C bond lengths are equal, (this is only approximately true).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the fourth lesson teaching you how to read, write and pronounce Greek. By this time, you're already more than halfway done. The rest of the letters will be easy to learn. 

Let's start with Eta:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Η η&lt;/font&gt;

Even though the capital letter looks like an H and the small letter looks somewhat like a small N, this is actually a vowel. In Hellenistic, Medieval, and Modern Greek, it is pronounced like the Spanish &quot;i&quot; (IPA [i]), same as the letter Iota. In Ancient Greek, it used to be pronounced like a long &quot;e&quot;, as in the word &quot;pain&quot;. That's why words which got derived in the past from Greek and are spelled with an Eta are actually spelled with an E in English, which is also a different sound from the original eta. An example: δημοκρατία became &quot;democracy&quot; and not &quot;dimocracy&quot; in English. In Attic Greek it must have sounded different from both. Fortunately, this reference to those English words is a way to know whether a Modern Greek word is spelled with Eta or Iota. In standard transliteration this letter is rendered as '''ī''' (the dash is used in order to distinguish it from Iota), while in names and toponyms it is transcribed simply as '''i''' (with the disadvantage of being unable to distinguish it from Iota). Sometimes ''h'' is used just because of the similarity of the respective capital letters, providing though a weird and wrong spelling. Practice your reading now: 

ακαδημία &lt;br&gt;
Κρήτη &lt;br&gt;
Αμερική &lt;br&gt;
ηλεκτρονικά &lt;br&gt;
Ισραήλ &lt;br&gt;
Ινδονησία &lt;br&gt;
Μαδρίτη &lt;br&gt;
Τρίπολη &lt;br&gt;
Άρης &lt;br&gt;
Σπάρτη &lt;br&gt;
Ταϊλάνδη &lt;br&gt;


There is yet another letter that sounds like ''i'': upsilon.

&lt;font size=4&gt;Υ υ&lt;/font&gt;

The shape of this Greek letter seems to refer us to both Y and U, and that's correct: when English words derive from Greek ones, most of times this letter is rendered as Y in English and vice versa. Also, in very ancient Greek this letter was pronounced like the ''u'' in &quot;rule&quot; (IPA [u]) but later it transformed to the French U sound (German Ü, IPA [y], sound which doesn't exist in English). In medieval Greek the letter started sounding just like Iota and Eta. Example words:

δυναμική &lt;br&gt;
ανάλυση &lt;br&gt;
Σύδνεϋ &lt;br&gt;
Τόκυο &lt;br&gt;
Συρία &lt;br&gt;
Υεμένη &lt;br&gt;


Now you're probably wondering how to write the ''u'' sound as in &quot;r'''u'''le&quot; in Modern Greek. Greeks need two letters for this: Omikron and Upsilon (ου). This probably sounds familiar to those who have studied French, because French also spells [u] as &quot;ou&quot;. Here are a lot of sample words with this letter combination, for practice:

Ουκρανία &lt;br&gt;
Ρουμανία &lt;br&gt;
Τουρκία &lt;br&gt;
μουσική &lt;br&gt;
Καμπούλ &lt;br&gt;
Καλκούτα &lt;br&gt;
Ιερουσαλήμ &lt;br&gt;
Σεούλ &lt;br&gt;
Περού &lt;br&gt;
Ρουάντα &lt;br&gt;


Now you're going to learn another very important Greek letter: Omega.

&lt;font size=4&gt;Ω ω&lt;/font&gt;

This is the second variety of ''O'' in Greek. The O that you already learned is called Omikron, which translates to &quot;small O&quot;. This one is called Omega, which translates to &quot;big O&quot;. They are both pronounced the same, as o in '''o'''bey. In standard transliteration, this letter is rendered as '''ō''' because in ancient Greek it had the sound of a long [o], which made it essentially a different vowel. Transcription in names and toponyms is usually just '''o'''. Sometimes unofficially it is rendered as ''w''(inspired by the shape of the small letter), but this leads to weird and incorrect spelling, as in some pretty weird-looking transliterations, like &quot;egw agapw&quot;. Knowing this letter (and the ones taught before), you can read some new words:

Ιαπωνία &lt;br&gt;
Ρωσία &lt;br&gt;
ωροσκόπιο &lt;br&gt;
ερωτικός &lt;br&gt;
άρωμα &lt;br&gt;
Κώστας &lt;br&gt;
Κως &lt;br&gt;
Πορτ-ω-Πρενς &lt;br&gt;
Ρώμη &lt;br&gt;
Πολωνία &lt;br&gt;


The last letter I'd like to introduce to you in this lesson is Beta.

&lt;font size=4&gt;Β β&lt;/font&gt;

As I mentioned earlier, this letter sounds like an English V (IPA [v]), not like a B. That's why it is often used for English words that contain V or W. In classical Greek it was pronounced like English B, explaining the common origin of the two letters, but the pronunciation changed to V in hellenistic Greek. Compare the sound of Beta to the sound of the Spanish 'B', which has a V sound unless it's found in the beginning of a word. Beta is generally used very often and there are lots of example words that you can use for practice:

ασβέστης &lt;br&gt;
αμβροσία &lt;br&gt;
Βιετνάμ &lt;br&gt;
Βολιβία &lt;br&gt;
Λίβανος &lt;br&gt;
Ιβάν &lt;br&gt;
Οττάβα &lt;br&gt;
Κούβα &lt;br&gt;
Κουβέιτ &lt;br&gt;
Αλβανία &lt;br&gt;
Λίβερπουλ &lt;br&gt;
Βρετανία &lt;br&gt;
Βανκούβερ &lt;br&gt;
Μελβούρνη &lt;br&gt;
Βιέννη &lt;br&gt;
Βατικανό &lt;br&gt;
Βουδαπέστη &lt;br&gt;
Ελ Σαλβαδόρ &lt;br&gt;
Βέρνη &lt;br&gt;
Βομβάη &lt;br&gt;
Ρέυκιαβικ &lt;br&gt;
Κολομβία &lt;br&gt;
Βαρσοβία &lt;br&gt;
Λισαβόνα &lt;br&gt;
Δουβλίνο &lt;br&gt;
Ταϊβάν &lt;br&gt;


That's it for this lesson! If you didn't have trouble reading the example words, you're ready to continue with [[Modern Greek/RWP/Lesson 5|lesson 5]]!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

'''Abstinence''' is the only 100% guaranteed method to avoid unwanted pregnancy and sexual transmission of diseases. Abstinence is the practice of not engaging in any sexual contact: Intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, or fondling or any sort of foreplay.

== What is Abstinence? ==

Sexual abstinence can be defined in different ways, but most frequently it is the avoidance of sexual intercourse with a partner.  Abstinence always includes avoiding vaginal intercourse, and sometimes people extend it to mean forebearance from oral and/or anal sex as well.

Abstinence can protect against pregnancy and against sexual transmission of diseases.  

To use abstinence to protect against pregnancy, no sexual contact that could allow sperm to enter the vagina can be engaged in - vaginal sex has the highest risk of pregnancy, but leakage of sperm from anal sex or contact with sperm from non-penetrative sex ('frotting') can lead to pregnancy.

To use abstinence to protect against sexual transmission of diseases, anal, vaginal, and oral sex must all be avoided.  It must also be remembered that many sexually transmitted diseases, most importantly AIDS, can be transmitted through exposure to infected blood.

Many people who are abstinent refuse to have sex and some (or all) forms of sexual contact before marriage.

A person may masturbate while being abstinent, so long as the masturbation does not involve contact with another person, or another person's fluids or genitals. If complete abstinence is practiced faithfully, there is zero risk of pregnancy or sexual transmission of diseases.


Anal sex carries a higher STD transmission risk than vaginal and oral sex.  If a person practices abstinence by engaging in anal sex when they would otherwise have engaged in vaginal or oral, they will raise their risk of contracting an STD if their partner or partners are infected.

It is important to remember that 100% protection only applies if abstinence is 100% practiced.  Practicing abstinence most of the time and occasionally engaging in unprotected sex will elevate your risk of becoming pregnant or contracting an STD.

Keep in mind that even if you practice abstinence, STDs and other diseases can still be transmitted through direct blood contact with an infected person, or through sharing an intravenous needle with an infected person.

== Virginity ==

People who have never had sex are called '''virgins'''.  As different people
have different opinions as to what constitutes sex, some people may consider
themselves virgins even if they have had some forms of sex.  Also, some
people who have had sex previously, but are now waiting until marriage to
have sex again refer to themselves as '''born again virgins''', and some
people use the term '''lapsed virgin''' or '''non-practicing virgin''' to
refer to a person who engages in sexual activity.

== Romance and Abstinence ==

It is very possible to maintain a lasting romantic relationship and remain abstinent. Typically, people following this path choose to wait until marriage to have sexual intercourse with their partner for the first time. People who are taking this route are still not immune to risk, and should test themselves for STDs before engaging in sex for the first time with their partners. It is possible for an abstinent person to have contracted an STD at birth, or from another event, such as exposure to infected blood (blood transfusions were common culprits historically, but now all blood donated is tested for disease), sexual activity that happened before they began practicing abstinence, or anal or oral sexual activity, which can be passed to their partner after they are married.  People who are abstinent until marriage may still use birth control methods to prevent unwanted pregnancies after marriage (if getting pregnant is unwanted).

Even couples that are sexually active may practice abstinence at certain times of their life.  Certain medical conditions may make intercourse difficult, painful, or unsafe, for example.  Also, couples that use fertility awareness for birth control must practice abstinence while the woman is fertile.  Keep in mind that fertility awareness as a means of birth control has a high failure rate, especially in women with irregular menstrual cycles.

Instead of having sex, abstinent couples can bond in other romantic ways, such as cuddling, hugging or kissing. They can also express their feelings for each other verbally, instead of relying only on touch to convey affection.

'''NOTICE:  While this page in a good attempt at basic information, it is in no way completely accurate nor inclusive of all essential information for those seeking generalized information on sexually transmitted diseases. For example, while oral sex is mentioned, the oral transmission route via saliva and throat tissue is not indicated in the very first paragraph, only semen or vaginal secretions. ''' 


'''Sexually Transmitted Diseases''' (STD) are diseases that can be passed between sexual partners via semen or vaginal secretions. Some of the most common or famous STDs include HIV, Herpes, and Gonorrhea. Many STDs can be transmitted through oral and anal sex, as well as vaginal intercourse.

== Contracting STDs ==

{{SideBox|'''Monogamous''':&lt;br&gt;Having only one sexual partner, usually for the rest of your life. Marriage is typically monogamous.}}

As their name implies, the primary method for contracting an STD is through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner. For this reason, sexual partners should be tested to ensure that they are not infected, and therefore do not pose an infection risk to their partners. Being in a faithful, '''monogamous''' relationship with an uninfected partner is a good way to avoid STDs. Keep in mind that a person might be infected with an STD and not know about it. It is important, therefore, that couples should get tested for STDs.

{{SideBox|float=left|'''[[Sexual Health/Abstinence|Abstinence]]''':&lt;br&gt;Avoiding sexual contact, for health or moral reasons, typically until marriage.}}

The only 100% way to avoid sexual transmission of an STD is '''abstinence'''. However, condoms offer good protection from most STDs. Cervical barriers such as diaphragms may offer some protection from STDs, but not as good as condoms. Other methods of birth control do not offer any protection from STDs.

STDs may also be contracted in non-sexual ways. The child of an infected mother might contract the infection during childbirth or breastfeeding. STDs can also be transmitted directly by blood. People who use intravenous drugs, such as heroin, can pass STDs on infected needles. All blood transfusions are tested for STDs, and infected blood is discarded, but infected transfusions have transmitted in the past. People who are very recently infected may test (falsely) negative for the disease, and should retest themselves after a period of some weeks.

== STDs ==

There are many different STDs in this world. Some STDs can be cured with treatment. Some STDs cannot be cured, but can be managed with treatment. Some STDs cannot be cured, and are fatal.

=== HIV ===
{{Wikipedia|HIV}}
[[Image:Niaid-hiv-virion-mod.svg|thumb|200px|left|A schematic illustration of a section through a HIV virion]]
[[Image:HIV Daughter Particles.jpg|thumb|150px|HIV daughter particles being shed from an infected T cell]]
'''Human Immunodeficiency Virus''', or &quot;HIV&quot; is one of the most well-known STDs, and certainly one of the most dangerous. HIV is caused by a virus, and there is no known cure. HIV attacks the immune system, making the victim prone to infections. When the Immune system is destroyed by the HIV, the person is said to have '''Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome''', or &quot;AIDS&quot;.  HIV can be helped with medicine, but it is almost always a death sentence in the long run. HIV can be transmitted through sex, direct blood contact, and through contact with other infected fluids. HIV can be passed in a number of ways besides sexual contact, such as birth (from the mother to the child), or through sharing intravenous needles. People who are virgins, or who have previously engaged in safe sex practices may still be infected with HIV.

When it was first discovered, HIV was predominant in gay men, but recently it has been infecting homosexual and heterosexual people equally. HIV can be transmitted easily through anal and vaginal sex, and not as easily through oral sex. HIV is a large problem in the developing world, and is a growing problem everywhere else. Here are some facts about HIV:

*HIV currently is not curable, but is treatable&amp;mdash;to a degree&amp;mdash;with medication.
*There is no vaccine for HIV.
*HIV infects people equally well, regardless of race, gender, age, or sexual orientation.
*1 in 4 people who have HIV don't know they are infected.
*HIV causes AIDS.
*HIV has no visual symptoms. It is impossible to tell if a person has HIV by their appearance.
*HIV can be spread by any transmission of infected bodily fluids. Unprotected sex, sharing of intravenous needles, and other contact between bodily fluids can transmit the disease.
*People who have multiple sexual partners, or who frequently engage in unprotected sex are at high risk for contracting and spreading HIV.

If you suspect you may have been exposed to HIV, or if you are not certain, you should consult a doctor immediately.

=== Herpes ===
[[Image:Herpes labialis - opryszczka wargowa.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Cold sores, also called oral herpes]]
'''Herpes simplex virus''' (HSV) is the most common STD.  It, like HIV, is a virus that can be transmitted through sex, blood, and other direct fluid contact. Unlike HIV, herpes isn't fatal, nor does it reduce the effectiveness of the immune system.

[[Image:SOA-Herpes-genitalis-male.jpg|thumb|150px|Genital herpes on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis]]
Herpes causes occasional outbreaks known as '''cold sores''', which are open sores on the skin in the area of the original infection. People with herpes are especially capable of transmitting the disease during an outbreak, but it is possible to transmit herpes even when there is no outbreak at all. Herpes can be treated with medicine, but cannot be cured.

11% of women and 23% of men carry HSV-2, the type that most commonly causes genital cold sores. Up to 90% of people test positive for HSV-1, the type that most commonly causes oral cold sores.  Because it is so common, most doctors do not test for it unless the patient is complaining of an outbreak (to confirm the diagnosis), or specifically asks to be tested for herpes.

=== HPV ===
HPV (human papilloma virus) is also a virus.  There are many different strains of HPV.  Some strains cause unsightly warts to form on the genitals. Other strains cause cervical cancer in women - this is why it is important for sexually active women to have regular pap smears to test for precancerous cervical cells.

While a person's immune system may fight off the viral infection, there is no treatment for HPV.  Warts may be removed by a doctor if they are bothersome.  There is now a vaccine for HPV that is available to women.

===Gonorrhea and Chlamydia===
These are bacteria infections that are transmitted through sex.  They may also infect other locations, such as the eye or throat.  Like all bacterial infections, they may be treated with antibiotics.

The most common symptom is none at all, especially in women. In people who do have symptoms, painful urination is the most common one.  In women, both gonorrhea and chlamydia can spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).  PID can cause infertility and greatly increases the woman's future risk for ectopic pregnancy.

===Syphilis===
Syphilis is a bacterial infection.  It has three stages.  In the first stage, primary syphilis, the person develops a sore in the location where they contracted the infection.  In the second stage, secondary syphilis, the person develops a distinctive rash.  One feature of this rash is that it is symmetrical - if it is on the right hand, it will be on the left hand also.  If it is on the right hip, it will be on the left hip, too.

Both the sore and the rash will heal on their own.  Between one to ten years after infection, tertiary syphilis will begin.  In this stage, tumor-like growths will begin to appear, and neurological and cardiovascular damage may occur.  Syphilis is treated with antibiotics.

=== Pubic Lice ===

Pubic lice are lice that are living in the pubic hair. They are not to be confused with head lice or scabies.  Pubic lice can be transmitted through direct skin contact with an infected person, clothing, furniture or bedding, but cannot be transmitted through fluids or blood.

== Protect yourself ==

The only way to completely protect yourself from acquiring STDs through sex is to remain abstinent. However, barrier birth control methods, such as condoms, do provide some protection, if used properly. The best ways to protect yourself from STDs are not to have unprotected sex, and not to have sex with strangers. Oral and Anal sex can transmit STDs, so protection should be used when engaging in these types of activities as well.

== Get Tested ==

It is a good idea to get tested for STDs regularly if you are, or have been, sexually active. People with multiple sexual partners are at the greatest risk for contracting an STD, and then to pass on that STD to many partners. If you have unprotected sex, you should get tested immediately, and also get tested again in 6 months, to make sure. If you are infected, you should see a doctor immediately to discuss treatment options, and you should not engage in unprotected sexual intercourse again until it is deemed safe to do so (if ever).

Hospitals and primary care physicians can either perform an STD test, or can tell you where to get one. Many organizations offer free or low-cost tests for people who need them which you can find a list of [http://yourstdhelp.com/free_clinic_locator.html here] or [http://www.stdcheck.com/std-test-center.php here].

== Talk With your partner ==

It is important to talk with your sexual partners about STDs. Many people who are infected don't know that they are infected, and some people who are infected might not mention it before sex. Women should insist that men wear condoms before having sex. It is a good idea for a woman to know the proper way to put on a condom, just in case. You should ask your partners when they were last tested, and what the results of those tests were. It is impossible to tell just by looking at a person whether they have an STD or not, so you should always talk with your partners before engaging in sexual intercourse.

'''Sex''', is both a noun and a verb. Sex - the noun - refers to male and female components needed for sexual reproduction, and is quite different from gender. '''Sex''' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women. '''Gender''' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men (masculine) and women (feminine). 

'''Sex''' as a verb refers to any action capable of provoking an orgasm. Heterosexual means an act involving a male and female. Homosexual refers to sexual acts between partners of the same sex. There are multiple ways to enjoy sexual encounters, including ways that are likely to provoke pregnancy and ways that invoke transitory pleasure.

'''Sexually Transmitted Infections''' (STIs) may be contracted during unprotected sexual contact. STIs can reduce fertility, cause death or serious health risk, and should be taken care of immediately by a health care professional. See [[Sexual Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases#Protect yourself|''Sexually Transmitted Diseases'']] for more information.

== Vaginal Intercourse ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;Many people use the word &quot;sex&quot; to refer to vaginal intercourse.}}

Vaginal intercourse can be defined as the penetration of the vaginal cavity. In a heterosexual context, vaginal intercourse occurs when a penis enters a vagina. In this case, the biological purpose of penile penetration of a vagina is to implant semen and provoke the conception of a fetus. However, the intention of heterosexual vaginal intercourse does not ''have'' to be conception. Likewise, homosexual vaginal intercourse, or sex between two women, can be accomplished with the use of fingers, hands or [[Sexual Health/Sexuality#Sex Toys|sex toys]]. Between queer individuals no standard definition of sex can be applied, as sex can take on any form of physical pleasure.

A vaginal cavity usually produces adequate lubrication for the act, but additional lubrication may be needed, particularly for older women. Only water-based lubricants intended for that purpose should be used, as other lubricants can cause irritation and may reduce the effectiveness of any barrier-method contraceptive used. Some lubricants are neutral whilst others explicitly have spermicide to reduce the possibility of conception. It is important to note that even small quantities of semen splashed near the vagina can occasionally provoke pregnancy without actual penetration having occurred.

== Anal Sex ==

Anal sex can be defined as an object entering an anal cavity in order to provide pleasure. The anus does not produce natural lubrication as the vagina does, so lubricant should always be used when engaging in anal intercourse. Also, the lining of the rectum is not as strong as the lining of the vaginal canal, so vigorous sex can cause rips and tears in the lining of the rectum. For this reason, plenty of lubrication should always be used, and partners should proceed carefully.

When engaging in anal sex, a condom should always be worn to prevent the bacteria from the digestive tract from entering the urethra of the penis. These bacteria can cause dangerous infections in an exposed penis. Also, STDs from the penis can be quickly absorbed through the thin membrane of the rectum. When using hands or fingers to engage in anal penetration, be sure to wear well-fitting sterile gloves, and change gloves between sexual acts to ensure maximum safety.

== Oral Sex ==

Oral sex occurs when the genitals of one partner are stimulated by the mouth, lips, and tongue of the other partner. When oral sex is performed on a man, it is called '''fellatio''', and when it is performed on a woman, it is called '''cunnilingus'''. When performing oral sex, care should be taken not to touch your teeth to your partners genitals, because those sensations are typically unpleasant.

During fellatio, the man should wear a condom to prevent the transmission of disease into the mouth of his partner. During cunnilingus, a '''dental dam''' can be used for the same purpose. A dental dam is a thin sheet of plastic or latex which goes over the genitals, to prevent direct fluid contact, and thus prevent the spread of disease.  A condom may be unrolled, cut along one side, and spread open to be used in place of a dental dam.  Plastic cling wrap that is not microwave safe may also be used in place of a dental dam.

== Manual Stimulation ==
In addition to the actions described above, people can also use their hands to stimulate the genitals of their partners. Manual stimulation is also known as '''mutual masturbation''', and is a reasonably safe sexual contact technique in that the hand has no mucous membranes (like the mouth, anus, and vagina have), and therefore are less likely to transmit or contract STDs. If the hand has open wounds on it, however, diseases can be passed directly to and from the bloodstream.

Before touching another person's genitals with your hand, make sure to wash your hand with plenty of soap and water.

== Warnings ==
In some cultures sex is regarded as 'dirty'. In fact it is important to protect the body from infection, so frequent washing is appropriate as a primary measure. Washing alone, although vitally important, can not provide complete protection from sexually transmitted diseases. Washing can usefully form part of pre and post sexual activity for both partners. 

Any object inserted into the anus (dildo, hand, penis, etc) should be clean, and never subsequently be inserted directly into a mouth or a vagina. The rectum is intended to eliminate body wastes, and so contains a large number of bacteria that can be transmitted to the mouth or vagina, and cause infection. An object that has been in an anus should be washed with soap and water immediately afterwards.

Oral, anal, and vaginal contact with an unprotected penis can all spread STDs, so a condom should be used. Condoms and dental dams should be used to prevent the mucous membranes of the genitals, mouth, and anus from coming into contact with body fluids which may bear infection (saliva, semen, naturally produced sexual lubricant, blood etc. )

A hand, used for so many activities, can be especially dirty, and may well carry bacteria unless carefully cleaned. Washing may seem obvious, but disclosing soap (which changes color) is used to train medical staff to wash themselves properly! Inserting a hand into the anus, vagina, or mouth of a partner can easily cause infection. Touching the head of a penis, especially around the urethral opening can also spread disease. Careful and thorough washing with soap and water before any sexual activity such as touching, fondling, and manual stimulation is important to minimize such risks.

==Touch and Affection==
Touch is commonly used to convey affection.  Holding hands, kisses on the cheek, and &quot;pecks&quot; (quick, closed-mouth kisses) on the lips are all common ways to display affection between friends, family members, and romantic partners.

Different people and cultures have different comfort levels and cultural norms when it comes to affectionate touching. '''Body language''' is very important in human relations, and like spoken language, is variable easily misunderstood. 

In the United States, two adults holding hands is usually considered to signify romantic attachment.  In Asian and Middle Eastern countries, however,  friends without romantic intention commonly hold hands.  In the United States, kisses are generally only regarded as appropriate between very close family members and romantic partners, in many European countries kissing cheeks and making a sound with the lips closed is a common greeting between family and friends of any age and any sex.

==Sexual Touching==
'''Sexual touching''' is touch that is used to provoke sexual arousal and is sometimes called '''foreplay'''.  Usually, touching a person's breasts, nipples, genitals, inner thighs, or buttocks is considered sexual. (A few exceptions exist, such as medical examination.)  Using hands to touch these areas sexually is known as &quot;fondling&quot; or &quot;groping&quot;.  Kissing on the lips, especially with the mouth open (French kissing) is also likely to provoke sexual arousal.

The difference between affectionate touching and sexual touching is not always clear, however.  A kiss on the lips may be purely platonic, or intensely passionate.  A shoulder massage may be a friendly gesture, or an intimate experience. It is very important to get consent from the person being touched before touching occurs.

==Sexual Touching and Affection==
Touching someone sexually is often considered to convey a strong emotional connection to that person.  However, some people engage in such activities only because of the positive physical feelings that result, and not because of a romantic connection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

A number of contraceptives are based off the use of hormones by women to prevent pregnancy. These methods are generally very effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy, but do not reduce the transmission of STDs at all. It is important, therefore, that partners using hormonal contraceptives also use barrier contraceptives to protect against disease.

== Combined hormonal contraception ==
The most common hormonal methods use both a synthetic version of estrogen, and a synthetic version of progesterone (called a 'progestin').  The most common method is &quot;the pill,&quot; but these hormones may also be delivered through a patch that adheres to the skin, or a flexible plastic ring that is inserted into the vagina.

Combined hormonal methods work by preventing ovulation.  They also have possible back-up effects of changing the mucus produced by the cervix (to prevent sperm from getting inside the uterus), and of making it difficult for any embryo to implant in the uterus.

===The Pill===
{{wikipedia|Oral contraceptive}}
'''The Pill''' is taken orally every day.  To be effective, it must be taken within 12 hours of the same time each day.  The Pill usually comes in packages of 28 pills.  The first 21 pills are &quot;active&quot; pills that contain hormones.  The last seven pills are &quot;inactive&quot;, or &quot;placebo&quot; pills.  Inactive pills do not contain hormones, and are just there to help a woman remember to take a pill every day.  When a woman stops taking active pills, she will have &quot;withdrawal bleeding&quot;, usually called a period.

There are two main types of pills.  Monophasic pills have the same amount of hormones in every active pill.  Bi-phasic or tri-phasic pills have different amounts of hormones (two different levels in bi-phasic, three different levels in tri-phasic).  If a woman wants to delay her period, or avoid it altogether, she may take active, monophasic pills every day, with no placebo pills until she is ready to have her period.  If this is done for a long time, or if it is attempted with bi- or tri-phasic pills, the woman is very likely to have &quot;breakthrough bleeding&quot;.

=== The Patch ===
{{wikipedia|Contraceptive patch}}
A recent addition to the lineup of hormonal contraceptives is '''the patch'''. The patch goes on the skin, and releases hormones through the skin that work the same as the pill. Patches are worn for one week at a time, for three weeks, and then a one-week break is taken to cause a period.

For some women, the patch may cause irritation to the skin.  If it persists, such irritation should be brought to the attention of a doctor.

===The Ring===
{{wikipedia|Vaginal ring}}
The vaginal contraceptive ring is a flexible plastic ring that is inserted into the vagina.  It is worn for three weeks, and then a one week break is taken.  The woman will have a period sometime during the break week.

==Progesterone-only contraception==
While commonly known as progesterone-only methods, these contraceptives do not actually contain progesterone, but rather a synthetic chemical known as a progestin.  The mechanism of action of these contraceptives depends on amount of progestin that is given to the woman.  

All progestin-only contraceptives cause changes in cervical mucus that may prevent sperm from entering the woman's uterus.  They may also make it more difficult for embryos to implant in the uterus.  Contraceptives that deliver a low dose of progestin include traditional progesterone-only pills as well as implants Norplant and Jadelle.  These methods prevent ovulation about 50% of the time. 

The progesterone-only pill Cerazette and the implant Implanon deliver an intermediate dose of progestin.  These methods prevent ovulation about 98% of the time.  Injectable methods like Depo-Provera deliver a high dose of progestin.  These methods completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.

===Progesterone-only pill===
{{wikipedia|Progesterone only pill}}
Like the combined pill, progesterone-only pills are taken orally every day.  While Cerazette has the same 12 hour window of effectiveness as the combined pill, the traditional progesterone-only pills (the '''mini-pill''') must be taken within 3 hours of the same time each day to be effective.

Unlike the combined pill, progesterone-only pills are all active; there are no placebo pills.  With the mini-pill, menstruation will still occur, but because the pill sometimes suppresses ovulation, menstruation will be irregular. Some women do not experience any menstruation while on the mini-pill.

=== Depo-Provera ===
{{wikipedia|Depo Provera}}
Also known as '''the shot''', Depo-Provera is a high dose of progestin injected into the woman with a syringe.  The woman must go back to her doctor or health clinic every twelve weeks (three months) to receive a new injection.  While irregular bleeding and spotting is a common side effect, regular menstruation will not happen while the woman is on the shot. 

Pregnancy may occur if a woman misses an appointment to renew the shot.  However, return of fertility varies widely between women, and some women will not get pregnant until a year after their last shot.  For this reason, it is recommended that women who want to become pregnant in the near future use a different method of birth control.
 
Depo-Provera is known to cause loss of bone density.  Because of the seriousness of this side effect, the manufacturer does not recommend that women use the shot for longer than two years.

In some women, the shot causes skin irritation around the location of injection.

===Implant===
{{wikipedia|Norplant}}{{wikipedia|Implanon}}
Previously available was Norplant (a five-rod implant), which was taken off the market due to difficulties removing the rods.  The manufacturer now offers a three-rod implant called Jadelle that works in the same way, but is easier to remove.  Both Norplant and Jadelle are effective in preventing pregnancy for five years.

Implanon is a single-rod implant that is effective for three years.

== Side Effects ==
No hormonal method protects against STDs.

Combined hormonal methods cause increased risk of blood clots and stroke.  Progesterone-only methods do not carry these risks.

All hormonal methods have a possible effect of causing changes in sexual desire, most commonly loss of interest in sex and decreased ability to orgasm, but also possibly an increased sex drive.  Depression is also a possible side effect. All women will react differently to hormonal contraceptives, and if a particular hormone or hormone mixture is causing such unwanted side-effects, it is possible that a different type of contraceptive might not have those side effects. Consult your doctor to discuss your contraceptives.

There are a number of other birth control methods besides hormonal and barrier methods. We will discuss some of them here.

== IUD ==

{{wikipedia|Intrauterine device}}

An '''IUD''', or &quot;Intrauterine Device&quot; is a small hard object, typically made of metal or plastic, that is inserted into the uterus. The IUD causes the body to release substances that are hostile to both sperm and eggs. Copper enhances this spermicidal effect.

Some IUDs contain a hormone-releasing cylinder instead of copper.  These are known as IntraUterine Systems (IUS). The hormones in an IUS reduce the frequency of ovulation (by 10-50%), cause changes in cervical mucus that prevent sperm from entering the uterus, and also cause changes in the endometrium that may prevent embryos from implanting.

Copper IUDs can be used as an '''emergency contraceptive'''. Emergency contraceptives are birth control methods that are designed to prevent pregnancy ''after'' unprotected sex, or sex where the primary contraception (usually a broken condom) fails. Inserting an IUD within 5 days of unprotected sex has an 99% chance of preventing pregnancy.

IUDs do not protect against STDs.

== Morning-After Pill ==
{{wikipedia|Emergency contraception}}
The '''morning after pill''', also known as the '''emergency contraceptive pill''', is a high-dose hormonal contraceptive that can be taken after unprotected sex, or sex where the primary contraceptive has failed. The morning after pill causes the uterus to shed it's lining, effectively prompting an immediate menstruation that washes the fertilized egg out of the uterus. There is some risk involved with the emergency contraceptive pill, and there have been a handful of deaths reported among women who have used the pill. It is unknown in these cases whether the emergency contraceptive itself caused those deaths. Regardless, care should be taken when using an emergency contraceptive, and you should consult your doctor.

The morning after pill does not prevent against STDs.

== Fertility Awareness Methods ==
{{wikipedia|Fertility awareness}}
Fertility awareness methods teach women to observe one or more of their primary fertility signs: basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position.  From these signs, the woman can known when she is fertile (approximately 8-10 days of each menstrual cycle), and when she is not fertile.  To avoid pregnancy, the woman will not have intercourse, or will use some other method of birth control, on days she is fertile.

Fertility awareness is best learned in a class.  A good fertility awareness teacher will provide individualized instruction based on a woman's own observations.  A class in fertility awareness should also provide suggestions on how to make abstinence during fertile times easier, or on how to remember to use other methods of birth control on those days.  Most fertility awareness teachers are associated with the Roman Catholic Church; inquiring at the local Catholic diocese is a good way of finding a teacher.  Catholic teachers usually call the method natural family planning, or NFP.  Local women's health clinics may be aware of non-religious fertility awareness teachers in their area.

In addition to these observational methods, there are statistical methods that estimate when a woman is fertile.  They are the Rhythm Method (a formula based on menstrual cycle length) and the Standard Days Method (can only be used by women whose menstrual cycles are always between 26 and 32 days).  While easier to learn, these statistical methods are not as accurate as the observational methods.

Fertility awareness methods do not protect against STDs.

==Withdrawal==
{{wikipedia|Coitus interruptus}}
Before ejaculation, a man may remove his penis from the woman's vagina, and ejaculate away from her genital area.  The fluid that comes out of a man's penis prior to ejaculation, known as Cowper's fluid or pre-ejaculate fluid, is not believed to contain viable sperm. (An exception is if the man has ejaculated recently - there may be sperm left from the previous ejaculation in the urethra.)

Precisely predicting the time of ejaculation is very difficult.  Getting even a small amount of semen in a woman's vagina or on her vulva results in a very high risk of pregnancy, and it is ''not'' recommended that couples rely only on withdrawal as birth control.  However, withdrawal may be used to increase the effectiveness of other methods.  Using withdrawal in combination with a hormonal method or barrier method will lower the risk of pregnancy.

If a couple is using withdrawal, the man should urinate after ejaculation and before any other sexual contact.  This is to clear any remaining sperm out of the urethra.

Withdrawal does not protect against STDs: infectious microorganisms can be present in pre-ejaculate fluid.

The ability to become pregnant and carry the pregnancy to term is known as '''fertility'''. '''Infertility''', also called '''subfertility''', is medically defined as having unprotected intercourse for one year and not becoming pregnant.  Even if they became pregnant easily, women may experience many miscarriages, known as repeated pregnancy loss (RPL).

== Causes of Infertility ==
{{wikipedia|Infertility}}
===In Women===
Endometriosis, blocked tubes, annovulation, luteal phase defect, hostile cervical mucus, hormonal disorders such as abnormal thyroid function and PCOS.

====Repeated Pregnancy Loss====
Over 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and it is very common for a woman to have one or two miscarriages before carrying a pregnancy to term.  If a woman has four miscarriages in a row, however, she is considered to have ''repeated pregnancy loss'', or RPL.  Possible causes of RPL should be tested for by a doctor, possibly a reproductive endocrinologist (RE).

===In Men===
Low total sperm count, low percentage of motile sperm, low percentage of normally shaped sperm. 

== Treatments ==
===Drugs that induce ovulation===
In women who do not ovulate, or ovulate only rarely, the drug clomifene citrate (Clomid) may be prescribed.  Clomid may also lengthen the luteal phase of women with luteal phase defect.  However, clomid decreases the production of cervical mucus, possibly decreasing the number of sperm that are able to pass through the cervix into the uterus and fallopian tubes.

More powerful drugs - known as injectables - may be used if several unsuccessful cycles with Clomid or similar drugs do not result in pregnancy.  While injectable cycles have higher pregnancy rates, they also have higher risks of conceiving multiple fetuses.

===Intra-Uterine Insemination===
In intra-uterine insemination (IUI), a medical practitioner places the man's sperm directly inside the woman's uterus.  This bypasses the cervix, overcoming any problems with cervical mucus and sperm transport.

===In Vitro Fertilization===
In in vitro fertilization (IVF), the woman is given drugs to cause many ovarian follicles (eggs) to mature instead of the normal one or two per menstrual cycle.  These eggs are harvested, and combined in a laboratory with the man's sperm.  The resulting embryos are monitored for quality, and several days after fertilization one or more embryos are placed in the woman's uterus.  Any embryos not transferred that cycle are frozen for future use.

===Donor Eggs and Sperm===
Some couples choose to use eggs, sperm, or both, from donors.  This may be because the man or woman does not have any eggs or sperm of their own; their eggs or sperm are unable to create embryos; or one or both members of the couple have genetic health problems that they do not want to pass on.  If the couple chooses to use donor eggs, they must use IVF.  If they are only using donor sperm, they may use IVF, IUI, or artificial insemination (AI).  (In AI, the semen is placed in the vagina, near the woman's cervix, with a diaphragm or diaphragm-style menstrual cup.)

===Surrogacy===
If the woman is not capable of carrying a pregnancy, they may hire a surrogate.  In traditional surrogacy, the man's sperm, or donor sperm, is used to impregnate the surrogate (through AI or IUI).  Any resulting child is genetically the child of the surrogate.  In gestational surrogacy, the intended mother's eggs, or donor eggs, are used to create embryos through IVF.  Any resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

There are a number of problems that can arise in the act of sex, and these are known collectively as '''sexual dysfunctions'''. 

== Male Dysfunctions ==

Males can suffer from a number of sexual dysfunctions, such as '''erectile dysfunction''', or '''premature ejaculation'''.

=== Erectile Dysfunction ===

'''Erectile dysfunction''', or &quot;ED&quot; is the inability of the man to achieve or maintain an adequately hard erection. This can be caused by poor blood-flow to the genitals, hormone problems, psychological problems, and a variety of other issues. Men who have high blood pressure or high cholesterol are at risk for developing ED. Similarly, men who have large amounts of psychological stress may be unable to develop an erection. ED is known to be provoked by alcohol '''brewers droop''', smoking and most recreational drugs. Some prescription drugs such as those used to control high blood pressure (hypertension) also cause ED

If the cause of ED is physical, '''Viagra''' can sometimes be used to help develop an erection. Viagra works by increasing the blood flow to the penis, and causing the penis to store more of that blood in the erectile tissue. ED is usually a symptom of something more serious, and Viagra should never be used without medical advice from a doctor. Speaking to a doctor about sexual dysfunction is often extremely embarrassing for the patient, but doctors are trained to listen and advise.

=== Premature Ejaculation ===

'''Premature ejaculation''' occurs when a man ejaculates quickly, after little or no sexual contact, and sometimes without orgasm. After a man ejaculates, he may lose his erection quickly, and be unable to satisfy his partner. Premature ejaculation can be caused by a variety of physical and mental issues, and a doctor should be consulted on the best way to treat it. Premature ejaculation should not be confused with '''pre-emission''' - a natural lubricant sometimes produced by some men when sexually aroused,

=== Delayed Ejaculation ===

'''Delayed Ejaculation''' is a condition where men are unable to ejaculate in a reasonable amount of time given &quot;adequate&quot; sexual stimulation. The average man will ejaculate in 5 minutes or less of active thrusting, and not being able to achieve orgasm in such a situation after a long period of time (or being unable to achieve one at all) is delayed ejaculation. A period of sexual abstinence and physical rest(three or four days) may help, but if the condition persists, medical advice is essential, as this may be a symptom of a more serious problem.

== Female Dysfunctions ==

===Anorgasmia===

'''Anorgasmia''' is a sexual dysfunction that can strike both males and females, but is significantly more common in females. Also, anorgasmia has almost never been studied in males, so there isn't enough data or statistics on that subject.

Anorgasmia is the inability to have an orgasm, under the influence of adequate sexual stimulation. Anorgasmia is highly related to delayed ejaculation in males, except delayed orgasm is marked by not being able to achieve orgasm in an acceptable timeframe, while anorgasmia is marked by being unable to achieve orgasm at all.

There is a studied link between anorgasmia and anti-depressant medications. Anorgasmia does not necessarily prevent conception.

== Treatment ==

The greatest obstacle to treatment of sexual disorders is the social '''embarrassment''' of speaking about very private matters to a public medical professional. The longer the problem is kept secret, the more difficult the treatment. Because satisfactory sexual function is dependent on good health, dysfunction often is a symptom of some unrelated medical or psychological condition which is likely to be a lot less sensitive to social castigation. '''Early medical consultation, preferably with your sexual partner''' for support, can often remedy the situation with only minor medicinal intervention, especially in young patients.

'''Sexual Harassment''' or '''Rape''' is a form of verbal or physical abuse where the target of the harassment is repeatedly insulted or addressed in an unwanted, sexual manner. Sexual harassment can include unwanted touching, rubbing, or groping, unwanted comments of a sexual nature, repeated offers for or requests of sexual contact, and calling a person sex-related names. &quot;Sexual Harassment&quot; is a very broad term for a large number of actions, all of which bring unwanted sexual attention to the victim. Sexual harassment is considered a crime in most jurisdictions.

== How to Spot Harassment ==
Sexual harassment, like all other forms of '''mobbing or bullying''' is defined by the sufferer. If someone makes unwelcome advances, and do not desist when it is explained their action is unwelcome then that persistently unwelcome behaviour may have a psychological consequence, such as a reluctance to be in the presence of the offender.
== How to Stop Harassment ==
Reacting to bad behaviour with complaints or threats is likely to aggravate rather than moderate the unwelcome behaviour. It is best to try to ignore provocation at the time it occurs, and ask someone you trust to convey your displeasure or distress to the aggressor. 

== Get Help/Support ==
Many institutions such as schools, major employers and police have trained '''mediators''' to intervene. A mediation typically involves one or two mediators whose job is to take highly charged emotional language from the parties concerned in the offence and to '''rephrase''' statements in neutral language. 

'''Mediation is not easy''', because it means that victim and aggressor must face each other and try to understand the other's point of view. It is however psychologically much more effective and permanent than conventional punishment, which often gives aggressors a bizarre sense of pride, a tangible reward for bad behaviour.

      <comment>That is not always the technical definition of sex in the case of rape and therefore isn't helpful here</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

'''Rape''' is a criminal act where the aggressor forces the victim to engage in sex or unwanted sexual contact. Rape is an aggressive, violent crime, that can have serious criminal repercussions for the aggressor, and serious mental, emotional, and physical repercussions for the victim. Rape can occur within marriage.

== What Is Rape ==

The definition of what precisely is &quot;Rape&quot; is different depending on the legal jurisdiction where the crime takes place. Many instances of forced sexual contact are referred to by the general term &quot;Sexual Assault&quot;. This page will consider all forced sexual contact as being &quot;Rape&quot;, and will use that term accordingly. It is important to note that the definition of rape here is going to be more broad then it likely is in the law where the reader lives. This page is not meant to constitute legal counsel.

Rape occurs when sexual acts are performed without the express consent of one party. This can include, but is not limited to:
*Instances when '''consent is forced''', such as through threats of violence.
*Instances when '''consent is coerced''', such as between people with authority (doctors, teachers, other leaders) and subordinates. 
*When the victim is below the '''age of consent''', and the other partner is an adult.
*When the victim is '''incapable of giving informed consent''', such as while being under the influence of drugs or alcohol or a mental disorder.

Rape is most often performed by a male attacker against a female victim. However, this is not always true, and it is not uncommon for men to be raped by women or other men, or for women to be raped by other women. 

Rape is always illegal because it is typically harmful to physical or mental well being of the victim. Even in a case where unwanted sexual contact is not considered &quot;rape&quot;, it will likely be illegal as an act of sexual assault, common assault, domestic violence or some other violent crime. Threats of rape, or suggestions of unwanted sexual nature are typically instances of sexual harassment, which is also illegal.

=== Statutory Rape ===

The '''age of consent''' is the age at which it is deemed children are able to make informed decisions about sexual participation. People below the age of consent are considered &quot;minors&quot;, and people above the age of consent are considered &quot;adults&quot;. It is typically against the law for an adult to have sex with a minor, even if the sex is consensual. In an instance where a minor is married to an adult (assuming such practice is legal), sex between the couple is allowed as being part of a married union. The rape between a minor and an adult is typically called '''statutory rape''', although that term can also be used in different situations.

In the case of statutory rape where the minor has consented, the act of sex with an adult can have profound, troubling and long lasting psychological effects on the development of the minor, and could lead to problems later in life.

=== Date Rape ===

Date rape occurs when when a victim is attacked by a friend or other acquaintance. This is different from other cases of rape where the victim typically does not know the attacker. It is not uncommon for rape to be committed by:

*Friends or acquaintances
*Boyfriends, girlfriends, or other people on a date.
*People involved in a long term relationship such as marriage.

It is important to note that unwanted sexual contact is always rape, even if the victim and the attacker are in a sexual relationship or a marriage. Date Rape can occur when one person has sex with a friend or acquaintance when that person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. There is even a special class of drugs known as &quot;date rape drugs&quot; that are used to subdue the victim. These drugs can be administered in secret, through food or drinks, even in public areas. All people, especially women, are warned to keep their food and drinks close. People should watch their food to ensure that it is not tampered with, and people should also not accept free food or drinks from strangers.

== Lasting Effects ==

Rape causes a number of harmful side-effects in the physical and emotional well being of the victim. The issues vary widely based on how the crime itself is handled, how the victim is seen by society and culture, and what sort of support is available. In all cases, rape is a traumatic defilement that is never &quot;gotten over&quot;. 

=== Mental Effects ===

Rape victims may experience intense and sometimes unpredictable emotions, both immediately after the attack, and in the weeks and months following it. Victims are often severely traumatized by the assault for the first few weeks and months following the incident. It is also not uncommon for the victim to experience strong memories of the attack, or have nightmares. 

The victim may suffer from psychological upheaval, including the development of near-phobias. Many victims will avoid being alone for long periods of time, and some experience permanent personality changes. At the same time, the victim may feel feelings of shame and reject attempts to reach them, or shun the company of others. 

The victim may have difficulty concentrating, sleeping, eating, and normally functioning. He or she may feel jumpy or on edge. The victim may also experience severe, highly disruptive symptoms that make it incredibly difficult to function in first few months following the assault. These problems may disrupt the victim's daily life and prevent them from seeking assistance or telling friends and family members, resulting in Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Symptoms of this are:

* feeling numb and detached, like being in a daze or a dream, or feeling that the world is strange and unreal
* difficulty remembering important parts of the assault
* reliving the assault through repeated thoughts, memories, or nightmares
* avoidance of things (places, thoughts, feelings) that remind the victim of the assault
* anxiety or increased arousal (difficulty sleeping, concentrating, etc.)

It is important for all victims of rape to seek help and possibly counselling. There are people who can help with the emotional side effects of an attack, and to help reduce the possibility of symptoms associated with rape manifesting, or, if they have done so, from becoming permanent fixtures. 

=== Physical Effects ===

In the short term, rape may cause physical trauma in the form of:
#Physical strikes and violence that accompany the attack. 
#Damage to genitals, particularly to the vaginal area, vulva, or possibly anal passage depending on specifics.

In the longer term, rape may lead to the transmission of an STD, or even to pregnancy. It is important for all rape victims to visit a hospital to test for STD and pregnancy, and also to help heal some of the physical trauma associated with the rape. During such a hospital visit, doctors may take DNA samples and photographic documentation, that might help to catch and convict the attacker.

==Rape and Interpersonal Relationships==

Rape victims have problems dealing with the enormity of the damage done to them, mentally and physically, and this spills over into their relationships with others. Rape victims often times experience feelings of shame and self-disgust, anxiety, depression, or melancholy, which can disrupt even close friendships. Most people do not know how to handle the rape victim, especially in cases that result in severe personality changes. 

In romantic relationships, there are further issues to consider. It is usually difficult for victims of rape to operate sexually in a normal manner, especially within the first 6 to 8 months of the incident. Many victims can have difficulties with sexual intimacy or even close romantic physical contact for a long period of time after the actual assault has occurred. In date rape situations this is of particular note, since many victims who are date raped tend to avoid situations where this can happen again, to the point of avoiding relationships altogether. 

Reactions in existing relationships after a rape are so varied that any exact descriptions would be speculation. However, some victims can no longer deal with sexual activity of any kind after a rape, which puts stresses and can dissolve relationships and marriages.

== Facts About Rape ==

There are a number of common myths about rape. Here, we will contradict many of those myths, and present some facts:

*When a person says &quot;no&quot;, or when a person has verbally refused consent, any further sexual contact or actions are considered rape. In other words, &quot;no means no&quot;.
*A person is not &quot;asking to be raped&quot; because of body language or the type of clothing they are wearing. Dressing or acting in a provocative way is not an &quot;invitation&quot; for rape.
*It is never the victim's fault for being raped, even if the victim is in &quot;the wrong place&quot;, or if they have interacted with the &quot;wrong people&quot;. Rape is always the fault of the attacker.
*Rape is not about sexual lust, but instead is usually about violent dominance, mastery and control. Rape during military action is considered an illegal instrument of war and is now contrary to international law, and so susceptible to severe punishment by all military, criminal and international tribunals.

== Get Help/Support ==

It is important for people who have been victims of rape to get help. This includes, but is not limited to:
*Medical help, including STD and pregnancy tests.
*Psychological help, such as counselling.
*Help and support from friends and family. Rape is deeply embarrassing for the victim, but secrecy is likely to be psychologically the most damaging strategy.

Many victims choose not to get help, and some even choose not to talk about the rape to anybody. This is a mistake, and could lead to severe mental and physical health problems in the future. All victims of rape should get the appropriate help, and help is almost always freely available.

Here are some resources to turn to if you or somebody you know has been the victim of rape:
* [http://www.rapevictimadvocates.org/ Rape Victim Advocates]
* [http://www.pandys.org Pandora's Aquarium, a message board for rape and sexual abuse survivors]
* [http://www.rainn.org Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network (RAINN)]

There are many other resources available, including many local organizations in different communities.

I think that is is important to note here how concepts are implemented. Control systems in MATlab will use both the numeric methods and programming methods to achieve the design criteria. This article is not meant to teach the theory of controls.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

Sexual health is vital to human society because we are all mortal, and have to produce healthy children if society is to survive. Human sexuality is a complicated topic that affects everybody. Most societies impose strict rules about who may do what with whom because those rules have helped those societies survive. These rules are not universal, but they are almost always very strongly enforced either by public authorities or informally through social ridicule or castigation. 

Most people experience strong periods of sexual desire, or engage in sexual fantasies at some points in their lives. Because most societies prohibit or inhibit any exploration or discussion of sexual topics, many people also worry whether or not their particular fantasies or desires are &quot;normal&quot;. As long as your objective is '''to give pleasure to your real or imagined partner''', your fantasies are perfectly healthy and mature. If your objective is solely your own pleasure, they are masturbatory and immature, and probably you will grow out of it. If your objective is to cause pain or harm to yourself or others in order to provoke a pleasant feeling in yourself then there is a serious problem that you should discuss with a professional psychologist or medical doctor. 

== Masturbation ==

[[w:Masturbation|'''Masturbation''']] is the action of a person manually stimulating their own genitals to achieve orgasm. Masturbation is a completely normal activity, and many people in this world do it, at least occasionally. Masturbation does not carry any of the risk associated with sex: there is no way to become pregnant from masturbation, and there is no risk of contracting an STD from masturbation, except in the case of mutual masturbation (performed with other people).

For very young males, 'inadvertent' masturbation can occur when writhing about on the belly, playing with things such as toy cars, or building blocks on the ground. Older boys may use their hands, and is some risk of causing some minor distortion to the erect penis if the penis is held tightly in the fist, rather than being caressed gently with thumb, middle finger and index finger, but the shape of the shaft is purely cosmetic and most unlikely to have any functional effect. Very young females often stimulate themselves by rhythmical rocking, and later may find certain sports, especially cycling and horse riding, to be socially acceptable and attractive activities. Reliable data is almost impossible to obtain, but it seems girls are far less likely to discover manual masturbation techniques, which seem to be almost universal in boys by about the time of puberty.

Contrary to popular myth, masturbation certainly does not cause deafness, blindness nor provoke 'weak mindedness' or other disabilities.

== Sexual Fantasy ==

Sexual fantasy, or the act of fantasizing about specific sexual acts, or acts with specific partners is a normal practice that many people engage in. Sexual fantasy can occur in dreams at night, or can take the form of daydreams. 

== Sexuality ==
Sexuality is very much imposed upon us according to our sex. Boys are traditionally given '''masculine''' toy guns and either allowed or encouraged to fight, whilst girls are given '''feminine''' baby dolls and encouraged to cook and clean. This sexual and gender polarisation helped society to survive in primitive times. Homosexuality among males ('''gays''') has always been highly regulated, even in early Greek society, where it was sometimes  encouraged or mandated between a boy and his mentor. '''Queers''' (males engaging in anal sex, known as sodomy with females or buggery with other males) have frequently been punished by death.

Since the middle of the 20th century, homosexuality has been decriminalized in many western societies, but there is still much social castigation of any sexual activity not intended to produce children. Most people are somewhat '''bisexual''' and sexually attracted to both males and females in different proportions or in different situations. However, since any society of mortals depends on the production of children and so tend to produce rules to promote stable and supportive families. It is considered important, by some, for young people to nurture their heterosexuality and suppress their homosexual desires. Many strongly homosexual people do contract marriage and engage in heterosexual relationships whilst privately fantasising their secret, homosexual desires. In such cases, psychological counselling may be helpful,

== Sexual Partners ==

Sexual partners can come from many different venues. Ideally, sexual partners are also romantic partners, or &quot;lovers&quot; who are in a stable social relationship which is a 'proto-family' in which they wish to conceive children. However, sexual partners can also be merely promiscuous or &quot;casual partners&quot;, with whom there is no lasting romantic relationship after the act of sex is over. Since sexual activity has strong physical and emotional consequences '''a quick fling''' often has serious and unexpected side effects, particularly when performed by those in a romantic relationship of whom sexual '''faithfulness''' or '''trust''' is expected 
Sexual partners may be male or female, but the types of sex that you can engage in is highly dependent on the gender of your partner.  When both partners are male, or both partners are female, they are said to be &quot;homosexual&quot;. When one partner is male, and the other partner is female, they are said to be &quot;heterosexual&quot;. Religious, moral, and political factors might be involved in the process of selecting a sexual partner.

== Sex Toys ==

[[Image:Silicon Dildo.jpg|thumb|right|A purple silicone sex toy.]]

'''Sex Toys''' are inanimate objects that are used to stimulate the genitals or other sensitive regions to facilitate reaching orgasm. Sex toys may be used alone (during masturbation), or with a partner. Some of the most common sex toys are dildos and vibrators, which are penis-shaped objects (usually metal, silicone, or plastic) that can be inserted into the vagina or the anus, or attached to a penis. There are many other types of sex toys in existence, however, and it is not possible to list or describe all of them.

'''Note:''' Sex toys should always be well cleaned, and they should not be shared. Sex toys can transmit STDs from one partner to another. Silicone sex toys are often recommended by manufacturers as they are non-porous, and can be submerged in boiling water for proper sterilization. Non-silicone plastic sex toys should not be shared, or if they are shared, should be used with a barrier of sorts placed between the toy and the user of the toy.

== Cleaning ==

=== Cleaning for Boys ===

Males should clean their genitals by first withdrawing any foreskin to fully expose the glans and applying gentle (toilet) soap with water and then rinsing thoroughly. The penis, testicles, and perineum (the area between the testicles and the anus) and the anus itself all should be cleaned regularly.  Any flesh ordinarily protected by the foreskin is more sensitive to certain chemicals, such as soap, than other parts of the body; some sources advise using water only to clean it.  A waxy substance known as '''smegma''' builds up under the foreskin.  While smegma helps protect the skin by keeping it moist and assisting in lubrication, excessive build-up may provide a medium for bacterial infection. The area under the foreskin should be dried completely after cleaning, to prevent moisture from attracting germs and mildew. Shaving of the penis and testicles is not uncommon, in boys and men, but care should be taken not to cut yourself in those sensitive areas.

=== Cleaning for Girls ===

The vagina is a self-cleaning organ.  Douching (inserting solutions into the vagina) can alter the types of bacteria that are present, change the pH, and increase the risk of infection.  Wearing cotton underwear and loose clothing to promote air circulation can reduce the risk of infection.

The skin in the vulva may be more sensitive to certain chemicals, such as soap, than other parts of the body.  While the vulva may be cleaned with just water, or with water and soap (as long as none is inserted into the vagina), this type of cleaning is not normally necessary.

After urination, women should always wipe beginning near the front of the vulva, and move backwards toward the anus.  This is to prevent dragging harmful bacteria from the region near the anus into the urethra, where they can travel to the bladder and cause an infection.

Any object inserted into the vagina (such as a diaphragm and hands) should always first be washed with soap and water.  It is not uncommon for women to shave or wax their genitals, but again, care should be taken to avoid cuts or scalding.

== Virginity ==

A person who has never had sex is known as a '''virgin'''. Some people claim to be virgins if they have not had vaginal intercourse, but have had oral or anal sex instead. Some people use the word &quot;virgin&quot; to describe a person who has had no sexual contact (or limited fondling), while others use the word &quot;virgin&quot; to describe someone who has never had sex willingly.

Women who are virgins may experience some discomfort during the first few times they engage in vaginal intercourse. This can be due to the stretching of the vaginal canal, and possibly through the breaking of the '''hymen'''.

People who have had sex, but choose to stop having it sometimes refer to themselves as ''born-again virgins''. 

=== Hymen ===

Many women are born with a special membrane in their vagina known as a '''hymen'''. The hymen blocks part of the vaginal canal, and can be broken during the first time a girl has vaginal intercourse. However, the presence or absence of the hymen is not sufficient to determine whether a woman is a virgin or not. Some women are not born with a hymen, and the hymen may be broken or stretched open by activities such as riding a bicycle, strenuous exercise, or even (occasionally) tampon use.

If a woman has her hymen intact during her first experience with vaginal intercourse, the hymen will be broken by the penetration. Breaking the hymen often causes pain and bleeding. In cultures where the hymen is considered a vital mark of virginity prior to marriage a surgical 'repair' operation may be performed clandestinely.

== Specialist Doctors ==

There are a number of specialized types of doctors that deal with sexuality, pregnancy, and childbirth. Here are some of the most common types:

;Gynaecologist: Gynaecologists are doctors who specialize in the female reproductive system. Gynaecologists help women find appropriate contraceptives, do pelvic exams and pap smears (to test for cancer or other abnormal conditions of the reproductive organs), and diagnose and treat vaginal infections.  Gynaecologists also help women who have problems associated with intercourse, such as pain.  While all of these services are also offered by internists and family doctors, gynaecologists have more experience with them.
;Obstetrician: Obstetricians are doctors who who specialize in the female reproductive system, pregnancy, and birth. Gynaecologists usually are also obstetricians, and this combination is frequently abbreviated as &quot;OB/GYN&quot;.
;Urologist: A urologist is a doctor who specializes in the urinary tracts of men and women, and also the reproductive system of men.
;Andrologist: An andrologist is a doctor who specializes in the male reproductive system. Andrologists are not as common as urologists or gynaecologists.
;Reproductive Endocrinologist: Reproductive endocrinologists specialize in treating infertility in both men and women.
;Oncologist: Oncologists specialize in treating cancer. Some common cancers include breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and testicular cancer.

In addition to these specialist doctors, men and women should also regularly have check ups with a family physician or internist (an internist specializes in treatment of adults, while a family physician treats both adults and children). It is important to keep all doctors aware of the medicines you are on, so that they don't accidentally prescribe conflicting medications.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

An Event Listener, once set to an applet object waits for some action to be performed on it, be it mouse click, mouse hover, pressing of keys, click of button, etc. The class you are using (e.g. &lt;code&gt;JButton&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) reports the activity to a class set by the class using it. That method then decides on how to react because of that action, usually with a series of if statements to determine which action it was performed on. &lt;code&gt;''source''.getSource()&lt;/code&gt; will return the name of the object that the event was performed on, while the ''source'' is the object passed to the function when the action is performed. Every single time the action is performed, it calls the method.

== ActionListener ==
&lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; is an interface that could be implemented in order to determine how certain event should be handled. When implementing an interface, all methods in that interface should be implemented, &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; interface has one method to implement named &lt;code&gt;actionPerformed()&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[#code-listing-6|code listing 9.6]] shows how to implement &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt;:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-6&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 9.6: EventApplet.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;21-43&quot;&gt;
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Button;
import java.awt.Container;
import java.awt.Dialog;
import java.awt.FlowLayout;
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.Label;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

public class EventApplet extends Applet {

    /**
     * Init.
     */
    public void init() {
        Button clickMeButton = new Button(&quot;Click me&quot;);

        final Applet eventApplet = this;

        ActionListener specificClassToPerformButtonAction = new ActionListener() {

            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
                Dialog dialog = new Dialog(getParentFrame(eventApplet), false);
                dialog.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
                dialog.add(new Label(&quot;Hi!!!&quot;));
                dialog.pack();
                dialog.setLocation(100, 100);
                dialog.setVisible(true);
            }

            private Frame getParentFrame(Container container) {
                if (container == null) {
                    return null;
                } else if (container instanceof Frame) {
                    return (Frame) container;
                } else {
                    return getParentFrame(container.getParent());
                }
               
            }
        };
        clickMeButton.addActionListener(specificClassToPerformButtonAction);

        add(clickMeButton);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

When you compile and run the above code, the message &quot;Hi!!!&quot; will appear when you click on the button.

== MouseListener ==
Applet mouse listener does not differ from the AWT mouse listener in general. When the mouse is in the applet area, the listener receives notifications about the mouse clicks and drags (if &lt;code&gt;MouseListener&lt;/code&gt; is registered) and mouse movements (if &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt; is registered). As applets are often small, it is a common practice to let applet itself to implement the mouse listeners.

One way to keep in touch with your group is through the use of talk pages. [[User talk: RiRi82|RiRi82 Talk page]] is a good place to leave messages for RiRi if you have trouble meeting up in the real world. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 21:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

==Image copyright status==

Hi Jami,

Please don't forget to add the copyright status of any images you upload to wikibooks. It can be detrimental to the book later on if the images need to be deleted :).

Thanks for the help, we actually created that picture, and just didn't know what copy right to place with it.  We'll try and figure it out, but if it gets deleted i don't think the chapter will miss anything.  Thank you again!--[[User:Jami 7|Jami_7]] 04:57, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

You can keep in touch with your group by writing messages on [[User talk: Jami 7|Jami's Talk page]]. You could also leave messages on the discussion board for your chapter, but talk pages are good for more personalized messages (but keep in mind it is still available to the public view).

== Images, HTML ==

Hello RiRi! I fixed your images. Wikibooks doesn't work well with HTML code, so tags like &lt;img src=&quot;Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg&quot;&gt; don't work correctly. To make an image, you should write a link like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I also removed some of the other HTML code from the page, and replaced most of it with equivalent Wikicode. For a tutorial on wikicode, see [[Help:Contents|The HELP wikibook]].
If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask!. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:46, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

[[Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg|right|framed|This is a dude in a picture]]

Also, if you want to put an image on the right, you can say:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg|right]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

and to put it on the left, you can say:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg|left]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you want to put a frame around it, you can say:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg|framed]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

And you can put all this together, plus add a description:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Walter Bradord Cannon.jpg|right|framed|This is a dude in a picture]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:Sorry... the &quot;template&quot; is what adds new section to your talk page for each image. I didn't see the point in making your talk page 1,000 lines long :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:50, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

::Hi... just got your message on wikipedia (you're usually better off leaving a message on my talk here, rather than there). What you need to add is one of these tags: [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]]. If you made the image yourself, you can simply add the licence you feel most comfortable with. If you got the image from somewhere else, you need to verify that it is either public domain, or that the copyright permits the image to be duplicated and used here on wikibooks ''and anywhere else, for any reason'', because any wikibook may be printed, distributed and sold by other parties following the rules of the GFDL. 

::While this does make things more complicated for editors like you who are trying to add images that improve the books, it's very important because of copyright laws and wikimedia policies. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:31, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

*p. 9 (October 31, 1950).  One of the games of [[w:marbles|marbles]] involves shooting one marble out of a ring with another.

*p. 11 (November 17, 1950).  Although ''Peanuts'' is famous for its complete absence of adults, they were occasionally seen and heard in the earliest years of the strip (see [[#p197|June 3, 1952]]).

*p. 46 (March 8, 1951).  Patty is using a [[w:typewriter|typewriter]].

*p. 49 (March 21, 1951).  &quot;Mad dog&quot; refers to a dog with [[w:rabies|rabies]].  Rabid dogs are usually killed by local authorities (c.f. ''[[w:To Kill a Mockingbird|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'').

*p. 67 (May 23, 1951).  &quot;Second childhood&quot; refers to mental impairment as a result of old age.  It was a [[w:euphemism|euphemism]] for such things as what we now know to be [[w:Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's disease]].  

*p. 71 (June 4, 1951).  In the early 20th century, people unhappy with the squalor and crime of big cities went &quot;back to the soil&quot; and became farmers.  It was an attempt to re-connect with nature and enjoy &quot;the simple life.&quot; What Charlie Brown was referring to was playing in his sandbox.

*p. 79 (July 4, 1951).  It is generally thought that the convention of a man walking nearest the curb is so that he and not the lady would be splashed by passing carriages or by someone above emptying a [[w:chamber pot|chamber pot]].

*p. 84 (July 21, 1951).  In the early part of the 20th century, when a young lady went out on a date, she didn't need to bring any money since the man would pay for everything.  But it was recommended that she carry some &quot;mad money&quot;, in case the man did something that angered her (made her mad), so she could end the date and have her own money to take a [[w:tram|street car]] or [[w:taxicab|taxi]] home.

*p. 91 (August 13, 1951).  &quot;Comic magazine&quot; and &quot;[[w:comic book|comic book]]&quot; are used interchangeably throughout the early days of the strip, with the former eventually dropping out of use.  (See p. 17, November 29, 1950 for the first use of &quot;comic book&quot;.)

*p. 108 (October 13, 1951).  In a less politically sensitive time (white) children would play &quot;Cowboys and Indians,&quot; a game in which they would chase and pretend to shoot each other, with either imaginary guns&amp;mdash;a child's index finger being the gun's barrel and the thumb the hammer (See Volume 2's August 7 1954, p. 250, for Lucy's clever take on this &quot;hand gun&quot;) -- or using toy weapons. (See p. 148, February 10 1952, for a full-scale production of the game.)

*p. 114 (November 1, 1951).  Children in the United States used to ask for money or candy on [[w:Halloween|Halloween]].  In the 21st century, it's become almost exclusively candy.

*p. 124 (December 6, 1951).  The proper technique for [[w:ice fishing|ice fishing]] is to cut a hole in the ice&amp;mdash;which is what Charlie Brown does six days later in the December 13, 1951 strip, p. 126.

*p. 125 (December 10, 1951).  Someone else has drawn a picture of Charlie Brown on the sidewalk.  He adds the legend &quot;Don't Tread on Me&quot; so that people won't scuff up his picture (scuffing him in effigy).  The phrase &quot;Don't Tread on Me&quot; along with the image of a rattlesnake became popular during the [[w:American Revolution|American Revolution]] and is seen on the [[w:Gadsden flag|Gadsden flag]].  It remains a symbol of defiance against oppression.

*p. 135  (January 12, 1952).  Charlie Brown is &quot;driving&quot; a [[w:Soapbox (car)|soapbox car]], a car made of wooden boxes, with no motor, that only goes downhill due to gravity.

*p. 137 (January 15, 1952).  The expression &quot;Born on the wrong side of the (railroad) tracks&quot; means to be poor, but Charlie Brown is using it here to mean unlucky.  The snow man was unlucky enough to be born where it's sunny (because it's melted him).

*p. 137 (January 16, 1952). Prelude in C major from [[w:Johann Sebastian Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[w:Well-Tempered Clavier|Well-Tempered Clavier]] (Book 1), [[w:BWV|BWV846]].

*p. 140 (January 23, 1952).  This musical piece is more commonly referred to as Beethoven's [[w:Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Piano Sonata No. 29 in B flat major'']].  This is also the music for March 25 and April 14.  A Hammer-Klavier (in correct German, ''Hammerklavier'') is simply the German word for piano.  Schulz lettered those German words in [[w:Blackletter|blackletter script]], which was still in use in Germany at the time. (See also p. 206, June 24, 1952, below).

*p. 144 (February 1, 1952).  The large disc they are listening to is a [[w:Gramophone record|phonograph record]], the precursor to a [[w:compact disc|compact disc]].

*p. 146 (February 4, 1952).  [[w:Albert Payson Terhune|Albert Payson Terhune]] was the author of many stories and novels about dogs, most notably ''Lad, a Dog''.

* p. 148 (February 10, 1952).  Charlie Brown is mis-singing [[w:Stephen Foster|Stephen Foster]]'s &quot;[[w:Old Folks at Home|Old Folks at Home]]&quot; (More commonly know by its first line, &quot;Way down upon the Swanee River&quot;).   &quot;Old Chisel Home Trail&quot; is the [[w:Chisholm Trail|Chisholm Trail]], a cattle drive route from Texas to Kansas in the 19th Century.

*p. 160 (March 9, 1952).  The joke is that in the three hours they played (a common length of time for a round of [[w:golf|golf]]), they only made it as far as the 1st (of 18) holes.

*p. 162 (March 13, 1952). [[w:Banbury|Banbury Cross]] is a real place in England, but Charlie Brown is undoubtedly thinking of the nursery rhyme &quot;[[w:Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross|Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross]].&quot;

*p.169 (March 30, 1952).  The songs Lucy wants to hear are &quot;[[w:Three Blind Mice|Three Blind Mice]]&quot; and &quot;[[w:Twinkle Twinkle Little Star|Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]].&quot;

*p. 171 (April 3, 1952).  Charlie Brown is delivering the traditional whistle of appreciation for feminine beauty (though it usually has two notes: [[w:Wolf-whistling|WEEEET-WOOO]]), and Patty takes offense.  Schroeder, being more musical, delivers a mini-concert to Violet and gets to walk off with her.  It is the melody to &quot;Traumerei&quot; from [[w:Robert Schumann|Schumann's]] &quot;Scenes from Childhood&quot; for piano.

*p. 179 (April 21, 1952).  &quot;Rubbers&quot; is another term for [[w:galoshes|galoshes]].

*p. 182 (April 29, 1952).  Charlie Brown thinks they need him to play the card game [[w:Contract bridge|bridge]], which requires four people. (Six months later, p. 257, October 22 1952, that is what he's needed for.)

*p. 194 (May 27, 1952).  Snoopy's first words in the strip, as opposed to &quot;Smack Smack&quot; (see p. 2,1 December 11, 1950, 2nd panel) and other animal noises.  

*{{anchor|p197}}p. 197 (June 3, 1952).  The first time that adults (except for [[w:Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]) are seen in the strip, even if only on TV. (See Volume 2, pp. 215, 218, and 221 for whole crowds of adults as Lucy plays in a golf tournament.)

*p. 201 (June 14, 1952).  &quot;Sweetmeats&quot; is just another term for [[w:confectionery|confectionery]] products, including candy.

*p. 202 (June 15, 1952).  Patty is misquoting [[w:William Congreve|William Congreve]]'s line from his 1697 play ''The Mourning Bride'': &quot;Musick has Charms to sooth a savage ''Breast''. . .&quot;

*p. 205 (June 22, 1952).  The violent names and nature of some comic books at the time were epitomized by [[w:EC Comics|EC Comics]] and criticized by [[w:Fredric Wertham|Fredric Wertham]] in his book ''[[w:Seduction of the Innocent|Seduction of the Innocent]]''.

*p. 206 (June 24, 1952).  &quot;[[w:Eine Kleine Nachtmusik|Eine Kleine Nachtmusik]]&quot; is famous musical piece by [[w:Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. ''Jawohl'' is German for an emphatic &quot;Yes&quot; (similar to &quot;of course&quot; or &quot;you bet&quot;).  

*p. 206 (June 25, 1952).  Both 33 and 20 are terrible scores for any hole in [[w:golf|golf]].

*p. 218 (July 21, 1952).  Because he wrote about collies, these are almost certainly [[w:Albert Payson Terhune|Albert Payson Terhune]] books again (see p. 146 above).

* p. 228 (August 15, 1952).  A [[w:shutout|shutout]] is a game in which one team wins without allowing the opposing team to score at all.  So, yes, their opponents having scored 63 runs, Charlie Brown's team has no chance of shutting them out.

*p. 231 (August 22, 1952).  Lucy is confusing checkers with the card game [[w:Contract bridge|bridge]], where a [[w:Coup (bridge)|''coup'' and ''grand coup'']] are various sophisticated card plays.  Charlie Brown doesn't appear to know the difference either.  But he soon learns to play (See p. 257, below).

*p. 243 (September 19, 1952). Linus's first appearance (although his name wouldn't be mentioned until September 22). Schulz: &quot;[O]ne day I was doodling on a piece of paper and I drew this little character with some wild hair straggling down from the top of his head and I showed it to a friend of mine... whose name was Linus Maurer. For no reason at all I had written his name under it... [t]hen I thought, why not put this character in the strip and make him Lucy's brother?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;herald&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth|year=1967|month=September|title=A Visit with Charles Schulz|journal=Christian Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*p. 246 (September 25, 1952). [[w:Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean from the New World. [[w:Daniel Boone|Daniel Boone]] was an 18th century American frontiersman and Indian-fighter.

*p. 248 (October 1, 1952).  [[w:Perfect pitch|Perfect pitch]] (also called absolute pitch) is ability to sing any individual note on command and/or recognize any individual note upon hearing it played.  It is often thought to be a sign of musical genius.  Charlie Brown is confusing it the [[w:pitching|pitching]] in [[w:baseball|baseball]].

*p. 264 (November 7, 1952).  The strip's first use of &quot;fuss-budget&quot;, a term seldom seen outside of ''Peanuts.'' It means one who fusses over insignificant matters; a complainer.

*p. 267 (November 15, 1952).  Note the use of &quot;[[w:deep focus|deep focus]]&quot; on both Lucy and the telephone.  Quite dramatic.  Right out of ''[[w:Citizen Kane|Citizen Kane]]'', which the strip would refer to frequently in later years.

*p. 268 (November 16, 1952).  The first time Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown.

*p. 278 (December 9, 1952).  Schroeder is playing the Prelude in C major from Book One of [[w:Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] &quot;Well Tempered Clavier.&quot;

*p. 282 (December 18, 1952).  [[w:Carnegie Hall|Carnegie Hall]] is one of the finest American venues for the performance of classical music.  In the 1950s and 60s especially it was considered the height of musical accomplishment to perform there.

The person generally credited with first doing this is [[w:Chuck Yeager|Chuck Yeager]] on October 14, 1947.

*p. 10 (January 22, 1955).  This may be inspired by the 1940 film, ''Edison, the Man'', which starred [[w:Spencer Tracy|Spencer Tracy]] and told the story of the earlier years of inventor [[w:Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison]].

*p. 16 (February 4, 1955).  An egotist is someone self-centered, who thinks they are &quot;the center of the universe.&quot;

*p. 21 (February 15, 1955).  In actual [[w:farming|farming]], &quot;parity&quot; was the ratio of farm income to farm expenditure with 1910-1914 as a base. Farm interests from 1920s to 1960s wanted federal programs to raise their income to parity. 

*p. 33 (March 15, 1955).  Lucy is playing with some famous sayings.  &quot;There's a sucker born every minute,&quot; (i.e. you can always find someone to con) is attributed to showman [[w:P.T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]].  &quot;Two's company, but three's a crowd.&quot;  &quot;If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.&quot;

*p. 45 (April 11, 1955).  [[w:Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett]] was a 19th-century American folk hero and frontiersman.  The Walt Disney-produced [[w:Davy Crockett#Television|television show about him]] launched Crockett mania in the U.S. and England.  The show's theme song, &quot;[[w:The Ballad of Davy Crockett|The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]&quot; was a number #1 hit record and children starting wearing [[w:coonskin cap|coonskin cap]]s.

*p. 48 (April 19, 1955).  Charlie Brown is reading a [[w:Pogo|Pogo]] comic book.

*p. 57 (May 10, 1955) Buffalo Bill was an army scout and frontiersman who later went into the entertainment business, running his &quot;[[w:Wild West|Wild West]]&quot; show.  [[w:Annie Oakley|Annie Oakley]] was a female [[w:sharpshooter|sharpshooter]] and part of the show.  She was so talented that she is generally considered American's first female superstar.  Although she wasn't actually part of the settling of the West, she dressed in buckskins to play up that image.  It would not be too far a stretch to say that this strip is commentary on the rise of [[w:feminism|feminism]] that occurred after [[w:World War II|World War II]].

*p. 60 (May 16, 1955) Almost all clovers have three leafs.  Due to their rarity, a [[w:four-leaf clover|four-leaf clover]] is considered a good luck charm.

*p. 66 (June 1, 1955).  The first appearance of one of the 1950's hottest fads, the [[w:Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett]] [[w:coonskin cap|coonskin cap]].(See p. 45, above.) / [[w:Sam Snead|Sam Snead]] was a professional golfer famous for his large straw hats.

*p. 69 (June 6, 1955).  The song &quot;[[w:The Ballad of Davy Crockett|The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]&quot; claims many fantastic things about the man, among them that he killed a bear &quot;when he was only three.&quot;

*p. 69 (June 8, 1955).  &quot;[[w:The Ballad of Davy Crockett|The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]&quot; begins,  &quot;Davy!  Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier . . .&quot;  Modern readers may find it odd that Schulz devoted so many strips to such a trivial phenomenon, but Davy Crockett and coonskin caps really were seemingly everywhere at the time.  (See p. 78, June 28, 1955)

*p. 70 (June 9, 1955).  [[w:Minnesota|Minnesota]] is Chales Schulz' home state.

*p. 73 (June 17, 1955).  A [[w:white-collar worker|white-collar worker]] is a professional, someone who's work is supposedly more intellectual than physical.  People in manufacturing are said to be [[w:blue collar worker|blue collar worker]]s.  The joke is that even Pig Pen's white collar is bound to be dirty.

*p. 75 (June 21, 1955). &quot;But is it art?&quot; is an age-old question that really has no answer.  What makes a [[w:Abstract Expressionism|drip painting]] by [[w:Jackson Pollock|Jackson Pollock]] worthy of the [[w:Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art]], but not a similar painting by a chimp?

*p. 76 (June 25, 1955).  Most [[w:recreation room|recreation room]]s in suburban homes are in the basement to keep the noise down.

*p. 79 (July 2, 1955).  [[w:Willie Mays|Willie Mays]] and [[w:Duke Snider|Duke Snider]] were popular baseball players of the 1950s.

*p. 99 (August 15, 1955).  The umlauts over the o's would actually be pronounced &quot;boo-woo.&quot;  According the [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet]], the correct way to represent &quot;bow wow&quot; is: bau wau. 

*p. 105 (August 30, 1955)  [[w:Miss Frances|Miss Frances]] was the host of a popular children's television program. She inventing the approach of talking to the her young viewers as if they were in the room with her. 

*p. 131 (October 31, 1955). The trick-or-treaters are, in order, Patty, Lucy, Shermy, Violet, Schroeder and Linus.
**Lucy's hair and shoes are visible on in panel #4, even though she had planned on dressing as a ghost on Oct 29/30.
**On November 14, Pig-Pen says he was &quot;away&quot; on Hallowe'en, so he is not in this strip.
**Linus is behind Schroeder in panel #9; even though Charlie Brown admired Davy Crockett earlier, Linus produces a Crockett snowman on December 12.

*p. 106 (November 2, 1955).  This will be [[w:Sputnik|Sputnik]], the first artificial satellite, launched by the then-[[w:Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, signaling the start of the [[w:Space Age|Space Age]] and the [[w:Space Race|Space Race]].

*p. 117 (September 27, 1955).  Charlie Brown is shown as &quot;small.&quot;  The expression &quot;to feel small&quot; means to be embarrassed. 

*p. 142 (November 26, 1955).  Snoopy is imitating [[w:Mickey Mouse|Mickey Mouse]].

*p. 147 (No date in strip, but is December 7, 1955).  Lucy is reading a variation on the [[w:Dick and Jane|Dick and Jane]] readers popular at the time.  Schulz is being sarcastic.  Not much really happens in the stories, so they are far from &quot;fascinating.&quot;

*p. 149 (December 11, 1955).  The snow man is (who else?) [[w:Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett]].

*p. 156 (December 28, 1955).  All fads pass, and so did Davy Crocket mania.  (See p. 187, March 8, 1956, for what became of at least one old coonskin cap.)

*p. 159 (January 5, 1956).  [[w:Nuclear fallout|Nuclear fallout]] is [[w:radioactive contamination|radioactive contamination]] from a nuclear attack.

*p. 162 (January 10, 1956).  [[w:Private first class|Private first class]] is the &quot;rank&quot; immediately above Linus' current one. (See p. 159, January 4, 1956)

*p. 163 ( January  13, 1956).  [[w:Juvenile delinquency|Juvenile delinquency]] is anti-social and criminal activity by those under the age of 18.  It came into the public eye and interest in the 1950s (see ''[[w:West Side Story|West Side Story]]'').

*p. 166 (January 19, 1956).  To &quot;read between the lines&quot; means to understand the [[w:subtext|subtext]] of something&amp;mdash;not what is actually said, but rather implied.

*p. 167 ( January 22, 1956).  Charlie Brown is putting sand (or maybe salt, if he's trying to melt it) on the ice to prevent anyone from slipping on it ¿ which is exactly what Snoopy wants to do.

*p. 170 (January 30, 1956).  A &quot;fair weather friend&quot; is one who is your friend during good times (&quot;fair weather&quot;), but abandons you when in times of trouble (&quot;rough weather&quot;).

*p. 178 (February 16, 1956).  [[w:Rin-Tin-Tin|Rin-Tin-Tin]] and [[w:Lassie (1954 tv series)|Lassie]] were the heroic canine stars of popular television shows and movies.

*p. 180 (February 20, 1956).  ''Ding Dong School'' was the television program hosted by [[w:Miss Frances|Miss Frances]].  [[w:Howdy Doody|Howdy Doody]] was arguably the pre-eminent children's television show of the 1950s.  [[w:Lassie (1954 tv series)|Lassie]] was a very popular television program starring a dog.

*p. 184 (March 3, 1956).  Lucy is describing a scene from [[w:Peter Pan|Peter Pan]].  Most likely the book was read to her or she saw the 1954 musical starring [[w:Mary Martin|Mary Martin]] on stage, since she was too young to have seen the [[w:Peter Pan (1953 film)|Disney film version]] in 1953.

*p. 190 ( March 15, 1956).  &quot;[[w:Asia minor|Asia minor]]&quot; the old term for [[w:Southwest Asia|Southwest Asia]] which corresponds today to the [[w:Asian|Asian]] portion of [[w:Turkey|Turkey]].  Lucy has confused the term with  &quot;[[w:Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor%2C_BWV_565 |Toccata and Fugue in D Minor]]&quot; by [[w:Johann Sebastian Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach]].

*p. 208 (April 26, 1956).  In the 1950s the government paid farmers not to use their land.  The idea was that this would prevent [[w:soil erosion|soil erosion]] and build up healthier soil when crops were eventually planted.

*p. 210 ( April 30, 1956). Unlike the previous greens, which were all legitimate shades of the color, the ones in this panel are jokes. [[w:Evergreen|Evergreen]] and [[w:wintergreen|wintergreen]], are types of plants.  Herb Green was a cartoonist, and [[w:Graham Greene|Graham Greene]] a novelist.

*p. 217 (May 18, 1956).  Linus has transformed his blanket into an [[w:ascot tie|ascot tie]], a very sophisticated look in the 1950s, frequently worn by sporty celebrities. 

*p. 226 (June 8, 1956).  [[w:Stephen Foster|Stephen Foster]] was arguably the most popular American composer of the 19th Century.  His works include &quot;[[w:Oh! Susanna|Oh! Susanna]],&quot; &quot;[[w:Camptown Races|Camptown Races]]&quot; and &quot;[[w:Beautiful Dreamer|Beautiful Dreamer]].&quot;

*p. 232 ( June 22, 1956).  [[w:Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley]], &quot;the King of Rock and Roll&quot; had just made his first television appearances earlier that year and was a riding a huge crest of popularity.  At age 21, was also, arguably, at the height of his attractiveness.  And, naturally, Schroeder cares not a whit for [[w:rock music|rock music]].

*p. 233 (June 24, 1956).  A [[w:dust bowl|dust bowl]] is an area where, due to drought and/or poor soil management, the soil has lost all nutrients turned to dust, and blown away.

*p. 244 (July 19, 1956).  The automatic [[w:dishwasher|dishwasher]] as we know it wasn't invented until the 1920s.  With the privations imposed by the [[w:Great Depression|Great Depression]] and then [[w:World War II|World War II]], it didn't become a common domestic appliance until the 1950s.  And, so, of course, Violet's great-grandmother, who was probably born in the 1880s or 1890s, didn't have one.

*p. 247 (July 27, 1956).  Usually, one sticks up for the [[w:Underdog (competition)|under''dog'']], the person or thing not generally favored.

*p. 247 (July 28, 1956).  The [[w:suburb|suburban]] population in North America exploded after [[w:World War II|World War II]]. Returning [[w:veteran|veteran]]s wishing to start a settled life moved ''en masse'' to the suburbs.  Between 1950 and 1956 the resident population of all U.S. suburbs increased by 46%.  And, since new suburbs were built from scratch, very few had mature trees. (Though Charlie Brown's kites never seem to have a problem finding large trees to crash into.)

*p. 249 (July 30, 1956).  The titles are all variations on popular books or types of books.  ''From Rags to Fuss-Budget'' is a spin on any &quot;[[w:Rags to Riches|Rags to Riches]]&quot; tale (how someone started out poor but became rich; see the [[w:Horatio Alger|Horatio Alger]] novels).  ''The Power of Positive Fussing'' is from [[w:Norman Vincent Peale|Norman Vincent Peale's]] ''The Power of Positive Thinking'', one of most popular inspirational books of the 1950s.  ''Great Fuss-Budgets of Our Time'':  the are lots of &quot;of Our Time&quot; books published every year.  ''I Was a Fuss-Budget for the F.B.I.'' is a take on [[w:I Was a Communist for the FBI|I Was a Communist for the FBI]], the radio show and, later, film about an undercover agent infiltrating [[w:communist|communist]] organizations in order to disrupt them.  The [[w:F.B.I.|F.B.I.]] is the Federal Bureau of Investigations, America's internal criminal investigation organization.  In the 1950s America was particularly interested in hunting domestic communists, something which was [[w:McCarthyism|carried to the extremes]] by U.S. senator [[w:Joseph McCarthy|Joseph McCarthy]].

*p. 253 (August 4, 1956).  [[w:Benjamin Spock|Dr. (Benjamin) Spock]]  Was a leading pediatrician.  The main message of his best-selling ''[[w:The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care]]'' was for parents to be more affectionate with their children, and to treat them as individuals. (See p. 300, November 26, 1956, below.)

*p. 271 (September 20, 1956).  Compatible color was a television broadcast standard that allowed color broadcasts to appear on black and white televisions without distortions or flickers (but still, of course, in black and white).  Incompatible color was a previous color television standard developed by CBS that would have rendered all existing televisions obsolete.

*p. 275 (September 30, 1956).  Schroeder is playing the Prelude in C major from Book I of [[w:Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] Well-Tempered Clavier.

*P. 283 (October 18, 1956).  There's no particular reason why Charlie Brown yelled this except that it's dog-related and in the movie ''[[w:Lassie Come Home|Lassie Come Home]]'' it gets yelled, which is what Charlie Brown is really after.
&lt;!-- huh? I don't get this
*p. 287 (October 28, 1956) (compare with --Christmas strip-- )
--&gt;
*p. 300 (November 26, 1956).  Lucy is reading from [[w:Benjamin Spock|Dr. Benjamin Spock's]] ''[[w:The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care]]''.

*p. 22 (February 19, 1957).  Undoubtedly [[w:Lawrence Welk|Lawrence Welk]], whose show first aired nationally in 1955.

*p. 23 (February 21, 1957). Having &quot;both feet on the ground&quot; means having a firm grip on reality. This pun is likely a reference to the fact that the accordion is played while standing, whereas the piano is played while seated and often with a foot on the pedals. (The accordion is also a less widely respected instrument than the piano, explaining Schroeder's disgust at the remark.)

*p. 23 (February 22, 1957). This is the first reference in ''[[w:Peanuts|Peanuts]]'' to the name [[w:Joe Shlabotnik|Joseph Shlabotnik]], later to be [[w:Charlie Brown|Charlie Brown]]'s [[w:baseball|baseball]] hero.

*p. 33 (March 17, 1957) 1st panel and following.  Charlie Brown is engaged in the ancient game of [[w:hoop rolling|hoop rolling]].  It's exactly what it looks like:  rolling a hoop with a stick.

*p. 34 (March 20, 1957).  [[w:Skywriting|Skywriting]] is when a small airplane, expelling special smoke during flight, flies in certain patterns, creating &quot;writing&quot; readable from the ground.

*p.41 (April 6, 1957).  A [[w:fiscal year|fiscal year]] is a 12-month period used for calculating annual (&quot;yearly&quot;) financial reports in businesses and other organizations.  It covers a full 365 days, but does not begin on January 1 nor end on December 31.

*p. 47 (April 20, 1957) 4th panel [[w:Casey Stengel|Casey Stengel]] was the manager of the [[w:New York Yankees|New York Yankees]] in the 1950s and led them to many [[w:World Series|World Series]] victories.

*p. 53 (May 4, 1957).  Old fashioned [[w:roller skates|roller skates]] did not have their own uppers.  They were essentially mini skateboards that you attached to your shoes with a set of clamps that you tightened using a skate key.

*p. 56 (May 10, 1957).  [[w:Washboard|Washboard]]s, used to wash clothes, were, of course, hand-operated.

*p. 58 (May 13, 1957).  [[w:Calypso music|Calypso music]] is [[w:Caribbean|Caribbean]] [[w:folk music|folk music]].  It entered the American mainstream in 1956 with  [[w:Harry Belafonte|Harry Belafonte]]'s very popular rendition of the &quot;[[w:Banana Boat Song|Banana Boat Song]]&quot;, a traditional [[w:Jamaica|Jamaican]] folk tune.

*p. 62 (May 23, 1957). 33 1/3 and 78 rpm were common speeds for [[w:phonograph|phonograph]] records.  (The implication is that Lucy speaks very quickly indeed!).

*p. 77 (June 29, 1957).  Buttons proclaiming &quot;[[w:I Like Ike|I Like Ike]]&quot; were common in 1951-1952.  They proclaimed support for [[w:Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for U.S. president.  He was president from 1953 to 1961, during the time this panel ran.

*p. 82 (July 9, 1957).  Barrel staves are curved, wooden parts that make up a [[w:barrel|barrel]].

*p. 83 (July 13, 1957).  &quot;Slacker&quot; is a term from [[w:World War I|World War I]] and [[w:World War II|World War II]] describing men who were avoiding the military draft.

*p. 89 (July 25, 1957). The quotation is from the ''[[w:Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''.

*p. 91 (July 29, 1957).  Lucy has confused &quot;[[w:phonetic|phonetic]]&quot; (word sounds) with &quot;[[w:psychic|psychic]]&quot; (having the ability to read minds).

*p. 98 (August 17, 1957).  According to the U.S. Census Bureau 16.1 million men and women served in the U.S. armed forces from Dec. 1, 1941, and Dec. 31, 1946.  So practically every U.S. family has a [[w:World War II|World War II]] veteran in it.

*p. 99 (August 18, 1957).  &quot;Geronimo!&quot; is the traditional cry of [[w:paratrooper|paratrooper]]s and others as they jump out of planes.  It comes from a film about the Apache leader [[w:Geronimo|Geronimo]].

*p. 101 (August 23, 1957).  &quot;Thar She Blows!&quot; is the traditional yell of [[w:whaling|whale hunters]] when they spot a whale or, more often, a whale spouting water from its blow hole.

*p. 112 (September 17, 1957).  Snoopy is holding his fist in the air like [[w:Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini]], suggesting that Lucy is behaving like the [[w:fascism|fascist]] dictator.

*p. 118 (October 2, 1957).  Lucy makes this statement just two days before the launch of [[w:Sputnik|Sputnik]]!

*p. 139 (November 18, 1957).  According to [[w:Number-one hits of 1957 (USA)|Billboard]], the number one song in the [[w:United States|United States]] that week was &quot;[[w:Jailhouse Rock|Jailhouse Rock]]&quot; by [[w:Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley]]. Note: Schulz drew his strip weeks in advance. Even though he didn't know exactly which song would be number one, he knew it would undoubtedly be a [[w:rock and roll|rock and roll]] tune, which Schroeder naturally dislikes.

*p. 151 (December 16, 1957).  The first movement of [[w:Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] Piano Sonata No. 1, op. 2 No. 1.

*p. 152 (December 20, 1957).  [[w:Pat Boone|Pat Boone]] was a popular singer of the time.  His songs were usually sweet love songs, more conventional and &quot;middle of the road&quot; than the raucous [[w:rock and roll|rock and roll]] of [[w:Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley]].  Boone had two number one songs in 1957, &quot;Love Letters In the Sand&quot; and &quot;April Love&quot;.

*p. 157 (December 30, 1957).  Snoopy's ears are forming a square.  &quot;[[w:Square (slang)|Square]]&quot; is a slang term for someone who is old fashioned and not &quot;[[w:Hip (slang)|hip]].&quot;  Schroeder's love of classical music marks him as definite square.

*p. 160 (January 8, 1958).  Another reading from the gentle and encouraging [[w:Benjamin Spock|Dr. Benjamin Spock's]] revolutionary book, ''[[w:The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care]]''.

*p. 164 (January 17, 1958).  ''[[w:Peter Rabbit|Peter Rabbit]]'' by [[w:Beatrix Potter|Beatrix Potter]] and ''[[w:Alice in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' by [[w:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]] are both children's books, and so easy reads (though ''Alice'' is actually a complex satire, although it is doubtful that Charlie Brown would get the references).

*p. 164 (January 18, 1958).  &quot;Pioneer Days&quot; would be the 1800s when the [[w:American Old West|American Old West]] was first settled by white men (&quot;pioneers&quot;).  That would anywhere from 50 to 150 years before [[w:World War II|World War II]].

*p. 170 (February 2, 1958).  This appears to be a reference to the movie ''[[w:I Was a Teenage Werewolf|I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' from 1957.

*p. 172 (February 4, 1958).  Another reference to [[w:Sputnik|Sputnik]], the first artificial satellite.

*p. 175 (February 10, 1958).  Linus knows that carrying around a blanket makes him look crazy, and crazy people are not drafted into the army.

*p. 175 (February 11, 1958).  Lucy is mis-quoting [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] who said, &quot;Religion is the [[w:opium of the people|''opium'' of the people]].&quot;  Like most people, she has mis-interpreted that saying to mean that religion is a tool used by the bourgeoisie to keep the masses quiet and complacent. 

*p. 181 (February 25, 1958).  To be &quot;[[w:Blackball (blacklist)|blackballed]]&quot; is to forbidden to join an organization.  The Blue Birds were a children's club, part of the [[w:Camp Fire USA|Camp Fire Organization]] (similar to [[w:Scouting|Scouting]]), and so, theoretically not ''that'' picky. (Blue Birds were started in 1913 as an organization for girls.  In 1989 the Blue Bird level became the &quot;Starflight&quot; level serving both boys and girls.) 

*p. 186 (March 9, 1958).  The [[w:Asian Flu|Asian Flu]] was a strain of [[w:influenza|influenza]] that caused a [[w:pandemic|pandemic]] in 1957-58.

*p. 188 (March 13, 1958).  A [[w:Strop#Disciplinary_strapping|strop]] is a piece of leather used to sharpen an old-fashioned [[w:straight razor|straight razor]].  They were also used to spank children with when they misbehaved.  Schroeder's grandfather is arguing for more discipline.  Electric razors don't have strops.

*p. 190 (March 17, 1958).  Jim Hagerty was [[w:Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's]] press secretary.  As such, any reporter would love to interview him. 

*p. 196 (March 31, 1958).  The quotation is from the chlidren's book ''[[w:Little Black Sambo|Little Black Sambo]],'' which would now be considered racially offensive.

*p. 199 (April 8, 1958).  A parasol can not be [[w:hi-fi|hi-fi]], but, like the term &quot;[[w:high tech|high tech]]&quot;, &quot;hi-fi&quot; was bandied about in lots of inappropriate places in attempts to suggest that whatever was being sold was on the cutting edge of science.

*p. 200 (April 10, 1958).  See above.

*p. 221 (May 30, 1958).  The [[w:Beat Generation|Beat Generation]] refers to a group of American writers of the 1950s, most notably [[w:Jack Kerouac|Jack Kerouac]].  But here Charlie Brown is referring to himself as beaten down by life in general.

*p. 222 (June 1, 1958).  &quot;Dear Agnes&quot; is a play on [[w:Dear Abby|Dear Abby]], the advice columnist (or &quot;[[w:agony aunt|agony aunt]]&quot;), whose column began running in 1956.

*p. 224 (June 6, 1958).  A [[w:gila monster|gila monster]] is a venomous lizard found in the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.

*p. 268 (September 17, 1958).  See p. 232, June 25, 1958.  Odd that Schulz recycles an idea not four months after he first uses it.

*p. 269 (September 19, 1958).  &quot;The fastest ''gun'' in the west&quot; was a claim made by many an [[w:Old West|Old West]] [[w:gunslinger|gunslinger]].  It literally meant that you were able to draw your gun and shoot faster than any opponent, thus killing them.

*p. 217 (September 22, 1958).  &quot;I don't pretend to be able to give advice.&quot;  All that would change with the coming of her psychiatric advice booth (Vol. 5,  p. 37, March 27, 1959).

*p. 274 (September 29, 1958)  [[w:Hula hoop|Hula hoop]]s!  The only thing more ubiquitous than [[w:Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett]] in the 1950s was hula hoops. ''Peanuts'' is a veritable index to the pop culture of the second half of the 20th century.

*p. 275 (October 3, 1958).  The ticking of a clock supposedly simulates the heartbeat of the mother, which a puppy would have heard in the womb and while snuggled up against the mother after birth, in order to reassure it.

*p. 289 (November 3, 1958). The [[w:underdog (competition)|underdog]] is the person or team not expected to win a contest.  The word's origin, in ship construction, actually does make its opposite &quot;overdog.&quot;

*p. 289 (November 4, 1958).  [[w:Beethoven|Beethoven]] did not belong to a [[w:country club|country club]], so he never had the chance to become &quot;club champion&quot;:  the member of the club who is the best at a particular sport, usually [[w:golf|golf]] or [[w:tennis|tennis]].

*p. 289 (November 5, 1958).  [[w:Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin]] was a well known American composer and lyricist, author of, among other songs, &quot;[[w:God Bless America|God Bless America]],&quot; &quot;[[w:White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]],&quot; and '&quot;[[w:There's No Business Like Show Business|There's No Business Like Show Business]].&quot; 

*p. 307 (December 16, 1958).  Johann is the first name of classical composer (and, along with [[w:Mozart|Mozart]], rival of [[w:Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s for the title of greatest classical composer) [[w:Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach]].  Note:  there are [[w:Bach (disambiguation)|several Johann Bachs]] who were composers, including a [[w:Johann Ludwig Bach|Johann Ludwig Bach]].

*p. 310 (December 24, 1958).  The [[w:age of accountability|age of accountability]] is the age at which a child knows right from wrong and is responsible for his/her own actions.  In the Catholic Church it's 7.

Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1959 to 1960''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2006. ISBN 1560976713)

*p. 3 (January 6, 1959) 4th panel.  [[w:Popular music|Popular songs]] were the music that &quot;everybody&quot; was familiar with during the first half of the 20th century, until rock and roll replaced it as the music of the general public.  
**&quot;[[w:Stardust_%28song%29|Stardust]]&quot;, written by [[w:Hoagy Carmichael|Hoagy Carmichael]], and recorded thousands of times, was one of the most popular of these &quot;popular songs.&quot;  During the 1940s - 50s many older pieces of music (including some classical) were jazzed up, given lyrics and became &quot;hits.&quot; For example,  &quot;[[w:Stranger in Paradise|Stranger in Paradise]]&quot; from the 1953 musical ''[[w:Kismet|Kismet]]'' is based on [[w:Alexander Borodin|Alexander Borodin]]'s ''[[w:Polovetsian Dances|Polovetsian Dances]]'' and [[w:Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]’s Piano Concerto in B-Flat Minor became “Tonight We Love.”  The joke is that the children are so young that they don't know &quot;Stardust&quot; has already been around a while and in fact started out as a pop song.

*p. 18 (February 11, 1959) 3rd panel.  &quot;Tennessee Ernie&quot; is [[w:Tennessee Ernie Ford|Tennessee Ernie Ford]], a popular singer and TV variety show host.

*p. 30 (March 9, 1959) 2nd panel.  [[w:Deep focus|Deep focus]] again. (See also Vol. 1, p. 267, November 15, 1952.)

*p. 34 (March 20, 1959).  [[w:Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn's]] Symphony No. 94 is nicknamed [[w:Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|the Surprise Symphony]] due to the sudden appearance of a loud chord during the second movement.

*{{anchor|p37}}p. 37 (March 27, 1959). The first appearance of Lucy's psychiatric help booth.

*p. 38 (March 29, 1959).  Commercial use of jet aircraft in the United States began with the [[w:Boeing 707|Boeing 707]], first used in international service in October 1958 and for domestic flights in January 1959.  Jets were louder than the propeller-driven aircraft they replaced, and in many places, people living near airports distributed petitions in an attempt to reduce the number of jet flights and/or reroute jet traffic away from their homes.

*p. 42 (April 6, 1959) 3rd and 4th panels.  Almost certainly ''[[w:Peter Gunn|Peter Gunn]],'' which had premiered on TV the year before.  Gunn was a cool detective, [[w:Hip (slang)|hip]] to all the lingo.  “Mommy-O” is a spin on &quot;Daddy-O&quot;, what one [[w:Cool (aesthetic)|cool]] cat might call another.  The 1958 film ''[[w:Daddy-O|Daddy-O]]'' features a truck driver who turns detective.

*p. 60 (May 18, 1959).  [[w:Phonebooth stuffing|Telephone booth stuffing]], in which as many people as possible tried to cram into the same glass-walled phone booth, was a fad in the late 1950s, primarily on college campuses.

*p. 67 (June 6, 1959). &quot;I was an only dog.&quot;   Schulz would later change his mind on this (or, he simply forgot the line).  Over the years (see May 5, 1965), we would learn that Snoopy had [[w:Snoopy's siblings|seven siblings]].

*p. 68 (June 7, 1959).  The first movement of [[w:Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] Piano Sonata No. 1, op. 2 No. 1.

*p. 79 (July 4, 1959) 4th panel.  Charlie Brown is suggesting that his father will have to drastically raise the price of haircuts at his barber shop in order to cover the increased cost of living that comes with an expanded family.  At the time, haircuts typically cost less than $2.00.

*p. 81 (July 6, 1959).  The Soviet Union was well-known for [[w:Soviet space dogs|sending dogs into space]], experiments which were continuing as of this date. The American space program had actually sent mice into space in the early 1950s; by 1959, they had moved on to monkeys, with a pair surviving a flight in May of that year.  [[w:Animals in space|Various other animals also made space flights]].

*p. 87 (July 20, 1959).  The back sides of boxes of [[w:Breakfast cereal|breakfast cereals]] aimed at children often had brief stories or comic strips printed on them.

*p. 87 (July 22, 1959).  The [[w:Continental League|Continental League]] was proposed in 1959 as a competitor to the [[w:American League|American]] and [[w:National League|National]] baseball leagues.  It was to have begun play in 1961, but the existing leagues soon announced plans for [[w:Expansion team|expansion teams]] in some of the Continental League cities, thus eliminating much of the new league's reason for being.

*p. 99 (August 19, 1959). &quot;Hot summer nights&quot;: the name given to racial riots of the 1950s and 60s.

*p. 101 (August 23, 1959).  Note that it was three months between the first mention of Charlie Brown's new baby sister (May 26, 1959) and this, her first actual appearance in the strip.

*p. 120 (October 6, 1959).  First mention of &quot;Miss Othmar.&quot;

*p. 124 (October 16, 1959) 4th panel.  The [[w:Brothers Grimm|Brothers Grimm]] popularized the legend of [[w:The Pied Piper of Hamelin|the Pied Piper]], who is reputed to have used his pipe to play music to lure an infestation of rats out of the town of Hamelin, Germany; when he was not paid by the townspeople, he later returned and lured the town's children away.

*p. 126 (October 21, 1959).  Lucy is reading the mythological story of [[w:Midas#Myth|King Midas]].  Linus is correct that things backfired for the king.

*p. 129 (October 26, 1959).  First mention of &quot;[[w:The Great Pumpkin|the Great Pumpkin]].&quot;

*p. 131 (November 1, 1959) 5th through 7th panels.  [[w:Benjamin Spock|Dr. Benjamin Spock's]] bestselling book ''[[w:The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]],'' first published in 1946, advocated a more loving approach -- some would say &quot;permissive&quot; -- to raising a baby than had previously been in vogue.

*p. 137 (November 15, 1959) 4th and 5th panels.  The [[w:Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] launched several [[w:Sputnik program|Sputnik]] satellites between 1957 and 1960, apparently enough that Charlie Brown and Lucy could use &quot;Sputnik&quot; as a generic term meaning &quot;artificial satellite.&quot;

*p. 138 (November 17, 1959) 1st panel.  A [[w:Perfect game (bowling)|score of 300]] -- 12 strikes in a row -- is the best possible score in a single game of [[w:Ten-pin bowling|ten-pin bowling]].

*p. 142 (November 26, 1959) 3rd panel.  [[w:Babylon|Babylon]] was a city in ancient [[w:Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]].

*p. 142 (November 27, 1959) 2nd panel.  [[w:King Solomon|Solomon]] -- king of the [[w:United Monarchy|United Kingdom of Israel]], approximately 970 to 928 BCE.  [[w:Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] -- more common name of Nebuchadrezzar II, ruler of Babylon (see previous strip) from about 605 to 562 BCE.  [[w:Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] -- founder of the [[w:Mongol Empire|Mongol Empire]] circa 1206.

*p. 145 (December 5, 1959) 2nd and 3rd panels.  Horsehide is another name for a [[w:Baseball (ball)|baseball]] and pigskin is another name for [[w:Pigskin#American_and_Canadian_football|an American football]], in both cases due to the material traditionally used for each ball's cover.  Both are now much more commonly made from either [[w:Leather|cow leather]] or synthetic materials.

*p. 150 (December 14, 1959) 4th panel.  Beethoven's first name was actually [[w:Ludwig van Beethoven|Ludwig]].

*p. 152 (December 20, 1959) 6th panel.  Linus's quote is [http://www.bartleby.com/108/42/2.html Luke 2:10] from the [[w:Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] of the Bible.  He expands upon it in ''[[w:A Charlie Brown Christmas|A Charlie Brown Christmas]],'' quoting verses 8 through 14.

*p. 160 (January 7, 1960) 4th panel.  Indoor antennas intended primarily for receiving [[w:Very high frequency|VHF]] television broadcasts were frequently in the form of a [[w:Dipole_antenna#Set-top_TV_antenna|dipole antenna]] placed on top of the TV set, each pole a separate telescoping metal rod.  Often set at a 45-degree angle to the set and a 90-degree angle to each other, these antennas were nicknamed &quot;rabbit ears.&quot;

*p. 162 (January 12, 1960).  &quot;Rabbit ears&quot; antennas often had to be adjusted to a different position in order to improve the quality of the television picture, when changing to a channel that was transmitting from a different location than the previous channel, or as a result of changing atmospheric conditions.

*p. 164 (January 17, 1960). The first iteration of what would become a recurring theme: Snoopy and his doomed relationship with a snowman. See also February 2, 1961; January 15&amp;ndash;20, 1962; and, most memorably, February 18, 1962.

*p. 174 (February 8, 1960).  Snoopy's doghouse had not previously been shown as being this close to a house -- see January 2, 1960, for example.

*p. 189 (March 14, 1960).  &quot;Whirlybird&quot; is a nickname for [[w:Helicopter|helicopters]].

*p. 207 (April 25, 1960) 4th panel.  The phrase &quot;happiness is a warm puppy&quot; led to an explosion in ''Peanuts'' merchandise and entered the consciousness of the public at large, even inspiring [[w:Happiness Is a Warm Gun|a Beatles song]].  (Also see the April 27 and April 30 strips.)

*p. 224 (June 5, 1960).  Linus starts singing the traditional spiritual &quot;[[w:Dem Bones|Dem Bones]].&quot;

*p. 240 (July 12, 1960).  The [[w:Cathode ray tube|picture tube]] is the main part of a traditional television set.

*p. 243 (July 18, 1960).  [[w:Uncle Sam|Uncle Sam]] is the traditional personification of the United States.  The elephant is a symbol for the [[w:Republican Party (United States|Republican party]], and the donkey is a symbol for its counterpart, the [[w:Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]].  A snake with the phrase &quot;Don't tread on me&quot; is an image from early American history, most notably seen on the [[w:Gadsden flag|Gadsden flag]].  All of this means that Lucy has crammed a bunch of symbols commonly used by editorial cartoonists into the same cartoon.

*p. 245 (July 24, 1960) 13th panel.  Lucy's [[w:Microphone|microphone]] is a [[w:Lavalier|lavalier]]-type condenser microphone, commonly worn by television personalities who would have to move around too much to use a fixed microphone and didn't need to use a handheld type.  This type of microphone later became much smaller, to the point where it can now be clipped to a lapel or even hidden beneath a shirt.

*p. 253 (August 11, 1960).  The [[w:Spitball|spitball]] was banned in professional baseball in 1920.  Schulz and/or his syndicate may have worried about some client newspapers' acceptance of the word &quot;spit&quot; on their comics page, hence the use of the [[w:Euphemism|euphemism]] &quot;expectorate ball.&quot;

*p. 254 (August 14, 1960) 4th panel.  [[w:British Honduras|British Honduras]] is now known as [[w:Belize|Belize]], after having become a self-governing colony in 1964 and fully independent of the United Kingdom in 1981.

*p. 257 (August 21, 1960) 6th panel.  &quot;[[w:Rain Rain Go Away|Rain Rain Go Away]]&quot; is a traditional nursery rhyme that normally doesn't work this quickly.  (Also see the following two Sunday strips, August 28 and September 4.)

*p. 264 (September 6, 1960).  This storyline may have been inspired by an upgrade of [[w:U.S. Route 101|U.S. 101]] through [[w:Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County, California]], upgraded to a [[w:Freeway|freeway]] in the 1960s.  Since freeways are wider than traditional roads and require additional space for grade-separated interchanges at intersections, their construction often results in the need for the local government to use [[w:Eminent domain|eminent domain]] powers to purchase significant amounts of land on and around the route of the road.

*p. 273 (September 28, 1960).  Comedian [[w:Mort Sahl|Mort Sahl]] took much of his material from current events.

*p. 282 (October 17, 1960).  &quot;Population explosion&quot; was a term commonly used to describe conditions that could be leading to [[w:Overpopulation|overpopulation]], in the news at the time due to the [[w:Post-World_War_II_baby_boom|baby boom]] following World War II.

*p. 287 (October 30, 1960).  This strip was rewritten, with Sally put in place of Charlie Brown, and used as the climax of ''[[w:It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown|It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]].''

*p. 305 (December 11, 1960), p. 308 (December 18, 1960), and p. 311 (December 25, 1960).  This year, Linus's piece to memorize for the Christmas program is [http://www.bartleby.com/108/42/2.html Luke 2:1], and Charlie Brown has Luke 2:8.

*p. 313 (December 30, 1960).  A container for [[w:Leftovers|restaurant leftovers]] is sometimes known as a doggie bag.

===Text===

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.''

''This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.''

''Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government.''

''It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.''

''And yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.''

''In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth.''

''I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting particulars:''

''THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.''

''In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.''

''It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole. This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.''

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper introduces a series of essays published in the ''Independent Journal'', the ''New-York Packet'' and the ''Daily Advertiser'' as a response to Anti-Federalist zeal surrounding the proposed [[../..Constitution/]]. The Constitution had been sent to the various states for ratification in September 1787. 

Being an introductory essay, Federalist No. 1 does not so much focus on the themes contained within The Federalist Papers. It presents a hasty adumbration of the concepts to be argued, but more time is spent imploring citizens to make the ''right choice'' in deciding whether to support or oppose the Constitution. The ''right choice'', here, is obviously a subjective one; Hamilton himself admits his bias in favor of the Constitution with considerable aplomb.

Hamilton also outlines six key concepts that he believes the Federalist Papers will cover:

# &quot;The utility of the UNION to your political prosperity&quot; – covered in No. 2 through No. 14
# &quot;The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union&quot;—covered in No. 15 through No. 22
# &quot;The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object&quot;—covered in No. 23 through No. 36
# &quot;The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government&quot;—covered in No. 37 through No. 84
# &quot;Its analogy to your own state constitution&quot;—covered in No. 85
# &quot;The additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to prosperity&quot;—covered in No. 85.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will be evident.''

''Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest of the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national government.''

''It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in a division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties. However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of the number. Whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.''

''It has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one connected, fertile, widespreading country was the portion of our western sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world, running at convenient distances, present them with highways for the easy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and exchange of their various commodities.''

''With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and independence.''

''This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.''

''Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same national rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as a nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with foreign states.''

''A strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free people. It is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.''

''This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they observed the danger which immediately threatened the former and more remotely the latter; and being pursuaded that ample security for both could only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they as with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take that important subject under consideration.''

''This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.''

''Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to BLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this (as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished than expected, that it may be so considered and examined. Experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It is not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of 1774. That body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the event proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures. Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the dictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good, were indefatigable in their efforts to pursuade the people to reject the advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were deceived and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.''

''They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and experienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of useful information. That, in the course of the time they passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head. That they were individually interested in the public liberty and prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature deliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.''

''These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took their advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter them from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in the men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally known, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and advice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most distinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political information, were also members of this convention, and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.''

''It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its Union. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people in forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety, therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one? I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform attachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons, which I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers. They who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the Union in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly would be the case, and I sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America will have reason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: &quot;FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS.&quot;''

''PUBLIUS.'' 

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper begins by noting that it is written in response to politicians who have lately rejected the previously &quot;uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly united.&quot; The [[w:American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]] had been a difficult conflict for the American forces, and despite the eventual victory it was clear that the new country was not on a level, militarily, with European nations, especially [[w:Britain|Britain]] and [[w:France|France]], which were the two European powers exercising major influence along the North Atlantic coastline. There was significant concern among Americans that one of the European powers would attempt to return the United States to colonial status or otherwise limit American sovereignty. In Federalist No. 2, Jay strove to demonstrate that a strong Union of the American states would provide the best opportunity for defense.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT IS not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like the Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their interests. That consideration naturally tends to create great respect for the high opinion which the people of America have so long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for all general and national purposes.''

''The more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that they are cogent and conclusive.''

''Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY seems to be the first. The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and comprehensively.''

''At present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from FOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising from domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it is proper it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial Union, under an efficient national government, affords them the best security that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.''

''The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the causes, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them. If this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes of war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America; for if it should turn out that United America will probably give the fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.''

''The JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation of treaties or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except Prussia, are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. She has also extensive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and, with respect to the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to.''

''It is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the laws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by three or four distinct confederacies.''

''Because when once an efficient national government is established, the best men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will generally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country, or other contracted influence, may place men in State assemblies, or senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more general and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national government,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and never experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the States. Hence, it will result that the administration, the political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of individual States, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to other nations, as well as more SAFE with respect to us.''

''Because, under the national government, treaties and articles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in one sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on the same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four confederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as well from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by different and independent governments, as from the different local laws and interests which may affect and influence them. The wisdom of the convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national government, cannot be too much commended.''

''Because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the governing party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and consequently having little or no influence on the national government, the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be preserved. The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great weight to this reasoning.''

''Because, even if the governing party in a State should be disposed to resist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do, result from circumstances peculiar to the State, and may affect a great number of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be able, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the aggressors. But the national government, not being affected by those local circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others.''

''So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are less to be apprehended under one general government than under several lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of the people.''

''As to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national government affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort than can be derived from any other quarter.''

''Because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and interests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the Union. Not a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are several instances of Indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants.''

''The neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering on some States and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more immediately to the borderers. The bordering States, if any, will be those who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of apparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence, to excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately interested.''

''But not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national government, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and settle them amicably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that respect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly than the offending State. The pride of states, as well as of men, naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. The national government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.''

''Besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united nation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a State or confederacy of little consideration or power.''

''In the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis XIV., endeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should send their Doge, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to FRANCE, to ask his pardon and receive his terms. They were obliged to submit to it for the sake of peace. Would he on any occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation from Spain, or Britain, or any other POWERFUL nation?''

''PUBLIUS.'' 

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper as well the other early ones as a whole argued for the utility of the Union, stating that a strong national government was more desirable than a diverse group of weaker local governments without national leadership. In No. 3, Jay argues that a strong national government could better preserve peace. He states that a “united America” would be less likely to provoke other nations to attack. For instance, it would be better able to uphold the terms of an international treaty. Additionally, the United States would be less likely to engage in “direct and unlawful violence”: whereas states immediately bordering foreign territories may act “under the impulse of sudden irritation,” the national government will be safer, since its “wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately interested.”

Jay also argues that in the event of an international conflict, a foreign power would be more likely to come to terms with a United America. He observes that in 1685, Genoa was forced to send its national leadership to France to ask pardon from [[w:Louis XIV|Louis XIV]]; Jay questions whether France would have demanded such tribute from any “''powerful'' nation.” Thus a “strong united nation” could better preserve the peace, since it would find it easier to settle causes of war.

Federalist No. 4 is titled ''&quot;The Same Subject Continued: Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by John Jay.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''MY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to by JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be more easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the State governments or the proposed little confederacies.''

''But the safety of the people of America against dangers from FOREIGN force depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST causes of war to other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not to INVITE hostility or insult; for it need not be observed that there are PRETENDED as well as just causes of war.''

''It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people. But, independent of these inducements to war, which are more prevalent in absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there are others which affect nations as often as kings; and some of them will on examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and circumstances.''

''With France and with Britain we are rivals in the fisheries, and can supply their markets cheaper than they can themselves, notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own or duties on foreign fish.''

''With them and with most other European nations we are rivals in navigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive ourselves if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish; for, as our carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree diminishing theirs, it is more their interest, and will be more their policy, to restrain than to promote it.''

''In the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one nation, inasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which they had in a manner monopolized, and as we thereby supply ourselves with commodities which we used to purchase from them.''

''The extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give pleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this continent, because the cheapness and excellence of our productions, added to the circumstance of vicinity, and the enterprise and address of our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater share in the advantages which those territories afford, than consists with the wishes or policy of their respective sovereigns.''

''Spain thinks it convenient to shut the Mississippi against us on the one side, and Britain excludes us from the Saint Lawrence on the other; nor will either of them permit the other waters which are between them and us to become the means of mutual intercourse and traffic.''

''From these and such like considerations, which might, if consistent with prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is easy to see that jealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the minds and cabinets of other nations, and that we are not to expect that they should regard our advancement in union, in power and consequence by land and by sea, with an eye of indifference and composure.''

''The people of America are aware that inducements to war may arise out of these circumstances, as well as from others not so obvious at present, and that whenever such inducements may find fit time and opportunity for operation, pretenses to color and justify them will not be wanting. Wisely, therefore, do they consider union and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in SUCH A SITUATION as, instead of INVITING war, will tend to repress and discourage it. That situation consists in the best possible state of defense, and necessarily depends on the government, the arms, and the resources of the country.''

''As the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and cannot be provided for without government, either one or more or many, let us inquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in question, more competent than any other given number whatever.''

''One government can collect and avail itself of the talents and experience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may be found. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize, assimilate, and protect the several parts and members, and extend the benefit of its foresight and precautions to each. In the formation of treaties, it will regard the interest of the whole, and the particular interests of the parts as connected with that of the whole. It can apply the resources and power of the whole to the defense of any particular part, and that more easily and expeditiously than State governments or separate confederacies can possibly do, for want of concert and unity of system. It can place the militia under one plan of discipline, and, by putting their officers in a proper line of subordination to the Chief Magistrate, will, as it were, consolidate them into one corps, and thereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into three or four distinct independent companies.''

''What would the militia of Britain be if the English militia obeyed the government of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government of Scotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed the government of Wales? Suppose an invasion; would those three governments (if they agreed at all) be able, with all their respective forces, to operate against the enemy so effectually as the single government of Great Britain would?''

''We have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if we are wise, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if one national government, had not so regulated the navigation of Britain as to make it a nursery for seamen--if one national government had not called forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets, their prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated. Let England have its navigation and fleet--let Scotland have its navigation and fleet--let Wales have its navigation and fleet--let Ireland have its navigation and fleet--let those four of the constituent parts of the British empire be be under four independent governments, and it is easy to perceive how soon they would each dwindle into comparative insignificance.''

''Apply these facts to our own case. Leave America divided into thirteen or, if you please, into three or four independent governments--what armies could they raise and pay--what fleets could they ever hope to have? If one was attacked, would the others fly to its succor, and spend their blood and money in its defense? Would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality by its specious promises, or seduced by a too great fondness for peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity and present safety for the sake of neighbors, of whom perhaps they have been jealous, and whose importance they are content to see diminished? Although such conduct would not be wise, it would, nevertheless, be natural. The history of the states of Greece, and of other countries, abounds with such instances, and it is not improbable that what has so often happened would, under similar circumstances, happen again.''

''But admit that they might be willing to help the invaded State or confederacy. How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded? Who shall command the allied armies, and from which of them shall he receive his orders? Who shall settle the terms of peace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and compel acquiescence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would be inseparable from such a situation; whereas one government, watching over the general and common interests, and combining and directing the powers and resources of the whole, would be free from all these embarrassments, and conduce far more to the safety of the people.''

''But whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under one national government, or split into a number of confederacies, certain it is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is; and they will act toward us accordingly. If they see that our national government is efficient and well administered, our trade prudently regulated, our militia properly organized and disciplined, our resources and finances discreetly managed, our credit re-established, our people free, contented, and united, they will be much more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment. If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies, one inclining to Britain, another to France, and a third to Spain, and perhaps played off against each other by the three, what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes! How liable would she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage, and how soon would dear-bought experience proclaim that when a people or family so divide, it never fails to be against themselves.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''QUEEN ANNE, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch Parliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION then forming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I shall present the public with one or two extracts from it: &quot;An entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace: It will secure your religion, liberty, and property; remove the animosities amongst yourselves, and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms. It must increase your strength, riches, and trade; and by this union the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of different interest, will be ENABLED TO RESIST ALL ITS ENEMIES.&quot; &quot;We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy conclusion, being the only EFFECTUAL way to secure our present and future happiness, and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies, who will doubtless, on this occasion, USE THEIR UTMOST ENDEAVORS TO PREVENT OR DELAY THIS UNION.&quot;''

''It was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and divisions at home would invite dangers from abroad; and that nothing would tend more to secure us from them than union, strength, and good government within ourselves. This subject is copious and cannot easily be exhausted.''

''The history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons. We may profit by their experience without paying the price which it cost them. Although it seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an island should be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided into three, and that those three were almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another. Notwithstanding their true interest with respect to the continental nations was really the same, yet by the arts and policy and practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies were perpetually kept inflamed, and for a long series of years they were far more inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and assisting to each other.''

''Should the people of America divide themselves into three or four nations, would not the same thing happen? Would not similar jealousies arise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead of their being &quot;joined in affection&quot; and free from all apprehension of different &quot;interests,&quot; envy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection, and the partial interests of each confederacy, instead of the general interests of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and pursuits. Hence, like most other BORDERING nations, they would always be either involved in disputes and war, or live in the constant apprehension of them.''

''The most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies cannot reasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an equal footing in point of strength, even if it was possible to form them so at first; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what human contrivance can secure the continuance of such equality? Independent of those local circumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one part and to impede its progress in another, we must advert to the effects of that superior policy and good management which would probably distinguish the government of one above the rest, and by which their relative equality in strength and consideration would be destroyed. For it cannot be presumed that the same degree of sound policy, prudence, and foresight would uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long succession of years.''

''Whenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen, and happen it would, that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her neighbors, that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy and with fear. Both those passions would lead them to countenance, if not to promote, whatever might promise to diminish her importance; and would also restrain them from measures calculated to advance or even to secure her prosperity. Much time would not be necessary to enable her to discern these unfriendly dispositions. She would soon begin, not only to lose confidence in her neighbors, but also to feel a disposition equally unfavorable to them. Distrust naturally creates distrust, and by nothing is good-will and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies and uncandid imputations, whether expressed or implied.''

''The North is generally the region of strength, and many local circumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the proposed confederacies would, at a period not very distant, be unquestionably more formidable than any of the others. No sooner would this become evident than the NORTHERN HIVE would excite the same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of America which it formerly did in the southern parts of Europe. Nor does it appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might often be tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors.''

''They who well consider the history of similar divisions and confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they would be borderers; that they would neither love nor trust one another, but on the contrary would be a prey to discord, jealousy, and mutual injuries; in short, that they would place us exactly in the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to see us, viz., FORMIDABLE ONLY TO EACH OTHER.''

''From these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive might be formed between these confederacies, and would produce that combination and union of wills of arms and of resources, which would be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign enemies.''

''When did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain were formerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their forces against a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be DISTINCT NATIONS. Each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to regulate by distinct treaties; and as their productions and commodities are different and proper for different markets, so would those treaties be essentially different. Different commercial concerns must create different interests, and of course different degrees of political attachment to and connection with different foreign nations. Hence it might and probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the SOUTHERN confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the NORTHERN confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and friendship. An alliance so contrary to their immediate interest would not therefore be easy to form, nor, if formed, would it be observed and fulfilled with perfect good faith.''

''Nay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighboring nations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests and unfriendly passions, would frequently be found taking different sides. Considering our distance from Europe, it would be more natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger from one another than from distant nations, and therefore that each of them should be more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard against foreign dangers by alliances between themselves. And here let us not forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade or compel them to depart. How many conquests did the Romans and others make in the characters of allies, and what innovations did they under the same character introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to protect.''

''Let candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into any given number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure us against the hostilities and improper interference of foreign nations.''

==Federalist No. 6==
Federalist No. 6 is titled ''&quot;Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state of disunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more alarming kind--those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between the States themselves, and from domestic factions and convulsions. These have been already in some instances slightly anticipated; but they deserve a more particular and more full investigation.''

''A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that, if these States should either be wholly disunited, or only united in partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other. To presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their existence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood, would be to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to set at defiance the accumulated experience of ages.''

''The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective bodies of society. Of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion--the jealousy of power, or the desire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence within their spheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between commercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either of the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions; in the attachments, enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members. Men of this class, whether the favorites of a king or of a people, have in too many instances abused the confidence they possessed; and assuming the pretext of some public motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification.''

''The celebrated Pericles, in compliance with the resentment of a prostitute, at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of his countrymen, attacked, vanquished, and destroyed the city of the SAMNIANS. The same man, stimulated by private pique against the MEGARENSIANS, another nation of Greece, or to avoid a prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of the statuary Phidias, or to get rid of the accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the purchase of popularity, or from a combination of all these causes, was the primitive author of that famous and fatal war, distinguished in the Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war; which, after various vicissitudes, intermissions, and renewals, terminated in the ruin of the Athenian commonwealth.''

''The ambitious cardinal, who was prime minister to Henry VIII., permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown, entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the influence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of this enterprising and powerful monarch, he precipitated England into a war with France, contrary to the plainest dictates of policy, and at the hazard of the safety and independence, as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his counsels, as of Europe in general. For if there ever was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy, it was the Emperor Charles V., of whose intrigues Wolsey was at once the instrument and the dupe.''

''The influence which the bigotry of one female, the petulance of another, and the cabals of a third, had in the contemporary policy, ferments, and pacifications, of a considerable part of Europe, are topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally known.''

''To multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the production of great national events, either foreign or domestic, according to their direction, would be an unnecessary waste of time. Those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn, will themselves recollect a variety of instances; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or extent of that agency. Perhaps, however, a reference, tending to illustrate the general principle, may with propriety be made to a case which has lately happened among ourselves. If Shays had not been a DESPERATE DEBTOR, it is much to be doubted whether Massachusetts would have been plunged into a civil war.''

''But notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience, in this particular, there are still to be found visionary or designing men, who stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace between the States, though dismembered and alienated from each other. The genius of republics (say they) is pacific; the spirit of commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men, and to extinguish those inflammable humors which have so often kindled into wars. Commercial republics, like ours, will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other. They will be governed by mutual interest, and will cultivate a spirit of mutual amity and concord.''

''Is it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit? If this be their true interest, have they in fact pursued it? Has it not, on the contrary, invariably been found that momentary passions, and immediate interest, have a more active and imperious control over human conduct than general or remote considerations of policy, utility or justice? Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies? Are not the former administered by MEN as well as the latter? Are there not aversions, predilections, rivalships, and desires of unjust acquisitions, that affect nations as well as kings? Are not popular assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage, resentment, jealousy, avarice, and of other irregular and violent propensities? Is it not well known that their determinations are often governed by a few individuals in whom they place confidence, and are, of course, liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those individuals? Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change the objects of war? Is not the love of wealth as domineering and enterprising a passion as that of power or glory? Have there not been as many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the prevailing system of nations, as were before occasioned by the cupidity of territory or dominion? Has not the spirit of commerce, in many instances, administered new incentives to the appetite, both for the one and for the other? Let experience, the least fallible guide of human opinions, be appealed to for an answer to these inquiries.''

''Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics; two of them, Athens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were they as often engaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the neighboring monarchies of the same times. Sparta was little better than a wellregulated camp; and Rome was never sated of carnage and conquest.''

''Carthage, though a commercial republic, was the aggressor in the very war that ended in her destruction. Hannibal had carried her arms into the heart of Italy and to the gates of Rome, before Scipio, in turn, gave him an overthrow in the territories of Carthage, and made a conquest of the commonwealth.''

''Venice, in later times, figured more than once in wars of ambition, till, becoming an object to the other Italian states, Pope Julius II. found means to accomplish that formidable league, which gave a deadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty republic.''

''The provinces of Holland, till they were overwhelmed in debts and taxes, took a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of Europe. They had furious contests with England for the dominion of the sea, and were among the most persevering and most implacable of the opponents of Louis XIV.''

''In the government of Britain the representatives of the people compose one branch of the national legislature. Commerce has been for ages the predominant pursuit of that country. Few nations, nevertheless, have been more frequently engaged in war; and the wars in which that kingdom has been engaged have, in numerous instances, proceeded from the people.''

''There have been, if I may so express it, almost as many popular as royal wars. The cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have, upon various occasions, dragged their monarchs into war, or continued them in it, contrary to their inclinations, and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the State. In that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA and BOURBON, which so long kept Europe in a flame, it is well known that the antipathies of the English against the French, seconding the ambition, or rather the avarice, of a favorite leader, protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy, and for a considerable time in opposition to the views of the court.''

''The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure grown out of commercial considerations,--the desire of supplanting and the fear of being supplanted, either in particular branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and navigation.''

''From this summary of what has taken place in other countries, whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own, what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy, in a state of separation? Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape? Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?''

''Let the point of extreme depression to which our national dignity and credit have sunk, let the inconveniences felt everywhere from a lax and ill administration of government, let the revolt of a part of the State of North Carolina, the late menacing disturbances in Pennsylvania, and the actual insurrections and rebellions in Massachusetts, declare--!''

''So far is the general sense of mankind from corresponding with the tenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep our apprehensions of discord and hostility between the States, in the event of disunion, that it has from long observation of the progress of society become a sort of axiom in politics, that vicinity or nearness of situation, constitutes nations natural enemies. An intelligent writer expresses himself on this subject to this effect: &quot;NEIGHBORING NATIONS (says he) are naturally enemies of each other unless their common weakness forces them to league in a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC, and their constitution prevents the differences that neighborhood occasions, extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their neighbors.&quot; This passage, at the same time, points out the EVIL and suggests the REMEDY.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT IS sometimes asked, with an air of seeming triumph, what inducements could the States have, if disunited, to make war upon each other? It would be a full answer to this question to say--precisely the same inducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all the nations in the world. But, unfortunately for us, the question admits of a more particular answer. There are causes of differences within our immediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under the restraints of a federal constitution, we have had sufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were removed.''

''Territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most fertile sources of hostility among nations. Perhaps the greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this origin. This cause would exist among us in full force. We have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United States. There still are discordant and undecided claims between several of them, and the dissolution of the Union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all. It is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted at the time of the Revolution, and which usually went under the name of crown lands. The States within the limits of whose colonial governments they were comprised have claimed them as their property, the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this article devolved upon the Union; especially as to all that part of the Western territory which, either by actual possession, or through the submission of the Indian proprietors, was subjected to the jurisdiction of the king of Great Britain, till it was relinquished in the treaty of peace. This, it has been said, was at all events an acquisition to the Confederacy by compact with a foreign power. It has been the prudent policy of Congress to appease this controversy, by prevailing upon the States to make cessions to the United States for the benefit of the whole. This has been so far accomplished as, under a continuation of the Union, to afford a decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute. A dismemberment of the Confederacy, however, would revive this dispute, and would create others on the same subject. At present, a large part of the vacant Western territory is, by cession at least, if not by any anterior right, the common property of the Union. If that were at an end, the States which made the cession, on a principle of federal compromise, would be apt when the motive of the grant had ceased, to reclaim the lands as a reversion. The other States would no doubt insist on a proportion, by right of representation. Their argument would be, that a grant, once made, could not be revoked; and that the justice of participating in territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the Confederacy, remained undiminished. If, contrary to probability, it should be admitted by all the States, that each had a right to a share of this common stock, there would still be a difficulty to be surmounted, as to a proper rule of apportionment. Different principles would be set up by different States for this purpose; and as they would affect the opposite interests of the parties, they might not easily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment.''

''In the wide field of Western territory, therefore, we perceive an ample theatre for hostile pretensions, without any umpire or common judge to interpose between the contending parties. To reason from the past to the future, we shall have good ground to apprehend, that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences. The circumstances of the dispute between Connecticut and Pennsylvania, respecting the land at Wyoming, admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy accommodation of such differences. The articles of confederation obliged the parties to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court. The submission was made, and the court decided in favor of Pennsylvania. But Connecticut gave strong indications of dissatisfaction with that determination; nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to it, till, by negotiation and management, something like an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have sustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure on the conduct of that State. She no doubt sincerely believed herself to have been injured by the decision; and States, like individuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their disadvantage.''

''Those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between this State and the district of Vermont, can vouch the opposition we experienced, as well from States not interested as from those which were interested in the claim; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the Confederacy might have been exposed, had this State attempted to assert its rights by force. Two motives preponderated in that opposition: one, a jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the interest of certain individuals of influence in the neighboring States, who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district. Even the States which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours, seemed more solicitous to dismember this State, than to establish their own pretensions. These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. New Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions, discovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, till alarmed by the appearance of a connection between Canada and that State, entered deeply into the same views. These being small States, saw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness. In a review of these transactions we may trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the States with each other, if it should be their unpropitious destiny to become disunited.''

''The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of contention. The States less favorably circumstanced would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors. Each State, or separate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself. This would occasion distinctions, preferences, and exclusions, which would beget discontent. The habits of intercourse, on the basis of equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since the earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to those causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this circumstance. WE SHOULD BE READY TO DENOMINATE INJURIES THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE IN REALITY THE JUSTIFIABLE ACTS OF INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGNTIES CONSULTING A DISTINCT INTEREST. The spirit of enterprise, which characterizes the commercial part of America, has left no occasion of displaying itself unimproved. It is not at all probable that this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations of trade by which particular States might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens. The infractions of these regulations, on one side, the efforts to prevent and repel them, on the other, would naturally lead to outrages, and these to reprisals and wars.''

''The opportunities which some States would have of rendering others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently submitted to by the tributary States. The relative situation of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an example of this kind. New York, from the necessities of revenue, must lay duties on her importations. A great part of these duties must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of what we import. New York would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage. Her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors; nor would it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to distinguish the customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New Jersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit? Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived an advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so oppressive? Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of New Jersey on the other? These are questions that temerity alone will answer in the affirmative.''

''The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity. How would it be possible to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? There is scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real objections. These, as usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties. There are even dissimilar views among the States as to the general principle of discharging the public debt. Some of them, either less impressed with the importance of national credit, or because their citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in the question, feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment of the domestic debt at any rate. These would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a distribution. Others of them, a numerous body of whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the State in the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous for some equitable and effective provision. The procrastinations of the former would excite the resentments of the latter. The settlement of a rule would, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of opinion and affected delays. The citizens of the States interested would clamour; foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their just demands, and the peace of the States would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and internal contention.''

''Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the apportionment made. Still there is great room to suppose that the rule agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon some States than upon others. Those which were sufferers by it would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. The others would as naturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to end in an increase of their own incumbrances. Their refusal would be too plausible a pretext to the complaining States to withhold their contributions, not to be embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance of these States with their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and altercation. If even the rule adopted should in practice justify the equality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the States would result from a diversity of other causes--the real deficiency of resources; the mismanagement of their finances; accidental disorders in the management of the government; and, in addition to the rest, the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them, and interfere with the supply of immediate wants. Delinquencies, from whatever causes, would be productive of complaints, recriminations, and quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more likely to disturb the tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident benefit. For it is an observation, as true as it is trite, that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the payment of money.''

''Laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to aggressions on the rights of those States whose citizens are injured by them, may be considered as another probable source of hostility. We are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or more equitable spirit would preside over the legislations of the individual States hereafter, if unrestrained by any additional checks, than we have heretofore seen in too many instances disgracing their several codes. We have observed the disposition to retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of the enormities perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island; and we reasonably infer that, in similar cases, under other circumstances, a war, not of PARCHMENT, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious breaches of moral obligation and social justice.''

''The probability of incompatible alliances between the different States or confederacies and different foreign nations, and the effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole, have been sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers. From the view they have exhibited of this part of the subject, this conclusion is to be drawn, that America, if not connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a simple league, offensive and defensive, would, by the operation of such jarring alliances, be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of European politics and wars; and by the destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided, would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them all. Divide et impera must be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''ASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several States, in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy, would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity, with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would attend such a situation.''

''War between the States, in the first period of their separate existence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments have long obtained. The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy, have, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their introduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the same ends. The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places, which mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country. Similar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and delay the progress of an invader. Formerly, an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively small force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aid of posts, is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprises of one much more considerable. The history of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide nothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and little acquisition.''

''In this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as possible. The want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous States would, with little difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. Conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. War, therefore, would be desultory and predatory. PLUNDER and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars. The calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits.''

''This picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it would not long remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.''

''The institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the correspondent appendages of military establishments. Standing armies, it is said, are not provided against in the new Constitution; and it is therefore inferred that they may exist under it. Their existence, however, from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most, problematical and uncertain. But standing armies, it may be replied, must inevitably result from a dissolution of the Confederacy. Frequent war and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant preparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker States or confederacies would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent neighbors. They would endeavor to supply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular and effective system of defense, by disciplined troops, and by fortifications. They would, at the same time, be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government, in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy. It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority.''

''The expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors. Small states, or states of less natural strength, under vigorous governments, and with the assistance of disciplined armies, have often triumphed over large states, or states of greater natural strength, which have been destitute of these advantages. Neither the pride nor the safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority. They would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected, to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence. Thus, we should, in a little time, see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World. This, at least, would be the natural course of things; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just, in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard.''

''These are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a Constitution, the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of a people, or their representatives and delegates, but they are solid conclusions, drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs.''

''It may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often distracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different answers, equally satisfactory, may be given to this question. The industrious habits of the people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain, and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce, are incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the true condition of the people of those republics. The means of revenue, which have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of industry, and the science of finance, which is the offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced an entire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the inseparable companions of frequent hostility.''

''There is a wide difference, also, between military establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions, and in one which is often subject to them, and always apprehensive of them. The rulers of the former can have a good pretext, if they are even so inclined, to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter. These armies being, in the first case, rarely, if at all, called into activity for interior defense, the people are in no danger of being broken to military subordination. The laws are not accustomed to relaxations, in favor of military exigencies; the civil state remains in full vigor, neither corrupted, nor confounded with the principles or propensities of the other state. The smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community an over-match for it; and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for protection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love nor fear the soldiery; they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights. The army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to suppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or insurrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of the great body of the people.''

''In a country in the predicament last described, the contrary of all this happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it; its armies must be numerous enough for instant defense. The continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen. The military state becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to weaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but as their superiors. The transition from this disposition to that of considering them masters, is neither remote nor difficult; but it is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions, to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military power.''

''The kingdom of Great Britain falls within the first description. An insular situation, and a powerful marine, guarding it in a great measure against the possibility of foreign invasion, supersede the necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom. A sufficient force to make head against a sudden descent, till the militia could have time to rally and embody, is all that has been deemed requisite. No motive of national policy has demanded, nor would public opinion have tolerated, a larger number of troops upon its domestic establishment. There has been, for a long time past, little room for the operation of the other causes, which have been enumerated as the consequences of internal war. This peculiar felicity of situation has, in a great degree, contributed to preserve the liberty which that country to this day enjoys, in spite of the prevalent venality and corruption. If, on the contrary, Britain had been situated on the continent, and had been compelled, as she would have been, by that situation, to make her military establishments at home coextensive with those of the other great powers of Europe, she, like them, would in all probability be, at this day, a victim to the absolute power of a single man. 'T is possible, though not easy, that the people of that island may be enslaved from other causes; but it cannot be by the prowess of an army so inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the kingdom.''

''If we are wise enough to preserve the Union we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation. Europe is at a great distance from us. Her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance. Extensive military establishments cannot, in this position, be necessary to our security. But if we should be disunited, and the integral parts should either remain separated, or, which is most probable, should be thrown together into two or three confederacies, we should be, in a short course of time, in the predicament of the continental powers of Europe --our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.''

''This is an idea not superficial or futile, but solid and weighty. It deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and honest man of whatever party. If such men will make a firm and solemn pause, and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this interesting idea; if they will contemplate it in all its attitudes, and trace it to all its consequences, they will not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a Constitution, the rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to the Union. The airy phantoms that flit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers, real, certain, and formidable.''

Federalist No. 9 is titled ''&quot;The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to succeed. If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated.''

''From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms of republican government, but against the very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the order of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and partisans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have, in a few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms. And, I trust, America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices, not less magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors.''

''But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican government were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible. The science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and checks; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election: these are wholly new discoveries, or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumstances that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I shall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on a principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such systems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of a single State or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great Confederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the object under consideration. It will, however, be of use to examine the principle in its application to a single State, which shall be attended to in another place.''

''The utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard the internal tranquillity of States, as to increase their external force and security, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of politics. The opponents of the plan proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work, nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they subscribe with such ready acquiescence.''

''When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these States. Neither Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth, we shall be driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous commonwealths, the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and the miserable objects of universal pity or contempt. Some of the writers who have come forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the division of the larger States as a desirable thing. Such an infatuated policy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices, answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of America.''

''Referring the examination of the principle itself to another place, as has been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here that, in the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon the occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more considerable MEMBERS of the Union, but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the true question, in the discussion of which we are at present interested.''

''So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition to a general Union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for extending the sphere of popular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism.''

''&quot;It is very probable,&quot; (says he) &quot;that mankind would have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single person, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.''

''&quot;This form of government is a convention by which several smaller STATES agree to become members of a larger ONE, which they intend to form. It is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one, capable of increasing, by means of new associations, till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united body.''

''&quot;A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may support itself without any internal corruptions. The form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniences.''

''&quot;If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states. Were he to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation.''

''&quot;Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The state may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.''

''&quot;As this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of each; and with respect to its external situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the advantages of large monarchies.''

''I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages, because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in favor of the Union, and must effectually remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to make. They have, at the same time, an intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.''

''A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a CONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States. The essential characteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government. These positions are, in the main, arbitrary; they are supported neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed happened, that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be inherent in their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that there is no absolute rule on the subject. And it will be clearly shown in the course of this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the government.''

''The definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be &quot;an assemblage of societies,&quot; or an association of two or more states into one state. The extent, modifications, and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by a constitutional necessity, for local purposes; though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in the Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.''

''In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES or republics, the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON COUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and the smallest to ONE. The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of the respective CITIES. This was certainly the most, delicate species of interference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is the appointment of their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this association, says: &quot;Were I to give a model of an excellent Confederate Republic, it would be that of Lycia.'' Thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper contains Hamilton's response to the common Anti-Federalist argument based on the theories of [[w:Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], who wrote famously in his [[w:The Spirit of the Laws|The Spirit of the Laws]] that &quot;it is natural to a republic to have only a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist.&quot; The Anti-Federalist took his arguments to mean that the federal Union was bound to fail. Hamilton responded that if Montesquieu were taken literally, then since he was thinking of dimensions far smaller even than those of the states, the Americans would have to split themselves into &quot;an infinity of little, jealous, clashing tumultuous commonwealths.&quot; More seriously, Hamilton contends that the confederated federal system described in the proposed [[../../Constitution/]] would not suffer as Montesquieu predicted simply due to its confederated rather than centralized design.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.''

''By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.''

''There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.''

''There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.''

''It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.''

''The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.''

''The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.''

''No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.''

''It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.''

''The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.''

''If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.''

''By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.''

''From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.''

''A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.''

''The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.''

''The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:''

''In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.''

''In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.''

''It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.''

''The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.''

''Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the Union, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the Union gives it the most palpable advantage.''

''The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire State.''

''In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.'' 

''PUBLIUS.'' 

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is the most famous of the Federalist Papers, along with the Federalist No. 51, also by James Madison, and is among the most highly regarded of all American political writings.

No. 10 addresses the question of how to guard against &quot;factions,&quot; groups of citizens with interests contrary to the rights of others or the interests of the whole community. Madison argued that a strong, large republic would be a better guard against those dangers than smaller republics—for instance, the individual states. Opponents of the Constitution offered counterarguments to his position, which were substantially derived from the commentary of [[w:Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] on this subject.

Federalist No. 10 continues a theme begun in Federalist No. 9. The whole series is cited by scholars and jurists as an authoritative interpretation and explication of the meaning of the [[../../Constitution/]]. Jurists have frequently read No. 10 to mean that the Founding Fathers did not intend the United States government to be [[w:Partisan|partisan]].

A Zener diode is a type of diode that permits current to flow in the forward direction like a normal diode, but also in the reverse direction if the voltage is larger than the rated breakdown voltage or &quot;Zener voltage&quot;.  The device was named for [[Wikipedia:Clarence Zener|Clarence Zener]], who discovered this electrical property.

A conventional solid-state diode will not let significant current flow if reverse-biased below its reverse breakdown voltage. By exceeding the reverse bias breakdown voltage, a conventional diode is subject to high current flow due to avalanche breakdown. Unless this current is limited by external circuitry, the diode will be permanently damaged. In case of large forward bias (current flow in the direction of the arrow), the diode exhibits a voltage drop due to internal resistance. The amount of the voltage drop depends on the design of the diode.

A Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except the device is especially designed so as to have a greatly reduced breakdown voltage, the so-called Zener voltage. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p-n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material. A reverse-biased Zener diode will exhibit a controlled breakdown and let the current flow to keep the voltage across the Zener diode at the Zener voltage. For example, a diode with a Zener breakdown voltage of 3.2 V will exhibit a voltage drop of 3.2 V if reverse biased. However, the current is not unlimited, so the Zener diode is typically used to generate a reference voltage for an amplifier stage, or as a voltage stabilizer for low-current applications.

The breakdown voltage can be controlled quite accurately in the doping process. Tolerances to within 0.05% are available though the most widely used tolerances are 5% and 10%.

Another mechanism that produces a similar effect is the avalanche effect as in the avalanche diode. The two types of diode are in fact constructed the same way and both effects are present in diodes of this type. In silicon diodes up to about 5.6 volts, the zener effect is the predominant effect and shows a marked negative temperature coefficient. Above 5.6 volts, the avalanche effect becomes predominant and exhibits a positive temperature coefficient.

In a 5.6 V diode, the two effects occur together and their temperature coefficients neatly cancel each other out, thus the 5.6 V diode is the part of choice in temperature critical applications.

Modern manufacturing techniques have produced devices with voltages lower than 5.6 V with negligible temperature coefficients, but as higher voltage devices are encountered, the temperature coefficient rises dramatically. A 75 V diode has 10 times the coefficient of a 12 V diode.

All such diodes, regardless of breakdown voltage, are usually marketed under the umbrella term of 'zener diode'.

Hi Junesun, 

You wrote:
:''I believe this approach would also work out well for Thai and take away a major stumbling block for people interested in learning Thai but afraid of learning a new alphabet. If you'd like to try it, make a page similar to Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan listing as many suitable words and names as you can think of and their transliteration and inform me. I'll gladly help you by finding a good order to introduce letters and starting to write the lessons. Deal?''

Very kind of you, and it sounds excellent - unfortunately I know almost no Thai at this stage! I was just incorporating other people's material. I speak Indonesian (which uses the Roman alphabet) and help out elsewhere where I can... 

You could try Tony Mortlock of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Thai/Adding_vocabulary_with_word_association&amp;oldid=555852 this version], which is the source for [[Thai/Adding vocabulary with word association]] (as explained on the [[Talk:Thai/Adding vocabulary with word association|talk page]]). I don't know if Tony has studied the Thai script, but he may be interested in helping, or directing you to someone else. His email is at the bottom of his page.

I have an additional selfish reason for wanting to see the Thai pages develop as I wish to start learning Thai sometime in the next year or so, in preparation for going there. 

I've read (eslcafe.com forums) that it's easy to buy material in Thailand to help learn to make the letters. So, when I eventually get there I may be in a better position to help.

Look forward to further collaboration... --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 00:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== Love your lessons ==

Hi Junesun,

Was new page patrolling and saw &quot;Lesson 5&quot;. Was giggling at the words you used for examples of &quot;Phi&quot;. Nice work!

--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:12, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

: I'm glad you like the lessons. I'm trying to give people an easy introduction to the Greek alphabet, since I know from personal experience that it's incredibly hard to learn a script when you're just given a table showing the letters. I'm hoping to encourage the development of similar lessons for other scripts, too (right now [[Arabic/Writing_lessons_plan|Arabic]] and [[Thai/Writing_lessons_plan|Thai]] because of personal interests). Seeing that the vast majority of commercially-available textbooks just give students a table of letters to memorise, Wikibooks could easily excel in this and become '''the''' place to go for tortured language students. 

: A similar step-by-step approach is successful in regular language lessons, too. See my [[BLL German]] course and the page [[Help: Bite-sized language lessons]], which is an explanation of the didactic idea behind it. Also, you might be interested to know that I'm currently running [http://www.en-gb.pledgebank.com/teachGerman a pledge] concerning language-teaching on Wikibooks, hoping to get more people involved.

== A few things on the language pages ==

* Re the Writing lessons plan pages, I think it would be helpful to link them from the main page for the language. ''(Note: I just realised you actually have linked them... missed that somehow, sorry. --03:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC))'' I linked [[Thai/Writing lessons plan]] from [[Thai]]. Possibly it should go under a &quot;teacher's resources&quot; or &quot;contributor's guide&quot; heading. In the short term, some of this material can still be useful to learners. Also, contributors might not be aware of the page unless it's linked from the front. 

* Re the word ''propadeutic'', I think very few people will know this word, so perhaps it could be expressed differently?  Does it just mean ''preparatory''?

* FYI: I've added a few things to [[How to learn a language]], including a section &quot;[[How to learn a language#Notes for teachers|Notes for teachers]]&quot; which might be moved to [[How to Teach a Language]] when it is more developed.

== Korean RWP lessons ==

Hi Junesun!

I recently found your lessons on reading, writing and pronouncing Korean. Are you planning to update these lessons at some time? I think they're very good for someone who has no prior knowledge of the language (like me). Or do you know any other online resources for learning Korean? ([[User:Michael Drüing|Michael Drüing]] 11:16, 8 November 2006 (UTC))

: Hi! I'm glad you find the lessons useful. I decided to discontinue working on Wikibook projects because I can't find other contributors to my projects ([[BLL German|my method to learn German easily]], [[Esperanto/Quick and dirty guide|Quick and dirty guide to Esperanto]], [[Modern Greek|Modern Greek writing and language lessons]], [[Korean/RWP|Learn to read write and pronounce Korean]], [[Arabic/Writing lessons plan|Learn to read write and pronounce Arabic]], [[Thai/Writing lessons plan|Learn to read write and pronounce Thai]]) and if I am to do all the work I may just as well put it on my own website (currently migrating to a new server). If you like, send me an e-mail and I'll message you when I've written the rest of the Korean lessons there.

: [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 20:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:: Sorry, forgot to mention it here, but a much improved version of the lessons is now available at [http://www.learnlangs.com/RWP/Korean my site on language learning]. I already completed lesson 4 there, which is incomplete here (not to mention that somebody is now editing the lessons here destroying the methology and deleting exercise possibilities), and I am hoping to post the last two lessons on my site soon. Also, I have found some Korean speakers who are recording words for me, so that you will have some samples to base your pronunciation on, instead of just descriptions. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 20:41, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

::: I'm sorry to read that you think my edits are destroying the methodology and deleting the exercise possibilities.  You clearly had stated that you were not going to continue to work on the lessons, so I didn't think to ask you about your vision before digging in.  If you're still insterested in collaborating here, let me know and I'd be happy to help.  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 02:36, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:::: I described the concept on the Korean talk page and at [[Korean/Writing lessons plan]]. The lesson plan can be found at [[Korean/Writing lessons plan 2]], but who cares about methodology or lesson plans here. Basically, it's about introducing '''one letter at a time''' followed by exercises, so that people get eased into reading and writing the script. It was a lot of work to find suitable letters and words for the first lesson, but now each new letter opens up an abundance of words for practise and each practise word also re-inforces the letters that students have already learned. Feedback on this method has been awesome.

:::: I dislike that you are moving in the direction of introducing more letters and providing less exercise opportunities again, since the whole purpose of the course was to be a counter-weight to that approach which unfortunately is very popular with textbook authors. There can never be enough exercises, as gifted students can just skip the rest of the exercises as soon as they feel comfortable and for challenged students even 50 exercises on the same topic may not be enough. I also dislike that you removed my announcement twice, since students have a right to know that the course on Wikibooks isn't going anywhere soon, so that they don't have to come back to check all the time. Also, seeing that I did all the work of creating the lessons, the GNU license affords me attribution. I do like the diagrams you added to the lessons. Now I have invested too much in developing and promoting the course on my own site though and I'm also more acutely aware of all the limitations Wikibooks puts on course development, so I won't continue the course here.
:::: [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 09:11, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

::::: Well, I hadn't seen [[Korean/Writing lessons plan]] before now, but, now having read it, I take no issue with the methodology.  It will be quite easy to revise my edits to align with that methodology.

:::::  Regarding the removal of the announcement, the first announcement[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Korean/RWP&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=778802] was a very ugly advertising rant posted by [[Special:Contributions/84.164.90.188|an anonymous user]].  When I checked the destination of the link, I found that no new material was actually added to that site, so I removed the rant.  The second announcement I removed (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Korean/RWP&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=861877]) inaccurately claimed that you are the only person working on the project and that you had no community support, it advertised a non-WikiMedia site, and it was a talk-page-style comment writted directly on a course module.  It was better suited for the talk page, so I moved it there.  At best, it may be OK to add a short link to your site in a ==External links== section on [[Korean/RWP]], similar to the one there now but without the skeptical &quot;The future of this course is unclear&quot;.

== Devanagari script tutorial ==

Hi , saw your comment on the Devanagiri script article requesting for a tutorial on how to write in devanagiri 
Came across this
http://www.avashy.com/hindiscripttutor.htm

(Cant sign in because I do not have an account but I have a English Wikipeida account named Deepak D'Souza . Just in case you need any thing from me you can leave a message there or email me at ddyaar@gmail.com)

: Hey, thanks for giving me that link. I still think that there should be an easier way to learn the script though; this website is nicely made but it still boils down to learning all the letters before you can read anything. My script tutorials have you reading right from the beginning and a lot of people have told me that they are a child's play to follow through to where you know all letters. Have a look at www.learnlangs.com/RWP/Korean to see what I consider an easy approach.  -- [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 16:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

== Your message on [[Talk:English]] ==

I saw your message on the talk page.  I can understand your concerns about using Wikibooks for learning languages but it must be possible.  Unfortunately the English Wikibook has been desserted for some time and I've taken the decision to revamp it but this is a huge project involving several different English books (English, ESL, Teaching ESL, Business English and a book I am writing for intermediate English students).  The one thing you probably don't have to worry about is people creating pages which don't blend in with the other part of the book - because nobody seems to edit this book anyway!  I wish you well but wish people would stay at Wikibooks and help make it better. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:03, 13 May 2007 (UTC)
: This has been exactly my experience: nobody seems to edit any book anyway. The books are all either abandoned or one-person efforts. And if you're going to have to do all the work of writing a book on your own, why not do it in a medium that's better suited for teaching, where you'll receive all the recognition and where nobody can one day come along and mess things up while you're not looking. Finding able contributors for Wikibooks is a lost quest. I tried too many times. For writing lessons for Arabic, Devanagari and Thai for example. Also for the German course at [[BLL German]] - the current German wikibook is a joke, even though it got the Book of the Month award. Introducing up to 200 new words per lesson (I counted them once in lesson 2), plenty of grammar and a minuscule amount of exercises, many of which are undoable because they require knowledge of concepts that haven't been introduced yet. I wanted to make a difference there. I created lessons and plans for more, even a separate page going into a lot of detail on how anybody can contribute to the course ([[BLL German/Contributing]]). Absolutely nobody showed up except to do minor corrections to the formatting and it's been almost a year. For Modern Greek I actually found two people who would help create lessons, but shortly after I developed a decent [[Talk: Modern Greek|lesson plan]] they disappeared. Wikibooks is not the way to go if you actually want to complete a good course and there isn't a single language course on it that I would recommend for actual studying. I gave a talk on Wikibooks at the Wikimania conference in Boston last summer and drew some interest, but nothing has changed. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 09:36, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

Junesun, I replied to your post on [[Talk:English]], but thought you may also be interested in this: http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Kana/quiz .  Wikiversity uses a &quot;quiz&quot; extension to help with interactive exercises.  If it would help in building courses, we may be able to get that extension installed here. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 22:05, 13 May 2007 (UTC)
: I suggested the development of exercise extensions. That would at least make Wikibooks somewhat of an alternative to web pages for non-programmers, though it will never reach all possibilities of course web pages created by experienced programmers, such as the courses on [http://www.lernu.net Lernu]. The other problems still remain though, especially the problem that most self-proclaimed course writers '''don't even know''' they should be providing exercises.

== Thanks ==

Hi Junesun. Thanks for your role in making Miskito a featured book. I'm flattered! I already expressed my thanks generically on the language bookshelf talk page, but thought I should tell you personally too. If you have any other thoughts (positive or critical) about the course I'd enjoy discussing it, and our ideas about language teaching/learning and the Wikibook language courses, with you. I certainly agree with your general appraisal of most of the &quot;books&quot; (ahem) there at the moment, and share your concern that something be done to improve them. I hope that the project I have started, of which I view the Miskito course as just a part and a first step, will contribute to that.

I don't know if you're interested but I seem to have triggered off a discussion (which I hope will be constructive) on the bookshelf talk page about how the languages are listed there. Since only one other person has taken part so far, you might be interested in saying something to help broaden the discussion and contribute your opinion, if you have one.

Finally, I just read your user page and I felt very sympathetic with the feeling you express in the last line: &quot;I used to also be involved in Wikipedia (user name: Junesun), but I'm fed up with seeing my hard work deleted by adolescent boys with too much power on their hands.&quot; I also work in Wikipedia, and oh yes, I know what you mean! However, there are also people there with whom it is worth collaborating, so perhaps you have to take the good with the bad. Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:45, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

== Pedagogics ==

I read on the [[Wikibooks talk:Languages bookshelf|Languages bookshelf talkpage]] that you're somewhat of an expert. I wondered, if you have a few moments, if you could look at [[Spanish|the Spanish Wikibook]], to see if it fits the principles of pedagogics. It'd be interesting to see where I'm going right/wrong, how I might improve, and, most importantly, if someone could actually use it for practical learning. Thanks and kind regards, &amp;mdash;[[User:Celestianpower|Cel&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;es&lt;/font&gt;tianpower]] &lt;sup&gt;[[user talk:Celestianpower|háblame]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:04, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

: Hey, it's so nice to hear that others are interested in providing quality language materials here, too. The Spanish Wikibook is quite good. The standard make-up of each lesson is good, the explanations are understandable, extra vocabulary and expressions that go with the topic (e. g. list of sports) have been chosen well and the exercises are very good for practising what was taught. However, most of the lessons appear to stand on their own, not incorporating what was taught before. 
: Things I would have done differently:
* try to re-use topics and words that you used in previous lessons. This will function as a natural review. Having introduced reflexive verbs in the first lesson, I might make the second lesson about daily activities (getting up, washing, brushing teeth, getting dressed, ...) as a lot of these verbs are reflexive in Romance languages. As new point of grammar I'd discuss the articles and the plural; 
* alternatively, I'd make the second lesson about verbs that are conjugated like &quot;llamarse&quot; - not necessarily reflexive verbs but verbs that take exactly the same endings (maybe a text about further introductions, so you could re-use some phrases from lesson 1), this way students wouldn't have to learn a new conjugation yet. Seeing a regularity when starting to learn the language is more motivating than first having to learn irregularities. Or at least assure new language learners that there is a regularity to these endings, that they won't have to learn a new set for each verb; 
* I also like to make one of the first lessons about &quot;to be&quot;, since it's very versatile and useful, and a more basic part of grammar than reflexive verbs; however Spanish having two kinds of &quot;to be&quot; might affect this decision.
* lesson 2, you should explain about &quot;primero&quot; and other ordinal numbers before using them;
* rather than forcing lots of elementary grammar and three conjugations down the student's throat in lesson 3, I'd introduce these step by step in real lessons with dialogues and exercises;
* lesson 4 also introduces rather much grammar, especially seeing students haven't had the time to digest the grammar-only lesson 3.
* in lesson 5 you re-introduce reflexive verbs (gustarse), making it sound like it's a new type of verb. This is confusing.
* lesson 6 is fine. Maybe the dialogue could be made a bit longer without introducing too many new words. Had &quot;necesitar&quot; been taught before? I'm not really keeping track of the vocabulary taught, but you should.
* lesson 7 is the third time reflexive verbs are introduced. The combination of teaching reflexive verbs + daily activities + telling the time is something I have used in the past too, but then you can't put that lesson at the beginning of the course.
* the way the future is introduced in lesson 8 is good. However, I wouldn't add quite as much stuff about hotels etc. there - that could be used for additional lesson dialogues. The Activities part can stay, it's an additional way of practising &quot;ir&quot;. I don't recall &quot;poder&quot; being taught (used for &quot;¿Se puede fumar en el cuarto?&quot;), so that needs to come at some point, hopefully in a different lesson.
* I don't see the future being used in any way in the dialogue of lesson 9. Maybe that dialogue would have been better used towards the beginning of the course, as it fits with the topic of introducing oneself. Lesson 9 should contain a dialogue in the future tense, as students dislike learning something they have no use for and also the more examples, the better. Don't forget to explain what the difference in usage between the future using &quot;ir&quot; and the future you are now teaching is. Just saying it's a &quot;real future tense&quot; doesn't help much.
* generally, provide a more complete list of essential vocabulary used, e. g. indicating that &quot;Qué&quot; is &quot;What&quot; and &quot;Cuándo&quot; is &quot;When&quot;, etc., rather than leaving that to the user to guess from the example sentences;
* try to think about grammar explanations differently, e. g. instead of conveying &quot;Now you are going to learn stem-changing verbs&quot; you should convey &quot;Weren't you thrown off by seeing 'quiero' instead of the expected 'quero' in the dialogue? The reason is ...&quot;;

Quite a lot of remarks, I know. I hope they will help improve the Spanish Wikibook. I don't speak Spanish well, drawing mostly on my Italian, Latin, French and Esperanto, but if you at some point create a lesson plan I'd like to have a look. I'd create one myself, but right now I need to focus on creating lessons for the company, so that I can pay my tuition fees.

== Modern Greek wikibook ==

I would be interested in getting involved in this project.  How can I plug in? [[User:ArielGlenn|ArielGlenn]] 00:49, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

: Great! Please have a look at the [[Modern Greek/Lesson plan|lesson plan]]. None of the lessons have been written so far, so you can start with lesson 1. If you don't feel that you can prepare an entire lesson according to the &quot;Bite-sized language lessons&quot; concept, you can also just contribute a dialogue, a grammar explanation, exercises or the like. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 07:33, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

== Devanagari ==
Hi Junesun! I saw your request about improvement of Devanagari wikibook. Frankly speaking, I agree with what you have said above, that books are  1-man errand. The problem with wikibooks, that atleast I encountered, was that I would like to restructure the Hindi or Devanagari books - the current way is totally random - deciding first how to lay down every course, and then going ahead writing one by one, loosing interest in the middle because you realize no one else is writing anything and all subtitles are your work.

So, I am planning to write a new book about Devanagari. Right now I am little busy, since my exams are going on. If you are still interested in this project, I would really like your help in guiding me through, since I am just an engineer, no language expert.

By the way, ich lebe in Deutschland. ich studiere Chemie im Universität Stuttgart, und ich verstehe nur ein bißen Deutsch.

viele Grüße,

--[[User:Anupamsr|Anupamsr]] 19:49, 9 August 2007 (UTC)
:[[Devanagari:Book|Here]], have a look at the sample. Please provide any comments if you have. The next lesson may take some time, because my exams are going on... as I said...--[[User:Anupamsr|Anupamsr]] 20:59, 9 August 2007 (UTC)

:: Hi Anupamsr! I'm glad that you're getting involved in the Devanagari course. So far, your work looks very good. I would eventually put the explanation about how reading works into the first reading lesson. 

:: If you want to teach people how to read Devanagari similar to how I taught them how to read [[Modern Greek|the Greek alphabet]] or Korean at [http://www.learnlangs.com/RWP/Korean], which is probably the most painless method there is, here are the steps you will need:
# collect a large amount of Hindi words that are similar to English ones. Country names, city names, personal names, brand names and anything goes, just have a look at the words I chose for my courses. The important thing is that the user will recognize the word after reading it. E. g. if he reads &quot;lu-n-du-n&quot;, he'd recognize that that's the word for &quot;London&quot;, especially if you provide &quot;capital in Europe&quot; as a hint. (I'm not claiming that that's the word for London, I don't know any Hindi)
# identify the words that only have very few distinct letters when written in Devanagari, e. g. &quot;papa&quot; would only have two and &quot;banana&quot; only three.
# introduce letters one by one (the combinations of K that you posted are a good start), but in such a way that students can read those words from step 2 as soon as possible. Give them as many words as possible for practice.

:: I would be glad to help you plan this, as I myself would like to be able to read Devanagari. Once you have a list of words, just let me know and I'll help you with the rest of the steps.

:: Judith

== == Zulu wikibook == ==

I'm sorry to bother you with this.  But would it be possible for you to look at the exercises that I have done for the Zulu book.  All I'd like is feedback in terms of the balance of the exercises.  Also I've used a measure of revision in some of the later exercises, by asking questions that were introduced in subsequent chapters.  Is this useful or simply demoralising? Any input would be much appreciated. --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] ([[User talk:IKnowNothing|talk]]) 21:32, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

: I think the exercises are fine, very balanced. I particularly like that you asked the student to interact (&quot;how would you respond...&quot;) instead of just asking for translations. When you're introducing conjugations and the like, fill-in-the-blank exercises and spot-the-mistake exercises are also very effective, but unfortunately Wikibooks is very limiting in what kind of exercises it allows you to create. By the way, thank you very much for creating a lesson in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook according to the lesson plan I wrote up! I had despaired to ever see anybody besides me contribute to that...

Hello, hope and wish you are doing fine. I recently noticed your request for a much more introductory page to learn Tamil (the South Indian language) and incidentally I happened to have started a course in wikiversity just for that... It would be helpful for me if you can start taking that course and give me feedback so as to organize it better (in a learner's perspective) and improve them... The course have just begun, but has completed resources for learning the Tamil script. Find it [[v:Topic:Tamil|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}
'''Cancer''' is a disease that can affect many different parts of the body, but some of the places that are most notably at risk for it are the pubic areas. It is for this reason that these areas should be checked frequently. Doctors who deal specifically with cancer treatment are known as '''oncologists'''.

== Breast Cancer ==
{{Wikipedia|Breast cancer}}
Breast cancer is a common and devastating cancer that is found predominantly in women, but that can also be occasionally found in men. Sometimes, if breast cancer isn't responsive to normal treatments, the breast may need to be surgically removed in an operation called a '''mastectomy'''. Mastectomies are radical surgeries that can have prolonged mental and emotional effects for the patient. Women are encouraged to check themselves for breast cancer on a regular basis.

Breast cancer, like most other cancers, is easier to treat medically if detected early. Women should be screened for breast cancer regularly, and they should examine themselves for changes or irregularities frequently.


The pink ribbon, and the color pink in general have been adopted as symbols of support for breast cancer. October is national breast cancer awareness month in the United states. During this month, survivors of breast cancer, as well as friends and family of both survivors and victims frequently wear pink ribbons.

=== Breast self-examination ===
Women are encouraged to examine themselves for breast cancer on a regular basis. [[w:Breast self-examination|Breast self-examination]](BSE) is not particularly reliable, but it can help to give valuable early warning. If you find anything abnormal during a breast self-examination, such as a lump, a sore area, or other abnormality, you should consult a doctor immediately.

==== Basic exam ====
Here are steps for a basic self-examination:
[[Image:En Breast cancer illustrations.gif|thumb|right|Some common indications of breast cancer.]]

#Stand in front of a mirror with top exposed. 
#Place hands on hips.
#Look for signs of dimpling, swelling, soreness or redness in all parts of your breasts in the mirror.
#Repeat step 3 with arms raised above your head.
#While still standing, palpate your breasts with your fingers, feeling for lumps. Try to use a larger area of your fingers rather than prodding. Feel both for the area just beneath the skin and for the tissue deeper within.
#Go over the '''entire''' breast while examining - a useful method is to divide the breast into quadrants and go through each quadrant carefully. Also examine the &quot;axillary tail&quot; of each breast that points towards the armpit.
#Repeat palpation while lying down.
#Check the nipples and the area just beneath them. Gently squeeze each nipple to check for any abnormal discharge.

==== Seven P's ====
A similar method of self-examination is known as the '''Seven P's of BSE''':

#'''Position''': Inspect breasts visually and palpate in the mirror with arms at various positions. Then perform the examination lying down, first with a pillow under one shoulder, then with a pillow under the other shoulder, and finally lying flat.
#'''Perimeter''': Remember to examine the entire breast, including the nipple, the axillary tail that extends into the armpit, and nearby lymph nodes.
#'''Palpation''': Palpate with the pads of the fingers, without lifting the fingers as they move across the breast.
#'''Pressure''': First palpate with light pressure, then palpate with moderate pressure, and finally palpate with firm pressure.
#'''Pattern''': There are several examination patterns, and each woman should choose the one which is most comfortable for her. The vertical strip pattern involves moving the fingers up and down over the breast, the pie-wedge pattern involves starting at the nipple and moving outward, and the circular pattern involves moving the fingers in concentric circles from the nipple outward. Don't forget to palpate up into the armpit.
#'''Practice''': Practice the breast self-exam, and become familiar with the feel of the breast tissue, so you can recognize changes. A health care practitioner can provide feedback on your method.
#'''Plan''': Know what to do if you suspect a change in your breast tissue. Know your family history of breast cancer. Have mammography done as often as your health care provider recommends.

For pre-menopausal women, BSE is best done at the same stage of their period every month to minimize changes due to the menstrual cycle - the recommended time is just following the end of the last period when the breasts are least likely to be swollen and tender. Older, menopausal women should do BSE once a month, perhaps on the first or last day of every month.

About eight in ten lumps discovered on BSE are harmless. Nevertheless, any abnormality thus detected should immediately be reported to a doctor. Though most breast cancers are detected by women, BSE should be combined with an annual examination by a doctor for better chances of detection. Women can easily miss a breast lump that an expert can find. For the same reasons it is better to learn BSE from an expert. It is not a replacement for more trustworthy techniques like mammography.

'''Note:''' consult a trustworthy site such as [http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/ John's Hopkins Breast Cancer Center] for more complete and up-to-date information.

=== Mammogram ===
A mammogram is a medical imaging procedure, where the insides of the breasts are photographed, and breast cancer can be identified. It is important that women have regular mammograms, especially older women.

== Cervical cancer ==
Cervical cancer is a cancer of the cervix, and occurs only in women. Studies suggest that cervical cancer could be caused by an infection of HPV. For this reason, women who have HPV should be screened for cervical cancer regularly. Women who do not have HPV should also be screened as prescribed by a doctor. One of the more radical treatments for cervical cancer is a '''hysterectomy''', which is a surgical removal of the uterus and the cervix. After a hysterectomy, a woman no longer menstruates, and is not able to conceive children.

== Ovarian cancer ==
Ovarian cancer is cancer of the ovaries, and affects only women. Women should be screened for ovarian cancer regularly.

== Prostate cancer ==
Prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate gland, and only affects males. Beginning at age forty me should be screened for prostate cancer regularly. Treatment of prostate cancer can include surgical removal of the prostate, which has been known to cause problems with urination, erection, and ejaculation.

== Testicular cancer ==
Testicular cancer is a cancer of the testicles, and only affects men. Men should be screened for testicular cancer regularly, and should examine themselves for testicular cancer frequently. Early detection, like all cancers, is key to treating and beating testicular cancer. If testicular cancer progresses far enough, one or both testicles may need to be surgically removed.

=== Testicular self-examination ===
{{Wikipedia|Testicular self-examination}}
Men can test themselves for testicular cancer, by feeling the testicles and the scrotum for changes, such as lumps, soft spots, and sacs of liquid in the scrotum. The self-test is unreliable, but can help to give some valuable early warning. If you find anything abnormal in your self test, you should consult a doctor immediately.

Men from puberty onwards should examine their testes after a hot shower or bath, when the scrotum is looser. They should first examine each testicle separately, taking the testicle between the thumb and the forefinger, feeling for lumps, and then compare them to see whether one is larger than the other. By doing this each month, males will become familiar with what is normal for them.

Men should have an examination by a doctor if they notice any of the following:
* a lump in one testicle
* pain or tenderness
* blood in sperm during ejaculation (a small amount once is not necessarily cause for worry and rarely is caused by testicular cancer)
* build-up of fluid in the scrotum
* enlargement of abnormal breast tissue on the chest
* a change in the size of one testicle or the relative sizes of the two (but it is normal for one testicle to be slightly larger than the other)

'''Cozido à portuguesa''' is a one-dish typical meal of beef, pork, sausage and vegetables, which reflects the resourcefulness of traditional [[cookbook:cuisine of Portugal|Portuguese]] cooking. It is a well known national dish in Portugal, which somewhat parallels the French [[cookbook:pot-au-feu|pot-au-feu]], the Spanish [[cookbook:cocido|cocido]], the [[cookbook:New England boiled dinner|New England boiled dinner]] or the Costa Rican [[cookbook:casado|casado]]. 

It may take [[cookbook:beef|beef]], [[cookbook:pork|pork]], pork [[cookbook:sausage|sausage]], [[cookbook:blood sausage|blood sausage]], [[cookbook:salt pork|salt pork]], [[cookbook:pig's feet|pig's feet]], hard [[cookbook:ham|ham]], [[cookbook:potato|potato]]es, [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, [[cookbook:turnip|turnip]]s, [[cookbook:chickpea|chickpeas]], [[cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]] and [[cookbook:rice|rice]]. This would be originally a favorite food of the affluent farmer, which later reached the tables of the urban bourgeoisie and typical restaurants.

      <comment>/* Memory Pools */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Memory Allocation/Deallocation ==

You can allocate/deallocate each object as you require, or you can recycle your objects.

=== Allocate Deallocate ===

This would be the most basic approach. You allocate memory using the 'new' operator. You deallocate using the 'delete' operator. 

In addition, C-style memory management functions like malloc, realloc, free etc. can be used for allocating/deallocating memory. Using 'new' would be preferred in most cases. 

Have a look at auto-pointers later in this article, to facilitate automatic deallocation of pointers. 

=== Memory Pools === 

If you are going to allocate and deallocate repeatedly, it might be advisable to use memory pools. 

Using memory pools has several advantages. 

* You can control the amount of memory you want to allocate. For example, your memory pool helper functions, or memory pool classes can limit the amount of objects to be allocated. They might return NULL above a limit. Alternatively, in multi-threaded applications, they can choose to wait till a consumer has 'returned' some objects. 
* If you allocate in a single block, you get contiguous memory, compared to allocating one by one. Contiguous memory can be faster in terms of cache hits. 
* You have much more control over allocations and deallocations. For example, the memory pool can keep track of all the memory 'loaned' to other classes. It can provide a functionality whereby all the memory can be freed by a single function call. This can be helpful if you don't want to worry about deallocating individual objects, and instead want to deallocate all used objects in a single call at the end of a function etc. 
* Your memory pool classes can behave dynamically based on the configuration of the system. For example, in a multi-threaded consumer-producer model, your memory pool classes can choose an appropriate cache size based on the available memory in the system.

== Managing Pointers == 

You need to manage pointers in C++. Here are a few tips: 

* As a general rule, each pointer should be pointing to a valid memory location, or should be NULL. You should avoid dangling pointers at all costs. 
* As far as possible, you should not have more than one pointers pointing to the same memory. This could lead to dangling pointers, in case you free the memory using one pointer but don't set the other pointer(s) to NULL. 
* You should try to create and destroy the pointers in the same location. This makes it easy to keep track of what you are allocating and freeing. 
* Never double-free a pointer. And never reallocate a pointer to a new memory location if it was already pointing to a valid memory location, unless of course, you have some other way of freeing the old memory location. 
* Each memory location that you allocate using 'new' or 'malloc' etc. should be freed once you are done using the memory. Not freeing this memory would be called a memory leak. In general, it is a good idea to prevent memory leaks even if you know that you are not going to require too many allocations and your program is going to end soon.  

=== Auto Pointers ===

Auto pointers save you the task of freeing memory once you are done using a memory location. Auto pointers are part of the C++ standard library. 

{{TODO|Example code for using auto pointers}}

{{NOTE|Never store auto pointers in any STL container. The reason for this is that STL containers use assignment operations. Auto pointers use a very specific assignment behavior that is not compatible with the way containers are designed.}}

===Smart pointers===

:100 g [[cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]]
:125 ml [[cookbook:water|water]]
:1 drop red food colouring (optional)

== Procedure ==
#Preferably the almonds have to be roasted first. Put them in the oven at 180 °C for a few minutes.
#Then for the actually candying. Pour the water into a heavy-based saucepan. Then sprinkle over the sugar. Place over a low heat. Stir until the mixture thickens.
#Add the colouring. Stir in the almonds and mix so that they get a nice coating.
#Spread out the almonds on some baking paper and separate the almonds using a fork and let them cool a bit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''If you know Thai script, you may wish to help add Thai script to the table at [[Thai/Adding vocabulary with word association|Adding vocabulary with word association]].''

This is a plan for propadeutic (preparatory) lessons teaching the student the Thai script and its pronunciation (including letter combinations). The goal is to introduce letters one by one so as not to overwhelm the student. In order to raise his confidence and provide feelings of success, words used for illustration and exercises shall mostly be understandable without any knowledge of Thai: Thai words that come from English, Thai words that other languages borrowed, common transliterations of English personal names and names of countries or places whose name is not very different in Thai. 

The student will have no previous knowledge of Thai. He will be taught a few letters and then given some words from this list in order to practise reading. Upon successfully recognising all the letters of a word, he should be able to recognise the word itself. For example, &quot;(pasa) spain&quot; is recognizable because it's so similar to the English words &quot;Spain&quot; and &quot;Spanish&quot;. &quot;(pasa) farangsez&quot; is not recognizable because the English word is &quot;French&quot; and doesn't ressemble the Thai transliteration.

For now, this will just be a list of words that could be used, but eventually it shall turn into an order for letters to be introduced like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]] and then into actual step-by-step lessons like the writing lessons at [[Modern Greek]].

The following vowels are always written in front of the word including เ แ โ ไ ใ

Please post any words that could be used here, along with a letter-by-letter transliteration, the actual pronunciation and the English meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

I'm currently learning basics of using Java for serial communication on Linux. I couldn't get JavaComm to find /dev/ttyS0, so I've downloaded Sun's SimpleRead.java (http://java.sun.com/developer/releases/javacomm/SimpleRead.java) and modified in the following way:
&lt;pre&gt;
...
portId = (CommPortIdentifier) portList.nextElement();
System.out.println(&quot;Found a port named &quot; + portId.getName());
if (portId.getPortType() == CommPortIdentifier.PORT_SERIAL) {
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
It turned out, that on my machine serial ports are named COMx with x being a number 1-8.

This naming convention seems consistent with the contents of javax.comm.properties which reads on my machine:
&lt;pre&gt;
...
# Port numbers are sequentially allocated to all devices found that correspond
# to these devices.
# For example if you specify the prefix /dev/ttyS=PORT_SERIAL
# and the following devices exist
# /dev/ttyS0
# /dev/ttyS1
# then they will be allocated COM1 and COM2 respectively
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Therefore I'd propose adding a warning to other newbies in &quot;Finding the desired serial Port&quot; paragraph, that they should not neccessarily expect JavaComm port names to correspond to the OS level port names. 

My observations may or may not relate to the software that I'm using, so for reference I tested this on IBM Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2, JavaComm is provided by java-1.4.2-ibm-javacomm rpm package and I'm running them on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 4 update 3.

Regards,&lt;br&gt;
Paweł Brodacki

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello

I will also add that in order to properly compile this code is necesary to add this line at the begin.
import java.io.*;

Also, I think variable motoPort is not previously defined.

Best Regards,
Javier Sanchez.

Hiho.
classes  cannot be synchronized see:
http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html

in part '''A simple, thread-safe Ring Buffer Implementation'''
you have to synchronize all the methods not the class, i think

cheers 
Johann

is there a date on this entry &amp; mods?   since people are now/still saying that javax.comm is KAPUT
it would be good to have a date.
In general: Books have dates, Internat rants often do not, making them barely useful cts 21Sep2010

the very first pat of the demo fails:

 while (portIdentifiers.hasMoreElements())  {
        CommPortIdentifier pid = (CommPortIdentifier) portIdentifiers.nextElement();
        System.out.println(&quot;port  &quot; + pid.getName());
 
prints nothing   21Sep2010</text>

Schulz]] made frequent topical references within the strip to the events and popular culture of the time, which would have required no explanation for a contemporary reader.  Some of these references are now rather obscure, and might not be understood by someone not versed in the popular culture of the period.  These annotations aim to provide background for such references, and explain their significance. &lt;noinclude&gt;Links to Wikipedia are provided where necessary, if more information is desired.&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Each chapter corresponds with a separate volume from the Fantagraphics series, corresponding to two years of the published strips. The original publication dates of the strips are given in addition to the page numbers of the collection, so this reference work can also be used by people with access to the original archives.

The whole article should be reworked. For example the ''Attributes'' section contains wrong information; you are not able to ''hide'' attributes by defining the __getattr__ method as this method is only called when the attribute is not accessible. See also http://docs.python.org/ref/attribute-access.html [[Special:Contributions/217.236.101.14|217.236.101.14]] ([[User talk:217.236.101.14|talk]]) 17:56, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

Edit paragraph &quot;Dynamic Class Structure&quot; -&gt; C language does not have classes, but C++ does.

The example for Representation/__str__ is incomplete it seems. What did the original author intend to return?</text>

* [http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/419_1494.pdf The official country and major city transliterate names]

== Current status ==

This is starting to shape up. I looked up some words and place names that I had used for Greek, to see whether they might be suitable for Thai as well, and a lot of them are. The difficulty in comparison to the Greek alphabet course will be that there won't be any letters the student can already recognise right from the start. So what we need is a lot of words that don't use many letters (short words like &quot;oh&quot;, but long words like &quot;banana&quot; are also possible) and that are preferably very similar to the English equivalent. By the way, are there any one-letter words in Thai (not necessarily like any English ones)?

Once the list is sufficiently long, I will try to find an order that reflects a step-by-step increase. For example, once the student can read กา, he will just need to learn the additional letter ว (and the tone mark) in order to be able to read ก้าว, then he will just need to learn the additional letter เ in order to be able to read เก้า, then just โ to be able to read โกโก้. In the Greek alphabet course, we managed to find so many suitable words that the student could always read several new words (ressembling English ones! ''but of course Greek has had a more intense exchange of vocabulary with English than Thai has'') for each new letter he learned. It's great for practise and for a feeling of success. Nothing is more frustrating than having learned letter after letter and still being unable to read anything. Besides, if there is no opportunity to practise reading before the alphabet is completely assimilated, or if all the words are foreign to the student so that reading them is not a fun enigma but a task, the student will very easily forget what he has learned.

Thank you very much for your contributions!

The blocking guideline is simple: if you are disruptive to Wikibooks, you may be blocked. [[WB:CIVIL|Be civil]] and [[WB:ATTACK|respectful]] to other Wikibookians. 

== Blocking ==

Blocks should be used by administrators to protect Wikibooks, not as punishment. Administrators should exercise their best judgment in determining whether someone is being disruptive, whether to warn or block, and for how long a block should last. Just like all other actions, blocks are open to review.

== Unblocking ==

Unblocking should only be performed if disruption is no longer a concern. Like with blocking, its up to administrators to determine when disruption is no longer an issue. However in order to avoid disruption, administrators should either consult the blocking administrator or discuss a block on the [[WB:AA|Administrative Assistance]] page before overturning another administrator's block. When in doubt share your concerns and work cooperatively.

If you have been blocked, you may request to be unblocked using the {{tlx|unblock}} template on your talk page, which you should still be able to edit. If you believe someone else was wrongly blocked you may discuss it on the [[WB:AA|Administrative Assistance]] page.

== Controversial ==

At times there may be strong disagreement on what the appropriate action should of been or what the appropriate response should be. If a block or unblock action is particularly controversial administrators should avoid taking action or overturning a previous action until discussion has quieted down and a clear consensus has been reached. An action with consensus should not be overturned without strong proof that disruption has continued or will discontinue and may be grounds for having your tools removed if done inappropriately.</text>

Consensus failed. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

=== Yes ===
# &lt;s&gt;{{support|Support Wholeheartedly}} - I think all the areas of concern mentioned above have been adequately addressed in this guideline proposal. So far as I can tell, the community seems to be following this guideline of it's own accord already. That's consensus enough for me.

#{{support}} [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:33, 12 October 2007 (UTC)
#&lt;s&gt;{{support}} I was going to abstain, but on second thought I am in general support of this. Not to say that we can't improve it over time. I agree with herby that we can't hope to cover every possibility, so I suggest that this be a guideline and not a policy. We should also make sure we add something about how the text isnt always definitive and that admins are encouraged to use their best judgement. I specifically like the part about not being bold, because an admin wheel-war isnt a possibility that should ever be allowed. Now, admins can certainly question other admin's blocks, and raise the possibility of a reversal, but the key is discussion and not rash action. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:26, 15 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

=== No ===
#{{oppose}}  No blocking &lt;s&gt;policy&lt;/s&gt; guideline will ever cover every eventuality and will merely lead to opportunities to argue that someone is in the wrong --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:52, 13 October 2007 (UTC)
#{{oppose}} I agree with what Herby says.  I also disagree with the &quot;blocking and unblocking is not being bold&quot; statement.  If I disagree with another admin's block then I want to revert it and I'm quite happy for another admin to come along and revert any of my blocks.  Wikibooks works well because admins have different views and we all watch over each other and have the ability to revert each others actions.  I also disagree with blocking IPs which are suspected of being proxies.  There is no proof that this has stopped vandalism and it has a very bad affect on people in many countries who rely on open proxies for uncensored access to the Internet.

#:Blocking OPs is a foundation policy, and unblocking them is a violation of foundation policy. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:06, 14 October 2007 (UTC)
#:When I talked about possible reverting of an admin's block/unblock I wasn't referring to blocking of OPs.  If admins wish to persue this pointless activity of blocking OPs then they can but I'm not willing to do so but I won't interfere with these blocks made by other admins.  Open proxies are used extensively in countries like China and Vietnam and also in places like Italy where Internet access is closely monitored by the authorities.  Open proxies are also used by those who use very busy ISPs which are often blocked because of vandalism by a small number of users.  In addition, in countries like Singapore ALL Internet traffic is routed through a very small number of Government proxy servers (which censor any anti-government content).  Such pre-emptive action hasn't had any affect on vandalism on Wiki projects.

#{{oppose}} - per Herbythyme. The only thing blocking policies (or guidelines) do is create more opportunity for wikilawyering. Blocking is the last choice tool for preventing disruption, and if wikilawyering in encouraged, we only get more disruption. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:06, 14 October 2007 (UTC)
#{{oppose}} I realized that the current form of this guideline is limp, and there is already a section about blocking on the administrators policy that covers this material. The only things that this draft should have added were a restriction against being bold to prevent wheelwarring, and a set of guidelines for dealing with an unblock request. The current draft contains neither, and in my opinion is significantly worse then what we already have. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:41, 15 October 2007 (UTC)
#{{oppose}} At first I was trying to be proactive but after some thought I realize this guideline is pretty useless now. I prefer [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Blocking_guideline&amp;oldid=1002346 this version] and feel we should work from there, not stripping it entirely. Some editors here really freak out about a few simple things. The solution to someone trying to be a lawyer is pretty easy: don't listen or respond to it. Rejecting something because it can't predict the future is silly. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:39, 16 October 2007 (UTC)
#:I just want to reiterate this point: no policy can completely predict all future possibilities, and none of the policies that have been accepted here in the past do this. We can cover common cases and expect admins to be able to extrapolate from those to the uncommon cases. Considering that all actions are always open to discussion and review, I don't feel like that's a bad system. Also, fear of wikilawyering is virtually nil. We can simply ignore people who are abusing and twisting policy (especially personal misinterpretation of policy). We would be better served in this policy and in any policy to cover the important common cases, and provide enough clues to help guide admins when they venture into unfamiliar territory. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:33, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

== Discussion / Comments ==
:Panic was asking if I thought this would move forward given past objections. My refactored reply:
:::...I think all the concerns have already been addressed on the talk page, including those in the archive. The only outstanding issue I could envision being a sticking point is that of sock puppets. In that case, there seems to be a consensus that a)this is a guideline, so there's room for leeway and b)blocking would apply to bad faith sockpuppets of the type mentioned - those used for astroturfing, evading blocks, violating policies or guidelines in some other way. Other issues that seem to have been resolved:
:::#The wording on &quot;be bold&quot; seems reasonably clear - blocking is '''not''' a place to be bold. Admins should not change another admin's block (with the usual exceptions).
:::#A guideline on cross-wiki vandalism was added, which addresses the issue nicely, IMHO.
:::#Much of the opposition should be appeased simply by having this as a guideline instead of as a policy.
:As I said above, admins seem to be following everything in this guideline already. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:48, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

In regard to the two opposed votes: This is a proposed guideline not a proposed policy, and covers what we should do not what we must do. Also the open proxy thing is a Wikimedia wide policy, so even if it weren't included in this guideline, it would still apply to Wikibooks. If you have a problem with that policy, I suggest discussing it at [[Meta:Talk:No open proxies]] and try to get that policy changed or overturned. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:24, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with Darklama as far as NOP aspects are concerned and certainly Meta is the place to discuss it.  I can only conclude that Xania is not active enough to realise just how much vandalism has been changed here (and on other projects) by the blocking of open proxies.  I am sure some people will suffer but I was reverting more vandalism in a day last November than I am probably in a month now.  For myself I only block ones I find currently active and vandalising Foundation wikis.  Equally I will not currently block for longer than a year on any project.  Other than school IPs the vast majority of vandalism (&amp; vandal accounts) I encounter come from Open Proxies --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:53, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

I notice that several people have noted that having a guideline gives people a way to argue that some admin's block is wrong. I think that's a good thing, provided the guideline notes that excessive wikilawyering is itself disruptive, and action can be taken to stop it. That's half the reason we need a guideline on blocking. The other half being that it gives guidance to admins.

The reduced version by Darklama is fine except that it reverses the previous stance on being bold. The static version, and all the minor revisions made up that one insist that blocking is not a place for admins to be bold, and encourages us not to revert other admins' blocks (to prevent wheelwarring) except if there's some good reason (and such examples are given). The current version instead says that administrators may be bold except when they shouldn't. This is wishy-washy in the extreme. I like the previous version much much more, and I still think that it accurately describes how things happen on Wikibooks, and that it should be enforced. I still support this tiny version. I suppose it should alleviate a few concerns about wikilawyering, though it may leave too much up to an admin's good judgment (luckily our administrators have no shortage of good judgment the vast majority of the time). '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:49, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;Be bold&quot; removed now. I added a clause about seeking consultation of the blocking admin or other admins when there is disagreement (that's how it works on all of our sister projects, but it hasn't always worked that way here, unfortunately). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:52, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

:I was actually trying to go with &quot;except when being bold can itself be disruptive&quot;, as thats the way I had interpreted the larger version as saying. I was trying to leave out whether blocking and unblocking is an action to be bold with in general, and focus instead on it not being the case at the very least when it can be disruptive. I believe we need to explicitly say in some way that an action shouldn't be taken without prior discussion if it will be disruptive, due to past problems with this and to prevent wheel waring. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:09, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

:If all we are looking for is a way to guide admins, while still leaving the details up to personal judgement, maybe this material would all be better in [[Using Wikibooks]], or one of the help pages then as a guideline here. I like the material, but I agree that as soon as we codify things we raise the possibility for wikilawyering. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:28, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

::We can't have the cake and eat it to, we have to select what is best, to have policies and guidelines or just let things to personal judgments and interpretations. Blocking a proposal by claiming it will be used for wikilawyering is argumenting with an appeal to fear or a threat (argumentum ad baculum). We have to work inside the rules we selected that is hoping people are working in good faith, using arguments that violate that basic understanding should be avoided.
::We must opt if we are going to have the formalization of rules and practices or not once and for all, going around in circles is getting tiring, personally I don't trust personal judgments because I'm at the core a programmer and think I have a good understanding of history and human limitations and fragilities. The &quot;proven&quot; way is to set things in paper and agree upon it, this permits evolution and adaptation. The only way to avoid wikilawyering is to have it  written as good as we can, leaving nothing left to interpretation and no loop hole that can be abused.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 11:32, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:::People have a lingering fear of wikilawyering because you specifically have become so proficient at it, Panic. We most certainly can have certain guidelines and ask that people use their own judgment in following them. We are not robots to be programmed, and the more you say that people &quot;must&quot; do, the less people will be interested in doing anything at all. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:19, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

::::I don't agree that using the texts to support or disapprove an action/interpretation is Wikilawyaring, if the interpretation is valid and not an abuse of the text (one is as free to perform interpretations as any other), and agree that if a particular text is not mature enough it shouldn't be supported. On the other hand I see the laking of a written approved text as indication of existing disagreeing opinions, that in itself creates even more fragility on any decission reached without established consensus. Personally I've taken to change most the wording from must to should in guidelines, must is only proper in policies and used sparingly.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:32, 15 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

===Revelant discussion===

==== Algorithm question ====

First of all i think that instead of:
for (j = i - gap; j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; a[j] &gt; value; --j) 
there should be
for (j = i - gap; j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; a[j] &gt; value; j-=gap)


The code still yelds the correct result beacause in the final step gap=1 and the alg does an insert sort.... But in terms of complexity it won't act well


Secondly i think the algorithm should also be explained in words, most of the time this helps a lot... A similar explanation like the one in the first link of the external links section would be great. I will insert it if you guys don't mind.
:I agree with your second point. However, your first point is incorrect; if we were to move j by gap, we would only sort one column of the matrix containing the list rearranged into ''gap'' columns, so the sort would not be effective. This is crucial. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 00:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

Hi,

no big, just leave a link to the history page... preferably to the historical version you used. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:22, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Bg sg w1.png]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]].

      <comment>/* Shape moment of inertia for flat shapes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The moment of inertia can be defined as the second moment about an axis and is usually designated the symbol ''I''.  The moment of inertia is very useful in solving a number of problems in mechanics.  For example, the moment of inertia can be used to calculate angular momentum, and angular energy.  Moment of inertia is also important in beam design.

==Shape moment of inertia for flat shapes==

The area moment of inertia takes only shape into account, not mass.

:It can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of a flat shape about the x or y axis when ''I'' is only important at one cross-section.

&lt;math&gt; I_x=\int y^2\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; I_y=\int x^2\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; I_z =\int r^2\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

Because, for flat shapes, &lt;math&gt; r^2=x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; the following is true &lt;math&gt; I_z = I_x + I_y &lt;/math&gt;

The shape moment of inertia of the cross-section of a beam is used in [[Structural Engineering]] in order to find the stress and deflection of the beam.

==Shape moment of inertia for 3D shapes==


See [[Statics/Geometric Properties of Solids | Mass Moments Of Inertia Of Common Geometric Shapes]].

==Mass moment of inertia==

The mass moment of inertia takes mass into account.  The mass moment of inertia of a point mass about a reference axis is equal to mass multiplied by the square of the distance from that point mass to the reference axis:

&lt;math&gt; I_{point mass} = r^2 m \,&lt;/math&gt;

The metric units are kg*m^2.

The mass moment of inertia of any body of mass rotating around any axis is equal to the the sum of the mass moment of inertia of each of the particles of that body:

&lt;math&gt; I_m = \sum r_i^2 m_i&lt;/math&gt;

Rather than adding up each particle individually, sometimes we can take a mathematical shortcut by integrating over all the particles:

&lt;math&gt; I_m = \int r^2 \,dm&lt;/math&gt;

==Radius of gyration==

The radius of gyration is the radius at which you could concentrate the entire mass to make the moment of inertia equal to the actual moment of inertia.  If the mass of an object was 2kg, and the moment of inertia was &lt;math&gt;18kg*m^2&lt;/math&gt;, then the radius of gyration would be 3m.  In other words, if all of the mass was concentrated at a distance of 2m from the axis, then the moment of inertia would still be &lt;math&gt;18kg*m^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Radius of gyration is represented with a ''k''.

&lt;math&gt;k=\sqrt{I/m}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The formula for the area radius of gyration replaces the mass with area.

&lt;math&gt;k=\sqrt{I/A}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Parallel axis theorem==

If the moment of inertia is known about one axis, and the object will spin about a different axis a given distance away; then, the moment of inertia can be found by the following formula,

&lt;math&gt; I_{new axis} = I_{known axis} + (mass) d^2\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the distance between the two axis of rotation and the axis of known ''I''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Verbs ===

All Kinyarwanda verb infinitives begin with 'gu-' or 'ku-' (morphed into 'gw-' or 'kw-' before vowels).  To conjugate, the infinitive prefix is removed and a prefix agreeing with the subject takes its place.  Then a tense infix can be inserted.

Noun Prefix | Subject Prefix

Sing./Pl. | Sing./Pl.

u-mu-/a-ba- | a-/ba-

u-mu-/i-mi- | u-/i-

i-(ri)-/a-ma- | ri-/a-

i-ki- (i-gi-)/i-bi- | ki- (morphs to cy- before vowels)/bi-

i-n-/i-n- | i-/zi-

u-ru-/i-bi- | ru-/bi-

a-ka-/u-tu- | ka-/tu-

u-bu-/u-bu- | bu-/bu-

u-ku-/a-ma- | ku-/a-

a-ha-/a-ha- | ha-/ha-

The prefixes for pronouns are as follows.

I = n-

you (sing.) = mu-

he = y-/a-

she = y-/a-

we = tu-

you (pl.) = u-

they (human) = ba-

Tense markers include the following.

-Ø- | Present

-ra- (morphs to -da- when preceded by 'n' | Present Progressive - to be doing

-za- | Future - will do

-racya- | to still be doing

The past tense can be formed by using the present and present progressive infixes and modifying the apect marker suffix.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Unchecked, uncaught or runtime exceptions are exceptions that are not required to be caught or declared, even if it is allowed to do so. So a method can throw a runtime exception, even if this method is not supposed to throw exceptions. For example, &lt;code&gt;ConcurrentModificationException&lt;/code&gt; is an unchecked exception.

The unchecked exceptions can only be the &lt;code&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt; and its subclasses, and the class &lt;code&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt; and its subclasses. All other exception classes must be handled, otherwise the compiler gives an error.

Sometime it is desirable to catch all exception for logging purposes, then throw it back on. For example, in servlet programming when application server calls the server &lt;code&gt;doPost()&lt;/code&gt;, we want to monitor that no exception even runtime exception happened during serving the request. The application has its own logging separate from the server logging. The runtime exceptions would just go through without detecting it by the application. The following code would check all exceptions, log them, and throw it back again.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-12&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.12: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void doPost(HttpReguest request, HttpResponse response) {
  try {
    ...
    handleRequest();
    ...
  } catch(Exception e) {
    log.error(&quot;Error during handling post request&quot;, e);

    throw e;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the above code, all business logic exception are handled in the &lt;code&gt;handleRequest()&lt;/code&gt; method. Runtime exceptions are caught for logging purposes, and then throw back to the server to handle it.

Runtime exceptions are usually caused by data errors, like arithmetic overflow, divide by zero, ... . Runtime exceptions are not business related exceptions. In a well debugged code, runtime exceptions should not occur.  Runtime exceptions should only be used in the case that the exception could be thrown by and only by something hard-coded into the program. These should not be able to be triggered by the software's user(s).

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A checked exception is an exception that must be either caught or declared in a method where it can be thrown. For example, the &lt;code&gt;java.io.IOException&lt;/code&gt; is a checked exception. To understand what is a checked exception, consider the following code:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-9&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.9: Unhandled exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public void ioOperation(boolean isResourceAvailable) {
  if (!isResourceAvailable) {
    throw new IOException();
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This code won't compile as it throws or can throw a checked exception without catching it or declare it. Two different modifications can resolve the situation: to catching it or to declare it by the {{java:throws}} keyword.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-10&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.10: Catching an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2, 6-8&quot;&gt;
public void ioOperation(boolean isResourceAvailable) {
  try {
    if (!isResourceAvailable) {
      throw new IOException();
    }
  } catch(IOException e) {
    // Handle caught exceptions.
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-11&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.11: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void ioOperation(boolean isResourceAvailable) throws IOException {
  if (!isResourceAvailable) {
    throw new IOException();
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|}

In the Java class hierarchy, an exception is a checked exceptions if it inherits from &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt;, but not from &lt;code&gt;java.lang.RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt;. All the application or business logic exceptions should be checked exceptions.

It is possible that a method declares that it can throw an exception, but actually it does not. Still, the caller has to deal with it. The checked exception declaration has a domino effect. Any methods that will use the previous method will also have to handle the checked exception, and so on.

So the compiler for the Java programming language checks, at compile time, that a program contains handlers for all application exceptions, by analyzing each method body. If, by executing the method body, an exception can be thrown to the caller, that exception must be declared. How does the compiler know whether a method body can throw an exception? That is easy. Inside the method body, there are calls to other methods; the compiler looks at each of their method signature, what exceptions they declared to throw.

== Why force exception handling? ==
This may look boring to the developer but it enforces him to think about all the checked exceptions and increase the code quality. This compile-time checking for the presence of exception handlers is designed to make the application developer life easier. To debug whether a particular thrown exception has a matching catch would be a long process. In conventional languages like C, and C++, a separate error handling debugging were needed. In java we can be sure that when an application exception is thrown, that exception somewhere in the program is handled. In C, and C++, that has to be tested. In Java that does not need to be tested, so the freed up time can be used for more meaningful testing, testing the business features.

== What exceptions can be declared, when overriding a method ==

The checked exception classes specified after the {{java:throws}} keyword are part of the contract between the implementer and user. An overriding method can declare the same exceptions, subclasses or no exceptions.

== What exceptions can be declared, when implementing an Interface  ==

When interfaces are involved, the implementation declaration must have a throws-clause that is compatible with the interface declarations.

== Method overloading ==

In a class, there can be several methods with the same name. However they must have different ''signature''. The signature of a method is comprised of its name, its parameter types and the order of its parameter. The signature of a method is '''not''' comprised of its return type nor its visibility nor its thrown exceptions.

Methods with the same name in a class are called ''overloaded methods''. Overloading methods has no specific benefit but it is useful to mean that several methods do the same things but with different parameters. For example we may have the operation &lt;code&gt;runAroundThe&lt;/code&gt;. We can define two methods with the same name, but different input parameter types:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-22&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.22: Method overloading.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void runAroundThe(Building block) {
  ...
}

public void runAroundThe(Park park) {
  ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

One type can be the subclass of the other:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-10&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.11: ClassName.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;12-13, 15-16&quot;&gt;
public class ClassName {

  public static void sayClassName(Object aObject) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Object&quot;);
  }

  public static void sayClassName(String aString) {
    System.out.println(&quot;String&quot;);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String aString = new String();
    sayClassName(aString);

    Object aObject = new String();
    sayClassName(aObject);
  }
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Console for Code listing 4.11'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
String
Object
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Although the both methods would fit to a call with a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; parameter, it is the method with the nearer type that will be called. To be accurate, it will call the method whose parameter type is a subclass of the parameter type of the other method. Beware! The parameter type is defined by the ''declared'' type of an object, '''not''' its ''instantiated'' type!

The following two method definitions are valid too:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-23&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.23: Method overloading with the type order.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void logIt(String param, Error err) {
  ...
}

public void logIt(Error err, String param) {
  ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Because the type order is different. If both input parameters were type String, that would be a problem since the compiler would not be able to distinguish between the two:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-24&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.24: Bad method overloading.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void logIt(String param, String err) {
  ...
}

public void logIt(String err, String param) {
  ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The compiler would give an error for the following method definitions as well:

{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-25&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.25: Another bad method overloading.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void logIt(String param) {
  ...
}

public String logIt(String param) {
  String retValue;
  ...
  return retValue;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Note, the return type is not part of the unique signature.  Why not?  The reason is that a method can be called without assigning its return value to a variable.  This feature came from C and C++. So for the call:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-26&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.26: Ambiguous method call.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
logIt(msg);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

the compiler would not know which method to call. It is also the case for the thrown exceptions.

The &lt;code&gt;example2&lt;/code&gt; methods cannot co-exist because the names of the parameters are not part of the signature. The &lt;code&gt;example3&lt;/code&gt; methods cannot co-exist because the visibility of the methods are not part of the signature. The &lt;code&gt;example4&lt;/code&gt; methods can co-exist, because they have different method signatures.

== Variable Argument ==
Instead of overloading, you can use dynamic number of arguments. After the last parameter, you can pass optional unlimited parameters of the same type. These parameters are defined by adding a last parameter and adding &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; after its type. The dynamic arguments will be received as an array:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-27&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.27: Variable argument.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 6-15&quot;&gt;
  public void registrerPersonInAgenda(String firstName, String lastName, Date... meeting) {
    String[] person = {firstName, lastName};
    lastPosition = lastPosition + 1;
    contactArray[lastPosition] = person;

    if (meeting.length &gt; 0) {
      Date[] temporaryMeetings = registreredMeetings.length + meeting.length;
      for (i = 0; i &lt; registreredMeetings.length; i++) {
        temporaryMeetings[i] = registreredMeetings[i];
      }
      for (i = 0; i &lt; meeting.length; i++) {
        temporaryMeetings[registreredMeetings.length + i] = meeting[i];
      }
      registreredMeetings = temporaryMeetings;
    }
  }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The above method can be called with a dynamic number of arguments, for example:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-27&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.27: Constructor calls.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
registrerPersonInAgenda(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Doe&quot;);
registrerPersonInAgenda(&quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Lee&quot;, new Date(), new Date());
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This feature was not available before Java 1.5 .

== Constructor overloading ==

The constructor can be overloaded. You can define more than one constructor with different parameters. For example:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-12&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.12: Constructors.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8-10, 15-18&quot;&gt;
public class MyClass {

  private String memberField;
 
  /**
   * MyClass Constructor, there is no input parameter
   */
  public MyClass() {
     ...
  }
 
  /**
   * MyClass Constructor, there is one input parameter
   */
   public MyClass(String param1) {
     memberField = param1;
     ...
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-listing-12|code listing 4.12]], we defined two constructors, one with no input parameter, and one with one input parameter. You may ask which constructor will be called.  Its depends how the object is created with the {{java:new}} keyword. See below:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-29&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.29: Constructor calls.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// The constructor with no input parameter will be called
MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();

// The constructor with one input param. will be called
MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(&quot;Init Value&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-section-29|code section 4.29]], we created two objects from the same class, or we can also say that &lt;code&gt;obj1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;obj2&lt;/code&gt; both have the same type. The difference between the two is that in the first one the &lt;code&gt;memberField&lt;/code&gt; field is not initialized, in the second one that is initialized to &lt;code&gt;&quot;Init Value&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. A constructor may also be called from another constructor, see below:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-13&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.13: Constructor pooling.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
public class MyClass {

  private String memberField;
 
  /**
   * MyClass Constructor, there is no input parameter
   */
  public MyClass() {
    MyClass(&quot;Default Value&quot;);
  }
 
  /**
   * MyClass Constructor, there is one input parameter
   */
  public MyClass(String param1) {
    memberField = param1;
    ...
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-listing-13|code listing 4.13]], the constructor with no input parameter calls the other constructor with the default initial value. This call must be the first instruction of a constructor or else a compiler error will occur. The code gives an option to the user, to create the object with the default value or create the object with a specified value. The first constructor could have been written using the {{java:this}} keyword as well:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-30&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.30: Another constructor pooling.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  public MyClass() {
    this(&quot;Default Value&quot;);
  }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Such a call reduces the code repetition.

== Method overriding ==

To easily remember what can be done in method overriding, keep in mind that all you can do on an object of a class outside this class, you can do it also on an object of a subclass, only the behavior can change. A subclass should be ''covariant''.

Although a method signature has to be unique inside a class, the same method signature can be defined in different classes.  If we define a method that exists in the super class then we override the super class method.  It is called ''method overriding''.  This is different from method overloading. Method overloading happens with methods with the same name different signature.  Method overriding happens with same name, same signature between inherited classes.

The return type can cause the same problem we saw above.  When we override a super class method the return type also must be the same.  If that is not the same, the compiler will give you an error.

Beware! If a class declares two public methods with the same name, and a subclass overrides one of them, the subclass still inherits the other method. In this respect, the Java programming language differs from C++.

Method overriding is ''related dynamic linking'', or ''runtime binding''. In order for the Method Overriding to work, the method call that is going to be called can not be determined at compilation time. It will be decided at runtime, and will be looked up in a table.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-31&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.31: Runtime binding.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
MyClass obj;

if (new java.util.Calendar().get(java.util.Calendar.AM_PM) == java.util.Calendar.AM) {
  // Executed a morning
  obj = new SubOfMyClass();
} else {
  // Executed an afternoon
  obj = new MyClass();
}
 
obj.myMethod();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-section-31|code section 4.31]], the expression at line 3 is true if it is executed a morning and false if it is executed an afternoon. Thus, the instance of &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; will be a &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;SubOfMyClass&lt;/code&gt; depending on the execution time. So it is impossible to determine the method address at compile time. Because the &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; reference can point to object and all its sub object, and that will be known only at runtime, a table is kept with all the possible method addresses to be called. Do not confuse:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-32&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.32: Declared type and instantiated type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
obj.myMethod(myParameter);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The implementation of this method is searched using the &lt;u&gt;instantiated&lt;/u&gt; type of the called object (&lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;u&gt;declared&lt;/u&gt; type of the parameter object (&lt;code&gt;myParameter&lt;/code&gt;).

Also another rule is that when you do an override, the visibility of the new method that overrides the super class method can not be reduced.  The visibility can be increased, however.  So if the super class method visibility is {{java:public}}, the override method can not be {{java:package}}, or {{java:private}}. An override method must throw the same exceptions as the super class, or their subexceptions.

&lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; references to the parent class (i.e. &lt;code&gt;super.someMethod()&lt;/code&gt;). It can be used in a subclass to access inherited methods that the subclass has overridden or inherited fields that the subclass has hidden.

{{XNote|A common mistake to think that if we can override methods, we could also override member variables. This is not the case, as it is useless. You can redefine a variable that is private in the super class as such a variable is not visible.}}

      <comment>ó instead of ó for high tone</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Normally, the official [[orthography]] of [[Kinyarwanda]] has 5 vowels with both long vowels and short vowels as well as high tones or no tones on syllables in [[pronunciation]], but the official orthography does not mark vowel length and [[melody]]. Only the context can tell the reader which word was meant. 

Most of the time written texts are thus ambiguous even to native speakers. Thus the written words ''umusambi'' can stand either for ''[umusaambi]'' 'mat' or ''[umusaámbi]'' 'crane', ''gutaka'' for either [''gutaka''] 'to scream' or [''gutaaka''] 'to decorate'. ''ino'' can stand for either ''[ino]'' 'toe' or ''[inó]'' 'here' etc. 

Eventhough the sound '''p''' has been lost and is found only in [[onomatopeic]] words and [[loan-words]], the aspirated voiceless velar fricative ''h'' is spelled as '''p''' after the bilabial nasal '''m''' as shown in the examples '''impuha''' [''imhuuha''] 'rumors', impamvu [''imhaâmvu''] 'cause/reason'. The [[allophones]], the [[voiced bilabial stop]] '''b''' which appears only after the [[homorganic nasal]] '''m''' and the [[voiced bilabial fricative]] '''ß''' realized intervocalically are also written the same way, using the [[voiced bilabial stop]] symbol '''b'''. Although, the language has only one [[liquid]], both '''r''' and '''l''' are used in the orthography. The liquid '''r''' is used in all texts and '''l''' is used only in loan-words which have '''l''' in their spelling such as ''Libiya'' 'Libya', ''Alijeriya'' 'Algeria', ''idolari'' 'dollar'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kinyarwanda has five vowels which are either long or short, high-toned and no tones. The high tone can appear either on first mora or the second mora. These vowels are the two high vowels i and u, the midvowels e and o and the center low vowel a. The midvowels e and o are not allowed in both the (pre)prefix and suffix positions. In verbs, however, these midvowels can appear in the suffix position as a result of vowel harmony if the vowel of the verb stem is a midvowel. ex. gukosa 'to make mistakes' gukosoora 'to correct' /ku-kos-uur-a/; kumenya 'to know' kumenyeesha /ku-meny-iish-a/.
The majority of word stems have the same identical vowel in all syllables: u-mu-biri 'body', u-bu-riri 'bed, i-ki-reenge 'leg', i-béere 'breast', u-mu-góongo 'back', u-mu-hoondo 'yellow', u-ku-guru 'leg', u-ru-túgu 'shoulder', igihaánga 'skull', i-ki-gaanza 'hand palm'. This observation raises the question as to whether the stem is assigned only one vowel which is copied or spreads to other syllables.
Since kinyarwanda has open syllables only, loan-words with cluster consonants copy the vowel of the syllable on the right or a default vowel u with bilabial consonants and i with others. As the following work loan-word porogaramu 'program' shows, both vowels o and a are copied on the preceding vowelless consonants and the vowel u is inserted after the final consonant m.

It would be a good idea to remove the word &quot;shit,&quot; as it is considered a somewhat strong vulgarity in English, especially for the target audience.
:[[w:El Caganer|El Caganer]] is very popular in Catalan speaking areas, but I don't think non Catalan-speaking kids will really like the 'shit' translation (or anything about feces).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kinyarwanda language has less than twenty [[adjectives]]. This means that in some cases, Kinyarwanda lacks adjectives to qualify nouns. At this time, it makes them from other nouns. In translating a text expreesed by adjectives in other languages is rendered, for example, by either the possessive construction (X of Y) or by the relative clause construction.

e.g. 'a stupid boy' : umuhungu w'igicucu

And most important thing is your project file.
It make you more easy.

 project Testdll is
    for Library_Name use &quot;Te&quot;;
    for Library_Dir use &quot;dll&quot;;
    for Library_Ali_Dir use &quot;ali&quot;;
    for Library_Kind use &quot;dynamic&quot;;
    for Languages use (&quot;Ada&quot;);
    for Object_Dir use &quot;obj&quot;;
    for Library_Interface use (&quot;t&quot;);
 
    for Library_Auto_Init use &quot;False&quot;;
    for Library_Src_Dir use &quot;dll&quot;;
 end Testdll;

You can configure almost all settings in your GPS IDE. But note that GPS cannot do Library_Interface setting correctly.
After configuring it, you should check the project file and modify it accordingly.
Library_Interface means which package contains export functions in DLL.

Library_Auto_Init is interesting and you must choose a correct setting in
your project.

If you choose True, it will call adaInit when library load (which means
elaboration appears in loading time automatically)
if choose False, it will export init and finalize functions in DLL and you
must call them by yourself.

If you export functions like C/C++ &quot;normal&quot; functions without any elaboration
parts, you may set library_auto_init to True.

If your Ada code does not only work like C/C++ but also needs Ada elaboration
function,
you should initialize/finalize by yourself.

&quot;DANGEROUS&quot; DANGEROUS&quot; DANGEROUS&quot;DANGEROUS&quot;DANGEROUS&quot;

For example,
if you have a library level task needing elaboration in load time and use
implied linking and loading
it will &quot;deadlock WAITING&quot;  when DllMain calls init code.
It's unexpected behaviour that you don't want to.

DANGEROUS&quot;DANGEROUS&quot;DANGEROUS&quot;DANGEROUS&quot;DANGEROUS&quot;

In some case, you may use LoadLibrary / GetProcAddress to work (Explicit
loading). But it is not easy to manage your code, especially if you export many functions.

== Step 2. Make a .lib file (for static linking) ==
You can use utilities dumpbin and lib to generate .lib file
(2.A)

     dumpbin/exports Te.dll &gt; te.def,

the file content is

The Teinit and Tefinal is used to elaborate and terminate the Ada
elaboration part after Te.dll loaded.
(the name does not call adainit/adafinalize but still the same function as
adainit/adafinalize)

== Step 3. Work together in MS VC++ ==

Start Visual Studio C++ project and add Te.lib to your linker setting.

Writing a Te.h header for Ada DLL
(GPS should generate .lib and .h for you).

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
extern &quot;C&quot; extern void _stdcall test(int a,int b,int c,int d,int e);
extern &quot;C&quot; extern void  Teinit();
extern &quot;C&quot; extern void  Tefinal();
&lt;/source&gt;

And write a C/C++ test code to generate a .exe file
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &quot;stdafx.h&quot; //visual c++ default header
#include &quot;Te.h&quot; //your ada library header
 
int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
 
  Teinit();  //start init
  for (int i = 0 ; i&lt; 300 ;i++)
     test(0,0,0,0,i);
 
  Tefinal(); //end  init
  return 0;
 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Step 4. Run your code ==

Put .exe and .dll in the same directory and run the test

The loader will find dll following in this order:
# current directory
# path variable
# Windows directory

Put the dll and exe in the same directory, it is the best option.

==TraNSLATING Hiranga into romaji==
Example:  Discourse topic marker は '''(romaji - wa, literally ha)'''
(The bold is the add-on)
[[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 13:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

:This may seem unimportant, but many native speakers when writing in romagi, will write は as ha for the topic marker.  They still pronounce it wa however. [[User:Emry|Ken]] 13:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)


==Is this page to advanced??==

At a basic stage, wouldn't it be nice to just introduce greetings, and the main part of basic learning, the Hiragana, Katakana and some (very) basic Kanji. 

I think this would be more important at this stage than imperative verbs etc... 

Ed -- 04:49, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

:That stuff is included in the introduction section, but I think the introduction section should just include kana lessons and really basic stuff, while greetings etc. should go here. I think the way the kana is supposed to be taught now is ok. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 00:43, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:There's only so much that can be learned from hiragana, katakana and basic kanji.  I think the 'Starter Less' should be good for people who are just curious.  I've already started a Lesson that needs at least hiragana.  I didn't see this page until I made the lesson, but it can be easily revised with things added to it. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 22:27, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

==content==

I think that the basic section of the book should be able to be used as a learning resource for the [[w:Japanese_Language_Proficiency_Test|Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] level 4. This way we can use a set list of vocabulary, kanji and grammar. The suggested structure of the section now is good in that the kanji and vocabulary can be introduced in each section, and there are already grammar parts listed under the headings.

A good resource for JLPT : http://www.jlptstudy.com/

also if we structure the book on the JLPT then the other sections, intermediate, advanced, and expert, can be used for JLPT levels 3, 2, 1 respectively. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 00:52, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

I also agree with this. I think that we should however include auxiliary vocabulary and other knowledge freely while emphasizing the information necessary for the Japanese proficiency test. This would accomplish the two goals of providing the knowledge needed to pass the exam while including enough information to keep the studious user interested. [[User:WongFei|WongFei]] ([[User talk:WongFei|talk]]) 2:26AM, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

==練習==

I think every lesson should include relevent drills at the end to get people thinking and speaking in Japanese and practicing the new techniques. [[User:WongFei|WongFei]] ([[User talk:WongFei|talk]]) 10:39, 5 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Food Service Operations Manual ==

Writing an operations manual is an ambitious undertaking - one that will benefit all members of your restaurant's team. An operations manual outlines a consistent model that can be used in a single restaurant, provides management with a useful reference tool, and is an effective way to inform staff about the standards and expectations you hold for your restaurant. 

The manual will draw your attention to: 
* Areas of your restaurant that are working well 
* Problems that need improvement 
* Crisis elements that need immediate attention 

While it's not the most romantic work, organizing your restaurant through an operations manual will enable you to run your operation more efficiently, with less work and with greater profits. Here are a few key points to keep in mind when planning and writing your manual: 

'''Keep it simple''' 

One of the purposes of an operations manual is to explain complex activities in simple terms. You want to describe what needs to be done, how to do it and the final result you would like to achieve. Pictures are an easy and simple way to communicate these goals. '''Also it is wise to create a simple portfolio for your recipes and pictures.'''

'''Assign responsibilities to specific job roles'''

Make sure that all tasks, duties and responsibilities are clearly outlined under specific job positions. This will help to avoid misunderstandings, redundancies and inconsistency both in the manual and in your operation. 

'''Start at the bottom and work your way up''' 

Chart each job position that needs to be documented in the manual. Each position should have a thorough job description and a list of tasks, divided up into service, opening and closing lists. Any specialized functions or responsibilities of a position that fall outside of the service, opening and closing format can be documented in a section titled general duties. Be sure to include recipes, inventory sheets and mapping where necessary. 

'''Clarity, Consistency and Spirit are your objectives''' 

* Consistency - the key to building any business is the ability to deliver the same product or result over and over again. 
* Clarity - through careful documentation, your operation's structure can be distilled to specific tasks that will be meaningful to staff, rather than general ideas than can be subject to misinterpretation. 
* Spirit - the details that breathe life into your restaurant and make it unique need to be included in any description of your operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Three out of four American households own a grill, also known as a barbecue. Many grill 
components can be replaced with new parts, adding to the useful life of the grill. Though 
charcoal grills can sometimes require new cooking grids and charcoal grates, gas grills are 
much more complex, and require additional components such as burners, valves, and heat 
shields.

== Burners ==

[[Image:H_burner.gif|frame|Drawing of an 'H' Style Dual Burner]]

A gas grill's burner is the central source of heat for cooking food. Gas grill burners are 
typically constructed of 

*stainless steel
*aluminized steel
*cast iron (occasionally porcelain-coated)

Burners are hollow with gas inlet holes and outlet 'ports'. For each inlet is a separate 
control on the control panel of the grill. Many grills have just one burner. Common configurations are referred to as dual burners, with two gas inlets and two corresponding control knobs - right and left, and single burners, having only one inlet and control. The most common type of gas grill burners are called 'H' burners and resemble the capital letter 'H' turned on its side. Another popular shape is Oval. There are also 'Figure 8', 'Bowtie' and 'Bar' burners.

Other grills (typically more expensive models) have a separate burner for each control, 
usually featuring three or four individual burners. These burners can be referred to as 
'Pipe', 'Tube', or 'Rail' burners. They are mostly straight since they are only required to 
heat one portion of the grill. For example a gas grill may have 3 pipe burners which run 
from the front to the back of the grill - a left burner, center burner, and right burner. 
This allows the user the flexibility to use any combination of the three depending on the 
amount of food being cooked and the desired temperature.

Burners are situated at the bottom of the grill. They can have 'legs' or rest directly on 
the grill casting. Gas is supplied through venturi tubes or simply 'venturis'. Venturis can 
be permanently attached to the burner or removable. At the other end of the venturi is the 
gas valve, which is connected to the control knob on the front of the grill. When the user 
turns the knob, the valve opens, allowing gas to flow through the venturi tube and into the 
burner. Some burners (usually pipe style) do not require venturis and connect directly to 
the valve.

Because burners operate at such high temperatures (typically 300 to 650 degrees fahrenheit) 
and are subject to drippings from cooking meat (corrosive due to their moisture content and 
acidity), these crucial components are usually the first to wear out. A gas grill burner can 
typically operate effectively for 1 to 5 years with average usage. When the burner becomes 
significantly corroded, or 'rusted out', gas escapes through the corroded areas, creating 
'hot spots' and making it difficult or impossible to properly cook food.

When a new burner is required, there are several possible sources. Usually the original 
manufacturer of the grill offers a replacement which is identical or nearly identical to the 
original part. This is known as an OEM part. This is a desirable option for many because the 
burner is known to work with their grill. However, sometimes grill manufacturers may go out 
of business, may not have the original replacement available (especially for older grills), 
or may charge a price which is deemed too high by the consumer.

Several companies manufacture 'after-market' burners which can be a suitable replacement. 
Though they may not be exactly like the original, they have been tested and shown to work 
with the grill models for which they are sold. When choosing an after-market replacement 
burner, there are 3 main criteria which must be met for optimal operation:

#The burner physically fits in the grill and rests evenly at the bottom of the grill
#The burner is relatively close in size to the original
#Gas can be supplied to the burner

Because of the wide variety of burner/venturi configurations, after-market parts 
manufacturers typically offer 'universal' venturis, which can be bent and extended to reach 
from the burner to the valve in order to meet the 3rd requirement above.

== Cooking Grids ==

Cooking grids, also known as cooking grates, are the surface on which the food is cooked in  
a grill. They are typically made of:

*Stainless steel (Usually the most expensive and durable, may also carry a lifetime warranty)
*Porcelain-coated cast iron (The next most durable after stainless, usually thick and good for searing meat)
*Porcelain-coated steel (Will typically last as long as porcelain-coated cast iron, but not as good for searing)
*Cast Iron (More commonly used for charcoal grills, cast iron must be constantly covered with oil to protect it from rusting)
*Chrome-plated steel (Usually the least expensive and shortest-lasting material)

Unless the grid is stainless steel, the protective coating will eventually wear off and the underlying metal will begin to rust. At this time it is time for a new grid. As with burners, replacement cooking grids can be obtained from the original grill manufacturer or an after-market parts dealer.

Though some refer to a cooking grid's front to back dimension as 'width' and the side to 
side dimension as 'length', proper terminology defines the 'depth' of a cooking grid as 
measured from to front back and the 'width' as measured from side to side. When looking for 
a replacement cooking grid, the grid's depth is the most crucial dimension. A typical rule 
of thumb is that the depth must be within 3/8&quot; of the depth of the original grid to fit 
properly. The width is less critical, and can be shorter that the original, simply reducing 
the amount of cooking area.

== Rock Grates ==

Rock grates are placed directly above the burner and are designed to hold lava rock or 
ceramic briquettes. These materials serve a dual purpose - they protect the burner from 
drippings which can accelerate the deterioration of the burner, and they disperse the heat 
from the burner more evenly throughout the grill.

Rock grates are one of the least expensive replacement parts for a grill. Because they do 
not hold food, they do not need to be protected from rust like cooking grids. Therefore, 
they are typically constructed of carbon steel which will start to rust almost immediately. 
A rock grate is useful until it rusts completely through and no longer holds rock.

== Heat Shields ==

Heat shields are also known as burner shields, heat plates, heat tents, radiation shields, 
or heat angles. They serve the same purpose as a rock grate + rock, protecting the burner 
from corrosive meat drippings and dispersing heat. They are more common in newer grills. 

Some advantages of heat shields over rock:

*They do not harbor bacteria
*They are not as heavy
*They are easier to replace

It is also claimed by some that they vaporize the drippings and 'infuse' the meat with more 
flavor, though it is debatable if there is any difference in this regard to rock. Many users 
still prefer rock over heat shields.

== Valves ==

Valves can wear out or become rusted and too difficult to operate, thus requiring 
replacement. A valve is unlike a burner in that a replacement usually must match exactly to 
the original in order to fit properly. Therefore, many grills are disposed of when 
valves fail, due to a lack of available replacements.

If a valve seems to be moving properly, but no gas is getting to the burner, the most common 
cause for this is spider webs or other debris in the venturi. This impediment can be cleared 
by using a long flexible object.

== Posts ==

With the exception of cast aluminum, all grill posts will eventually rust through and need 
to be replaced. If an exact replacement cannot be obtained, holes can sometimes be drilled 
in a post with the same diameter as the original where required to mount the grill head.

== Other Parts ==

Grills contain many other less essential parts, such as handles, heat gauges, warming racks, 
condiment trays, and more. As a general rule, the less critical the part, the more likely 
that it will only be available from the original grill manufacturer.

== How to Decide When to Replace a Grill ==

Each user will need to determine the most cost effective option for his or her situation. If the total of the replacement parts required is more than a new grill, by all means buying a new grill is the best option. If the casting (the actual body of the grill) is corroded or significantly warped, buy a new grill. Almost all other parts can be replaced on most grills.

== Grill Manufacturers ==

There are dozens of grill manufacturers. Some build grills designed to be kept for many years, and as such provide replacement parts and make the grills compatible with industry standards. Usually manufacturing their grills in the United States, some examples of these manufacturers are [http://www.modernhomeproducts.com Modern Home Products] and [http://www.broilmaster.com Broilmaster]. These grills are typically more expensive and not available at large home improvement warehouse stores or discount chains. However, they tend to last a very long time, sometimes as much as 30 years or more.

Other grill companies sell models which may have many of the parts manufactured at low costs in Asia. This allows the grills to be sold for less, but can also mean that original replacement parts will be hard to find or not available at all. Examples of these manufacturers are [http://www.charbroil.com Char-Broil] and [http://www.myownbbq.com Vermont Castings].

== After-Market Parts ==

There are currently two U.S. companies manufacturing after-market grill parts for a wide variety of grill models:

*[http://www.musiccitymetals.net Music City Metals]
*[http://www.modernhomeproducts.com Modern Home Products]

These manufacturers do not sell directly to the public, and customers must go through a dealer in order to obtain parts. Local retail shops can sometimes provide these products. There are also many websites selling gas grill parts. A few examples are:

*[http://grillpartssearch.com/mm/merchant.mvc GrillPartsSearch.com]
*[http://www.clagrills.com CLA Grills]
*[http://www.appliancefactoryparts.com Appliance Factory Parts]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most important thing about the symbolic math toolbox is that (as far as I can tell), unlike MATLAB, Maple is a symbolic kernel, not a numeric one. So, for example, you can manipulate fractions exactly by storing them as symbolic variables, rather than dealing with roundoff errors... I also use it to determine expressions for functions that would be a pain in the butt to find by hand, and then just copy them and paste into the program I want to use them in. Maple also lets you use variable-precision arithmetic, not sure how accurate or useful that is but it is there.

The downside is that it often will give you really complicated stuff that you can't really do much with. I haven't figured out how to make it output indecies, which means I manually have to go in and put them in after the toolbox is done running. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 15:26, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

: I have added prettymuch everything I know about the toolbox, I'm not sure how to use the linear algebra or VPA stuff so if someone knows better than me please add it! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 23:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)


What is intended by the &quot;syms a(1)&quot; command at the end of the Symbolic Variables? I don't think that should be there since it doesn't make sense (or at least I can't figure out what you mean). Are the parens for indexing or function evaluation? (edit: aha from later examples I think you mean for parens to be indexing). Also the example that results in &quot;a=[a a2]&quot; looks confusing since I can't imagine why people would want to have the MATLAB variable &quot;a&quot; represent &quot;[a a2]&quot; - it's too confusing.

Also later on in the Symbolic Function section you can see how sym('a(1)') and sym('a(2)') is not useful. Just stick with &quot;syms a&quot; or perhaps if you really want to say that a is a 2 element symbolic variable then &quot;syms a1 a2&quot; and &quot;a = [a1 a2];&quot;.

Also for the section about solving and symbolic functions the example confuses assignment = with equality ==. I recommend adding a discussion about what = means.

: Thank you for your comments. I agree, it is kind of unnecessary to use that kind of syntax, I removed it in favor of just the array. The second point, yeah that was weird, I don't know why I did that.. the third, equality is addressed in the &quot;logic&quot; section but don't think assignment is addressed anywhere, so that's something to do later, any suggestions where to put it? And where did I mistake assignment with equality, or did you fix that already? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 05:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)


''&quot;There is no function to directly change a symbolic variable into a function handle, unfortunately.&quot;'' - I they have added one recently: [http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/symbolic/matlabfunction.html matlabFunction].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the fifth lesson and second-to-last lesson teaching you how to read, write and pronounce Greek. 

The first new letter you'll learn is Phi:


&lt;font size=4&gt;Φ φ&lt;/font&gt;

Neither of the letters has any resemblance to English letters. The pronunciation is familiar though: it's just like an English F (IPA [f]). If English derived a word containing Phi from Greek, it is typically spelled with ''ph'' instead of simply ''f'' - just like in the letter name &quot;Phi&quot; itself. Practise using the following Greek words: 

φιλοσοφία &lt;br&gt;
φιλμ &lt;br&gt;
φεμινισμός &lt;br&gt;
φαρμακείο &lt;br&gt;
ελέφαντας &lt;br&gt;
Φίλιπ &lt;br&gt;
Αφρική &lt;br&gt;
Σαν Φρανσίσκο &lt;br&gt;

The next letter is easier again. This is Zeta:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Ζ ζ&lt;/font&gt;

The capital Zeta looks like a Z and the small Zeta looks like a more curvy version of it. It's pronounced as an English Z (IPA [z]), too. Easy, isn't it? Example words:

ντίζελ &lt;br&gt;
Βραζιλία &lt;br&gt;
Τερέζα &lt;br&gt;
Βενεζουέλα &lt;br&gt;
Ζάμπια &lt;br&gt;
Ζιμπάμπουε &lt;br&gt;
Καζακστάν &lt;br&gt;
Νέα Ζηλανδία &lt;br&gt;

An interesting combination in Greek is Tau-Zeta:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Τζ τζ&lt;/font&gt;

This is pronounced as a combination of the sounds of Tau and Zeta (IPA [dz]). Although &quot;j&quot; is a letter in the English alphabet, there is no such letter in Greek.  Instead, we use τζ, whose combined sounds make the &quot;j&quot; sound.  τζ is not a letter in the Greek alphabet.  It is what the previous statement says, just a sound coming from a combination of letters. In words derived from English, this combination is sometimes used to replace the ''j'' sound as in &quot;'''j'''ournalist&quot; or the ''g'' sound as in &quot;'''g'''eneral&quot;, because there is no sound [dʒ] in Greek. Practise reading the following words:

ατζέντα &lt;br&gt;
έιτζ &lt;br&gt;
Φίτζι &lt;br&gt;
Τζορτζ Μπους &lt;br&gt;
Αζερμπαϊτζάν &lt;br&gt;
Ρίο ντε Τζανέιρο &lt;br&gt;
Τζακάρτα &lt;br&gt;
Καμπότζη &lt;br&gt;

Now you're going to learn another very important Greek letter: Gamma.

&lt;font size=4&gt;Γ γ&lt;/font&gt;

This is equivalent of ''G'' in Greek, except that it isn't pronounced as a regular English G. When Gamma is followed by a 'light' vowel sound such as E or I, it is pronounced like the English Y in &quot;year&quot; (IPA [ʝ]). When it is followed by a 'dark' vowel sound such as A, O or U, it is pronounced in a way that doesn't exist in English, kind of like the ''ch'' in &quot;Bach&quot; or the lake &quot;Loch Ness&quot; in Scotland, with the difference that vocal chords should be vibrated when pronouncing it (IPA {{IPA|[ɣ]}}). (Listen to a [[media:voiced velar fricative.ogg|sound sample]].)
This letter comes up very often in Greek, so you'll have lots of opportunities to practise.

Πορτογαλία &lt;br&gt;
φιγούρα &lt;br&gt;
Γερμανία &lt;br&gt;
Βουλγαρία &lt;br&gt;
βιολογία &lt;br&gt;
Βέλγιο &lt;br&gt;
γεωλογία &lt;br&gt;
πρόγραμμα &lt;br&gt;
γραφικά &lt;br&gt;
Αργεντινή &lt;br&gt;
Πράγα &lt;br&gt;
Νορβηγία &lt;br&gt;
Αλγερία &lt;br&gt;
Αφγανιστάν &lt;br&gt;
Γεωργία &lt;br&gt;
Γουατεμάλα &lt;br&gt;
Γουινέα &lt;br&gt;
Γρενάδα &lt;br&gt;
Μαδαγασκάρη &lt;br&gt;

A variation occurs when there are two Gammas in a row:

&lt;font size=4&gt;γγ&lt;/font&gt;

This combination is pronounced like the ''ng'' in the English word &quot;ri'''ng'''&quot; (IPA: [ŋg]). Examples:

Ουγγαρία &lt;br&gt;
Αγγλία &lt;br&gt;
Μογγολία &lt;br&gt;
άγγελος &lt;br&gt;

Finally, how to spell the actual [g] sound as in &quot;garden&quot;? For that, you need two letters again: Gamma and Kappa.

&lt;font size=4&gt;Γκ γκ&lt;/font&gt;

Sometimes when this combination is at the middle of words then it represents the sound ''ng'' in the English word &quot;ri'''ng'''&quot; (like γγ), but when the word is a foreign loanword and the intention is to have a [g] sound, then it is pronounced as [g]. Though, this detail is not very significant for the pronunciation and it is not wrong to always pronounce γκ as a [g] sound.
Greek words you already know that include this combination are:

γκαράζ &lt;br&gt;
γκέτο &lt;br&gt;
Γκάνα &lt;br&gt;
Αγκόλα &lt;br&gt;
γκάλοπ &lt;br&gt;
γκαλερί &lt;br&gt;
Σανγκάη &lt;br&gt;
Κογκό &lt;br&gt;
Μπανγκλαντές &lt;br&gt;

That's it for this lesson! If you didn't have trouble reading the example words, you're ready to continue with [[Modern Greek/Lesson 6x|lesson 6]]!

== DECISION THEORY ==

Decision theory studies rational choices. It is used both to predict and explain actual choices and to improve actual decision making. The first purpose is called positive theory and the second is called normative theory. While our primary aim is to predict and explain actual choices (positive theory), understanding how to improve actual decision making (normative theory) helps us to better understand decision theory for our applications, as well. 

Decision theory may also be used to predict equilibria achieved by some evolutionary process. In particular, this evolutionary process may be the biological evolutionary process or a cultural evolutionary process. We consider applications to each.

=== [[/Smart Choices and Models Based Upon Them/]] ===

We first start with a review of material in _Smart Choices_, a book written by John Hammond, Ralph Keeney, and Howard Raiffa, experts from the Harvard Business School in the field of decision theory and its application in business. (An MBA program is largely the study of how to improve decisions important to business, and decision theory is a key component of this study.) These chapters introduce you to the basics of decision theory and how it can be applied to improve your decisions. The chapter continues with a discussion of our goals for models intended to help us predict and explain social behavior. We see that our modeling focuses only upon the most important factors necessary to predict and explain, even if we must sacrifice a complete or accurate description of the individual’s actual decision making process.

=== [[/Optimization in Markets/]] ===

We then introduce the basics of microeconomic theory, since economists were the first to use models based upon self-interested individuals and these models are now the foundation for the discipline. We introduce these models based upon decision theory because they have been so successful in economics. As the political scientists Shepsle and Bonchek explain, considering these models are important for our general goals of predicting and explaining all types of social behavior: 

_The modern theory of economics is a grand intellectual edifice precisely because it has succeeded, as no other social science has, in constructing explanations logically, rigorously, and in empirically meaningful ways. At the foundation of this edifice is a scientific commitment to explanation, not description._ (Shepsle-Bonchek, 21)

The models developed here introduce the reader to most of the basic tools and concepts of decision theory, at least in a world without uncertainty. We first consider profit-maximizing decisions that firms make in perfectly competitive markets, show how the model describes supply and demand choices, and how it describes the “market” determining price to reach a competitive equilibrium. We then extend this model to consumers, whose preferences can take a more general structure, which leads us to develop “utility” functions, an important tool throughout decision theory and game theory. We also introduce the concept of efficiency, which can be used to evaluate the outcomes that our models predict. We find, in particular, that competitive markets, driven by self-interested individuals, are efficient, and compare that conclusion to monopoly markets that are not.

=== [[/Sincere Voters/]] ===

We then apply decision theory models to political science with the intent of creating a positive theory of politics. We use of models of self-interested individuals to consider various voting mechanisms used to generate group decisions. We start with rational individuals, just as in the economics models, and analyze decisions they would make with these voting mechanisms. We show that some voting mechanisms, and majority voting in particular, can lead to irrational group decision making, even if all individuals are rational. For another application, we also consider the incentives for lobbying for rules, regulations, or laws that would benefit everyone within a group and find an explanation for special interests.

=== [[/Natural Selection/]] ===

We not use models based upon the mathematics of decision theory, not to predict and explain rational decisions, but in evolutionary biology. Here, “decisions” are not made consciously by any individual, but an evolutionary mechanism rewards the most fit individuals that pass along more of their genes to the next generation. The population of individuals then tends to eventually evolve to one with individuals who virtually all have characteristics that maximize fitness. After examining the process of natural selection, we consider its application in choices involving food and shelter, and the determination of sex ratios. 

=== [[/Cooperation with Kin Selection/]] ===

This materials continues the study of evolutionary biology, but it considers decision theory models from a different perspective. We consider the perspective of the gene rather than the individual with that gene. This offers a theory of kin selection, which may lead to behavior towards family members that appears altruistic from the viewpoint of an individual in the population, but not from the viewpoint of an individual gene. We consider some applications of kin selection in amoebae, social insects, ground squirrels, and humans. Finally, after we have considered evolutionary arguments that predict and explain tendencies in animal behavior, we apply the same evolutionary arguments to determine behavioral tendencies in people, an approach that has formed the field of evolutionary psychology.

=== [[/Cultural Evolution and Social Norms/]] ===

Here we apply decision theory in models of evolution outside of biology. We consider an analogous process to biological evolution in the evolution of cultural behavior. In this model, people tend to adopt more ideas that tend to lead to more successful behavior, so that more fit ideas become more prevalent in a later population and less fit ones become less prevalent. This evolutionary process eventually leads to the most &quot;fit&quot; ideas being adopted within the cultural. We discuss implications of such a process to draw out predictions that can then be tested against actual behavior.

=== [[/Decision Theory with Uncertainty/]] ===

Here we re-open the decision theory toolbox to consider the additional tools necessary to deal with a world with uncertainty. We consider, in some detail, basic rules that an individual should follow if he were rational in the face of uncertainty.

=== [[/Investments, Insurance, and Search/]] ===

Now we introduce several important applications of decision theory with uncertainty, applying decision theory to investments, insurance, and search.

=== [[/Anomalies and Responses to Them/]] ===

Here we consider apparent anomalies that have been observed when trying to apply these models of self-interested individuals to actual social behavior. We find some situations, especially when uncertainty is involved, where individual choices do not seem consistent with all the rules that a rational decision maker must follow. Given these differences, we must consider two questions. First, are there any predictable biases in these differences between actual choices and rational choices? Second, under what circumstances is some social behavior of interest likely to be consistent with rational choices? In addressing these questions, we reconsider when a model based upon individuals’ rational choices is likely to be appropriate for a positive theory that intends to predict and explain some social behavior of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Decision theory studies rational choices. It is used both to predict and explain actual choices and to improve actual decision making. The first purpose is called positive theory and the second is called normative theory. While our primary aim is to predict and explain actual choices (positive theory), understanding how to improve actual decision making (normative theory) helps us to better understand decision theory for our applications, as well. 

Decision theory may also be used to predict equilibria achieved by some evolutionary process. In particular, this evolutionary process may be the biological evolutionary process or a cultural evolutionary process. We consider applications to each.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Smart Choices and Models Based Upon Them|Smart Choices and Models Based Upon Them]] ===

We first start with a review of material in ''Smart Choices'', a book written by John Hammond, Ralph Keeney, and Howard Raiffa, experts from the Harvard Business School in the field of decision theory and its application in business. (An MBA program is largely the study of how to improve decisions important to business, and decision theory is a key component of this study.) These chapters introduce you to the basics of decision theory and how it can be applied to improve your decisions. The chapter continues with a discussion of our goals for models intended to help us predict and explain social behavior. We see that our modeling focuses only upon the most important factors necessary to predict and explain, even if we must sacrifice a complete or accurate description of the individual’s actual decision making process.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Optimization in Markets|Optimization in Markets]] ===

We then introduce the basics of microeconomic theory, since economists were the first to use models based upon self-interested individuals and these models are now the foundation for the discipline. We introduce these models based upon decision theory because they have been so successful in economics. As the political scientists Shepsle and Bonchek explain, considering these models are important for our general goals of predicting and explaining all types of social behavior: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The modern theory of economics is a grand intellectual edifice precisely because it has succeeded, as no other social science has, in constructing explanations logically, rigorously, and in empirically meaningful ways. At the foundation of this edifice is a scientific commitment to explanation, not description.'' (Shepsle-Bonchek, 1997, 21)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The models developed here introduce the reader to most of the basic tools and concepts of decision theory, at least in a world without uncertainty. We first consider profit-maximizing decisions that firms make in perfectly competitive markets, show how the model describes supply and demand choices, and how it describes the “market” determining price to reach a competitive equilibrium. We then extend this model to consumers, whose preferences can take a more general structure, which leads us to develop “utility” functions, an important tool throughout decision theory and game theory. We also introduce the concept of efficiency, which can be used to evaluate the outcomes that our models predict. We find, in particular, that competitive markets, driven by self-interested individuals, are efficient, and compare that conclusion to monopoly markets that are not.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Sincere Voters|Sincere Voters]] ===

We then apply decision theory models to political science with the intent of creating a positive theory of politics. We use of models of self-interested individuals to consider various voting mechanisms used to generate group decisions. We start with rational individuals, just as in the economics models, and analyze decisions they would make with these voting mechanisms. We show that some voting mechanisms, and majority voting in particular, can lead to irrational group decision making, even if all individuals are rational. For another application, we also consider the incentives for lobbying for rules, regulations, or laws that would benefit everyone within a group and find an explanation for special interests.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Natural Selection|Natural Selection]] ===

We not use models based upon the mathematics of decision theory, not to predict and explain rational decisions, but in evolutionary biology. Here, “decisions” are not made consciously by any individual, but an evolutionary mechanism rewards the most fit individuals that pass along more of their genes to the next generation. The population of individuals then tends to eventually evolve to one with individuals who virtually all have characteristics that maximize fitness. After examining the process of natural selection, we consider its application in choices involving food and shelter, and the determination of sex ratios. 

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Cooperation with Kin Selection|Cooperation with Kin Selection]] ===

This materials continues the study of evolutionary biology, but it considers decision theory models from a different perspective. We consider the perspective of the gene rather than the individual with that gene. This offers a theory of kin selection, which may lead to behavior towards family members that appears altruistic from the viewpoint of an individual in the population, but not from the viewpoint of an individual gene. We consider some applications of kin selection in amoebae, social insects, ground squirrels, and humans. Finally, after we have considered evolutionary arguments that predict and explain tendencies in animal behavior, we apply the same evolutionary arguments to determine behavioral tendencies in people, an approach that has formed the field of evolutionary psychology.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Cultural Evolution and Social Norms|Cultural Evolution and Social Norms]] ===

Here we apply decision theory in models of evolution outside of biology. We consider an analogous process to biological evolution in the evolution of cultural behavior. In this model, people tend to adopt more ideas that tend to lead to more successful behavior, so that more fit ideas become more prevalent in a later population and less fit ones become less prevalent. This evolutionary process eventually leads to the most &quot;fit&quot; ideas being adopted within the cultural. We discuss implications of such a process to draw out predictions that can then be tested against actual behavior.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Decision Theory with Uncertainty|Decision Theory with Uncertainty]] ===

Here we re-open the decision theory toolbox to consider the additional tools necessary to deal with a world with uncertainty. We consider, in some detail, basic rules that an individual should follow if he were rational in the face of uncertainty.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Investments, Insurance, and Search|Investments, Insurance, and Search]] ===

Now we introduce several important applications of decision theory with uncertainty, applying decision theory to investments, insurance, and search.

=== [[Self Interest and Social Behavior/Anomalies and Responses to Them|Anomalies and Responses to Them]] ===

Here we consider apparent anomalies that have been observed when trying to apply these models of self-interested individuals to actual social behavior. We find some situations, especially when uncertainty is involved, where individual choices do not seem consistent with all the rules that a rational decision maker must follow. Given these differences, we must consider two questions. First, are there any predictable biases in these differences between actual choices and rational choices? Second, under what circumstances is some social behavior of interest likely to be consistent with rational choices? In addressing these questions, we reconsider when a model based upon individuals’ rational choices is likely to be appropriate for a positive theory that intends to predict and explain some social behavior of interest.

Is [[Why Computational Physics?]] a book name, or a chapter of a book called &quot;Computational Physics?&quot; --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

Why computational physics? is an introductory note on the importance and philosophy of computational physics. it is aime at giving the reader an idead about the scope and aims of the book. Threrfore it becomes a section or part of the introduction. Waiting for feedback Alay -e-abbas

:OK, I'll move it to a chapter then ( [[Computational Physics/Why Computational Physics?]] ). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:38, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
Have you read the euler method section? please suggest where shpould it be placed. Alayabbas 1:11 PM 22 August 2006 (PST)
I have added trapezoidal rule also waiting for feed back. Alayabbas 1:35 PM, 22 Aug 2006 (PST)
:Haven't read it... do you have a link? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:46, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

i have added it in the spreedsheet section also the trapezoidal rule. Alayabbas 10:10 PM, 24 Aug 2006 (PST)</text>

__TOC__

==Standards and Best Practices==
Standards in computer programming are methods of programming that have been declared acceptable and thereafter are recommended as the approach that should be used.  Much like what [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAAP GAAP] is to Accounting, programming standards allow programmers to use a common ground when writing code.  Closely tied with programming standards, best practices are simply recommended methods of writing code.  A segment of code can be transformed visually to comply with a programming best practice, however, syntactically the segment of code will remain the same.  Best practices may also involve addition of extra code segments or removal of redundant code segments.  To sum it up, best practices are simply the most recommended way of writing a segment of code, whereas programming standards are a specific set of rules to apply to coding style and techniques.

==Standards, Best Practices, and Templates==
Here you will find some information on the standards and best practices of several different languages.  Also you will find templates that will help you start off on the right foot with all the best practices and standards included.  This way, you will be able to begin your coding process already loaded up with all the best practices and standards, allowing for a better segment of code to be produced.

==1. Define the following:==
;a. Botulism: is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin, botulin, that is produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium botulinum.'' Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulism toxin.  Outbreaks of foodborne botulism are usually caused by eating contaminated home-canned foods.
;b. Steam pressure canning: is a method of canning by placing the food in a pressure cooker.  A pressure cooker allows water to be heated to a temperature higher than the &quot;standard&quot; boiling point of 212°F (100°C).
;c. Boiling water bath: A boiling water bath is a method of canning that uses a large pot of boiling water.  The filled jars are placed on the rack, then the rack is lowered into the boiling water.  Process for the required time as listed in the recipe.  This method of canning is the most popular technique for processing canned foods.
;d. Steam canning: This is a method of canning that involves a shallow pan with water in the bottom.  The lid for this method is rather deep, as to allow for the top clearance of the filled jars.  The shallow pool of water is heated to boiling as to create steam.  The steam processes the filled jars.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not recommend steam canning because processing times for currently available equipment has not been researched.
;e. Open kettle canning: This method of canning uses a large pot where the product to be canned is heated to boiling as to purge out any impurities.  The filling is then packed into hot jars after which the seals and bands are processed.  The jars will seal on there own.  No processing is needed for this method of canning.  This USDA recommends that this process not be used because it does not prevent all risk of spoilage.
;f. Pectin: Under acidic conditions, pectin forms a gel, and it can be used as an edible thickening agent in processed foods. This effect is used for making jams and jellies.
;g. Hot pack: Food is packed into jars after being cooked and while still hot.  It is then placed in a pressure cooker.
;h. Cold pack: Food is packed into jars in an uncooked state (or sometimes after being scalded).  It is then placed in a pressure cooker.
;i. Sterilize: Killing all forms of bacteria and other pathogens present on an item (such as a jar).
;j. Scald: Immersing a fruit or vegetable in boiling water for a minute or two.  This splits the skin, easing the task of removing the peel.
;k. Jelly: A jelly is a sweet or savoury food gel, usually made through the addition of gelatin or pectin to edible liquids. &quot;True&quot; jellies are smooth textured and made from fruit juice, such as grape jelly.
;l. Jam: is a type of sweet spread or condiment made with certain fruits or vegetables, sugar, and sometimes pectin.  In the United States and Canada, jams are invariably made from mashed or ground fresh fruits.
;m. Marmalade: invariably refers to a conserve derived from a citrus fruit, most commonly from oranges. The recipe includes sliced or chopped fruit peel, which is simmered in fruit juice and water until soft; indeed marmalade is sometimes described as jam with fruit peel.
;n. Pickles: Pickling is the process of preparing a food by soaking and storing it in a brine containing salt, acid (usually vinegar), or both, a process which can preserve otherwise perishable foods for months. The resulting food is called a pickle.

==2. List the equipment used in the following methods of canning:==
===a. Pressure===
Pressure canners for use in the home have been extensively redesigned in recent years. Models made before the 1970's were heavy-walled kettles with clamp-on or turn-on lids. They were fitted with a dial gauge, a vent port in the form of a petcock or counterweight, and a safety fuse.  Modern pressure canners are lightweight, thinwalled kettles; most have turn-on lids. They have a jar rack, gasket, dial or weighted gauge, an automatic vent/cover lock, a vent port (steam vent) to be closed with a counterweight or weighted gauge, and a safety fuse. 

Pressure does not destroy microorganisms, but high temperatures applied for an adequate period of time do kill microorganisms. The success of destroying all microorganisms capable of growing in canned food is based on the temperature obtained in pure steam, free of air, at sea level. At sea level, a canner operated at a gauge pressure of 10.5 lbs provides an internal temperature of 240° F.

Two serious errors in temperatures obtained in pressure canners occur because:
# Internal canner temperatures are lower at higher altitudes. To correct this error, canners must be operated at the increased pressures specified in this publication for appropriate altitude ranges.
# Air trapped in a canner lowers the temperature obtained at 5, 10, or 15 pounds of pressure and results in under processing. The highest volume of air trapped in a canner occurs in processing raw-packed foods in dial-gauge canners. These canners do not vent air during processing. To be safe, all types of pressure canners must be vented 10 minutes before they are pressurized.

To vent a canner, leave the vent port uncovered on newer models or manually open petcocks
on some older models. Heating the filled canner with its lid locked into place boils water and
generates steam that escapes through the petcock or vent port. When steam first escapes, set
a timer for 10 minutes. After venting 10 minutes, close the petcock or place the counterweight
or weighted gauge over the vent port to pressurize the canner.

Weighted-gauge models exhaust tiny amounts of air and steam each time their gauge rocks or jiggles during processing. They control pressure precisely and need neither watching during processing nor checking for accuracy. The sound of the weight rocking or jiggling indicates that 
the canner is maintaining the recommended pressure. The single disadvantage of weighted-gauge canners is that they cannot correct precisely for higher altitudes. At altitudes above 1,000 feet, they must be operated at canner pressures of 10 instead of 5, or 15 instead of 10, PSI.

Check dial gauges for accuracy before use each year and replace if they read high by more than 1 pound at 5, 10, or 15 pounds of pressure. Low readings cause over-processing and may indicate that the accuracy of the gauge is unpredictable. Gauges may be checked at most county Cooperative Extension offices.

Handle canner lid gaskets carefully and clean them according to the manufacturer's directions. Nicked or dried gaskets will allow steam leaks during pressurization of canners. Keep gaskets clean between uses. Gaskets on older model canners may require a light coat of vegetable oil once per year. Gaskets on newer model canners are prelubricated and do not benefit from oiling. Check your canner's instructions if there is doubt that the particular gasket you use has been pre-lubricated.

Lid safety fuses are thin metal inserts or rubber plugs designed to relieve excessive pressure from the canner. Do not pick at or scratch fuses while cleaning lids. Use only canners that have the Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) approval to ensure their safety.

Replacement gauges and other parts for canners are often available at stores offering canning equipment or from canner manufacturers. When ordering parts, give your canner model number and describe the parts needed.

Follow these steps for successful pressure canning:
# Put 2 to 3 inches of hot water in the canner. Place filled jars on the rack, using a jar lifter. Fasten canner lid securely.
# Leave weight off vent port or open petcock. Heat at the highest setting until steam flows from the petcock or vent port.
# Maintain high heat setting, exhaust steam 10 minutes, and then place weight on vent port or close petcock. The canner will pressurize during the next 3 to 5 minutes.
# Start timing the process when the pressure reading on the dial gauge indicates that the recommended pressure has been reached, or when the weighted gauge begins to jiggle or rock.
# Regulate heat under the canner to maintain a steady pressure at or slightly above the correct gauge pressure. Quick and large pressure variations during processing may cause unnecessary liquid losses from jars. Weighted gauges on Mirro canners should jiggle about 2 or 3 times per minute. On Presto canners, they should rock slowly throughout the process.
# When the timed process is completed, turn off the heat, remove the canner from heat if possible, and let the canner depressurize. &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''Do not force-cool the canner'''&lt;/font&gt;. Forced cooling may result in food spoilage. Cooling the canner with cold running water or opening the vent port before the canner is fully depressurized will cause loss of liquid from jars and seal failures. Force-cooling may also warp the canner lid of older model canners, causing steam leaks. Depressurization of older models should be timed. Standard-size heavy-walled canners require about 30 minutes when loaded with pints and 45 minutes with quarts. Newer thin-walled canners cool more rapidly and are equipped with vent locks. These canners are depressurized when their vent lock piston drops to a normal position.
# After the canner is depressurized, remove the weight from the vent port or open the petcock. Wait 2 minutes, unfasten the lid, and remove it carefully. Lift the lid away from you so that the steam does not burn your face.
# Remove jars with a lifter, and place on towel or cooling rack, if desired.

===b. Boiling water bath===
Boiling water canners are made of aluminum or porcelain-covered steel. They have removable
perforated racks and fitted lids. The canner must be deep enough so that at least 1 inch of
briskly boiling water will be over the tops of jars during processing. Some boiling-water canners
do not have flat bottoms. A flat bottom must be used on an electric range. Either a flat or ridged
bottom can be used on a gas burner. To ensure uniform processing of all jars with an electric
range, the canner should be no more than 4 inches wider in diameter than the element on
which it is heated.

Follow these steps for successful boiling-water canning:
# Fill the canner halfway with water.
# Preheat water to 140° F for raw-packed foods and to 180° F for hot-packed foods.
# Load filled jars, fitted with lids, into the canner rack and use the handles to lower the rack into the water; or fill the canner, one jar at a time, with a jar lifter.
# Add more boiling water, if needed, so the water level is at least 1 inch above jar tops.
# Turn heat to its highest position until water boils vigorously.
# Set a timer for the minutes required for processing the food.
# Cover with the canner lid and lower the heat setting to maintain a gentle boil throughout the process schedule.
# Add more boiling water, if needed, to keep the water level above the jars.
# When jars have been boiled for the recommended time, turn off the heat and remove the canner lid.
# Using a jar lifter, remove the jars and place them on a towel, leaving at least 1-inch
spaces between the jars during cooling.

===c. Steam&lt;br&gt;d. Open kettle===
The USDA does not recommend the use of the steam method or the open kettle method as neither of these processes are guaranteed to eliminate contaminants.

==3. Give directions for sterilizing, filling, sealing, and testing seals on jars.==
===Sterilizing===
There are at least two ways to sterilize jars:
* Boil them in water for 15 minutes
* Wash them in hot soapy water and then let them soak in bleached rinse water for at least two minutes.  Use a quarter cup of bleach for every two gallons of water.  Take the jars out of the bath and allow the bleach and water to evaporate for at least 15 minutes.

Boiling them can take a long time because it takes a lot of water to cover the jars completely, and it is difficult to get very many jars in even a very large pot.  Then there is the problem of removing the boiling-hot jars from the pot.  Because of this, it is often easier to use bleach.

===Filling===
You can either try to pour or ladle your food into the jars directly (though you risk making a big mess), or you can use a wide-mouth funnel.  Most places that sell canning jars will also sell these funnels.  The small end of the funnel fits nicely in the mouth of the jar, and the large end is wide enough to make pouring or ladling a lot easier.

Do not overfill the jars.  Leave {{units|2 cm|¾ inch}} or so of space at the top of the jar, though most recipes will actually specify the recommended headroom.  If you run out of food before a jar is completely filled, it's OK to just leave it that way and seal it.

===Sealing===
Place the lid on top of the jar, making sure that the rubber seal on the underside of the lid comes in contact with the mouth of the jar.  Then screw the threaded portion of the lid on over it.  It only needs to be tight enough to hold the rubber seal to the mouth of the jar.  The actual seal occurs because the air inside the jar shrinks as it cools, and this actually pulls the underside of the lid inward.  Of course this only works if the food is hot when you pour it into the jar.

===Testing Seals===
After processing, remove jars from canner and place upright jars on a towel in a draft-free place. '''DO NOT''' retighten screw bands or check for seal while the jars are hot. Allow processed jars to cool undisturbed for 24 hours. After 24 hours, check the seals. Sealed lids curve downward and do not move when pressed.

==4. When should food be steam pressure processed?==
Foods that are low in acid have a higher pH level and do not contain enough acid to prevent the growth of botulinum bacteria.  These foods are processed at temperatures of 240 - 250 degrees F, attainable with pressure canners.

Low-acid foods include all fresh vegetables with the exception of tomatoes.  Fruits and tomatoes are neutral- to high-acid foods.

==5. List the kinds of vegetables and fruits that are excellent for canning as opposed to freezing or drying.==
Almost any fruit or vegetable can be canned or frozen, but there are a few exceptions.  Summer squash and zucchini are better preserved by freezing than by canning.  Salad greens and potatoes do not freeze very well and should be canned instead.

==6. Can the following items:==
===a. One fruit juice using the open kettle method===
====Apple Juice====
The USDA does not recommend the open kettle method as it does not ensure that the end product is uncontaminated.  Rather, use the boiling water method.
;Quality: Good quality apple juice is made from a blend of varieties. For best results, buy fresh juice from a local cider maker within 24 hours after it has been pressed.
;Procedure: Refrigerate juice for 24 to 48 hours. Without mixing, carefully pour off clear liquid and discard sediment. Strain clear liquid through a paper coffee filter or double layers of damp cheesecloth. Heat quickly, stirring occasionally, until juice begins to boil. Fill immediately into sterile pint or quart jars (see page 1-9 to sterilize jars), or fill into clean half-gallon jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process as per the table below.

===b. Two kinds of fruit using the boiling water bath method, one by hot packing and one by cold packing===
====Hot packing====
Hot-packing is the practice of heating freshly prepared food to boiling, simmering it 2 to 5
minutes, and promptly filling jars loosely with the boiled food. Whether food has been
hot-packed or cold-packed, the juice, syrup, or water to be added to the foods should also be
heated to boiling before adding it to the jars. This practice helps to remove air from food
tissues, shrinks food, helps keep the food from floating in the jars, increases vacuum in sealed
jars, and improves shelf life. Preshrinking food permits filling more food into each jar.
Hot-packing is the best way to remove air and is the preferred pack style for foods processed in
a boiling-water canner. At first, the color of hot-packed foods may appear no better than that of
cold-packed foods, but within a short storage period, both color and flavor of hot-packed foods
will be superior.
====Cold packing====
Cold-packing is the practice of filling jars tightly with freshly prepared, but unheated food. Such  foods, especially fruit, will float in the jars. The entrapped air in and around the food may cause discoloration within 2 to 3 months of storage. Cold-packing is more suitable for vegetables processed in a pressure canner.

====Berries====
This procedure is suitable for blackberries, blueberries, currants, dewberries, elderberries, gooseberries, huckleberries, loganberries, mulberries, and raspberries.
;Syrup: Syrup is a combination of sugar and water.  The sugar volume ranges from 10% (for light syrup) to 50% (for heavy syrup).
;Quantity: An average of 12 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 8 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A 24-quart crate weighs 36 pounds and yields 18 to 24 quarts—an average of 1-3/4 pounds per quart.
;Quality: Choose ripe, sweet berries with uniform color.
;Procedure: Wash 1 or 2 quarts of berries at a time. Drain, cap, and stem if necessary. For gooseberries, snip off heads and tails with scissors. Prepare and boil preferred syrup, if desired. Add 1/2 cup syrup, juice, or water to each clean jar.
;Hot pack: For blueberries, currants, elderberries, gooseberries, and huckleberries. Heat berries in boiling water for 30 seconds and drain. Fill jars and cover with hot juice, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.
;Cold pack: Fill jars with any of the raw berries, shaking down gently while filling. Cover with hot syrup, juice, or water, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process following the procedure outlined in requirement 2b.

===c. Two kinds of vegetables using the pressure canning method, one by hot packing and one by cold packing===
====Beans or Peas—Shelled, Dried (Hot pack)====
;Quantity: An average of 5 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 3-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints—an average of 3/4 pounds per quart.
;Quality: Select mature, dry seeds. Sort out and discard discolored seeds.
;Procedure: Place dried beans or peas in a large pot and cover with water. Soak 12 to 18 hours in a cool place. Drain water. To quickly hydrate beans, you may cover sorted and washed beans with boiling water in a saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, soak 1 hour and drain. Cover beans soaked by either method with fresh water and boil 30 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pint or 1 teaspoon per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with beans or peas and cooking water, leaving 1-inch headspace. Adjust lids and hot pack using the processing times and pressures in the tables below.

;Quality: Select well-filled pods with green seeds. Discard insect-damaged and diseased seeds. Procedure: Shell beans and wash thoroughly.
;Cold pack: Fill jars with raw beans. Do not press or shake down.
*Small beans—leave 1-inch of headspace for pints and 1-1/2 inches for quarts.
*Large beans—leave 1-inch of headspace for pints and 1-1/4 inches for quarts.
Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Add boiling water, leaving the same headspaces listed above. Adjust lids and process as per the tables below.

===d. One jelly or jam===
You can make jelly or jam from almost any fruit you like.  Strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, grape, and plum are all excellent choices, but you can also use a variety of wild fruits as well, including rose hip, gooseberry, autumn olive, and elderberry.  We present a recipe for '''plum jam''' here, but an almost identical recipe for '''rose hip jam''' can be found in requirement 4 of the [[../../Nature/Herbs|Herbs]] honor.

A mix of ripe and nearly ripe plums will work well for this recipe.  Wash the plums, place them in a large pot and cover with water.  Heat until the plums become soft and squishy and the skins break open.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a [[W:Chinois|chinois]] or a ''china hat''.  A chinois is a cone-shaped sieve with a mounting stand and a cone-shaped pestle.  Place a large measuring bowl under the chinois and use the pestle to crush the plums through the holes in the straining cone, catching the pulp in the measuring bowl.  The skins and seeds will be left behind.  Take note of the amount of pulp obtained, pour it into a ''large'' pot and add an equal volume of sugar.  Stir in the sugar until it is dissolved, and heat the mixture to a boil.  When it begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it boil for 20 minutes.  Do not reduce the heat so much that the mixture stops boiling, and monitor it carefully, stirring often.  If dark colored sauce can be stirred up from the bottom of the pan, reduce the heat a little more, as this is an indication that the sauce is burning.

After 20 minutes, pour the mixture into jars and seal them.  It should gel in about 20 minutes.

==1. Define the following terms:==
;a. Blanching: Blanching is a food preparation process wherein the food substance, usually a vegetable or fruit, is plunged into boiling water, removed after a brief, timed interval and finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water (shocked) to halt the cooking process.  It is best to place the food in a wire basket so that it can be lowered into boiling water, lifted out, and then lowered into the cold water.  This is easier than pouring off the boiling water or wasting time trying to fish the food out of a pot of boiling of water.  Furthermore, this will allow you to reuse the boiling water for the next batch without having to wait for it to reheat.

;b. Quick freeze: Quick freezing is used to quickly freeze perishable food items. In this case, water contained inside the food items is subjected to temperatures well below its melting/freezing point {{units|0°C|32°F}}. This causes the water inside the foods to freeze in a very short period of time. 

;c. Freezer burn: Freezer burn is a condition that occurs when frozen food has been damaged by ice crystals, due to air reaching the food. It is generally caused by non-airtight packaging. Freezer burn often results in change of texture and discoloration of the affected food. It appears as grayish to brown leathery spots on the food.  Although freezer burn affects the quality of food, it does not make it unsafe or unhealthful to eat.

==2. What kinds of containers can be used for freezing foods?==
Plastic containers work the best.  Metal containers also work well.  The important considerations are that the container be food-safe, air-tight, and not be damaged by freezing.

==3. What are the essential things to be considered when selecting vegetables or fruits for freezing?==
First check the quality as you would for any fresh fruit or vegetable.  Wash thoroughly and make sure the fruit or vegetable has no salt on it. When you freeze the fruit or vegetable make sure that it is not bumped or otherwise damaged.

==4. How do you thaw frozen vegetables for the table? How do you thaw frozen fruits for the table?==
===Vegetables===
Most vegetables should be cooked without thawing first.  Corn on the cob should be partially thawed before cooking, and leafy green vegetables should be completely thawed.  Thawing should not be done at room temperature.  Food is safe indefinitely while it is frozen, but as soon as the temperature rises above {{units|4°C|40°F}}, it is susceptible to bacteria (which can cause food poisoning).  Instead, thaw it in the refrigerator 6-8 hours ahead of time, or under ''cold'' (below {{units|21°C|70°F}}) running water for 30 minutes.  Do not remove the vegetables from their packaging, as this allows bacteria to get in.  Turn the package every few minutes.

Drop frozen vegetables in boiling water, and quickly return the water to a boil.  Pry the vegetables apart as it thaws so that it can cook evenly.

===Fruits===
Do not thaw fruit at room temperature, for the same reasons you do not thaw vegetables at room temperature.   Instead, thaw fruit in the refrigerator 6-8 hours ahead of time.  If you are in a hurry, you can also thaw fruit by running ''cold'' water over it, as long as the water temperature is below {{units|21°C|70°F}}, turning the package every few minutes or so.  This will take about half an hour for one pound of fruit.  If you are going to use the fruit right away, you can thaw it in a microwave oven at a low setting.  Do not thaw the fruit completely, as the ice crystals will give it a bit of firmness that freezing takes away.

==5. Freeze two vegetables (corn and another of your choice), then prepare and serve for sampling.==
Vegetables must be blanched before they are frozen.  To blanch, drop the vegetable in boiling water for the &quot;blanching time&quot;, then transfer to ''cold'' water.  When packing into containers, ''always'' leave a bit of headspace.  Water expands as it freezes, so you must leave room for this expansion or the container will be forced open and the food will get freezer-burned.

When freezing any food, do not fill the freezer with too much warm food at a time and do not stack the packages until they are completely frozen.  If you fill the freezer with a lot of warm food all at once, it will take longer for it to freeze which will make for a lower-quality end product.  Ideally, you want the food to freeze as quickly as possible.  Once it is frozen, you can stack it however you want.

If you have two freezers (say a chest freezer and a refrigerator/freezer), it would be a good idea to lower the temperature of the fridge-freezer to its minimum.  Then use this freezer to initially freeze the food.  Once the food is completely frozen, transfer it to the chest freezer (at normal temperature) for storage.  When you are finished freezing the food, you can raise the fridge-freezer back to its normal setting.

Be sure to label the food packages as you freeze them.  It can be difficult to tell them apart later (pumpkin does not go so well in a peach cobbler).

===Corn===
For corn on the cob, blanch for seven minutes.  For kernel corn, blanch for four minutes.  Allow it to cool completely.  For kernel corn, cut it from the cob leaving one third of the kernel on the cob.  Package in freezer bags and place it in a freezer.
===Carrots===
Cut off the tops and wash.  Freeze small carrots whole, but cut large carrots into thin slices or into {{units|1.5cm|quarter inch}} cubes.  Blanch small whole carrots for 5 minutes, and blanch sliced or cubed carrots for 2 minutes.  Drain and package into freezer bags, then freeze.

===Okra===
Blanch small pods for 3 minutes, large pods for 4.  Slice into &quot;coins&quot;, package, and freeze.
===Pumpkin and Winter Squash===
Cook in boiling water until the pulp is soft.  Remove the rind and mash the pulp.  To cool, place the container of pumpkin pulp in cold water.  Package and freeze.
===Summer Squash and Zucchini===
Cut into {{units|1.25cm|.5 inch}} slices, and blanch for 3 minutes.  Package and freeze.

==6. Quick freeze a vegetable for easy pouring.==
Blanch the vegetables as in the previous requirement.  When you are ready to freeze them, place them on a tray in a single layer and separate them so they do not touch one another.  After the vegetables are frozen, place them in a container, seal, label, and return to the freezer.  The vegetables will separate easily and can be poured right out of the package when you need them.

==7. Why is salt not put in vegetables to be frozen?==
Salt lowers the freezing point of water from its normal temperature of {{units|0°C|32°F}} to {{units|-21°C|-6°F}}.  Most food freezers operate at {{units|-18°C|0°F}}, which is higher than the freezing point of salt water.  If food to be frozen contains enough salt, it will not freeze in a regular freezer.  If it contains only a little salt, the freezing point will be lowered, but not by as much.  Even a small amount of salt will prevent it from quick-freezing.

==8. Freeze some peaches in light syrup and also some in orange or pineapple juice. What is the reason for using ascorbic acid in the syrup and not in the fruit juice? Why is ascorbic acid used in freezing peaches?==
===Packed in syrup===
First, you'll need to make the syrup which is just sugar and water.  For peaches, you will need a 40% syrup, which is made by dissolving {{units|250ml|1 cup}} of syrup in {{units|1000ml|4 cups}} of lukewarm water.  Chill the syrup before using.

Wash and peel the peaches.  Add {{units|2.5ml|½ tsp}} of ascorbic acid to the syrup.  Place the peaches in a container and cover completely with the syrup, leaving some headroom.  Wad up some wax paper and place it on top of the peaches to keep them submerged.  Seal and freeze.

===Packed in Fruit Juice===
Wash and peel the peaches.  Place the peaches in a container and cover completely with the fruit juice, leaving some headroom.  Wad up some wax paper and place it on top of the peaches to keep them submerged.  Seal and freeze.  Acsorbic acid is not needed when packing in fruit juice because the fruit juice has acsorbic acid in it already.  The acsorbic acid will prevent the peaches from turning brown.

==9. Freeze one type of berry without added sweeteners.==
Wash and drain the berries (except for blueberries which should not be washed).  Pack them into containers leaving some headspace, and freeze.

==10. Make one kind of freezer jam.==
Wash {{units|500ml|two cups}} of strawberries or blackberries, being sure to select only fully ripened ones.  Remove any caps and stems, and crush the berries.  If desired, you can squeeze blackberries through a sieve to remove any seeds.  Put the berries in a large bowl, add {{units|1000ml|four cups}} of sugar, mix well, and let sit for 20 minutes.  Dissolve one package of powdered pectin in {{units|250ml|one cup}} of water and boil for one minute.  Stir the water/pectin into the berries and sugar for two minutes.  Then ladle into containers and freeze.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To specify widths, heights and other lengths, you can use various units, listed in the following table.

&lt;!-- Note: percentage is not a unit. --&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Units in CSS
! Code
! Definition
! Note
|-
| em
| The height of the element's font.
|
|-
| ex
| The height of the letter 'x' in the element's font.
|
|-
| px
| pixel
|
|-
| mm
| millimeter
|
|-
| cm
| centimeter
|
|-
| pt
| point (1/72 inch)
|
|-
| pc
| pica (12 points = 1/6 inch)
|
|-
| in
| inch
|
|}

Lengths may also be specified as a percentage of another length. Using percentages can be complicated because the base length varies from property to property. For example, when percentages are used with the {{CSS:property|margin}} property the calculation is based on the width of the containing block. When percentages are used with the {{CSS:property|font-size}} property the calculation is based on the {{CSS:property|font-size}} of the parent element but with {{CSS:property|line-height}} it is based on the {{CSS:property|font-size}} of the current element.

Font sizes on screen are best given as a percentage or in &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;s. (See the note on [[../Fonts and Text#Using ems in Internet Explorer|Using ems in Internet Explorer]].) This means that the page will interact gracefully with users' font preferences. Using pixels (&lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;) for font sizes causes a number of problems and should be avoided.

The absolute units &lt;code&gt;mm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; do not work well on screen and cause problems in many older browsers. It is safest to only use them for print media. Even in print media they may interact badly with users' preferences.

== Relative units ==
The three units &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt; are called relative units. These units do not specify a fixed length. Instead they scale relative to some other quantity. In the case of &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt; they scale relative to the font size of some element.

=== Screen pixels, printer pixels and CSS pixels ===
The &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt; unit specifies a length in ''CSS pixels''. These are not the same as the pixels on the screen that the document is rendered on or the dots on the printer that it is printed on. It is perfectly possible, for example, for there to be two screen pixels or five printer dots to one CSS pixel. Many web browsers use the rule that one screen pixel equals one CSS pixel for simplicity but you can not rely on this. Opera and Internet Explorer version 7 allow the user to change the number of screen pixels per CSS pixel. It is common for users with poor vision who use these browsers to choose to have five or six screen pixels to the CSS pixel.

The [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-length formal definition] of the CSS pixel is quite complicated but the basic idea is that a CSS pixel appears to be the same size when the document is at a comfortable reading distance. So a CSS pixel would be physically bigger on a monitor than on a mobile phone because the monitor would normally be further from the user's eyes than the mobile phone.

=== Calculations ===
Divide the desired margin width/height by the width/height of its container to convert it to ems. Multiply by 100 to convert that to percentages.

Divide the desired container width by 1.62 to use the Golden Ratio as the size of the content block. Subtract the content width from the container width to use the Golden Ratio as the size of the sidebar

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; selector matches hyperlinks. There are the four pseudo-classes that are commonly used with it: &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;visited&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;!-- &lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; was introduced in CSS2.1. --&gt; Rules using these pseudo-classes should be given in this order so that the dynamic effects take precedence over the visited/unvisited state. The following example will display a link that is black, changes to green when the mouse is over it, and changes to pink when active (whilst the mouse is pressed over it).

&lt;pre&gt;
a:link
 { color:black; background:gray }
a:visited
 { color:black; background:red }
a:hover
 { color:green }
a:active
 { color:pink }
&lt;/pre&gt;

When the mouse is over an unvisited link both the &lt;code&gt;a:link&lt;/code&gt; selector and the &lt;code&gt;a:hover&lt;/code&gt; selector are matched. Since the hover rule appears last its &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; declaration takes precedence over the link rule's &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; declaration. Since the hover rule does not alter the &lt;code&gt;background&lt;/code&gt; property the result is green text on a gray background.

The &lt;code&gt;:link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:visited&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-classes can only be used with the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; selector. CSS2.1 allows the &lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:active&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-classes to be used with other elements. However, Internet Explorer only allows &lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt; on anchor elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cooling of the hot wort is a critical step for several reasons.

*Yeast are killed by high temperature.
*Wort produces dimethyl sulfide (DMS) at high temperatures, and between the point where the temperature is just not high enough to boil it off and that where its rate of formation is negligible (i.e. room temperature) this flavour accumulates.
*Some spoilage bacteria can grow in the wart as it cools (e.g. if the wort is contaminated after boiling, by air or by condensate), and the longer that these have to grow before the yeast is pitched, the greater effect that they will have on the beer.
* Oxygen reacts with hot wort to produce undesirable flavours. (Note however, that once the wort is cooled, it is much less reactive, and in fact it is essential for oxygen to be added to wort, as yeast cannot synthesise certain lipids required for their cell membranes without it).


In a home context, beer is usually cooled in one of two ways:
* By immersing the metal boiling vessel, for example in a laundry basin full of water
* By inserting a cooler or cooling coil into the wort.
* Using a counter current heat exchange (usually a copper pipe immersed in a wider diameter plastic pipe with the wort and the beer flowing in opposite directions).

The laundry basin method has the advantage of being cheap, and requiring no additional equipment. The cooling coil is however far quicker. A simple heating coil can be made from copper pipe, (such as the type used in domestic houses). The pipe can be bent with a pipe bender, obtained from an ordinary hardware store, and once it is coiled, two polyethylene tubes can be attached to it. The whole apparatus is then submerged into the wort boiler, and one polyethylene tube is connected to a cold water source, and the other outlet pipe is drained away. The pipe should be &quot;painted&quot; with a thin layer of epoxy to prevent copper leaching off it - alternatively, if you can get it, stainless steel pipe may be used.

features=Associated with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Wizengamot''''' is part of the ruling structure for the Wizarding world. It is first mentioned in passing on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s &quot;Chocolate Frog&quot; card, which tells us that he is Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. Although it is never directly defined in the books, it is apparently a council of the most respected wizards, and is at least in part parallel to the the Supreme Court in the Muggle world.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see two incarnations of the Wizengamot directly.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] looks into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], where he observes the proceedings of the Wizengamot during several trials of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] shortly after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] passing. At that time, the head of the Wizengamot was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]], and we see three different sessions: the session in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]] pleads to have his sentence reduced, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]'s sentencing, and the trial (such as it was) and sentencing of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan Lestrange]].

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Harry actually has to stand before the Wizengamot in order to defend his use of magic against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], the Minister for Magic, seems to be in charge of the Wizengamot at this point, having possibly replaced Dumbledore, and seems to be trying to use the Wizengamot as a means of doing damage control.

== Analysis ==

Apart from the two versions of the Wizengamot described above, we can infer a third.

In the first version of the Wizengamot mentioned, during the Death Eater trials, the main function of the Wizengamot seemed to be trying and convicting Death Eaters. To that end, and reflecting the personality of the Chief Warlock, Bartemius Crouch Sr., it was a very harsh, almost militaristic organization.

When Harry is being tried, the Wizengamot seems to be in the process of turning into a mouthpiece for the Ministry. With Fudge as the Chief Warlock, its purpose has become very closely aligned with the needs of the Ministry, which like any political organization has a need for favorable publicity. To that end, the actions of the Wizengamot seem to be aimed at doing what will make the Ministry look good in the papers, rather than doing what will be the most fair; it is only the supreme debating skill of Albus Dumbledore that allows justice to be served in this particular case.

Finally, in between the two instances, there is mention that Albus Dumbledore is Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, an office that he held until more or less forced out of that position by the Ministry over the summer before Harry's fifth year at school ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], chapter 5); and he does appear to be reinstated in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. His removal from the post does show that the Ministry has some indirect control over the makeup of the Wizengamot, although it seems that it is apparently supposed to be somewhat independent. One can assume, given Dumbledore's nature, that the Wizengamot under his control was concerned with truth rather than political expedience, and was a gentler and perhaps more noble court than in either of the instances we see directly.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Dumbledore and Crouch are two people on the Wizengamot. Is there anyone else that we know who has been on it, or any position other than Chief Warlock?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Unlike American and British Muggle democracies, there is only partial separation of powers between the Wizengamot and the rest of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].  The Wizengamot appears to function as a High or Supreme Court, Criminal Court ''and'' Parliamentary and Legislative Body.  During Harry's &quot;hearing&quot; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] the trial is presided over by Cornelius Fudge who acts as both prosecutor and principal judge.  However, Fudge is also the head of government and administrative executive for the Ministry, and should not be permitted that much control and power.  The author may have created such a flawed system to emphasize the potential for corruption and authoritarianism in the Ministry of Magic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes features are best coded as client-side JavaScript (js) instead of in the software (either as core, or an extension). This chapter is a guide to developing js solutions. Instead of the bottom-up method of instruction used in [[JavaScript]], this text will use top-down methods, beginning with the examination of methods used in several useful scripts, examining the particular techniques used, and then extending them to another set of useful scripts.

This chapter will teach you only the basics of scripting in a MediaWiki environment; for generic or complex scripting, or use outside MediaWiki, refer to [[JavaScript]].

      <comment>Using Alternative licenses</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">All content on wikibooks is licensed under the GFDL. This is expressly stated on the &quot;edit&quot; screen, and clicking the &quot;save page&quot; button shows acceptance of that license. Now, I see that you have specifically used the {{tl|User PD}} template on your user page, so all contributions by you are released into the public domain. However, contributions by other users may not be. I don't think there is any way to expressly state that an entire book will be released under a different license, because the contributions of other editors might not be under other licenses. If you do not like the GDFL for whatever reason, you may be forced to contribute to another website. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

:You can, if you want, try to make a banner that says your book is to be licensed under a different license. I am not particularly knowledgable in this subject, so you you want to try something like this, I would ask [[User:Robert Horning]], because he knows this topic pretty well. What are your reasons, if i may ask, for your insistance that your book not be released under the GFDL? It's not a particularly restrictive license. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

::The template looks alright to me. I worry that either a) this warning will be meaningless when considering that all contributions here are already licensed under the GFDL, b) that users who are confused by the licensing issues won't contribute to your book, and c) that this book won't be eligible for some of the opportunities that are open to books, including [[WB:COTM]], [[WB:BOTM]], and new &quot;Publication of the month&quot; initiatives (that work to typeset, publish, and distribute completed wikibooks). Also, if your book is suffering from these handicaps, it provides incentives for other people to create other books, on the same topic, that are simply released under the GFDL. Such difficulties of licensing, and forking of content could lead for your book to be deleted in the future. Perhaps this is the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario, but i don't think it is ''impossible''. You might want to bring the issue up at [[WB:SL|staff lounge]] before you do anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Using Alternative licenses ==

I have seen what you are trying to suggest.  As far as &quot;freedom&quot; is concerned, I am not completely sure where you are coming from, but I understand those who are critics of the Free Software Foundation and their licensing practices.  There are a few things you can do to content that is here on Wikibooks, but I must emphasis that as [[User:Whiteknight]] pointed out, there is nothing preventing individuals here from making changes that only use the GFDL as the licensing arrangement.

Every contribution to Wikibooks must be available to anybody who wants to used Wikibooks content under the GFDL.  If you use a license that is incompatable with the GFDL, it makes all content thus contributed no longer available under  compatable terms with any other content and must be deleted as a copyright violation.  This is also being done to simplify our lives here on Wikibooks, as trying to work with multiple licenses would make life so complicated for Wikibooks contributors that it would hardly be worth even adding new content.

That said, you have a few options, keeping in mind that you as a contributor retain copyright to all content that you are creating here:

*'''Dual-license all of your personal contributions.'''  This does not have to be just public domain license (as you have done), but it can be with any other content license, including and not even limted to the Microsoft End-User Agreement License.  I'm not kidding here either.  That is your option on how you would like to see this used.  But it must be &quot;dual-licensed&quot; where one of the licenses that can be used for redistrubtion must include the GFDL.
*'''Create the content off-line first.'''  Doing this means that Wikibooks only has the latest version of whatever you were writing.  It kills the idea of collaborative writing, but even being a Wiki does not necessarily require that the content always be edited in such a manner.  You could write or create whatever you wanted either on a word-processor or on a version of MediaWiki running on your home computer.  When you think the content is &quot;ready for publication&quot; you can then post it on Wikibooks.  BTW, there are several software development groups that do exactly this with GPL'd computer software, where they always release their &quot;previous&quot; version under the GPL but they keep the most recent version for paying customers and a propritary license.  If somebody is adding new content to whatever document you have written in this manner, that would be considered a fork, and you would have to deal with the consequence of forking in a significant way.
*'''Move the content to a completely different Wiki.'''  I know this sounds harsh, but if you don't like the terms of the GFDL, perhaps Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects is not the place to publish it.  There are other Wikis that use licensing under very different terms, and it seems as though the [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] licenses are quite common, perhaps even more common than those with terms under the GFDL.  You might want to look at http://www.wikia.com/ for some other projects, some of which use the Creative Commons licensing.

All this said, perhaps it might be possible to try and create a Wikibook that uses a specific alternative license in a dual-licensing format (together with the GFDL).  There have been attempts to do that in the past, but the problem I see is one of legal enforcement.  Right now, the &quot;standard disclaimer&quot; on Wikibooks is that anything you add is licensed under the GFDL.  You could put some disclaimers on each page of the Wikibook that it is available under some alternative license, but the real question comes to if any contributions by those who don't want to have it available under those terms should be deleted, and what the status of multiple users doing this would be.  It really opens a Pandora's box of legal troubles that are better left alone, but if you want to '''be bold''' and see where that might lead, go ahead and try.   Just be aware that over the long term the content may simply revert to being just GFDL compatable if the other major contributors aren't as keen to keep the second license.  Those that want to ignore the GFDL will simply see the content deleted from Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:29, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''The House of Gaunt''''' is &quot;a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.&quot; The phrase is also used to refer to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|the shack in which the remaining members of the family lived]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], via the memories of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]], we visit the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|home of the Gaunt family]]. There, we learn that the House of Gaunt is a descendant family of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. Only three members of the Gaunt family are ever mentioned: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]], who apparently chooses to speak only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], the witch who will later become the mother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]]. We learn later that Morfin and Marvolo end up in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], Marvolo for six months, Morfin for three years, while Merope elopes to London with her potion-bedizened swain. Marvolo, after being released, never again speaks his daughter's name, and dies in the Gaunt shack shortly afterwards. Merope dies in childbirth a few months later. On his release, Morfin finds the house empty and Merope gone. Some twelve or so years later, Morfin is sent to Azkaban for the murder of three Muggles, a murder which was actually done by his nephew, Tom Marvolo Riddle.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We learn that the house of Gaunt also can claim descent from the Peverell family; one of the artifacts they have retained to show their antiquity turns out to be a ring containing a stone, the Resurrection Stone, originally owned by one of the three Peverell brothers of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|legend]].

With the death of Tom Marvolo Riddle at the end of the book, the House of Gaunt comes to an end.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

The inbreeding that comes from the &quot;habit of marrying their own cousins&quot; has left both Morfin and Merope quite profoundly ugly, with straggly hair and eyes that point in different directions. It seems also that Merope is quite weak magically.

The monumental amount of pride that the Gaunt family has in its heritage seems to have blinded it to all magical progress for an extended length of time. Anything that has happened has, of course, been tainted by contact with Muggles and is therefore unworthy. Marvolo, in particular, seems prepared to dismiss the entire magical governance structure because it does not accept his ancestry as somehow setting him above other wizards.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Because their pride requires them to dismiss anything having to do with Muggles, the Gaunt family lives a very isolated life, far away from other wizards. It would be safe to say that the Gaunt family as a whole would be happiest to be left entirely on its own.

== Analysis ==

It is interesting to note that the pride in ancestry that is held by Marvolo and Morfin finds an echo in Tom Marvolo Riddle, who has never met them and does not even know he is related to them for possibly the first fifteen years of his life. Even when he does meet Morfin, he does not speak with him long enough to get any real idea of what Morfin's beliefs are, or how closely they align with his own. It is probably safe to say that this belief in the power of ancestry is another family characteristic.

==Space Travel==

From the down of history our ancesotrs looked into the sky with envy toward the flying birds, when their wings spared majestically soaring over the sky.  Our curiosity made us wonder if one day not only we be master over our blue sky but also venture into the space.
  
On December 17,1903 a location by the name of Kitty Hwak Beach which is near Dayton, Ohio two brothers Wilbur and Orville  Wrights made it possible for humans to make the impossible possible.  Their first fly was lasted only &quot;59 second&quot; in an &quot;altitude of 852 feet.&quot;

In the 1910 not only Wright brothers established their first Air Comapny; they also opened their first Aviation School whom among their first students women were also being accepted to be trained as pilots.  Years later in 1915 NACA (National Assessment Committe in Aeronatuics ) was born which later is known today as NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).

This brought  Russians and Americans to a a very tight space race.  The Russicans Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man to travel behind our blue sky in 1961.  The first female astronaut was Valentina Tereskova also from Russia.

This incident made Americans more determined in their space race with Russians.  The world forogt about sleep on July 1969 because Apollo 11 entered the Moons' Orbit and with a Lunar Modules' landing on the surface of the Moon ;Neil Armstrong became the first American to walk on the Moon.

Now Russians have decided to bo back to Moon.  Therefor, Americans are back in the race again.  Except this time Americans would like to use the Moon as a base for flying into the unknowns.

An American Corporation  by the name of Reaction Engines Ltd has a design for an airship.  Skylon is &quot;82 meter long and has a wing span of 2 share hybird breathing rocket engines.  It uses liquid hydrogen.&quot;  This unmanned airship does not need any lunching pds and is reusable.  Pretty soon the &quot;expensive, unreliable, shaking, lunching pad&quot; shall be a thing of the past.  The company is considering building 30 of these airships for both commerical and militray use.

Now that we have solved our cargo problems lets sit back relax and enjoy the scenery.  One of the NASA's plans is a space elevator with the price tage of $10 billion dollars.  The base of this elevator shall be in deep Pacific Ocean.  And the other end will be connected to a platform in the space station.  it is been said that eventually this elevator shall be extended to the Moon which covers a distance of 64,000 miles rid with a long cable.  This elevator can carry both humans as well as carges into the Moon.

Our space travelers shall sit back, unwind, and enjoy a very smooth rid.  While you are in the elevator do not forget  to look back and see our beautiful blue planet.  The farther you go up the better  you can see the curvature of our Earth.  The more we go up the less visible is our blue world.  The change of view from beautiful blue to deep black shall make you speechless.  This magnificent rid up to the platform shall last only five hours.

NASA would like to use the Moon as a base for traveling to Mars and behind.  On the year 2015 the first American spaceship shall land on the surface of the Red  Planet.

Our closest star to the Sun is Proxima Centauri, which has the distance of 4.3 light years away( a light year is the distance light travels in one year which has the sped of 186,282 miles per second.)  Right now the best our astronauts can do is 25,000 per hour.  With this speed it shall  take our astronauts  to reach Proxima Centauri  about 100,000 lights years.

The Earth is no longer our only home and with the way our goverments are acting toward each other soon enough our civilization shall be destroyed.

Last year Dr. Stephen Hawking siad.:&quot;Humanity is doomed to extinction unless it finds another planet to live on.&quot;

The sentence 

:The first parser must fail before it consumes any input: we'll see later how to implement backtracking. 

is perhaps better phrased as:

:To be actually useful for parsing, the first parse must fail &quot;before&quot; it eats up the input which caused it to fail. Later in the course, we will see how to implement this behaviour using backtracking.

The &quot;must&quot; in the current sentence was confusing to me till I tried, failed --- &quot;wrong&quot; order of arguments to &lt;|&gt; --- and then succeeded at Exercise 2.

[[User:GPhilip|GPhilip]] ([[User talk:GPhilip|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GPhilip|contribs]]) 08:42, 16 February 2012 (UTC)

2) explicit sequencing with the &gt;&gt;= operator

How in the world are we supposed to do this exercise without any example of how to use &gt;&gt;=?

:Good point.  I suppose Johnathan believed that his explanations of what &gt;&gt;= does, combined with the Haskell report are enough.  Or maybe you're supposed to puzzle through it, and as a result of the struggle, you come out understanding &gt;&gt;= (and consequently monads) pretty well.  If that doesn't work, maybe [[Haskell/Understanding monads]] is what you want.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 04:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

It would be nice to have a solution to exercise 2) and 3). My solution was to change
&quot;x &lt;- many (noneOf &quot;\&quot;&quot;)&quot; to
&quot;x &lt;- many (parseEscapes)&quot;
and defining the function:
&lt;pre&gt;
parseEscapes :: Parser Char
parseEscapes = do char '\\'
                  oneOf &quot;\&quot;nrt\\&quot;
           &lt;|&gt; noneOf &quot;\&quot;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
I am, however, not sure if this works the right way.

:I believe there is a slight error in the tutorial at this point. In its current form, it the original parser with &quot;noneOf &quot;\&quot;&quot;&quot; matches &quot;hel\\lo&quot;, which it obviously shouldn't. I replaced the line with &quot;noneOf ...&quot; with &quot;x &lt;- many ((noneOf &quot;\\\&quot;&quot;) &lt;|&gt; ((char '\\') &gt;&gt; (oneOf &quot;\&quot;nrt\\&quot;)))&quot;, which I believe does the right thing.
Also, if you are testing your Parser, don't forget to escape the escape characters in the String, meaning that if you want to test if &quot;hel\nlo&quot; gets parsed, you should not write readExpr &quot;hel\nlo&quot;, because \n will be parsed by the noneOf part, but readExpr &quot;hel\\nlo&quot;.

== Learning means reading (and lots of it in this case) ==

From the point of view of a Haskell learner I agree with Kowey 100%.

I've been through the top 10 google results for monads in Haskell (incl. the wikibooks one with waste robots). I'm 1/2 done the [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.haskell.org%2Ftutorial%2F&amp;ei=kzw6RuboC4uajgH5oeyAAg&amp;usg=AFrqEzduVPKQT9G4matr4K8tWbEaj5KSpw&amp;sig2=OWtHgqLWwq9OwQ7tWN32mQ gentle tutorial] and am on Parsing in the scheme tutorial. The description of monads in this scheme tutorial is both concise and easy to understand for an OO/procedural guy. Though it's only one or two sentences it's fairly insightful.

#2 took me a few hours of reading and trying things out (ghc's errors are quite helpful!) to complete the exercise (rewrite parseNumber using do &amp; &gt;&gt;=), but in the end the experience was well worth it. I feel being thrown into the water like that made me understand monads more than anything else I have read so far. I couldn't have done it without the other reading. I had a basic understanding of monads but until using them the 3 different ways I did not see how all the various notations were related. It's surprisingly difficult to find a simple explanation of how you can convert code between the 3 forms (which I should remedy myself, I know '''update: [http://sami.samhuri.net/articles/2007/05/03/a-scheme-parser-in-haskell-part-1 best explanation I can muster right now]''').

I'm currently stuck trying to implement #4 R5RS number parsing (#o12345670, #xff, #d987) but I feel in the end when I finally read and experiment enough to figure it out I will have a better understand of something else in Haskell. It's not your average day or two tutorial* this one (not for the average guy like me!). But  that complements Haskell which is not your one or two day language, especially for us with little to no previous FP knowledge. Contrast that with moving from Ruby to Python or vice versa, which can be done in a matter of hours for just a basic understanding of the language's syntax and constructs. In procedural languages you really only need to learn syntax (which is often similar) and libraries, which are also somewhat similar.

I guess what I'm saying is that if you're not willing to make the effort to search google (at least) and read many Haskell docs to figure things out then you may want to postpone this tutorial for a little while. There are books on Haskell and imo books are better suited for that sort of initial hand-holding (I'm not too &quot;cool&quot; for books or hand-holding, I just can't afford any CS books right now). --[[User:Sjs|Sjs]] 20:17, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

(* Let me note that by one or two days I mean the amount of time one can spend on it in 1-2 days, e.g. a couple of hours a day. It'll take me a month or more to spend a full 48 hours on this! I don't know about anyone else.)

== Parser fails on booleans ==

If you feed #t or #f into readExpr it generates an error. parseSymbol should be handling these, but '#' was never put in &quot;symbols&quot; so it doesn't get that far.

The simple solution would be to change &quot;symbols&quot;. Alternatively, write a parseBool function and modify parseExpr accordingly (in which case parseSymbol can be simplified):

    parseSymbol :: Parser LispVal
    parseSymbol = do first &lt;- letter &lt;|&gt; symbol
    		 rest &lt;- many $ letter &lt;|&gt; digit &lt;|&gt; symbol
    		 return $ Symbol $ first:rest

    parseBool :: Parser LispVal
    parseBool = do s &lt;- string &quot;#t&quot; &lt;|&gt; string &quot;#f&quot;
    	       return $ case s of
    			  &quot;#t&quot; -&gt; Bool True
    			  &quot;#f&quot; -&gt; Bool False

    parseExpr :: Parser LispVal
    parseExpr = parseSymbol &lt;|&gt; parseString &lt;|&gt; parseNumber &lt;|&gt; parseBool

Unfortunately, I don't know whether either of those will break the code later, so I figure I'd better not change it myself yet. --[[User:Philh|Philh]] 11:16, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

:I've added it to symbols. It needs to be changed to implement hex, oct and bin numbers, but that's covered in the solution. --[[User:Philh|Philh]] 21:46, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

== Recognizing floating point numbers ==

I'm using the pdf version of this book, and as it stands datatypeparser.hs recognizes input such as 3.4 or 3.4.1 (i.e., both floating point input as well as illegal input with more than one decimal point). I'm unable to figure out which parser is currently recognizing these inputs. Has anyone else also faced a similar problem? (Monday, 14th July)

== Associativity of function application ==

Function application associates to the left, not the right:

&lt;code&gt;Prelude&gt; :t \x y z -&gt; x y z&lt;br&gt;
\x y z -&gt; x y z :: (t -&gt; t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; t -&gt; t1 -&gt; t2&lt;br&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t \x y z -&gt; (x y) z&lt;br&gt;
\x y z -&gt; (x y) z :: (t -&gt; t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; t -&gt; t1 -&gt; t2&lt;br&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t \x y z -&gt; x (y z)&lt;br&gt;
\x y z -&gt; x (y z) :: (t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; (t -&gt; t1) -&gt; t -&gt; t2 -- Different&lt;/code&gt;


== Debugging tactics ==

It's kind of hard to see the results of any code at the moment, as the &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; received by the &lt;code&gt;readExpr&lt;/code&gt; function in the case of a successful parse is a LispVal, and AFAICS it hasn't been explained yet how to coerce one of these 'algebraic data types' to a string yet.  So there's no way of knowing if your answer to exercise 2 is working, for instance.

Would it be correct to say that we have to write our own version of the show function to do this? This issue is exactly the reason I signed up for wikibooks and read this discussion....the output is too ambiguous. The last time this discussion was edited was February 2011, which makes me think that maybe some poor slob just starting to learn this stuff is going to have to be the one to fix the tutorial. ...d'oh!
--[[User:Waynr|Waynr]] ([[User talk:Waynr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Waynr|contribs]]) 04:10, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

== The parser fails in the following string &quot;\&quot;letters&quot; ==

I am trying to do exercise 2 from the Parsing section. Where the tutorial asks for extending the
parser to support strings that include &quot;\&quot;&quot;. I tried it but because I could not find the
solution I saw it from the answers. The answer I think is not completely correct
because if you give as input &quot;\&quot;letters&quot; the Scheme interpreter fails when
it shouldn't. And if you give &quot;letters\&quot;&quot; or &quot;lett\&quot;ers&quot; the interpreter succeeds as it should.
Is there any better answer?
Thanks

== Eval needed? ==

The second set of exercises specifies parsing the backquote.  However, the scheme standard indicates that expressions within the backquoted list that are preceded by comma must be evaluated before being added to the resulting list.  There is a similar rule for the '@' character, in this case the subsequent expression must evaluate to a list.  

So I guess my question is how is one supposed to implement backquote without evaluation?  Evaluation is in the next section.  

As far as the rest of the tutorial, I've found it to be very challenging!  One thing I spent entirely too much time on was the commandline syntax - simply calling the program with the correctly quoted arguments.  It took me a while to realize that in order to pass a quoted string to the program, I needed to do this at the bash prompt:

./scheme &quot;\&quot;test string\&quot;&quot;

As has been pointed out already, having a 'show LispVal' function early on would be very helpful to knowing whether the parser is working correctly or not.  I ended up writing one for that purpose.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

my russian is not that good, but I assume that you want to write a book about buddhism. This is perfectly alright, but keep in mind that this an english Wikibook-server. You should then write everything in english. There are also other servers:

Hi,

You are absolutely right. 
Will go ans check it out at the ru.wikibooks.org

All the previous discussions on this page dealt with an older version of this policy which has been completely replaced by the current text. Older discussions for this policy are still available in the history of this page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

&lt;!-- Post from here ---&gt;



==Majority, consensus and unanimity ==
The discussion here has shown that no-one wants a simple majority voting system for anything but the most basic market research issues such as BOTM. It has also shown that everyone understands that a single user who endlessly blocks a decision for malicious or wierd reasons should not be allowed to do so forever. Hence the term &quot;consensus&quot; has been bandied about as the solution to decision taking.

I agree that consensus is a good idea. However I am deeply opposed to gang rule. The idea that there will always be a group of Wikibookians who are reasonable and objective and who will coalesce to guide a decision to an appropriate conclusion is pure fiction. What actually happens is that a dialectic occurs in which chance remarks and objectionable style cause people to polarise into groups. Without any constitutional constraints the strongest group wins. Gang rule occurs. After the most powerful group has accomplished its polarised aims Festinger's Dissonance Theory applies and the winning group construes itself to be all sweetness, reason and light and incapable of anything but a justified decision.

The current guidelines attempt to avoid this problem by constitutionalising the process. All advanced organisations do this, it is only the most rabid dictatorships and transient anarchies such as the school playground and revolutionary groups that would ever contemplate operating without a constitutional method for decision taking. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

: No offense, but I'm not quite sure what the point of the above is.
: I for the most part liked you recent edits to the policy wording, but removed the bit about the majority rule in the third round. There was no consensus of this in the debate before the guideline went official (strictly speaking, you probably shouldn't have done any changes in wording before discussing it on the talk page .. but I won't fret over the ones I agree with &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt;).
: My concern over using the majority rule as a last vent rises from the fear that it will reduce the willingness of a majority for compromise. If all you have to do to get your way is wait till the third round, why should you even engage in dialogue. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 11:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

::The point of this section is that the word &quot;consensus&quot; is being bandied about without anyone being clear about what it means. In practice there are only majority votes (50%,60%, 100% or some other fraction) and imposed decisions. There is no magical &quot;consensus&quot; that can be used for decisions, the word &quot;consensus&quot; without qualification just covers bullying or use of power.

::There was no consensus that the wording should become an accepted guideline. 

::Yes, the majority could wait until the third round. Alternatively, with the version after your edit, the dissenters could just continue to dissent until they kill the decision making process. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:::Agree, This topic has recently been under [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=795341&amp;oldid=795191#.22Consensus.22 (19-20 March 2007) discussion]] on my talk page so I'm reactivating this topic. Consensus doesn't support ignoring objections and must be part of an open process. I'm still working on an essay on  [[User:Panic2k4/Decision_making_and_Community_consensus_on_Wikibooks|Decision making and Community consensus on Wikibooks]] that fully addresses the problems, I have found so far. I take the change to call attention to the [[Wikibooks_talk:Decision_making/Archive1#Hang_on_a_sec|Hang on a sec post on the archive]] to anyone discussing the proposed drafted text.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:26, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;a&quot; process ==

The process outlined is only one potential process for developing consensus. If it's &quot;the&quot; (only) process then we should have used it once or twice by now. (I couldn't find where we have.) &lt;strike&gt;RfD's&lt;/strike&gt; VfD's certainly don't follow the letter of that process and yet the &lt;strike&gt;RfD&lt;/strike&gt; VfD process isn't broken and I don't suggest changing it. Instead I suggest keeping that process as an example process but not a mandated one. I did this by changing the word &quot;the&quot; to &quot;a&quot; because I believe that this reflects the current practice of the guideline better. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:I think in the end it is simplistic to suggest that one decision making process for every aspect of Wikibooks (or other Wikis) is going to work.  In the end there will always be judgment calls to be made.  In theory (?!) admins are trusted to make these calls (or 'crats - there was an RfA on Commons that caused some stir recently) and everything is reversible (some bits are harder than others - removing sysop rights for instance).  While guidance is great &quot;rules&quot; can hamper things considerable (I'm quite good at following guidance, please don't ask me about rules!).
:An interesting aspect is the use of (and importantly the counting of) &quot;neutral&quot; votes.  I read quite a bit on quite a few Wikis.  I tend to vote &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; - however sometimes I vote &quot;neutral&quot;.  It is a conscious decision.  The answer on Commons (FWIW) is that they do not count but can be influential - probably a reasonable answer (IMO).  However it adds a dimension to the complexity of decision making --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with this change. Even if this is a policy or a guideline, we want wikibookians to be able to use their judgment with preference towards this method. Wikibookians are not robots, and we cant expect them to act in a single specific way in every situation. The main point of this page is that wikibooks is not strictly a democracy, and a majority should never be free to ignore and trample on a minority. This is not to say that a consensus cannot be achieved with outstanding objections, only that those objections need to be considered before rendering a verdict. Even on VfD, if everybody votes to delete a particular page, and one person votes to keep, we will frequently not delete that book so that the one dissenter can work to improve it. The process is not reversed however, we won't &quot;try&quot; deleting a book if only one person votes that way. The idea of this method is to preserve the status quo unless there is overwhelming opinion to make change. The burden always falls on those who want to change the status quo, which leads to an inherent unfairness in the system: People who want to make change need to do alot more work then those who want to oppose it. So long as these principles are held, i dont really care how wikibookians go about making decisions. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== No Outside Authority ==

I wanted to maybe add a note to this page about stewards and outside authority. I want to point out that there really isn't any outside appeals that can be made if a situation here is not handled satisfactorily. I am leaving this message in response to a message on the administrator's noticeboard that stewards are administrative only, and do not hold any particular authority to make decisions. I would also like to point out that the WMF board has taken a largely laissez-faire approach to the projects, which means that even if we send them a complaint, they are hihgly unlikely to get involved. Plus, for the board to get involved in a dispute here, they would open themselves up to getting dragged into disputes on many thousands of projects.

I think that there is some assumption that there really is a last-ditch external appeal that can be made in a dispute, but I want to make clear that this isn't the case. Wikibookians really need to be self-reliant, and we need to make our own decisions without being able to appeal to an external authority. In some cases it might be acceptable to bring in a neutral arbiter, but that's a topic that really can be left up to the disputants. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:05, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:I definitely agree that something like this should be mentioned in the policy. Previous situations have taken wrong turns on this assumption and we need to make it clear that the Wikibooks word is final. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:36, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

::Exactly, it's not really a change in our policy, it's mostly just a clarification of a point that we've been mistaken on in the past. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:03, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

Howabout text like this:
{{TextBox|The Wikibooks community is the final authority available, and once the community has made a decision, that decision is binding. Of course, any decision made is always amendable through the regular decision-making process. Wikibookians should never appeal a decision to an external group, such as the Wikimedia stewards or the Wikimedia Board of Trustees. Neither of these groups is likely to respond to such requests anyway. If all parties to a disagreement decide so it is possible to bring in an outside neutral arbiter to help reach a decision. However, such arbiters can only help to reach a conclusion, and cannot enforce a binding decision without consensus from the general Wikibooks community.}}
I know it's a little long-winded, but it really does cover all the points we need to make: The wikibooks community is the final authority on any issue, no decision is &quot;final&quot; and can always be revisted by the community, neutral third parties can be imported from outside the project to act as arbiters, and people outside wikibooks have no authority to make binding decisions concerning wikibooks. I do acquiesce that certain global decisions can be made by the board concerning all projects, but they aren't decisions on which Wikibooks is likely to have any control over, nor any input on anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:42, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:I strongly disagree that this is the case.  There is little reason to believe that the WMF or any other group (appointed or elected from a multi-project basis) would ever even listen to any arbitration decision without it having &quot;gone through the process&quot; of any local or individual project decision process.  This by itself should stop anybody from trying to &quot;appeal directly to the top&quot; for a decision before the rest of the community has had a chance to step in and voice their opinions on the topic.

:Still, such actions &quot;from the top&quot; have happened here on Wikibooks in the past, and often at times at odds with what most of the community wanted to see happen.  Content has been removed, substantial content, without so much as a VfD discussion reviewing the merits of that content.  And recently as well, by people who weren't even regular Wikibooks administrators.  There may have been very good reasons for doing that, but the point is that there is a &quot;higher authority&quot; in action here, even if you don't want to acknowledge it.  Writing a policy that denies the existance of this &quot;higher authority&quot; is going to be a great disservice to new Wikibookians who read this policy, only to discover that another reality actualy exists.

:I do disagree that the WMF board won't listen to legitimate cries of intervention for gross cases of abuse.  They have done so in the past, and I have no reason to believe that they won't in the future.  That they choose (wisely, I might add) to not get involved with the situation started by the dispute with Panic is besides the point.  If you compare this to the U.S. Supreme Court (one I'm a little familiar with), they get thousands of appeal requests each year.  They only &quot;hear&quot; about 30-40 cases, and even then don't necessarily make a final decision on all of them.  Quite often, they remand them to a lower jurisdiction with only a comment about one or two fine points of law for that court to consider.  A meta-arbitration board certainly could do just this sort of activity if it is ever set up.

:Indeed, I would point out that some of the problems that came up with Jimbo's intervention on Wikibooks in the past was precisely because a few individuals did &quot;appeal&quot; directly to the top (Jimbo) and demand some sort of action to happen immediately.  Without any sort of community input first.  That is not what I'm talking about.

:Ultimately, authority to act as an administrator, bureaucrat, steward, or any other &quot;leadership&quot; position has its authority derived from the WMF board of trustees.  Legitimacy comes from the user community, but the real power is the one who controls the ability to pull the plug from the servers we are using.  That is the WMF board.  Any fanciful policy statement to the contrary is not going to change that fact, unless we become completely independent of the WMF board.  And even then it is still something that is up to whomever has the ability to physically operate the hardware (at least directly paying the bills for the hardware and is legally responsible for it) that can force the decisions to be made.  

:Basically, not only do I disagree that this ammendment to the decision making policy should be made, I don't think legitimately there is even grounds to suggest such a policy in the first place.  Decisions by a group of administrators is not the final &quot;court of appeal&quot; on this or any other Wikimedia project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:02, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::Rob, I think you're really splitting hairs here and are missing the point of this proposed change. Nobody really cares who has the power to &quot;pull the plug&quot;, it is out of our hands, but it's also out of our minds. We don't discuss closing wikibooks down here, and so it doesnt matter under whose authority such a thing could happen. What I'm looking to do with the amendment is to prevent people from looking beyond wikibooks to seek solutions. We have all the mechanisms here for resolving disputes, making decisions, and collaborating together. There is no need to try and go beyond the system, and so we should take steps to discourage attempts to do that. The WMF board has said on numerous occasions that it wouldn't get involved in community disputes. Hell, the WMF refuses to even play a helpful role in the selection of a new logo for this project. 
:Second, the kinds of &quot;from the top&quot; actions that you are discussing happened long in the past and are unlikely to happen again. However, we can take rudimentary steps to prevent it by making policy that states that the wikibooks community has final authority around here. Jimbo doesnt play the role that he once did in the WMF, and none of the current board members are interested in taking the kind of proactive stance that Jimbo took with the projects. The fact is, and something that you need to accept, is that the kinds of things that you're worried about simply arent an issue here anymore. We dont have to worry about the radical power abuses that happen on some of the smaller projects, and we dont have to worry about heavenly intercessions from the board into our daily affairs. The buck, for all intents and purposes starts and stops here with the wikibooks community, and I can't see a reasonable situation where outside assistance would either be asked for legitimately (as the decision making process is pretty comprehensive) or given (as the board is unlikely to intevene in any case). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:26, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:::This is not where I'm living in the past, as you seem to be implying, but facing a reality here.  The WMF board of trustees really does have the ultimate authority, and I think it is wise to note that.  And they have acted in the past, and have not made any statement showing they won't act in the future.  Indeed, some significant policy decisions (this is policy admittedly) have been made even over this past year which has had perhaps even a modest impact on Wikibook.  And while it may be buried under a pile of more mundane day to day administrator actions, there have been actions by board members and stewards here on Wikibooks that involved both content and user accounts over this past year that could have gone through the community decision processes (aka the VfD page and similar community forii) but weren't.  This is my point, that appeals have been made and decisions reached that did not involve the Wikibooks community, because this isn't the ultimate authority.  That I happen to agree with the actions performed by these individuals is one reason I haven't raised a stink about it on community pages... or at least haven't tried to reverse the actions myself.  I'm not talking the distant past or something that happened two or three years ago.  I also haven't seen any formal policy pronoucement on the part of the WMF board to suggest anything has really changed, other than perhaps the WMF board trusts the en.wikibooks community to more or less take care of itself at the moment, and are generally pleased with what policies we have come up with on our own.  But that is not the same as suggesting &quot;we&quot; have the ultimate authority and there is no room for appeal.

:::In addition, I find it somewhat comforting to know there are avenues of appeal in the case of abuse.  Even if it is a seldom used option and something that would only be of value in cases of blatant abuse of authority.  At the very least, having avenues of appeal on decisions like a user block would be useful if only to acknowledge that sometimes people do make mistakes, and are very human in their actions with personal prejudice and pride.  I would hope that no one individual (including myself) would have ultimate supreme authority on any matter, and that actions could be reversed.  To acknowledge that the WMF board is very unlikely to get involved in all but the most blatant abuses of authority may be true, but I still think it is reasonable to mention the possibility.  Meta Arbitration Committees have been mentioned in the past on Foundation-l as well, and this is something that may happen in the future.

:::I should note here that this is a difference in opinion, however, and I do understand more or less what you are trying to get at Whiteknight.  Authority of action, however, is the issue here, and I am suggesting that the authority is from the WMF board, not the &quot;community&quot; of generally active Wikibooks users.  Ultimately, there is &quot;outside authority&quot; that is superior to any decision reached by the Wikibooks community, and that authority shouldn't be ignored or dismissed.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:19, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::::I didn't mean any offense by my &quot;living in the past&quot; comment, I only was trying to point out that the kinds of things you seem to be worrying about don't pose a present danger to our community. I would be interested to see what kinds of steward actions in the recent past you are talking about. There were a handful of times in the past year or so when my internet connection was unreliable, but I was able to contact stewards to act on my behalf via IRC. It is a frustrating situation when I can watch a vandal operate on the RC feed, but can't log on to the website to do anything about it!
::::If a person is blocked unfairly, they can always appeal the situation to the community. In that way, all admins are kept in check, because if one admin is blocking improperly, other admins will come in and correct that. The flip side of the coin is where the community as a whole does something that is deemed to be &quot;unfair&quot;, but I would tend to say that a &quot;I'm right and everybody else is wrong&quot; situation is just an error of perception from the &quot;victim&quot;. I would really like to see the steward or board member with large enough cajones to come in here and say &quot;the entire community is wrong on this issue, and i'm going to unilaterally correct it&quot;. I don't feel like such a situation would end well, and it would be in our best interests not to even leave that option available. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:24, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

It may be part of the request to ask the arbiter(s) to reach a conclusion and it should be up for the community to validate the proceeding and determine that the conclusion is enforcible if not in opposition to an existing policy, this will reduce the noise level and void processes, as to save all parties time and provide a quicker resolution.
As an apart, I consider stewards and even the Wikimedia Board of Trustees members of the Wikibooks community. I understand what the text is attempting to avoid but I think that the idea is not expressed correctly.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:57, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:I changed a sentence to sound better, but I don't think the message is any different. Also, if you or anyone else wish to extract the idea that Stewards, Trustees, etc. are Wikibooks community members, then the above text needs to change to something like &quot;established Wikibooks editors&quot; or something similar. There's no way I would support this text if people try to find loopholes or other interpretation issues like how &quot;everyone is a part of the community&quot;. I don't think that view is correct in the first place, but if others do believe such things then it needs to get cut or re-worded. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:40, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::Did small correction on the wording and removed duplication of meanings. As for the definition of the Wikibooks community, I don't like your idea to reduce it only to &quot;established Wikibooks editors&quot; that is also a minority group of Wikibookians, you must keep in mind that to be able to express an opinion and participate on a decission one must only register an account (at least for now). As for the stewards and other &quot;top echelons&quot;, they fall outside of the need to register as they by default can act and even in cases change or drastically alter, decide or affect decisions or actions taken here. I would agree that most would abstain to participate in minor local discussions but probably would be willing and mostly welcomed and useful to more complex issues. I prefer inclusion to exclusion and think that this view is beneficial to the project...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:24, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:::I meant to suggest some words that would limit the definition of community to members that are here at the project and did not mean that the editors needed to be experienced. The term &quot;established&quot; defines that they have a presence here only. It only takes an account creation to establish one's self here. If a Steward starts to do anything here then yes they are a Wikibooks community member, but they are no longer any more important than another user really and shouldn't be considered a path to further appeal. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:10, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::::Agreed. I don't think &quot;appealing&quot; should be in this (or any) policy at all. Nor anything about eschelons, really. Nor criteria for what makes a contributor &quot;established&quot;. Stewards, foundation members, admins, longtime users and new contributors should all simply be treated as ''interested participants'', and their views weighed according to the strength of their arguments. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:55, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

My 2 cents worth:

{{TextBox|Once a community decision is reached, that decision is binding until reversed by the same process. Active participants may bring in outside arbiters to a disagreement if such is clearly decided by mutual agreement. However, such arbiters can only help to reach a conclusion, and cannot enforce a binding decision without consensus from the general Wikibooks community.}}

I reworded it some, since participants through mutual agreement can ask anyone from the outside to be arbiters, just nobody is obligated to do so, which I believe was the issue that was being brought up in regards to stewards and the board of trustees. I believe saying &quot;don't do this&quot; in this case is a bit too instructional and may only encourage people to do it. I believe &quot;binding until reversed by the same process&quot; is enough, anything else is outside Wikibooks' control.

That said I see a few problems with any suggested changes so far that isn't addressed and admittedly I'm not sure yet how to address it. I don't believe a decision made by a single lone contributor should be considered binding nor should a decision be considered binding if there is nobody around to care. Under any of the proposed changes, for example someone could start a book and could retain &quot;control&quot; over a book through scaring potential participants away who disagree with there POV, because there decision would be considered binding. This would encourage book &quot;ownership&quot; rather then cooperation. Also since this doesn't address abandoned book it seems to imply any decision made would be binding even on abandon books, so someone who wants to adopt a book would under this proposed change, it would seem be required to follow any previous decisions since there would be no active contributors to discuss it with in order to reverse a previous decision. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:14, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:Well, how do we make the point that people shouldn't go &quot;crying to mommy&quot; at meta or foundation-l every time they don't get their way? My biggest point with even bringing up this whole issue is that people should not be looking outside Wikibooks for solutions, when all the solutions or the mechanisms to derive solutions all all available here on Wikibooks already. We have a decision-making process that does not have a finite end point ''on purpose'', it's a process that is never considered &quot;finished&quot; or &quot;final&quot; in any respect. To that effect, because no decision is ever final, you can't leave the system to find a better resolution, you are forced to work in the system and with the system to improve things for everybody. 
:To address your concern as well, a single contributor is never really considered &quot;the community&quot;. But then again, if only one person votes on an issue, the result will always be 100% in favor of that person's opinion. It's only when other people get involved in a discussion do other possibilities emerge. Also, we are not likely to suffer trolls or control freaks very well, and if we find people who are chasing off new users, we will act as a community to stop that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:58, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Step Mash */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Mashing is the process of immersing the milled barley (grist) in water so as to convert the starch in the ground up endosperm into smaller sugars. The resulting liquor is called wort. When you brew from extract, you are using a concentrated form of wort, much like using frozen orange juice to make orange juice.

The goal of mashing or dilluting an extract, to create wort, is to provide an environment in which yeast will thrive. Sugars in the milled barley are in long chains, which are unfermentable. The mash process allows you to extract fermentable sugars from the grist, or milled grains, by dissolving starches and then breaking the starch chains up using enzymes developed in the malting stage.

The processes described here will work well in any of the mash tuns described in the equipment section.

== What Happens? ==
{|align=right bgcolor=#dddddd
|[[image:Starch-breakdown-sites.jpg|thumb|300px| Cartoon showing starch breakdown sites]]

|}
Conversion of barley starch into sugars is primarily the result of two types of enzymes - alpha amylase and beta amylase. Both enzymes break the chains of glucose which form starch at alpha 1,4 linkages. Alpha amylase breaks these bonds at random points in the starch chain. In contrast, beta amylase acts on the bond between the last 2 and 3 glucose residues in the starch chain, releasing the disacharide sugar maltose.

It may help to imagine alpha amylase as an enzyme that breaks chains in half, while beta enzymes merely nibble at the ends. Alpha enzymes will quickly turn starch chains into fermentable sugars, whereas beta enzymes, given the same amount of time to work, will leave a lot more of the longer, unfermentable chains. The more of the longer chains left in the wort, the thicker or fuller the final beer will feel when consumed. However, with more of the smaller chains, or fermentable sugars, the beer will turn out with a higher alcohol content. The relative effect of each of these enzymes is determined by the temperature - alpha amylase has an optimum temperature of 68 degrees C, while beta amylase has an optimum of 65 degrees. 


'''The following seems unneeded in a homebrewer's guide, but I could not bring myself to delete it. Perhaps this information could be rewritten to have more value to a reader just wanting to brew beer'''

''Limit dextrins are non-fermentable sugars which are produced from the parts of the starch molecule which are branched (ie contain alpha 1,6 linkages). The enzyme which removes the alpha 1,6 branch (in the branched small sugars, not the original starch) is called limit dextrinase, and is destroyed by the high temperatures of mashing (typically 65 degrees C or more), although it is active at lower temperatures. The limit gravity, or residual sugar present after complete fermentation, is in part determined by these limit dextrins. Brewers can control the limit gravity by:''

* ''minimising the time that the mash is at the temperature at which beta amylase is active, as this will convert larger limit dextrins into smaller ones''
* ''adding adjuncts with varying degrees of branching in their starch chains.''
* ''minimising the time the mash is at lower temperatures where limit dextrinase is active (eg protein rest)''

''Additional processes that can occur during mashing are''

* ''proteolysis (if there is a protein rest stage at 50 degrees C)''
* ''destruction of the beta glucan layer which protects the starch granules''
* ''colour is extracted from the malt''


==Mashing systems (techniques)==
There are various mashing techniques and the choice of technique is linkd to the equipment available, the level of expertise, the beer style produced, the level of process control and the number of brews to be produced per day.


=== Iso-thermal Infusion Mash ===
The iso-thermal infusion mash is the simplest way to make wort, however, since the technique lacks a protein rest, it is recommended that you use mostly well modified malts. The infusion mash is also referred to as the one-step mash, since the process requires only one step.

Iso-thermal obviously refers to the single mash temperature. In this system mash conversion (the malt starch is converted to sugars) takes place in the same vessel as wort separation. As there are no heating stages it is not necessary to have an agitation in the mash tun.

The ideal situation you want is to attain is one in which your mash ''rests'' at a temperature between 66° and 70° C (150°-158° F) to allow the amylase enzymes to do their work. The colder the rest, the more fermentable sugars will be available for fermenting, and therefore the higher alcohol content in the final beer. The hotter the temperature, the more unfermentable sugars will reach fermentation, and thus the fuller the mouth-feel. This is, of course a comparison of otherwise duplicate mashes. Remember, the enzymes ''will'' work outside their optimum temperatures, so given an adequate amount of time, all starches can be converted to fermentables.

For an infusion mash, mix a measured amount of hot water in a container with your grist (milled malt) and allow the mash to rest for 30 to 60 minutes. For every pound of grain, you will use 1 quart of water. At this ratio, the mash will stabilize at a temperature 9°-10° C (16°-18°F) lower than the temperature water added. For example, adding 10 quarts of water at a temperature of 78°C (172°F) to 10 lbs of grist will stabalize at a temperature of 68°-69°C (154°-156°F). You will be well served to take temperature readings at regular intervals to make sure you are maintaining the optimal temperature range. Adding small amounts of hot water to bring the temperature back up is permitable, however avoid bringing the temperature too high as the higher temperatures will negatively affect enzymatic activity, just as much as too low.

=== Decoction Mash ===
Decoction mash is the most complex technique used to extract sugars from grain. The technique was born out of the lack of accurate temperature measurements, with the only accurate points of measurement being freezing point of water (0° C or 32° F), blood temperature (~36°C or 98°F), and the boiling point of water (100°C or 212°F). This method also is believed to result in better yield. However, because of the complexity, and the unlikelihood of a homebrewer choosing to use decoction, detailed instructions will not be given here at this time.

The basic method begins by infusing a measured amount of boiling water with water and grist at blood temperature to bring the mash up to the initial rest temperature. This initial rest can be an acid rest, or the mash could begin with a protein rest. Near the end of this rest a measured amount of water and grist is stolen from the mash, heated to a boil, and then returned to the main mash to bring the temperature up to the next temperature rest. This process is called decoction. Sometimes, when an extended rest time is expected, the mash is decocted again, or even a few more times to maintain rest temperature.

=== Step Mash ===
If you are planning to use undermodified malts, or just simply want a better quality product, the Step Mash (or Program mash or Temperature-Controlled Step Infusion Mash), is only slightly more complicated than iso-thermal mashing. There can be two or three steps, or rests, in your mash. 

* '''Proteolytic stand''' Mashing takes place to achieve a strike temperature of about 50°C (122°F) and held there for roughly a half hour for the protein rest. 
* '''Saccharification stand''' The mash is brought to 63°- 65°C (150°-158°F),(20 to 60 minutes depending on the required fermentability of the wort) for the beta-amylase to produce the fermentable maltose sugars for another half hour. 
* '''Conversion stand''' The mash is raised to 71 - 72°C (about 20 minutes) for the alpha amylase to break down any large starch particles and to achieve starch conversion. The end of this stand is confirmed with the starch test - see below.
* '''Mash out stand''' the mash is finally raised to 76°C for 5 minutes to denature all mashing enzymes.

In practice, for every pound of grist in the mash, you will use 1 liter (1 qt) of water at 54°C (130°F) to get the mash to the initial protein rest. Then, for each pound of grist, you will use .5 liter (½ qt) of 93°C (200°F) water to raise the temperature 10°C (18°F). These are rough figures, since the more water added, the larger the volume, and therefore the more water required to raise the temperature a comparable amount. However, if you use these figures to figure the amounts needed, you will be pretty well off.

== End of mashing ==
Mashing usually takes about 30 minutes with a typical pale malt - however times may be more or less depending on the enzymatic activity (diastatic) power of the malt. 

To test for mash conversion we test for the presence of starch: this can be done by mixing 1g of Lite salt (potassium iodide) with 50 ml 3% iodine solution and adding a drop to a sample (a teaspoon full) of the mash. If it turns deep blue starch is present. 
===Unconverted mash===
If you continue to get starch, even hours after mashing, then the milling of the grain may be at fault in that the starch isn't being broken up enough to allow the enzymes to access it. High mash temperatures may have de-natured the malt enzymes. 

==Special mashing techniques==

===Grain steeping===
The most basic way to extract flavors from specialty grains is by steeping them in warm water.

The simplest way to perform this is to add the crushed grains (in a nylon or cotton grain bag) to the (cold) brewing water as is it brought to boiling temperature.  The grains should be removed before the temperature reaches 170°F to prevent the extraction of too many tannins.  Dip the bag in and out a few times and let it drip for about 15 seconds before discarding. Do not squeeze the bag. Squeezing will also extract too much tannin from the grain husks.

Alternatively, the crushed grains are steeped in 2-3 gallons of 150°F water for 30 minutes before being removed from the wort.  This allows for a more complete extraction.

===Partial mash===
Not much more difficult than steeping is the &quot;Partial mash&quot; or &quot;Mini-Mash&quot; procedure, which utilizes emzymatic malts in addition to the specially grains and will result in a much better extraction of flavors and colors.

Start by setting your oven to the &quot;warm&quot; (or lowest) setting.  We are looking to a achieve a temperature of between 140 and 160°F.  If the temperature of your oven is higher than 160°F at this setting, simply turn off the oven before placing the mash pot inside.  The thermal mass of the hot grains and water should maintain a proper temperature during mashing.

Heat between 1 and 3 quarts of water per pound of crushed grain that will be used to a light boil.  Remove from the heat, allow to cool to 160-170°F, and transfer to your mash vessel and mix in the crushed grains.  Mix thoroughly to be sure that the grains are not clumped then place the mash vessel in the oven for 45 to 60 minutes.  Do not open the oven door while mashing is in progress or a significant amount of heat will escape.  Do not let the mash temperature fall below 145°F.  An oven themometer with a probe will allow you to monitor the temperature, although this is usually not necessary.

While the mashing is taking place, heat an additional 1 to 3 quarts of water per pound of crushed grain (roughly the same amount you used for mashing) to a light boil, remove from the heat, and allow to cool to 140-170°F.  This will be your sparge water.

Once the mashing process is complete strain the mash into your brew pot using a stainless steel colander (pasta strainer).  Then, slowly and evenly pour the sparge water over the mash.  The mash is now complete.

&quot;&quot;Add an amount water necessary to your brew pot to get up to the volume of water you traditionally use for your extract brewing.&quot;&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nobody can exactly forecast the future. There is a whole part of literature, the utopian literature, which is today called ''' Science fiction '''. This kind of fiction deals with the possible future of mankind and the extraterrestial life in space. Famous example of this literature are Thomas More's book ''Utopia'', Swift's book ''Gulliver's Travels'', the books of Jules Verne, the book ''Brave New World'', the book ''1984'', the books of S. Lem and many more. In these books one can find many predictions of possible technical and social developments. The above books are quite exciting, and still worth reading.

A branch of science tries to forecast the future. It is called ''' futurology '''.  This science has developed methods to determine future developments. One of these methods, for example, includes the Delphi survey. A group of experts in their field are asked to estimate the most important changes to come. The result is statistically evaluated.  For instance, nuclear physicists can be asked when they expect the technical completion of a fusion reactor.     

Some statements about the future are no doubt from a scientific point of view. They are described below.

==The future of life on earth==    

The future of life is not predetermined. It does not have ''' a goal ''', even if it develops according to the rules of the evolution. The further biological development is open. It is ruled by randomness and biological needs at the same time and it is only partly foreseeable. Randomness is the basis of genetic mutations and variation, whereas the selection process is not random but governed by environmental conditions. Increasingly human technology alters and accelerates this biological evolution by breeding and genetic engineering, so that the natural development is strongly overlaid already today by the human influence.     

The end of life in the scientific view of the world is rather clear. This future may appear a little sad, because it does not offer any paradise. It confronts us with the fact of own death, the death of mankind and the death of life on earth. This future is from today's viewpoint unalterable. Perhaps later generations may find means and ways, to overcome these limits.     

The following hard rules about future are valid in the scientific conception of the world:     
*Each human being is mortal. Its active mental life is mortal too and his mind will die latest with the death of its body.    
*It is also sure, that life on earth will end at the latest when our sun will be blowing up to a red giant through exhaustion of its energy reserves.
*Mankind will become extinct once.  Except mankind will become independent of the sun.    

This all has a positive aspect:  Humans do not need to fear of making everything wrong.  
At the same time it has also a negative aspect: No matter how we strive, the end of the earth will come once.    

==The future of inanimate nature==    
There is a law of thermodynamics, which says that all structures tend toward more disorder. Another law of astronomy says that the world started with the Big Bang is expanding.    

If these two laws possess universal validity, then the universe is an increasingly empty space and it will end in a physical heat death.  

However, some structures like our sun will stay quite stable over billions of years, an extremely long time from a human perspective.

You may be interested in [[WB:RFP|Thenub's request for checkuser permissions]]. Regards [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:02, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 Proposal :Accelerating Wikibooks. Help Needed! ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 07:44, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

You are listed in [[Japanese/Introduction/About]] as an editor of the work, the page is under a copyvio that was a response to the RfD based on the same issue, since the discussion is going for a long time, because of that I will not attempt to contact you by mail. I will close it as a copyvio. You can probably requests and perform a undeletion at a later date if you missed the issue and see the page as useful for your work (I will support the undeletion on that basis).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:05, 2 November 2011 (UTC)

== Question ==

Hello Swift, you've been quite inactive recently (no edits for six months and no use of the sysop rights for a year). Do you plan on resuming activity here? I'm only asking because historically we'd usually start an RFP to remove the sysop bit at this point. If you plan on coming back in the coming months then there'd be no point in kicking it off - hence my question. Please let me know, thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 2 March 2012 (UTC)
:The RFP is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Swift_.28discuss.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.C2.A0.C2.B7_count.C2.A0.C2.B7_logs.C2.A0.C2.B7_block.C2.A0log.C2.A0.C2.B7_rfps.C2.A0.C2.B7_rights_.5Bchange.5D.29_.28Administrator.29 here], if you intend to become active again in the coming months please let us know at the RFP page - thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:56, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

== De-sysop ==

Hello Swift, your admin / sysop bit has been removed following the RFP. If you ever return and want it back then please let us know as I'm sure everyone would welcome you back. Kind regards, &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:22, 11 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

== &quot;Contents Tab&quot; ==

Hey Brenda!

When you say &quot;Contents Tab&quot;, do you mean the automatic table of contents for the page? The automatic table of contents appears when you have at least 4 headings on the page, and the [[Talk:Human Physiology/Integumentary System|discussion page]] only has 3. However, you can manually insert the TOC whereever you want it to be by using the &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. I have already put that tag at the top of the discussion page for you.

I hope this is right, let me know if you need anything else. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:54, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

Perfect thanks Kight --[[User:BrendaJohnson|BrendaJohnson]] 18:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

==1. Define Geocaching.==
Geocaching is an entertaining outdoor adventure game for GPS users. Participating in a cache hunt is a good way to take advantage of the wonderful features and capability of a GPS unit. The basic idea is to have individuals and organizations set up caches all over the world and share the locations of these caches on the Internet. GPS users can then use the location coordinates to find the caches. Once found, a cache may provide the visitor with a wide variety of rewards. All the visitor is asked to do is if they get something they should try to leave something for the cache.

==2. What is a GPS receiver?==
A GPS unit is an electronic device that can determine your approximate location (within around 6-20 feet) on the planet. Coordinates are normally given in Longitude and Latitude. You can use the unit to navigate from your current location to another location. Some units have their own maps, built-in electronic compasses, voice navigation, depending on the complexity of the device.

You don't need to know all the technical mumbo jumbo about GPS units to play Geocaching. All you need to do is be able to enter what is called a &quot;waypoint&quot; where the geocache is hidden.

It's also good to know that the GPS units built for turn-by-turn car navigation will sometimes have undesirable features.  One such feature is that it might &quot;snap&quot; you onto a road.  The GPS knows you are close to a road, but not on the road, but will assume that &quot;since you're in a car&quot; its coordinates are incorrect.  So it will display your position on the road in stead of off it.  If you can turn this feature off, you will have greater success.  Third party software is available for some GPS receivers to defeat this feature.  Consider using it, but understand that you are taking a risk when you do so.

Another feature of these in-car devices is that if your speed drops below a certain set point (such as 1.5 MPH), it will quit updating your position until your speed increases above that set-point again, or it notices you have moved some distance (such as 50 feet).  This feature prevents the GPS from &quot;bouncing around&quot; when a driver is stopped at a traffic light, but it is quite maddening for a cacher (just as you get close to the cache and slow down, it quits updating).  If you can turn this feature off, do so.  As with the &quot;snap-to-road&quot; feature, third party software is sometimes available to defeat this as well.  Use it with caution.

==3. Demonstrate 2 ways of finding the location of a Geocache in your area on the Geocache website.==
Have the student look on the website, [http://www.geocaching.com www.geocaching.com]. This is a family-friendly, kid-friendly website. Two methods of finding a location are:
* From the Main Page at the top drop-down menu, click on &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK A CACHE&quot;. Then enter a zip code in the &quot;By Postal Code&quot; box.
* From the Main Page on the top drop-down menu, click on &quot;Hide and Seek a Cache&quot; then enter an address in the &quot;Address&quot; box.
* From the Main Page at the top drop-down menu, click on &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK A CACHE&quot;. Then choose a state in the &quot;By State&quot; box.

==4. Demonstrate entering the latitude and longitude coordinates into the GPS to find a Geocache in your area.==
Each GPS is a little different, so have the student enter coordinates in the GPS units that are available. Ask around, there may be several people in your club or church willing to show the Pathfinders how to use their particular unit.

==5. Define the following terms:==
;Traditional cache: This is the original cache type consisting, at a bare minimum, a container and a logbook. Normally you'll find a Tupperware container, ammo box, or bucket filled with goodies. The coordinates listed on the traditional cache page is the exact location for the cache. The general rule of thumb is, &quot;If you take an item, leave an item of equal or greater value, and write in the logbook.&quot; Some caches are themed, so make sure to read the description before going on a hunt.
;Micro-cache: This is a traditional cache in a tiny container holding usually nothing more than a small roll of paper and pencil on which to record your visit; and you may need to bring your own pencil

;Virtual cache: This is not a physical cache, but rather a place of usually historical or local interest; that is, a commemorative plaque, sign, object, or building.  Virtual caches are grandfathered on Geocaching.com.  New virtual caches are now accepted only on [http://www.waymarking.com waymarking.com].
;Multi-level cache: This is a cache with more than one location; frequently the Geocacher must find the clues to the second cache in the first cache and so on.
;Travel bug: This is any object tagged with an identification tag that wants to travel to a specific location or accomplish specific tasks, for example, to get to a geocache at Mt. Rushmore or to attend a baseball game in every state. Look on the Geocache website Travel Bug page for more information.
;Geomuggle/muggle: This refers to a non-geocacher.  Usually this term is used after a non-geocacher looks puzzled at a geocacher making circles with their GPS receiver, or when a non-geocacher accidentally finds a cache.  Muggles are mostly harmless but try to not let them know the location of the cache because it may increase the chances of the cache going missing.

==6. What items may be left in a geocache? Which items may not?==
===What is usually in a cache?===
A cache can come in many forms but the first item should always be the logbook. In its simplest form a cache can be just a logbook and nothing else. The logbook contains information from the founder of the cache and notes from the cache's visitors. The logbook can contain much valuable, rewarding, and entertaining information. A logbook might contain information about nearby attractions, coordinates to other unpublished caches, and even jokes written by visitors. If you get some information from a logbook you should give some back. At the very least you can leave the date and time you visited the cache.
Larger caches may consist of a waterproof plastic bucket placed tastefully within the local terrain. The bucket will contain the logbook and any number of more or less valuable items. These items turn the cache into a true treasure hunt. You never know what the founder or other visitors of the cache may have left there for you to enjoy. Remember, if you take something, it’s only fair for you to leave something in return. Items in a bucket cache could be: Maps, books, software, hardware, CD's, videos, pictures, money, tickets, antiques, tools, games, etc. It is recommended that items in a bucket cache be individually packaged in a clear zipped plastic bag to protect them.

===What shouldn't be in a cache?===

Use your common sense in most cases. Explosives, ammo, knives, drugs, and alcohol shouldn't be placed in a cache. Respect the local laws. All ages of people hide and seek caches, so use some thought before placing an item into a cache.
Food items are ALWAYS a BAD IDEA. Animals have better noses than humans, and in some cases caches have been chewed through and destroyed because of food items in a cache. Please do not put food in a cache.

==7. Know and practice good Travel Bug Etiquette==
Use the Golden Rule when you find a Travel Bug. Most owners would rather see their travel bugs do a lot of traveling, so try not to hold on to a travel bug for too long. If you plan on holding onto the bug for more than 2 weeks, make sure to send a courtesy email to the owner letting them know.

==8. What is meant by Cache In, Trash Out?==
An activity held sacred by Pathfinders everywhere, Trash Out simply means to take along a plastic trash bag while hunting Geocaches and picking up trash on the way.

==9. Find 3 Geocaches in your area, at least one of which must be a regular (traditional) cache.==
Comply with local laws, use common sense with regards to safety, take along something to trade, and have fun.

NOTE to Instructors:  The new &quot;challenges&quot; listed on Geocaching.com do NOT count as cache finds according to Geocaching.com and thus would NOT count toward fulfillment of this requirement.

==10. Write about your geocache find in your logbook on the geocache website.==
From the Main Page of www.geocaching.com at the top right, click on “Create a Membership!”, for a free account choose “Get a Basic Membership”. This is a family friendly, kid safe web site. No personal information is available from this site. Emails are safe and password protected through this system. When you are a member you can post into the logbooks your cache finds.

Note to instructors:  Notice that these requirements do leave the opportunity for a GROUP to go find a cache and use a pre-existing Geocaching account to write the log on the geocache website.  Each individual Pathfinder does NOT need to write a log.  No &quot;register for a free Geocaching.com account&quot; requirement until the Advanced honor.

==11. Discuss Matthew 6:19-21 and Jeremiah 29:13 and compare them to geocaching.==
{{Bible verse
|book=Matthew
|chapter=6
|verse=19-21
|version=KJV
|text=
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through not steal, for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
}}
Sometimes geocaches succumb to the elements.  The containers can get broken, or the cache could be found by someone who doesn't know what it is, and they throw it away or destroy it.  Sometimes the log in the cache is too soaked to sign.  When you find one of these, it would be good to think of this verse.  We can depend on our treasure in heaven!

{{Bible verse
|book=Jeremiah
|chapter=29
|verse =13
|version=KJV
|text=
And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
}}
I have visited some caches several times before finally finding it.  Sometimes the cache owner can be exceedingly clever and hide a cache in plain sight.  It is possible to look right at it and not recognize it for what it is, even though it is the one thing you are searching for!  But persistence pays off.  When you have trouble finding a cache, think about this verse, and take comfort in knowing that when you seek the Lord, you will always be repaid.

==12. Discuss safety concerns you should consider when geocaching.==
Dangers include heights, falls, traffic, rough terrain, poisonous plants (like poison ivy or poison oak), snakes, spiders, wild animals, strangers, etc. Do not Geocache alone or at night in a remote area. Wear sturdy shoes as for hiking and make sure to take plenty of water when hiking to a remote area or for any distance. Let someone know what you are doing, where you are going, and when you expect to be back.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
A noun represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are used in sentences in two different ways: as subjects (performers of action), or objects (receivers of action).

The word comes from the Latin &quot;nomen,&quot; meaning &quot;name.&quot; Word classes like nouns were first described by the Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini and ancient Greeks like Dionysios Thrax, and were defined in terms of their morphological properties. For example, in Ancient Greek, nouns inflect for grammatical case, such as dative or accusative.

==Types of Nouns==
===Common and Proper Nouns===
A '''common noun''' is any nonspecific person, place or thing.

A '''proper noun''' is any specific person, place, living being, or thing. A proper noun can be a name, places, companies, and trademarks. In the English language, all proper nouns are capitalized, which makes them easy to recognize.
====Examples====
In comparing common and proper nouns, the word ''cat'' can be used to describe many things, which makes it a common noun. Describing an animal as a thing happens in grammar but not biology since they're living beings. (J.D. Meyer) However, you could be more specific and identify a certain cat as being ''Garfield'' or ''Felix'', which would make it a proper noun.

== Special Classes of Nouns ==
*'''Concrete noun ''' names something that can be perceived with the five senses (sight, sound, touch, smell and taste).&lt;/br&gt;''Examples: air, flower, food, water''
*'''Abstract noun ''' names something that can't be perceived with the five senses.&lt;/br&gt;''Examples: love, truth, belief, sympathy'' 
*'''Collective noun ''' names a collection or a group of similar things.&lt;/br&gt;''Examples: flock, herd, pack, etc.''
*'''Mass noun ''' a noun that is very rarely plural and is never with articles 'a' and 'an'.&lt;/br&gt;Examples: advice, equipment, fruit, information, weather

#'''Gender''' determines the sex of a noun.
#*'''Masculine gender''' indicates the male sex. &lt;/br&gt; ''Examples: brother, gander, nephew, father, John''
#*'''Feminine gender''' indicates the female sex. &lt;/br&gt; ''Examples: mother, sister, doe, Mary''

#'''Case''' shows the relation of a noun to other words in the sentence or phrase.
#*'''Nominative case ''' indicates that a noun is '''doing''' or '''being''' something in the sentence. A noun in the nominative case can be either a subject or predicate but not both in the sentence.
#*'''Objective case ''' indicates that a person or a thing is being acted upon. A noun in the objective case can be use as ''object of the verb'' or ''object of the preposition''.
#*'''Possessive case''' indicates that a person or a thing owns something. The possessive form of a noun is usually formed by adding an apostrophe (') or an apostrophe s ('s)

== Uses of Nouns ==
#'''Subject''' refers to the word about something is said in a sentence.
#'''Predicative nominative''' or '''predicate noun''' renames, identifies or explains the subject in a sentence. It is normally placed after a linking verb.
#'''Direct object''' refers to the receiver of the action in a sentence. It answers the question ''What?'' or ''Who?''
#'''Indirect object''' tells ''to whom'', ''to what'', ''for whom'' or ''for what'' a thing is done.
#'''Object of the preposition''' answers the question ''What?'' or ''Whom?'' after the preposition.
#'''Appositive''' refers to a noun that identifies or provides further information about another word in the sentence.
#* '''Essential appositive''' makes the meaning of a sentence clear. It is usually not set off by a comma.
#* '''Non-essential appositive''' may be omitted in the sentence without changing the meaning of it. 
#'''Objective complement''' adds to the meaning of or renames the direct object. It appears only with these verbs: ''appoint, call, consider, declare, elect, judge, label, make, name, select'' or ''think''.
#'''Direct address''' is the name or word by which a person is addressed. It is set off by a comma.

==Identifying Nouns==
In the following paragraph, taken from ''Black Beauty'' by Anna Sewell, all nouns appear in bold lettering.
The first '''place''' that I can well remember was a large pleasant '''meadow''' with a '''pond''' of clear '''water''' in it.  Some shady '''trees''' leaned over it, and '''rushes''' and '''water-lilies''' grew at the deep '''end'''.  Over the '''hedge''' on one '''side''' we looked into a plowed (British English: ''ploughed'') '''field''', and on the other we looked over a '''gate''' at our '''master''''s '''house''', which stood by the '''roadside'''; at the '''top''' of the '''meadow''' was a '''grove''' of '''fir trees''', and at the '''bottom''' a running '''brook''' overhung by a steep '''bank'''.

==Federalist No. 11==
Federalist No. 11 is titled ''&quot;The Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those points about which there is least room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as with each other.''

''There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe. They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in that carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength. Those of them which have colonies in America look forward to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful solicitude. They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace, by facts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers.''

''If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending, at the same time, throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other, for the privileges of our markets. This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of people--increasing in rapid progression, for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain so--to any manufacturing nation; and the immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communication in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another country. Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer. It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and risk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction? Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce?''

''A mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a state of things, conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the American trade, and with the importunities of the West India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present system, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits. Such a point gained from the British government, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade.''

''A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment of a federal navy. There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period not very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties. This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies. A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended. Our position is, in this respect, a most commanding one. And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies, it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our neutrality. By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope, erelong, to become the arbiter of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate.''

''But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or remorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.''

''Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success. An active commerce, an extensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity. We might defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature.''

''But in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and might operate with success. It would be in the power of the maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the conditions of our political existence; and as they have a common interest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our becoming theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and p rsecutors. That unequaled spirit of enterprise, which signalizes the genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost, and poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which, with wisdom, might make herself the admiration and envy of the world.''

''There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are rights of the Union--I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the Western lakes, and to that of the Mississippi. The dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the future existence of these rights; which the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage. The disposition of Spain with regard to the Mississippi needs no comment. France and Britain are concerned with us in the fisheries, and view them as of the utmost moment to their navigation. They, of course, would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery, of which experience has shown us to be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their own markets. What more natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists such dangerous competitors?''

''This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit. All the navigating States may, in different degrees, advantageously participate in it, and under circumstances of a greater extension of mercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do it. As a nursery of seamen, it now is, or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several States, will become, a universal resource. To the establishment of a navy, it must be indispensable.''

''To this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various ways. Every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and support. A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the resources of all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State or partial confederacy, which would only embrace the resources of a single part. It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated America possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential establishment. The more southern States furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval stores--tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood for the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture. The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of signal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national economy. Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater plenty of iron, and of better quality. Seamen must chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more than the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy.''

''An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States. When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another. The variety, not less than the value, of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value than with a small number of materials of the same value; arising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctations of markets. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation. The speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions.''

''It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united or disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends; this intercourse would be fettered, interrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes, which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed. A unity of commercial, as well as political, interests, can only result from a unity of government.''

''There are other points of view in which this subject might be placed, of a striking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of American affairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe, by her arms and by her negotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America, have successively felt her domination. The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority, and have gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America--that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere. Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the Europeans. It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming brother, moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will will add another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!'' 

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is part of the initial block of essays devoted to explicating the virtues of the Union. No. 11 discusses the benefits of the Union in the field of commercial and military naval relations.

==Federalist No. 12==
Federalist No. 12 is titled ''&quot;The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.''

''The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares. By multipying the means of gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness. The assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the industrious manufacturer,--all orders of men, look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils. The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has, from indubitable experience, received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them, and has proved, to the satisfaction of their friends, that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven. It has been found in various countries that, in proportion as commerce has flourished, land has risen in value. And how could it have happened otherwise? Could that which procures a freer vent for the products of the earth, which furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land, which is the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a state--could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry, in every shape, fail to augment that article, which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted? It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an adversary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a spirit of ill-informed jealousy, or of too great abstraction and refinement, is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason and conviction.''

''The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury. The hereditary dominions of the Emperor of Germany contain a great extent of fertile, cultivated, and populous territory, a large proportion of which is situated in mild and luxuriant climates. In some parts of this territory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in Europe. And yet, from the want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch can boast but slender revenues. He has several times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the preservation of his essential interests, and is unable, upon the strength of his own resources, to sustain a long or continued war.''

''But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue. There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive. It is evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation. Tax laws have in vain been multiplied; new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting them.''

''No person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be surprised at this circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts, and from excises. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description.''

''In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties. In most parts of it, excises must be confined within a narrow compass. The genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws. The pockets of the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies, in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption.''

''If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general Union. As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce, so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from that source. As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more simple and efficacious, so far it must serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties more productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to increase the rate without prejudice to trade.''

''The relative situation of these States; the number of rivers with which they are intersected, and of bays that wash there shores; the facility of communication in every direction; the affinity of language and manners; the familiar habits of intercourse; --all these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty, and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other. The separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties. The temper of our governments, for a long time to come, would not permit those rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard the avenues into their respective countries, as well by land as by water; and which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of avarice.''

''In France, there is an army of patrols (as they are called) constantly employed to secure their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the dealers in contraband trade. Mr. Neckar computes the number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand. This shows the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic, where there is an inland communication, and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country would be encumbered, if by disunion the States should be placed in a situation, with respect to each other, resembling that of France with respect to her neighbors. The arbitrary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are necessarily armed, would be intolerable in a free country.''

''If, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading all the States, there will be, as to the principal part of our commerce, but ONE SIDE to guard--the ATLANTIC COAST. Vessels arriving directly from foreign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely choose to hazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port. They would have to dread both the dangers of the coast, and of detection, as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final destination. An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports, might at a small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws. And the government having the same interest to provide against violations everywhere, the co-operation of its measures in each State would have a powerful tendency to render them effectual. Here also we should preserve by Union, an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be relinquished by separation. The United States lie at a great distance from Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other places with which they would have extensive connections of foreign trade. The passage from them to us, in a few hours, or in a single night, as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other neighboring nations, would be impracticable. This is a prodigious security against a direct contraband with foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to one State, through the medium of another, would be both easy and safe. The difference between a direct importation from abroad, and an indirect importation through the channel of a neighboring State, in small parcels, according to time and opportunity, with the additional facilities of inland communication, must be palpable to every man of discernment.''

''It is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at much less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison, further than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any partial confederacies. Hitherto, I believe, it may safely be asserted, that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three per cent. In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent., and in Britain they exceed this proportion. There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their present amount. The single article of ardent spirits, under federal regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a ratio to the importation into this State, the whole quantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four millions of gallons; which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred thousand pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture, to the economy, to the morals, and to the health of the society. There is, perhaps, nothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these spirits.''

''What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent? A nation cannot long exist without revenues. Destitute of this essential support, it must resign its independence, and sink into the degraded condition of a province. This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede. Revenue, therefore, must be had at all events. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight upon land. It has been already intimated that excises, in their true signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the people, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor, indeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture, are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that way. Personal estate (as has been before remarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be subjected to large contributions, by any other means than by taxes on consumption. In populous cities, it may be enough the subject of conjecture, to occasion the oppression of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the State; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure, escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of the State, nevertheless, must be satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of other resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the possessors of land. And as, on the other hand, the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its security. Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of the soil. But public and private distress will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert; and unite in deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''As CONNECTED with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety consider that of economy. The money saved from one object may be usefully applied to another, and there will be so much the less to be drawn from the pockets of the people. If the States are united under one government, there will be but one national civil list to support; if they are divided into several confederacies, there will be as many different national civil lists to be provided for--and each of them, as to the principal departments, coextensive with that which would be necessary for a government of the whole. The entire separation of the States into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many advocates. The ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of the empire seem generally turned toward three confederacies--one consisting of the four Northern, another of the four Middle, and a third of the five Southern States. There is little probability that there would be a greater number. According to this distribution, each confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great Britain. No well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which has been proposed by the convention. When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent. This idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is no rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of any given number of individuals; but when we consider that the island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each of the supposed confederacies, contains about eight millions of people, and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the passions of so large a society to the public good, we shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more numerous. Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.''

''The supposition that each confederacy into which the States would be likely to be divided would require a government not less comprehensive than the one proposed, will be strengthened by another supposition, more probable than that which presents us with three confederacies as the alternative to a general Union. If we attend carefully to geographical and commercial considerations, in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different States, we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most naturally league themselves under two governments. The four Eastern States, from all the causes that form the links of national sympathy and connection, may with certainty be expected to unite. New York, situated as she is, would never be unwise enough to oppose a feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of that confederacy. There are other obvious reasons that would facilitate her accession to it. New Jersey is too small a State to think of being a frontier, in opposition to this still more powerful combination; nor do there appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it. Even Pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the Northern league. An active foreign commerce, on the basis of her own navigation, is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and dispositions of her citizens. The more Southern States, from various circumstances, may not think themselves much interested in the encouragement of navigation. They may prefer a system which would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their commodities. Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy. As she must at all events be a frontier, she may deem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the stronger power of the Northern, Confederacy. This would give her the fairest chance to avoid being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be the determination of Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy includes New Jersey, there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to the south of that State.''

''Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will be able to support a national government better than one half, or one third, or any number less than the whole. This reflection must have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan, which is founded on the principle of expense; an objection, however, which, when we come to take a nearer view of it, will appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground.''

''If, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists, we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed to guard the inland communication between the different confederacies against illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly spring up out of the necessities of revenue; and if we also take into view the military establishments which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the several nations into which the States would be divided, we shall clearly discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce, revenue, and liberty of every part.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''WE HAVE seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against foreign danger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the Old World, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction, which have proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own. All that remains, within this branch of our inquiries, is to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the Union embraces. A few observations on this subject will be the more proper, as it is perceived that the adversaries of the new Constitution are availing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of republican administration, in order to supply, by imaginary difficulties, the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in vain to find.''

''The error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.''

''To this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some celebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in forming the modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects either of an absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to heighten the advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece and modern Italy. Under the confusion of names, it has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only; and among others, the observation that it can never be established but among a small number of people, living within a small compass of territory.''

''Such a fallacy may have been the less perceived, as most of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species; and even in modern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of representation, no example is seen of a government wholly popular, and founded, at the same time, wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in government, by the simple agency of which the will of the largest political body may be concentred, and its force directed to any object which the public good requires, America can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics. It is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her consideration.''

''As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand, and will include no greater number than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs. Can it be said that the limits of the United States exceed this distance? It will not be said by those who recollect that the Atlantic coast is the longest side of the Union, that during the term of thirteen years, the representatives of the States have been almost continually assembled, and that the members from the most distant States are not chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from the States in the neighborhood of Congress.''

''That we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting subject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the Union. The limits, as fixed by the treaty of peace, are: on the east the Atlantic, on the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees, on the west the Mississippi, and on the north an irregular line running in some instances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the forty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie lies below that latitude. Computing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees, it amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common miles; computing it from thirty-one to forty-two degrees, to seven hundred and sixty-four miles and a half. Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be eight hundred and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths. The mean distance from the Atlantic to the Mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent with that of several countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our system commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable. It is not a great deal larger than Germany, where a diet representing the whole empire is continually assembled; or than Poland before the late dismemberment, where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power. Passing by France and Spain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as it may be in size, the representatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the Union.''

''Favorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory.''

''In the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments, which can extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately provided for, will retain their due authority and activity. Were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular States, its adversaries would have some ground for their objection; though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished the general government would be compelled, by the principle of self-preservation, to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction.''

''A second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the federal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other States as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighborhoods, which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier, must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.''

''Let it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout the Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere be shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout, the whole extent of the thirteen States. The communication between the Western and Atlantic districts, and between different parts of each, will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has intersected our country, and which art finds it so little difficult to connect and complete.''

''A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently stand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and resources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our western or northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the seat of government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone against an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual danger. If they should derive less benefit, therefore, from the Union in some respects than the less distant States, they will derive greater benefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout.''

''I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never suffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or however fashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords of affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness; can no longer be fellowcitizens of one great, respectable, and flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their sacred rights, consecrate their Union, and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be shunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild of all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rendering us in pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness. But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected, merely because it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly spirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world for the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness. Had no important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered, no government established of which an exact model did not present itself, the people of the United States might, at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils, must at best have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole human race, they pursued a new and more noble course. They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society. They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the design of a great Confederacy, which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them. If they erred most in the structure of the Union, this was the work most difficult to be executed; this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide.''

Federalist No. 15 is titled ''&quot;The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IN THE course of the preceding papers, I have endeavored, my fellow-citizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing light, the importance of Union to your political safety and happiness. I have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be exposed, should you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of America together be severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice, by jealousy or by misrepresentation. In the sequel of the inquiry through which I propose to accompany you, the truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed. If the road over which you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you tedious or irksome, you will recollect that you are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the attention of a free people, that the field through which you have to travel is in itself spacious, and that the difficulties of the journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which sophistry has beset the way. It will be my aim to remove the obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done, without sacrificing utility to despatch.''

''In pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion of the subject, the point next in order to be examined is the &quot;insufficiency of the present Confederation to the preservation of the Union.&quot; It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either controverted or doubted, to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent, and which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new Constitution. It must in truth be acknowledged that, however these may differ in other respects, they in general appear to harmonize in this sentiment, at least, that there are material imperfections in our national system, and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy. The facts that support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They have forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and have at length extorted from those, whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived, a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of our federal government, which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the Union.''

''We may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not experience. Are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men? These are the subjects of constant and unblushing violation. Do we owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence? These remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have we valuable territories and important posts in the possession of a foreign power which, by express stipulations, ought long since to have been surrendered? These are still retained, to the prejudice of our interests, not less than of our rights. Are we in a condition to resent or to repel the aggression? We have neither troops, nor treasury, nor government. Are we even in a condition to remonstrate with dignity? The just imputations on our own faith, in respect to the same treaty, ought first to be removed. Are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in the navigation of the Mississippi? Spain excludes us from it. Is public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger? We seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and irretrievable. Is commerce of importance to national wealth? Ours is at the lowest point of declension. Is respectability in the eyes of foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments? The imbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us. Our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty. Is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress? The price of improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of waste land at market, and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public confidence, which are so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks, and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend and patron of industry? That most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits, and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity of money. To shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford neither pleasure nor instruction, it may in general be demanded, what indication is there of national disorder, poverty, and insignificance that could befall a community so peculiarly blessed with natural advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes?''

''This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the proposed Constitution; and which, not content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our tranquillity, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity.''

''It is true, as has been before observed that facts, too stubborn to be resisted, have produced a species of general assent to the abstract proposition that there exist material defects in our national system; but the usefulness of the concession, on the part of the old adversaries of federal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy, upon the only principles that can give it a chance of success. While they admit that the government of the United States is destitute of energy, they contend against conferring upon it those powers which are requisite to supply that energy. They seem still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an augmentation of federal authority, without a diminution of State authority; at sovereignty in the Union, and complete independence in the members. They still, in fine, seem to cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium in imperio. This renders a full display of the principal defects of the Confederation necessary, in order to show that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building, which cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main pillars of the fabric.''

''The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing Confederation is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of which they consist. Though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the Union, yet it pervades and governs those on which the efficacy of the rest depends. Except as to the rule of appointment, the United States has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money; but they have no authority to raise either, by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that though in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the members of the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the States observe or disregard at their option.''

''It is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind, that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head, there should still be found men who object to the new Constitution, for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old, and which is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of GOVERNMENT; a principle, in short, which, if it is to be executed at all, must substitute the violent and sanguinary agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy.''

''There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time, place, circumstance, and quantity; leaving nothing to future discretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of this kind exist among all civilized nations, subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war, of observance and non-observance, as the interests or passions of the contracting powers dictate. In the early part of the present century there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this species of compacts, from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realized. With a view to establishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world, all the resources of negotiation were exhausted, and triple and quadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed before they were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to mankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith, and which oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any immediate interest or passion.''

''If the particular States in this country are disposed to stand in a similar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the scheme would indeed be pernicious, and would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have been enumerated under the first head; but it would have the merit of being, at least, consistent and practicable Abandoning all views towards a confederate government, this would bring us to a simple alliance offensive and defensive; and would place us in a situation to be alternate friends and enemies of each other, as our mutual jealousies and rivalships, nourished by the intrigues of foreign nations, should prescribe to us.''

''But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation; if we still will adhere to the design of a national government, or, which is the same thing, of a superintending power, under the direction of a common council, we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government; we must extend the authority of the Union to the persons of the citizens, --the only proper objects of government.''

''Government implies the power of making laws. It is essential to the idea of a law, that it be attended with a sanction; or, in other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways: by the agency of the courts and ministers of justice, or by military force; by the COERCION of the magistracy, or by the COERCION of arms. The first kind can evidently apply only to men; the last kind must of necessity, be employed against bodies politic, or communities, or States. It is evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance of the laws can, in the last resort, be enforced. Sentences may be denounced against them for violations of their duty; but these sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword. In an association where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities, that compose it, every breach of the laws must involve a state of war; and military execution must become the only instrument of civil obedience. Such a state of things can certainly not deserve the name of government, nor would any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it.''

''There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States, of the regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected; that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the respective members, and would beget a full compliance with all the constitutional requisitions of the Union. This language, at the present day, would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought, when we shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to reputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one. A spirit of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses, for which they would blush in a private capacity.''

''In addition to all this, there is, in the nature of sovereign power, an impatience of control, that disposes those who are invested with the exercise of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to restrain or direct its operations. From this spirit it happens, that in every political association which is formed upon the principle of uniting in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties, there will be found a kind of eccentric tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs, by the operation of which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common centre. This tendency is not difficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power. Power controlled or abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controlled or abridged. This simple proposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect, that the persons intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of a confederacy will at all times be ready, with perfect good-humor, and an unbiased regard to the public weal, to execute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority. The reverse of this results from the constitution of human nature.''

''If, therefore, the measures of the Confederacy cannot be executed without the intervention of the particular administrations, there will be little prospect of their being executed at all. The rulers of the respective members, whether they have a constitutional right to do it or not, will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves. They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this will be done; and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny, without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state, which is essential to a right judgment, and with that strong predilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to mislead the decision. The same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is constituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies; who have seen how difficult it often is, where there is no exterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from each other, at different times, and under different impressions, long to co-operate in the same views and pursuits.''

''In our case, the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite, under the Confederation, to the complete execution of every important measure that proceeds from the Union. It has happened as was to have been foreseen. The measures of the Union have not been executed; the delinquencies of the States have, step by step, matured themselves to an extreme, which has, at length, arrested all the wheels of the national government, and brought them to an awful stand. Congress at this time scarcely possess the means of keeping up the forms of administration, till the States can have time to agree upon a more substantial substitute for the present shadow of a federal government. Things did not come to this desperate extremity at once. The causes which have been specified produced at first only unequal and disproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the Union. The greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of example and the temptation of interest to the complying, or to the least delinquent States. Why should we do more in proportion than those who are embarked with us in the same political voyage? Why should we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden? These were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand, and which even speculative men, who looked forward to remote consequences, could not, without hesitation, combat. Each State, yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or convenience, has successively withdrawn its support, till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads, and to crush us beneath its ruins.''

''To the People of the State of New York:

''THE tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or communities, in their political capacities, as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it, is equally attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind, of which we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in those systems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination. I shall content myself with barely observing here, that of all the confederacies of antiquity, which history has handed down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there remain vestiges of them, appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken principle, and were accordingly those which have best deserved, and have most liberally received, the applauding suffrages of political writers.''

''This exceptionable principle may, as truly as emphatically, be styled the parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies in the members of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring; and that whenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is force, and the immediate effect of the use of it, civil war.''

''It remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government, in its application to us, would even be capable of answering its end. If there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national government it would either not be able to employ force at all, or, when this could be done, it would amount to a war between parts of the Confederacy concerning the infractions of a league, in which the strongest combination would be most likely to prevail, whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general authority. It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member, and if there were more than one who had neglected their duty, similarity of situation would induce them to unite for common defense. Independent of this motive of sympathy, if a large and influential State should happen to be the aggressing member, it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over some of them as associates to its cause. Specious arguments of danger to the common liberty could easily be contrived; plausible excuses for the deficiencies of the party could, without difficulty, be invented to alarm the apprehensions, inflame the passions, and conciliate the good-will, even of those States which were not chargeable with any violation or omission of duty. This would be the more likely to take place, as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers, with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement; the better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent States. If associates could not be found at home, recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers, who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy, from the firm union of which they had so much to fear. When the sword is once drawn, the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation. The suggestions of wounded pride, the instigations of irritated resentment, would be apt to carry the States against which the arms of the Union were exerted, to any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of submission. The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the Union.''

''This may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy. Its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing, if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form. It is not probable, considering the genius of this country, that the complying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the Union by engaging in a war against the non-complying States. They would always be more ready to pursue the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with the delinquent members by an imitation of their example. And the guilt of all would thus become the security of all. Our past experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full light. There would, in fact, be an insuperable difficulty in ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the article of pecuniary contribution, which would be the most usual source of delinquency, it would often be impossible to decide whether it had proceeded from disinclination or inability. The pretense of the latter would always be at hand. And the case must be very flagrant in which its fallacy could be detected with sufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion. It is easy to see that this problem alone, as often as it should occur, would open a wide field for the exercise of factious views, of partiality, and of oppression, in the majority that happened to prevail in the national council.''

''It seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not to prefer a national Constitution which could only be kept in motion by the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of extending its operations to individuals. Such a scheme, if practicable at all, would instantly degenerate into a military despotism; but it will be found in every light impracticable. The resources of the Union would not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger States within the limits of their duty; nor would the means ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first instance. Whoever considers the populousness and strength of several of these States singly at the present juncture, and looks forward to what they will become, even at the distance of half a century, will at once dismiss as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective capacities, and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in the same capacities. A project of this kind is little less romantic than the monster-taming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity.''

''Even in those confederacies which have been composed of members smaller than many of our counties, the principle of legislation for sovereign States, supported by military coercion, has never been found effectual. It has rarely been attempted to be employed, but against the weaker members; and in most instances attempts to coerce the refractory and disobedient have been the signals of bloody wars, in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half.''

''The result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be clearly this, that if it be possible at any rate to construct a federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the general tranquillity, it must be founded, as to the objects committed to its care, upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the opponents of the proposed Constitution. It must carry its agency to the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no intermediate legislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the national authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts of justice. The government of the Union, like that of each State, must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals; and to attract to its support those passions which have the strongest influence upon the human heart. It must, in short, possess all the means, and have aright to resort to all the methods, of executing the powers with which it is entrusted, that are possessed and exercised by the government of the particular States.''

''To this reasoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any State should be disaffected to the authority of the Union, it could at any time obstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the same issue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is reproached.''

''The pausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we advert to the essential difference between a mere NON-COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interposition of the State legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only NOT TO ACT, or to ACT EVASIVELY, and the measure is defeated. This neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions, so as not to appear, and of course not to excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the Constitution. The State leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious invasions of it on the ground of some temporary convenience, exemption, or advantage.''

''But if the execution of the laws of the national government should not require the intervention of the State legislatures, if they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves, the particular governments could not interrupt their progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power. No omissions nor evasions would answer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights. An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a constitution in any degree competent to its own defense, and of a people enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal usurpation of authority. The success of it would require not merely a factious majority in the legislature, but the concurrence of the courts of justice and of the body of the people. If the judges were not embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature, they would pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the supreme law of the land, unconstitutional, and void. If the people were not tainted with the spirit of their State representatives, they, as the natural guardians of the Constitution, would throw their weight into the national scale and give it a decided preponderancy in the contest. Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or rashness, because they could seldom be made without danger to the authors, unless in cases of a tyrannical exercise of the federal authority.''

''If opposition to the national government should arise from the disorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals, it could be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the same evil under the State governments. The magistracy, being equally the ministers of the law of the land, from whatever source it might emanate, would doubtless be as ready to guard the national as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness. As to those partial commotions and insurrections, which sometimes disquiet society, from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction, or from sudden or occasional illhumors that do not infect the great body of the community the general government could command more extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind than would be in the power of any single member. And as to those mortal feuds which, in certain conjunctures, spread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through a very large proportion of it, proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation. When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments of empire. No form of government can always either avoid or control them. It is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for human foresight or precaution, and it would be idle to object to a government because it could not perform impossibilities.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''AN OBJECTION, of a nature different from that which has been stated and answered, in my last address, may perhaps be likewise urged against the principle of legislation for the individual citizens of America. It may be said that it would tend to render the government of the Union too powerful, and to enable it to absorb those residuary authorities, which it might be judged proper to leave with the States for local purposes. Allowing the utmost latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can require, I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons entrusted with the administration of the general government could ever feel to divest the States of the authorities of that description. The regulation of the mere domestic police of a State appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition. Commerce, finance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend all the objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion; and all the powers necessary to those objects ought, in the first instance, to be lodged in the national depository. The administration of private justice between the citizens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a similar nature, all those things, in short, which are proper to be provided for by local legislation, can never be desirable cares of a general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable that there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory; and the possession of them, for that reason, would contribute nothing to the dignity, to the importance, or to the splendor of the national government.''

''But let it be admitted, for argument's sake, that mere wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition; still it may be safely affirmed, that the sense of the constituent body of the national representatives, or, in other words, the people of the several States, would control the indulgence of so extravagant an appetite. It will always be far more easy for the State governments to encroach upon the national authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the State authorities. The proof of this proposition turns upon the greater degree of influence which the State governments if they administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence, will generally possess over the people; a circumstance which at the same time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all federal constitutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken in their organization, to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of liberty.''

''The superiority of influence in favor of the particular governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of the national government, but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the State administrations would be directed.''

''It is a known fact in human nature, that its affections are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object. Upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his neighborhood, to his neighborhood than to the community at large, the people of each State would be apt to feel a stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the government of the Union; unless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter.''

''This strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of State regulation.''

''The variety of more minute interests, which will necessarily fall under the superintendence of the local administrations, and which will form so many rivulets of influence, running through every part of the society, cannot be particularized, without involving a detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might afford.''

''There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the province of the State governments, which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light,--I mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice. This, of all others, is the most powerful, most universal, and most attractive source of popular obedience and attachment. It is that which, being the immediate and visible guardian of life and property, having its benefits and its terrors in constant activity before the public eye, regulating all those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake, contributes, more than any other circumstance, to impressing upon the minds of the people, affection, esteem, and reverence towards the government. This great cement of society, which will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular governments, independent of all other causes of influence, would insure them so decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render them at all times a complete counterpoise, and, not unfrequently, dangerous rivals to the power of the Union.''

''The operations of the national government, on the other hand, falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the citizens, the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by speculative men. Relating to more general interests, they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people; and, in proportion, less likely to inspire an habitual sense of obligation, and an active sentiment of attachment.''

''The reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all federal constitutions with which we are acquainted, and of all others which have borne the least analogy to them.''

''Though the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly speaking, confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of association. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign, whose authority extended over the whole nation; and a number of subordinate vassals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to them, and numerous trains of INFERIOR vassals or retainers, who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience, to the persons of whom they held it. Each principal vassal was a kind of sovereign, within his particular demesnes. The consequences of this situation were a continual opposition to authority of the sovereign, and frequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories themselves. The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak, either to preserve the public peace, or to protect the people against the oppressions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is emphatically styled by historians, the times of feudal anarchy.''

''When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper and of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight and influence, which answered, for the time, the purpose of a more regular authority. But in general, the power of the barons triumphed over that of the prince; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown off, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or States. In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were dreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor, and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority.''

''This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture. Among other illustrations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland will furnish a cogent example. The spirit of clanship which was, at an early day, introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch, till the incorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit, and reduced it within those rules of subordination which a more rational and more energetic system of civil polity had previously established in the latter kingdom.''

''The separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favor, that from the reasons already explained, they will generally possess the confidence and good-will of the people, and with so important a support, will be able effectually to oppose all encroachments of the national government. It will be well if they are not able to counteract its legitimate and necessary authority. The points of similitude consist in the rivalship of power, applicable to both, and in the CONCENTRATION of large portions of the strength of the community into particular DEPOSITS, in one case at the disposal of individuals, in the other case at the disposal of political bodies.''

''A concise review of the events that have attended confederate governments will further illustrate this important doctrine; an inattention to which has been the great source of our political mistakes, and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side. This review shall form the subject of some ensuing papers.''

''To the People of the State of New York:

''AMONG the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable was that of the Grecian republics, associated under the Amphictyonic council. From the best accounts transmitted of this celebrated institution, it bore a very instructive analogy to the present Confederation of the American States.''

''The members retained the character of independent and sovereign states, and had equal votes in the federal council. This council had a general authority to propose and resolve whatever it judged necessary for the common welfare of Greece; to declare and carry on war; to decide, in the last resort, all controversies between the members; to fine the aggressing party; to employ the whole force of the confederacy against the disobedient; to admit new members. The Amphictyons were the guardians of religion, and of the immense riches belonging to the temple of Delphos, where they had the right of jurisdiction in controversies between the inhabitants and those who came to consult the oracle. As a further provision for the efficacy of the federal powers, they took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to punish the violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious despoilers of the temple.''

''In theory, and upon paper, this apparatus of powers seems amply sufficient for all general purposes. In several material instances, they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The Amphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times, one of the principal engines by which government was then maintained; they had a declared authority to use coercion against refractory cities, and were bound by oath to exert this authority on the necessary occasions.''

''Very different, nevertheless, was the experiment from the theory. The powers, like those of the present Congress, were administered by deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities; and exercised over them in the same capacities. Hence the weakness, the disorders, and finally the destruction of the confederacy. The more powerful members, instead of being kept in awe and subordination, tyrannized successively over all the rest. Athens, as we learn from Demosthenes, was the arbiter of Greece seventy-three years. The Lacedaemonians next governed it twenty-nine years; at a subsequent period, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of domination.''

''It happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of the strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker; and that judgment went in favor of the most powerful party.''

''Even in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with Persia and Macedon, the members never acted in concert, and were, more or fewer of them, eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common enemy. The intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic vicissitudes convulsions, and carnage.''

''After the conclusion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the Lacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned out of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The Athenians, finding that the Lacedaemonians would lose fewer partisans by such a measure than themselves, and would become masters of the public deliberations, vigorously opposed and defeated the attempt. This piece of history proves at once the inefficiency of the union, the ambition and jealousy of its most powerful members, and the dependent and degraded condition of the rest. The smaller members, though entitled by the theory of their system to revolve in equal pride and majesty around the common center, had become, in fact, satellites of the orbs of primary magnitude.''

''Had the Greeks, says the Abbe Milot, been as wise as they were courageous, they would have been admonished by experience of the necessity of a closer union, and would have availed themselves of the peace which followed their success against the Persian arms, to establish such a reformation. Instead of this obvious policy, Athens and Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired, became first rivals and then enemies; and did each other infinitely more mischief than they had suffered from Xerxes. Their mutual jealousies, fears, hatreds, and injuries ended in the celebrated Peloponnesian war; which itself ended in the ruin and slavery of the Athenians who had begun it.''

''As a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal dissentions, so these never fail to bring on fresh calamities from abroad. The Phocians having ploughed up some consecrated ground belonging to the temple of Apollo, the Amphictyonic council, according to the superstition of the age, imposed a fine on the sacrilegious offenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refused to submit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook to maintain the authority of the Amphictyons, and to avenge the violated god. The latter, being the weaker party, invited the assistance of Philip of Macedon, who had secretly fostered the contest. Philip gladly seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned against the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won over to his interests the popular leaders of several cities; by their influence and votes, gained admission into the Amphictyonic council; and by his arts and his arms, made himself master of the confederacy.''

''Such were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which this interesting establishment was founded. Had Greece, says a judicious observer on her fate, been united by a stricter confederation, and persevered in her union, she would never have worn the chains of Macedon; and might have proved a barrier to the vast projects of Rome.''

''The Achaean league, as it is called, was another society of Grecian republics, which supplies us with valuable instruction.''

''The Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiser, than in the preceding instance. It will accordingly appear, that though not exempt from a similar catastrophe, it by no means equally deserved it.''

''The cities composing this league retained their municipal jurisdiction, appointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The senate, in which they were represented, had the sole and exclusive right of peace and war; of sending and receiving ambassadors; of entering into treaties and alliances; of appointing a chief magistrate or praetor, as he was called, who commanded their armies, and who, with the advice and consent of ten of the senators, not only administered the government in the recess of the senate, but had a great share in its deliberations, when assembled. According to the primitive constitution, there were two praetors associated in the administration; but on trial a single one was preferred.''

''It appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs, the same weights and measures, and the same money. But how far this effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left in uncertainty. It is said only that the cities were in a manner compelled to receive the same laws and usages. When Lacedaemon was brought into the league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an abolition of the institutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of those of the Achaeans. The Amphictyonic confederacy, of which she had been a member, left her in the full exercise of her government and her legislation. This circumstance alone proves a very material difference in the genius of the two systems.''

''It is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain of this curious political fabric. Could its interior structure and regular operation be ascertained, it is probable that more light would be thrown by it on the science of federal government, than by any of the like experiments with which we are acquainted.''

''One important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians who take notice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of the league by Aratus, as before its dissolution by the arts of Macedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and justice in the administration of its government, and less of violence and sedition in the people, than were to be found in any of the cities exercising SINGLY all the prerogatives of sovereignty. The Abbe Mably, in his observations on Greece, says that the popular government, which was so tempestuous elsewhere, caused no disorders in the members of the Achaean republic, BECAUSE IT WAS THERE TEMPERED BY THE GENERAL AUTHORITY AND LAWS OF THE CONFEDERACY.''

''We are not to conclude too hastily, however, that faction did not, in a certain degree, agitate the particular cities; much less that a due subordination and harmony reigned in the general system. The contrary is sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate of the republic.''

''Whilst the Amphictyonic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans, which comprehended the less important cities only, made little figure on the theatre of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon, the latter was spared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the successors of these princes, however, a different policy prevailed. The arts of division were practiced among the Achaeans. Each city was seduced into a separate interest; the union was dissolved. Some of the cities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garrisons; others under that of usurpers springing out of their own confusions. Shame and oppression erelong awaken their love of liberty. A few cities reunited. Their example was followed by others, as opportunities were found of cutting off their tyrants. The league soon embraced almost the whole Peloponnesus. Macedon saw its progress; but was hindered by internal dissensions from stopping it. All Greece caught the enthusiasm and seemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealousy and envy in Sparta and Athens, of the rising glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal damp on the enterprise. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the league to court the alliance of the Kings of Egypt and Syria, who, as successors of Alexander, were rivals of the king of Macedon. This policy was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his ambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors, the Achaeans, and who, as an enemy to Macedon, had interest enough with the Egyptian and Syrian princes to effect a breach of their engagements with the league.''

''The Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to Cleomenes, or of supplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppressor. The latter expedient was adopted. The contests of the Greeks always afforded a pleasing opportunity to that powerful neighbor of intermeddling in their affairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared. Cleomenes was vanquished. The Achaeans soon experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and powerful ally is but another name for a master. All that their most abject compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the exercise of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon, soon provoked by his tyrannies, fresh combinations among the Greeks. The Achaeans, though weakenened by internal dissensions and by the revolt of Messene, one of its members, being joined by the AEtolians and Athenians, erected the standard of opposition. Finding themselves, though thus supported, unequal to the undertaking, they once more had recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the succor of foreign arms. The Romans, to whom the invitation was made, eagerly embraced it. Philip was conquered; Macedon subdued. A new crisis ensued to the league. Dissensions broke out among it members. These the Romans fostered. Callicrates and other popular leaders became mercenary instruments for inveigling their countrymen. The more effectually to nourish discord and disorder the Romans had, to the astonishment of those who confided in their sincerity, already proclaimed universal liberty throughout Greece. With the same insidious views, they now seduced the members from the league, by representing to their pride the violation it committed on their sovereignty. By these arts this union, the last hope of Greece, the last hope of ancient liberty, was torn into pieces; and such imbecility and distraction introduced, that the arms of Rome found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts had commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces, and Achaia loaded with chains, under which it is groaning at this hour.''

''I have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this important portion of history; both because it teaches more than one lesson, and because, as a supplement to the outlines of the Achaean constitution, it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal bodies rather to anarchy among the members, than to tyranny in the head.''

Federalist No. 19 is titled ''&quot;The Same Subject Continued: The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE examples of ancient confederacies, cited in my last paper, have not exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this subject. There are existing institutions, founded on a similar principle, which merit particular consideration. The first which presents itself is the Germanic body.''

''In the early ages of Christianity, Germany was occupied by seven distinct nations, who had no common chief. The Franks, one of the number, having conquered the Gauls, established the kingdom which has taken its name from them. In the ninth century Charlemagne, its warlike monarch, carried his victorious arms in every direction; and Germany became a part of his vast dominions. On the dismemberment, which took place under his sons, this part was erected into a separate and independent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate descendants possessed the reality, as well as the ensigns and dignity of imperial power. But the principal vassals, whose fiefs had become hereditary, and who composed the national diets which Charlemagne had not abolished, gradually threw off the yoke and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction and independence. The force of imperial sovereignty was insufficient to restrain such powerful dependants; or to preserve the unity and tranquillity of the empire. The most furious private wars, accompanied with every species of calamity, were carried on between the different princes and states. The imperial authority, unable to maintain the public order, declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the anarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the last emperor of the Suabian, and the accession of the first emperor of the Austrian lines. In the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full sovereignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols and decorations of power.''

''Out of this feudal system, which has itself many of the important features of a confederacy, has grown the federal system which constitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are vested in a diet representing the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor, who is the executive magistrate, with a negative on the decrees of the diet; and in the imperial chamber and the aulic council, two judiciary tribunals having supreme jurisdiction in controversies which concern the empire, or which happen among its members.''

''The diet possesses the general power of legislating for the empire; of making war and peace; contracting alliances; assessing quotas of troops and money; constructing fortresses; regulating coin; admitting new members; and subjecting disobedient members to the ban of the empire, by which the party is degraded from his sovereign rights and his possessions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expressly restricted from entering into compacts prejudicial to the empire; from imposing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourse, without the consent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from doing injustice to one another; or from affording assistance or retreat to disturbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced against such as shall violate any of these restrictions. The members of the diet, as such, are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet, and in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial chamber.''

''The prerogatives of the emperor are numerous. The most important of them are: his exclusive right to make propositions to the diet; to negative its resolutions; to name ambassadors; to confer dignities and titles; to fill vacant electorates; to found universities; to grant privileges not injurious to the states of the empire; to receive and apply the public revenues; and generally to watch over the public safety. In certain cases, the electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor, he possesses no territory within the empire, nor receives any revenue for his support. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities, constitute him one of the most powerful princes in Europe.''

''From such a parade of constitutional powers, in the representatives and head of this confederacy, the natural supposition would be, that it must form an exception to the general character which belongs to its kindred systems. Nothing would be further from the reality. The fundamental principle on which it rests, that the empire is a community of sovereigns, that the diet is a representation of sovereigns and that the laws are addressed to sovereigns, renders the empire a nerveless body, incapable of regulating its own members, insecure against external dangers, and agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own bowels.''

''The history of Germany is a history of wars between the emperor and the princes and states; of wars among the princes and states themselves; of the licentiousness of the strong, and the oppression of the weak; of foreign intrusions, and foreign intrigues; of requisitions of men and money disregarded, or partially complied with; of attempts to enforce them, altogether abortive, or attended with slaughter and desolation, involving the innocent with the guilty; of general inbecility, confusion, and misery.''

''In the sixteenth century, the emperor, with one part of the empire on his side, was seen engaged against the other princes and states. In one of the conflicts, the emperor himself was put to flight, and very near being made prisoner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Prussia was more than once pitted against his imperial sovereign; and commonly proved an overmatch for him. Controversies and wars among the members themselves have been so common, that the German annals are crowded with the bloody pages which describe them. Previous to the peace of Westphalia, Germany was desolated by a war of thirty years, in which the emperor, with one half of the empire, was on one side, and Sweden, with the other half, on the opposite side. Peace was at length negotiated, and dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which foreign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the Germanic constitution.''

''If the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the necessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable. Military preparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising from the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of sovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the enemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take it, are retiring into winter quarters.''

''The small body of national troops, which has been judged necessary in time of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with local prejudices, and supported by irregular and disproportionate contributions to the treasury.''

''The impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice among these sovereign subjects, produced the experiment of dividing the empire into nine or ten circles or districts; of giving them an interior organization, and of charging them with the military execution of the laws against delinquent and contumacious members. This experiment has only served to demonstrate more fully the radical vice of the constitution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of this political monster. They either fail to execute their commissions, or they do it with all the devastation and carnage of civil war. Sometimes whole circles are defaulters; and then they increase the mischief which they were instituted to remedy.''

''We may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion from a sample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city of the circle of Suabia, the Abb 300 de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities which had been reserved to him. In the exercise of these, on some public occasions, outrages were committed on him by the people of the city. The consequence was that the city was put under the ban of the empire, and the Duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle, obtained an appointment to enforce it. He soon appeared before the city with a corps of ten thousand troops, and finding it a fit occasion, as he had secretly intended from the beginning, to revive an antiquated claim, on the pretext that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered from his territory, he took possession of it in his own name, disarmed, and punished the inhabitants, and reannexed the city to his domains.''

''It may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed machine from falling entirely to pieces? The answer is obvious: The weakness of most of the members, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the mercy of foreign powers; the weakness of most of the principal members, compared with the formidable powers all around them; the vast weight and influence which the emperor derives from his separate and heriditary dominions; and the interest he feels in preserving a system with which his family pride is connected, and which constitutes him the first prince in Europe; --these causes support a feeble and precarious Union; whilst the repellant quality, incident to the nature of sovereignty, and which time continually strengthens, prevents any reform whatever, founded on a proper consolidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this obstacle could be surmounted, that the neighboring powers would suffer a revolution to take place which would give to the empire the force and preeminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have long considered themselves as interested in the changes made by events in this constitution; and have, on various occasions, betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness.''

''If more direct examples were wanting, Poland, as a government over local sovereigns, might not improperly be taken notice of. Nor could any proof more striking be given of the calamities flowing from such institutions. Equally unfit for self-government and self-defense, it has long been at the mercy of its powerful neighbors; who have lately had the mercy to disburden it of one third of its people and territories.''

''The connection among the Swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a confederacy; though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the stability of such institutions.''

''They have no common treasury; no common troops even in war; no common coin; no common judicatory; nor any other common mark of sovereignty.''

''They are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical position; by their individual weakness and insignificancy; by the fear of powerful neighbors, to one of which they were formerly subject; by the few sources of contention among a people of such simple and homogeneous manners; by their joint interest in their dependent possessions; by the mutual aid they stand in need of, for suppressing insurrections and rebellions, an aid expressly stipulated and often required and afforded; and by the necessity of some regular and permanent provision for accomodating disputes among the cantons. The provision is, that the parties at variance shall each choose four judges out of the neutral cantons, who, in case of disagreement, choose an umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces definitive sentence, which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The competency of this regulation may be estimated by a clause in their treaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges himself to interpose as mediator in disputes between the cantons, and to employ force, if necessary, against the contumacious party.''

''So far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison with that of the United States, it serves to confirm the principle intended to be established. Whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordinary cases, it appears that the moment a cause of difference sprang up, capable of trying its strength, it failed. The controversies on the subject of religion, which in three instances have kindled violent and bloody contests, may be said, in fact, to have severed the league. The Protestant and Catholic cantons have since had their separate diets, where all the most important concerns are adjusted, and which have left the general diet little other business than to take care of the common bailages.''

''That separation had another consequence, which merits attention. It produced opposite alliances with foreign powers: of Berne, at the head of the Protestant association, with the United Provinces; and of Luzerne, at the head of the Catholic association, with France.''

==Federalist No. 20==
Federalist No. 20 is titled ''&quot;The Same Subject Continued: The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE United Netherlands are a confederacy of republics, or rather of aristocracies of a very remarkable texture, yet confirming all the lessons derived from those which we have already reviewed.''

''The union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states, and each state or province is a composition of equal and independent cities. In all important cases, not only the provinces but the cities must be unanimous.''

''The sovereignty of the Union is represented by the States-General, consisting usually of about fifty deputies appointed by the provinces. They hold their seats, some for life, some for six, three, and one years; from two provinces they continue in appointment during pleasure.''

''The States-General have authority to enter into treaties and alliances; to make war and peace; to raise armies and equip fleets; to ascertain quotas and demand contributions. In all these cases, however, unanimity and the sanction of their constituents are requisite. They have authority to appoint and receive ambassadors; to execute treaties and alliances already formed; to provide for the collection of duties on imports and exports; to regulate the mint, with a saving to the provincial rights; to govern as sovereigns the dependent territories. The provinces are restrained, unless with the general consent, from entering into foreign treaties; from establishing imposts injurious to others, or charging their neighbors with higher duties than their own subjects. A council of state, a chamber of accounts, with five colleges of admiralty, aid and fortify the federal administration.''

''The executive magistrate of the union is the stadtholder, who is now an hereditary prince. His principal weight and influence in the republic are derived from this independent title; from his great patrimonial estates; from his family connections with some of the chief potentates of Europe; and, more than all, perhaps, from his being stadtholder in the several provinces, as well as for the union; in which provincial quality he has the appointment of town magistrates under certain regulations, executes provincial decrees, presides when he pleases in the provincial tribunals, and has throughout the power of pardon.''

''As stadtholder of the union, he has, however, considerable prerogatives.''

''In his political capacity he has authority to settle disputes between the provinces, when other methods fail; to assist at the deliberations of the States-General, and at their particular conferences; to give audiences to foreign ambassadors, and to keep agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts.''

''In his military capacity he commands the federal troops, provides for garrisons, and in general regulates military affairs; disposes of all appointments, from colonels to ensigns, and of the governments and posts of fortified towns.''

''In his marine capacity he is admiral-general, and superintends and directs every thing relative to naval forces and other naval affairs; presides in the admiralties in person or by proxy; appoints lieutenant-admirals and other officers; and establishes councils of war, whose sentences are not executed till he approves them.''

''His revenue, exclusive of his private income, amounts to three hundred thousand florins. The standing army which he commands consists of about forty thousand men.''

''Such is the nature of the celebrated Belgic confederacy, as delineated on parchment. What are the characters which practice has stamped upon it? Imbecility in the government; discord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.''

''It was long ago remarked by Grotius, that nothing but the hatred of his countrymen to the house of Austria kept them from being ruined by the vices of their constitution.''

''The union of Utrecht, says another respectable writer, reposes an authority in the States-General, seemingly sufficient to secure harmony, but the jealousy in each province renders the practice very different from the theory.''

''The same instrument, says another, obliges each province to levy certain contributions; but this article never could, and probably never will, be executed; because the inland provinces, who have little commerce, cannot pay an equal quota.''

''In matters of contribution, it is the practice to waive the articles of the constitution. The danger of delay obliges the consenting provinces to furnish their quotas, without waiting for the others; and then to obtain reimbursement from the others, by deputations, which are frequent, or otherwise, as they can. The great wealth and influence of the province of Holland enable her to effect both these purposes.''

''It has more than once happened, that the deficiencies had to be ultimately collected at the point of the bayonet; a thing practicable, though dreadful, in a confedracy where one of the members exceeds in force all the rest, and where several of them are too small to meditate resistance; but utterly impracticable in one composed of members, several of which are equal to each other in strength and resources, and equal singly to a vigorous and persevering defense.''

''Foreign ministers, says Sir William Temple, who was himself a foreign minister, elude matters taken ad referendum, by tampering with the provinces and cities. In 1726, the treaty of Hanover was delayed by these means a whole year. Instances of a like nature are numerous and notorious.''

''In critical emergencies, the States-General are often compelled to overleap their constitutional bounds. In 1688, they concluded a treaty of themselves at the risk of their heads. The treaty of Westphalia, in 1648, by which their independence was formerly and finally recognized, was concluded without the consent of Zealand. Even as recently as the last treaty of peace with Great Britain, the constitutional principle of unanimity was departed from. A weak constitution must necessarily terminate in dissolution, for want of proper powers, or the usurpation of powers requisite for the public safety. Whether the usurpation, when once begun, will stop at the salutary point, or go forward to the dangerous extreme, must depend on the contingencies of the moment. Tyranny has perhaps oftener grown out of the assumptions of power, called for, on pressing exigencies, by a defective constitution, than out of the full exercise of the largest constitutional authorities.''

''Notwithstanding the calamities produced by the stadtholdership, it has been supposed that without his influence in the individual provinces, the causes of anarchy manifest in the confederacy would long ago have dissolved it. &quot;Under such a government,&quot; says the Abbe Mably, &quot;the Union could never have subsisted, if the provinces had not a spring within themselves, capable of quickening their tardiness, and compelling them to the same way of thinking. This spring is the stadtholder.&quot; It is remarked by Sir William Temple, &quot;that in the intermissions of the stadtholdership, Holland, by her riches and her authority, which drew the others into a sort of dependence, supplied the place.&quot;''

''These are not the only circumstances which have controlled the tendency to anarchy and dissolution. The surrounding powers impose an absolute necessity of union to a certain degree, at the same time that they nourish by their intrigues the constitutional vices which keep the republic in some degree always at their mercy.''

''The true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of these vices, and have made no less than four regular experiments by EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLIES, convened for the special purpose, to apply a remedy. As many times has their laudable zeal found it impossible to UNITE THE PUBLIC COUNCILS in reforming the known, the acknowledged, the fatal evils of the existing constitution. Let us pause, my fellow-citizens, for one moment, over this melancholy and monitory lesson of history; and with the tear that drops for the calamities brought on mankind by their adverse opinions and selfish passions, let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to Heaven, for the propitious concord which has distinguished the consultations for our political happiness.''

''A design was also conceived of establishing a general tax to be administered by the federal authority. This also had its adversaries and failed.''

''This unhappy people seem to be now suffering from popular convulsions, from dissensions among the states, and from the actual invasion of foreign arms, the crisis of their distiny. All nations have their eyes fixed on the awful spectacle. The first wish prompted by humanity is, that this severe trial may issue in such a revolution of their government as will establish their union, and render it the parent of tranquillity, freedom and happiness: The next, that the asylum under which, we trust, the enjoyment of these blessings will speedily be secured in this country, may receive and console them for the catastrophe of their own.''

''I make no apology for having dwelt so long on the contemplation of these federal precedents. Experience is the oracle of truth; and where its responses are unequivocal, they ought to be conclusive and sacred. The important truth, which it unequivocally pronounces in the present case, is that a sovereignty over sovereigns, a government over governments, a legislation for communities, as contradistinguished from individuals, as it is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is subversive of the order and ends of civil polity, by substituting VIOLENCE in place of LAW, or the destructive COERCION of the SWORD in place of the mild and salutary COERCION of the MAGISTRACY.'' 

''PUBLIUS.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Before learning the language, it must be noted that the Chinese language is completely different from English, or most of the languages in the world. It is not an alphabetic language. Its characters/words are not strung up in any linear way in any alphabets. Instead, each character takes its own form, and consists of various strokes. Yet there is still a system in the characters as well as language, however different from Western writing systems.

The grammar of Chinese is also quite distinct from European languages. It is important not to attempt to use European ideas to analyse the language lest misconceptions will form. Some linguists had tried to use European linguistics to analyse the Chinese language, only to result in unnecessary complications (e.g. there is no tense in Chinese) and awkward results when viewed by a native Chinese speaker.

Likewise, some courses teaching Chinese had attempted to teach only the romanized versions. This might be easier to learners as the language now becomes an alphabetical one, yet this is strongly not recommended. Although the Chinese government had introduced a system of romanizing the Mandarin by its pronunciation (pīn yīn), it is impractical to know only this system. In China, the pīn yīn is used only as a reference of pronunciation - the same relationship between the English language and the IPA. Just like you won't write /ðɪs ɪz æn ˈæ.pl̩/ instead of &quot;This is an apple&quot; in English, nor do Chinese people write their language in pīn yīn (however, certain Chinese scholars, writers and politicians have from time to time advocated a move away from Chinese characters to the Latin alphabet for Chinese native speakers).

==Characters==
===Overview===
Chinese characters are often described as &quot;pictographs&quot;, as each character can be rhetorically described as &quot;pictures&quot; denoting the meaning of that particular &quot;picture&quot; (more technically, characters can be termed &quot;ideographs&quot; or &quot;sinograms&quot;). This can be correct in some sense, and each character has its own unique appearance, pronunciation, meaning, and even its own story. Learners are advised to read [[Written Chinese/Liù Shū|this article]] in the appendix in order to have a general idea of the origin of Chinese characters, which can help systematizing the vast unique Chinese characters.

Despite the uniqueness of every Chinese character, you will find that the characters do share common parts. For example, after learning the character 口 (mouth) and 馬 (horse), you will find that learning the character 嗎 (question marker) becomes very easy as you only need to combine your previous-learned materials together. It is, thus, important to train yourself to remember Chinese characters by their parts, not stroke by stroke, or you might find the need of learning every single character with great effort.

===Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese===
Contemporary Chinese is written in either traditional or simplified characters. Character simplification has been a process in the evolution of the written language, and the current set of simplified characters was introduced in 1956. It is in use in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia, while the traditional characters are widely used in [[w:Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[w:Macau|Macau]] and [[w:Taiwan|Taiwan]]. 

Strictly speaking, even in the areas using the traditional characters, people do make use of a number of simplified characters in their writings, particularly in ad-hoc handwritten signs, or notes taken during classes.

However, we're going to cover the Traditional Chinese characters in this course. Although the Simplified Chinese system is easier to write and widely-used, it sacrifices many elements of the original Chinese characters. You are recommended to study the few &quot;rules&quot; used for the simplification process after you have familiarized yourself with the Chinese language, and know Simplified Chinese as a reference. Nevertheless, if you want to convert Traditional Chinese characters to Simplified ones, or vice versa, this [http://www.khngai.com/chinese/tools/convert.php converter] could help you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Western theory is based on the findings of the ancient [[Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] based on the vibrations of a string. 

The [[fundamental]] frequency is the frequency where the entire string vibrates backwards and forwards with two nodes at the ends where the string is tied down.  To try this, hold a spring between yourself and a partner and rocking it back and forth steadily until the entire spring sways without being disrupted.  This is the fundamental frequency. 

In Western music, the primary reference tone is the pitch A above middle C, with a fundamental frequency of 440Hz. In twelve-tone equal temperament, all other tones are related to this pitch according to the formula: &lt;math&gt;F(n) = 440 \times 2^{\frac{n}{12}} &lt;/math&gt;  

The first [[overtone]] (also known as the second [[harmonic]]) occurs when the length of a string is halved when the tension and density of the string is unchanged.  The frequency of the second harmonic is twice that of the first.  The frequency of the third harmonic is three times that of the fundamental and so on.  

It is not important to understand all of the physics of this, but it is important to remember that modern music is based of the harmonic series.  The further something is from the fundamental on the harmonic series, the less [[consonant]] it is said to be.  While typically [[consonant]] notes are the unison, octave, fifth, sixth, and third and [[dissonant]] notes the second, seventh, and tritone, as well as all augmented or diminished intervals, consonance is now considered a relative matter based on the harmonic series and context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Strokes==
Chinese characters are made up of strokes, in the same way that English words are made up of letters. These strokes are easily learned but not easily mastered; Chinese Calligraphy is an art in Chinese culture.
The image below shows all strokes that all Chinese characters are made up of, and how they look in two different writing media: the strokes on the left are written with an ink brush, and the strokes on the right are written with an ordinary ball-point pen.

[[Image:chinese strokes.gif]]

The following diagram shows you how to write these strokes. It's quite straight-forward: just start at the red dot, and trace the strokes as shown with your pen. Repeat this until you can write these strokes at ease, with the exact shape as shown.

[[Image:Write chinese strokes.gif]]

==Character formations==
The Chinese characters should be written at the correct scale; doing otherwise results in characters that are not only imprecise but incorrect. Chinese characters are just like English letters in this respect: the vertical line in the English letter &quot;d&quot;, for example, would never be three times the height of the circle.

Chinese characters can be thought of as contained in invisible blocks, and further divided in several ways in proportion to these blocks. Look at the following diagram for details.

[[Image:Chinese Characters.gif]]

These formations can be in any proportion, depending on the complexity and amount of strokes in different places in the characters. Be aware of this feature, for scale is one of the keys to writing nice Chinese characters. The following diagram illustrates some of the examples.

[[Image:Chinese Characters2.gif]]

These formations can also be included in one another to form other characters. The following diagram illustrates this feature with the same set of characters.

==Introduction==

The Korean writing system ([[w:Hangul|Hangeul]]) has some basic principles that are easy to master.

==Writing Korean letters==

===Consonants===

When writing Korean consonants ([[wikt:자음|자음]], ''jaeum''), the general rule is to start at the top left corner and work down to the bottom right.  The topmost horizontal stroke is usually first, followed by any vertical strokes.  The images below show the generally accepted stroke order:

[[Image:Giuk_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Niun_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Digut_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Riul_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Mium_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Biup_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Siut_stroke_order.gif]]

[[Image:Iung_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Jigut_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Chiut_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Kiuk_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Tiut stroke order.gif]]
[[Image:Piup_stroke_order.gif]]
[[Image:Hiut_stroke_order.gif]]

For double characters, such as ㅃ and ㅉ, simply write the corresponding single character twice, close together, using the same stroke order.  Once proficiency in writing has been developed, one may develop shortcuts or different forms of short-hand or cursive, for personal use.  For example, ㄹ is often written similar to a backwards S as one stroke.

===Vowels===

With vowels ([[wikt:모음|모음]], ''moeum''), the general rule is to move from left to right and top to bottom.  If the character is a digraph with both horizontal and vertical components, the horizontal vowel is written first, followed by the appending vertical vowel to the right:

[[Image:Korean_vowel_strokes.gif]]

==Syllables==
In [[w:Hangul|Hangeul]], words are divided into blocks of characters, each block representing one syllable.  For example, the word for the Korean dietary staple, kimchi, has two syllables and is thus divided into two blocks of hangul characters:

{|
|- align=center
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| [[wikt:ㄱ|ㄱ]]
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| [[wikt:ㅣ|ㅣ]]
| rowspan=2 | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot; rowspan=2 | [[wikt:ㅊ|ㅊ]]
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot; rowspan=2 | [[wikt:ㅣ|ㅣ]]
| rowspan=2 | =&gt;
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 김
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 치
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot; colspan=2 | [[wikt:ㅁ|ㅁ]]
|
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| colspan=2 | ''g i''&lt;br/&gt;''m''
|
| colspan=2 | ''ch i''
|
| colspan=2 | [[wikt:김치|김치]] (''gimchi'')
|}

In modern Korean, no ''jamo'' may stand alone. Instead, they are grouped into syllables, each with an '''initial''' consonant cluster ([[wikt:초성|초성]]), a '''medial''' vowel or diphthong ([[wikt:중성|중성]]), and optionally a '''final''' consonant cluster ([[wikt:종성|종성]]).

The placement or &quot;stacking&quot; of ''jamo'' in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.
* The components of complex ''jamo'' such as ㅄ or ㅝ are written left to right. 
* Medials are written under the initial, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the medial has a horizontal axis like ㅡ ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like ㅣ ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like ㅢ ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:

&lt;table cellpadding=5&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
{|
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#ffaaaa width=30 height=60|initial||bgcolor=#aaffaa width=30|medial
|}
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
{|
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#ffaaaa width=60 height=30|initial
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaffaa height=30|medial
|}
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
{|
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#ffaaaa width=30 height=30|initial
|bgcolor=#aaffaa width=30 rowspan=2|2nd&lt;br&gt;med.
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaffaa height=30|1st med.
|}
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt; 

* A final ''jamo'', if there is one, is always written at the bottom, under the medial:

&lt;table cellpadding=5&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
{|
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#ffaaaa width=30 height=40|initial
|bgcolor=#aaffaa width=30|medial
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaaaff height=20 colspan=2|final
|}
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
{|
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#ffaaaa width=60 height=20|initial
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaffaa height=20|medial
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaaaff height=20|final
|}
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
{|
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#ffaaaa width=30 height=20|initial
|bgcolor=#aaffaa width=30 rowspan=2|2nd&lt;br&gt;med.
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaffaa height=20|1st med.
|-align=center
|bgcolor=#aaaaff height=20 colspan=2|final
|}
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Blocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final.  The direction of the medial (horizontal or vertical) governs the placement of the initial.  These are the basic rules:

*Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: 읍
*Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: 쌍
*Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): 된
*Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: 밟

===Initial consonant placeholder===
When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the null initial ㅇ (called [[wikt:이응|이응]], ''ieung'') is used as a placeholder. (No placeholder is needed when there is no final.)

Examples:
* [[wikt:오이|오이]] (''oi'', &quot;cucumber&quot;)
* [[wikt:왕|왕]] (''wang'', &quot;king&quot;)

===Horizontal medials===

In a syllable with a horizontal medial (ㅛ, ㅗ, ㅡ, ㅜ, or ㅠ), the initial is written first, followed by the medial below it.  With ㄱ, the vowels look like this: 교, 고, 그, 구, 규.  Any other consonant behaves the same: 표, 소, 드, 부, 류. Notice how the protruding lines in each vowel nestle into any empty spaces in the consonant above it, particularly with ㄱ and ㅅ.

===Vertical medials===

In a syllable with a vertical medial (ㅑ, ㅏ, ㅕ, ㅓ, ㅣ, ㅐ, ㅔ, ㅒ, or ㅖ), the initial is written to the left of the vowel.  With ㄱ, the vowels look like this: 갸, 가, 겨, 거, 기.

===Wrapping medials===

If the vowel is a wrapping medial (i.e. written with the digraphs ㅘ, ㅝ, ㅚ, ㅟ, ㅢ, ㅙ, or ㅞ), the initial is always in the top-left area, with the diphthong surrounding the consonant on the bottom and right sides.  With ㄱ, the vowels look like this: 과, 궈, 괴, 귀, 긔, 괘, 궤. Notice how ㅗ fits into spaces of the consonant above it.

===Finals===

In a syllable with a final ([[wikt:받침|받침]], ''batchim''), the initial and medial are written in the top of the block, as described above, and the final is written below them.  In few cases, a syllable will contain two finals. Then, the final written below is simply the two characters next to each other.

Hello,

It's nice to see that somebody is working on improving the Korean lessons now. Thank you! &lt;br&gt;
I wonder whether it would be possible to make a step-by-step introduction to the Korean script, as is being done with [[Modern Greek]]. I believe that this method works much better than just listing all the consonants and vowels. The basis for the Greek writing lessons was an effort to think up a lot of words and (place) names that sound similar in Greek and English. See [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]]. Armed with such a list, it's possible to find an order for the introduction of letters that does not introduce more than one letter at a time except at the very beginning. I'd be glad to help you if you'd like to develop something similar for Korean, however I don't speak any Korean, I can just read the script fairly well. I'd like to learn how to speak Korean, but I haven't yet found a good course. I know the very extensive free online course offered by the university of Sogang ([http://korean.sogang.ac.kr/]), but I haven't been able to study with it because the dialogues are spoken too quickly and I'm unable to distinguish the words and sounds as well as I expect to. Anyway, thank you for your efforts!

Not in this section, probably in another one, though.  The truth is, Hangul is best represented by tables for consonants, but I could see your point if we consider vowels, because they are more patterned.  I'll try to think of something, and any layout ideas would be helpful - [[User:Iamgravity|Iamgravity]] 06:17, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

Now testing an image, will later post everything in gallery mode. Any comments or suggestions welcome! -

features=|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]|}}

== Overview ==

A '''''Blood-Sucking Bugbear''''' is noted in passing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets/Chapter_11|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus_Hagrid|Hagrid]] mentions that his roosters are being killed by &quot;either foxes, or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear&quot;, and needs to ask the Headmaster for permission to put a charm around the henhouse.

== Extended description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

== Analysis ==

It is quite possible that this is only mentioned in order to point up the fact that roosters are being killed. The killing of the roosters is a clue to the nature of the occupant of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]].

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In fact, it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny_Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] who is killing the roosters, under the orders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom_Marvolo_Riddle|Tom Riddle]], acting through his diary. This is because a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] can be destroyed by the rooster's crow; if all the roosters have been killed, the Basilisk occupying the Chamber of Secrets will have a longer time when it can be allowed out to roam and hunt.

Again, it is this antipathy to roosters which is meant to give the reader an idea of what Hermione is looking for in the library, when it dawns on her what the monster in the Chamber must be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the personal income taxation computations, one counts all the income of individuals from different sources, and then subtracts the allowable deduction from that (those which are allowed by the [[H.M.R.C.]]) In the United Kingdom, the income sources are classified into three: Non-Savings Income, Savings Income &amp; U.K. Dividend.
For all three there are three bands suggested to divide/classify the levels of income, on which tax is liable to U.K. Government (of course we must take into account that taxation is one of the major sources of income for any government).
These bands are Starting Band, Basic Band and Higher Band.

== Preface to the First Edition ==

One of the many challenges facing the countries in the Asia-Pacific today is preparing their societies and governments for globalization and the information and communication revolution. Policy-makers, business executives, NGO activists, academics, and ordinary citizens are increasingly concerned with the need to make their societies competitive in the emergent information economy. 

The e-ASEAN Task Force and the UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) share the belief that with enabling information and communication technologies (ICTs), countries can face the challenge of the information age. With ICTs they can leap forth to higher levels of social, economic and political development. We hope that in making this leap, policy and decision-makers, planners, researchers, development practitioners, opinion-makers, and others will find this series of e-primers on the information economy, society, and polity useful. 

The e-primers aim to provide readers with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends, and issues associated with the information age. The primers are written in simple, easy-to-understand language. They provide examples, case studies, lessons learned, and best practices that will help planners and decision makers in addressing pertinent issues and crafting policies and strategies appropriate for the information economy. 

The present series of e-primers includes the following titles: 

#The Information Age 
#Nets, Webs and the Information Infrastructure 
#e-Commerce and e-Business 
#Legal and Regulatory Issues for the Information Economy 
#e-Government; 
#ICT and Education 
#Genes, Technology and Policy: An Introduction to Biotechnology 

These e-primers are also available online at http://www.eprimers.org. and http://www.apdip.net. 

The primers are brought to you by UNDP- APDIP, which seeks to create an ICT enabling environment through advocacy and policy reform in the Asia-Pacific region, and the e-ASEAN Task Force, an ICT for development initiative of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We welcome your views on new topics and issues on which the e-primers may be useful. 

Finally, we thank all who have been involved with this series of e-primers-writers, researchers, peer reviewers and the production team.

Imagining the future is always a chancy proposition. For the future almost always turns out differently from how it was imagined. Just think of all the movies made about the present 20 or even 10 years ago. They hardly got it right. 

The reason we fail to anticipate the future is simple enough—the many variables that affect the unfolding of history are never fully captured by analysts, activists, artists and scientists. 

Yet, we persist in imagining the future. We persist because we are motivated by what could be as much as by what has been. We persist because we have a stake in the future—we intend to live in it. 

Imagining a future is affirming a particular account of it. We imagine a future we want to live in. In looking at trends, in extrapolating, we make choices. Even when we take into account all variables, we give some variables more weight than others. Even when all outcomes are anticipated, we deem some outcomes more likely than others. This is not intellectual dishonesty. It is simply how things are. (To say otherwise is to be dishonest.) 

This primer on the information age, as well as the other primers in this series on the Information Economy, Society and Polity, is an act of imagination and affirmation of a future that is being shaped by information and communication technologies (ICTs). 

This particular primer begins with a review of the digital and the ICT revolutions and how these profound technological transformations are changing the economy, business, and the workplace. The primer also outlines the impact of the pervasiveness of ICTs on the individual, the family and society. The effects of technological change on the global order—the nation-state system and governance—are likewise considered. Finally, the primer charts the challenges arising from the widening divide between those who have access to ICT and those who do not. 

Ultimately, we imagine the information age in order that we can affect its becoming.</text>

==What is the digital revolution? ==

Technological breakthroughs have revolutionized communications and the spread of information. In 1875, for example, the invention of the telephone breached distance through sound. Between 1910 and 1920, the first AM radio stations began to broadcast sound. By the 1940s television was broadcasting both sound and visuals to a vast public. In 1943, the worlds first electronic computer was created. However, it was only with the invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s that computers became accessible to the public. In the 1990s, the Internet migrated from universities and research institutions to corporate headquarters and homes. 

All of these technologies deal with information storage and transmission. However, the one characteristic of computer technology that sets it apart from earlier analog technologies is that it is digital. Analog technologies incorporate a combination of light and sound waves to get messages across, while digital technology, with its system of discontinuous data or events, creates a universal model? to represent information that is expressed by almost anything using light and sound waves.{{tiacite|1}}

To use an analogy, a digital world is a world united by one language, a world where people from across continents share ideas with one another and work together to build projects and ideas. More voluminous and accurate information is accumulated and generated, and distributed in a twinkling to an audience that understands exactly what is said. This in turn allows the recipients of the information to use it for their own purposes, to create ideas and to redistribute more ideas. The result is progress. Take this scenario to a technological level all kinds of computers, equipment and appliances interconnected and functioning as one unit. Even today, we see telephones exchanging information with computers, and computers playing compressed audio data files or live audio data streams that play music over the Internet like radios. Computers can play movies and tune in to television. Some modern homes allow a person to control central lighting and air-conditioning through computers. These are just some of the features of a digital world. 

:'''Box 1. Wearable Computer Systems '''
{{TextBox|Wearable computers are entire systems that are carried by the user, from the CPU and hard drive, to the power supply and all input/output devices. Such systems are under development here at the (MIT) Media Lab, where we are also working to create prototypes of uniquely affective wearable systems. The size and weight of these wearable hardware systems are dropping, even as [their] durability is increasing. We are also designing clothing and accessories (such as watches, jewelry, etc.) into which these devices may be embedded to make them not only unobtrusive and comfortable to the user, but also invisible to others. 

Wearable computers allow us to create systems that go where the user goes, whether at the office, at home, or in line at the bank. More importantly, they provide a platform that can maintain constant contact with the user in the variety of ways that the system may require; they provide computing power for the all affective computing needs, from affect sensing to the applications that can interpret, understand and use the data; and they can store the applications and user input data in on-board memory. Finally, such systems can link to personal computers and to the Internet, providing the same versatility of communications and applications as most desktop computers. }}

==What is ICT? ==
ICT is short for information and communications technology. It refers to a broad field encompassing computers, communications equipment and the services associated with them. It includes the telephone, cellular networks, satellite communication, broadcasting media and other forms of communication. 

==What is the relationship between the digital revolution and the ICT revolution? ==
The digital and ICT revolutions are twin revolutions. To understand their relationship, let us look at the history of voice telephony. According to Robert W. Lucky, The crux of [Alexander Graham] Bells invention of the telephone in 1875 was the use of analog transmission—the voltage impressed on the line was proportional to the sound pressure at the microphone.{{tiacite|2}} The growth of the telephone was relatively slow; it was not until the 1920s that a national telephone network was established in the US. In the late 1940s, an alternative to analog transmission of voice was considered with pulse-code modulation (an encoded signal of pulses). This marked the start of digitization in telecommunications. 

However, it was only in 1961 that the first digital carrier system was installed. Digitization meant the widespread replacement of telephone operators with digital switches. In 1971 the first fiber optic cables suitable for communications were made, leading to efforts to send communications signals via light waves. (Light wave transmission systems are inherently digital.) By about 1989, ones and zeros had become the language of telephone networks in the US. Digitization was a critical development because with digital transmission noise and distortion were not allowed to accumulate, since the ones and zeros could be regularly restored (i.e., regenerated) by a succession of repeater sites along the transmission line.{{tiacite|3}} The outcome was clearer communications over longer distances at lower costs. 

Today, voice is translated into data packets, sent over networks to remote locations, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, and, upon receipt, translated back to voice. Even television is not immune to digitization. In the near future, television signals and television sets will be digital. It will also be possible to use the television to surf the Internet. The digital TV will allow people from different locations to chat with each other while watching a program. With everything becoming digital, television, voice telephony, and the Internet can use similar networks. The transmission of hitherto different services (telephony, television, internet) via the same digital network is also known as convergence. 

Cairncross observes that once the infrastructure and the hardware, be it a computer or a telephone or another device, have been set in place, the cost of communications and information exchange will be virtually zero. Distance will no longer decide the cost of communicating electronically.{{tiacite|4}} This explains why, for example, a three-minute transatlantic call that costs $0.84 today would probably have cost nearly $800 in todays money 50 years ago! 

:'''Box 2. Enter the Communication Satellite '''
{{TextBox|In the late 1970s and early 1980s, just as [Michael] Jordan appeared on the scene, commercial television began to jump over national boundaries. A decade later, NBA games, especially those of the Chicago Bulls, could be seen in ninety-three countries. This exposure was made possible by the direct broadcast satellite (DBS). .. DBS was to have a much greater impact on the day-to-day lives of people around the world than did the moon landing. Launched into orbit so it would float in space over the west coast of South America, the first broadcast satellite relayed information from specialists on health and education into previously isolated areas…. The experiment was so successful that private companies stepped in to launch their own satellites. The companies, as usual, made their profits by selling advertising. Thus new technology led the worlds people into a new era of globalization, paid for by new advertising.

The potential profit of [TV] markets skyrocketed in the 1980s when fiber optic cable carried information in light waves along a silicon wire that had the thinness of human hair. Compared with the copper wire it replaced, the silicon wire could transmit dozens of television programs at once instead of one or two … Digital compression technologies meanwhile increased the possible number of channels on a television set from dozens to 150 and even 500. A British firm developed the first round-the-world fiber optic system in 1991. 

Now the possibilities were breathtaking. A single direct-to-broadcast satellite could transmit to earth all of the Encyclopedia Britannica in less than a minute. The contents could even be picked up and placed before the viewer by a cable relay station whose cost in 1975 had been $125,000, but in 1980 was less than $4,000 because of the quick technological advances. Profits promised to have no limit. As cable and satellites created international television in the 1980s, so did advertising, whose profits for cable companies shot up more than ten times. 

These new systems seemed to resemble magic cash registers as they churned out the money. They also resembled dynamite as they blew apart governmental regulation and geographical boundaries. They did nothing less than change some of the fundamental ways nations officials behaved toward their citizens. }}

==What are the main characteristics of digital technology? ==
;Media Integrity: Data stored in analog formats cannot be reproduced without degradation. The more copies made, the worse the copies get. Digital data, on the other hand, do not suffer such deterioration with reproduction.{{tiacite|5}} For instance, movies, videos, music and audio files in digital format can be copied and distributed with a quality that is as good as the original. 

;Media Integration: One of the major limitations of many conventional technologies is their inability to combine media types. Telephones, for example, can send and receive only sound. Similarly, you can watch television and expect a character to answer a question you pose. However, with digital data, it is easy to combine media.{{tiacite|6}} Thus, phones with video, or interactive sound with pictures, become possible. Hence the term multimedia. 

;Flexible Interaction: The digital domain supports a great variety of interactions, including one-on-one conferences, one-to-many broadcasts, and everything in between. In addition, these interactions can be synchronous and in real time.{{tiacite|7}}

;Transactions: The ability to combine the transactional capability of computers and computer networks with digital media is another interactive advantage of the digital domain. Placing an order and finalizing a transaction becomes as easy as filling in an electronic form and clicking a button. Movies-on-demand (where you pay for movies that you choose to watch on your TV screen) is just around the corner. 

;Tailoring: Software developed for digital communications and interaction is designed so that users may tailor their use of the tool and the media in a manner not possible with conventional analog technologies.{{tiacite|8}}

;Editing: The conventional alternatives for manipulating text, sound, images, and video are almost always more cumbersome or limited than the new digital tools. Years ago, Francis Ford Coppola said that the day would come when his young daughter will take a home video camera and make films that would win film awards. Coppola’s prediction is fast becoming a reality. Computers with the right software and minimal hardware can do today what thousands of dollars worth of film and video editing equipment did in the past decades.

==What is the Internet? ==
The Internet is a network of networks. It is a global set of connections of computers that enables the exchange of data, news and opinion. Aside from being a communications medium, the Internet has become a platform for new ways of doing business, a better way for governments to deliver public services and an enabler of lifelong learning. 

Unlike the telephone, radio or television, the Internet is a many-to-many communication medium. John Gage argues that— 

:The Internet is not a thing, a place, a single technology, or a mode of governance: it is an agreement. In the language of those who build it, it is a protocol, a way of behaving. What is startling the world is the dramatic spread of this agreement, sweeping across all areas of commerce, communications, governance that rely on the exchange of symbols.{{tiacite|9}} 

The Internet has become the fastest growing mass medium. In only four years the number of Internet users has reached 50 million. In contrast, it took radio 38 years, television 13 years and the PC 16 years to reach the same milestone. Despite its explosive growth, however, less than 10% of the global population is online.

==Why is the Internet important? ==
The Internet, according to Lawrence Lessig, is an innovation commons, a shared resource that enables the creation of new and/or innovative goods and services.{{tiacite|10}}

The Internet can be likened to designer clay; its use is limited only by the imagination and skill of the designer. This unique characteristic is due to the fact that the Internet is designed using the end-to-end (e2e) principle. That is, the intelligence in the network is at the ends, and the main task of the network is to transmit data efficiently and flexibly between these ends. 

Lessig identifies at least three important consequences of an e2e network on innovation. First, because applications run on computers at the edge of the network, innovators with new applications need only to connect their computers to the network to let their applications run. Second, because the design is not optimized for any particular existing application, the network is open to innovation not originally imagined. Third, because the design has a neutral platform - in the sense that the network owner cannot discriminate against some packets and favor others - the network cannot discriminate against a new innovator design. 

The Internet as an innovation commons has made the transformation to the information age possible. As Christopher Coward notes, 

:Because of end-to-end, the Internet acts as a force for individual empowerment. It fosters entrepreneurship. And, as long as end-to-end is not violated, it is democratizing in the sense that it redistributes power from central authorities (governments and companies) to individuals. In the Internet Age, everyone can be a producer of content, create a new software application, or engage in global activities without the permission of a higher authority.{{tiacite|11}}

:'''Box 3. The Earth Will Don an Electronic Skin'''
{{TextBox|In the [21st] century, planet earth will don an electronic skin. It will use the Internet as a scaffold to support and transmit its sensations. This skin is already being stitched together. It consists of millions of embedded electronic measuring devices: thermostats, pressure gauges, pollution detectors, cameras, microphones, glucose sensors, EKGs, electroencephalographs. These will probe and monitor cities and endangered species, the atmosphere, our ships, highways and fleets of trucks, our conversations, our bodies even our dreams. 

Ten years from now, there will be trillions of such telemetric systems, each with a microprocessor brain and a radio. Consultant Ernst &amp; Young predicts that by 2010, there will be 10,000 telemetric devices for every human being on the planet. They'll be in constant contact with one another. But the communication wont be at our plodding verbal pace.Fifty kilobits per second is slow,huffs Horst L. Stormer, a Nobel prize-winning physicist employed by Lucent Technologies Inc. Bell Laboratories and Columbia University. Machines will prefer to talk at gigabit speeds and higher so fast that humans will catch only scattered snippets of the discussion. 

What will the earths new skin permit us to feel? How will we use its surges of sensation? For several years maybe for a decade there will be no central nervous system to manage this vast signaling network. Certainly there will be no central intelligence. But many scientists believe that some qualities of self-awareness will emerge once the Net is sensually enhanced and emulates the complexity of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_35/b3644024.htm Neil Gross, ''The Earth Will Don an Electronic Skin'', in ''Businessweek Online'' (August 30, 1999)]. Accessed 28 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==What is Moores Law? Metcalfes Law? Internet time? ==
Moores Law and Metcalfes Law are insightful observations into the power of the personal computer and the Internet. 

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, the chip making company, postulated that the computing power of a microchip doubles every 18 months. This means that the power of the computer chip keeps growing as its size shrinks. As the chip becomes smaller and more powerful without significant price increases, so does the personal computer. Many associate Moore’s Law with the widespread availability of powerful PCs at constant (if not lower) prices. It was used as an explanation for the rapid changes in the PC industry, which in turn affected the whole economy. 

Robert Metcalfe, co-inventor of the Ethernet, the local area networking (LAN) technology, observed that a network’s value grows proportionately with the number of users. 

Internet time refers to the fact that with the Internet, more intensive activities are possible. Indeed, in business Internet time can be the source of competitiveness. 

Moore’s Law, Metcalfe’s Law and Internet time are pithy ways of expressing the dynamism that characterizes developments in the ICT sector and in the areas being transformed by ICT. Ed Lozowska best puts the rapid changes in the ICT sector in perspective: 

:If, over the past 30 years, transportation technology had improved at the same rate as information technology with respect to size, cost, performance, and energy efficiency, then an automobile would be the size of a toaster, cost $200, go 100,000 miles per hour, travel 150,000 miles on a gallon of fuel.{{tiacite|12}}

==Why are these technological revolutions important? ==
New technologies transform our lives “by inventing new, undreamed of things and making them in new, undreamed of ways�?, says the economist Richard Lipsey.{{tiacite|13}}

Imagine what will happen when the cost of a long distance telephone call becomes as low as the cost of a local call? Or, when you can get a driving license at a time and place of your own choosing? Or, when you can bank from the comfort of your own living room? In some countries, ICT is already making these happen. Many believe that the current technological revolution may in time exceed the Industrial Revolution in terms of social significance.{{tiacite|14 }}

Lipsey, who studies the relationship between technological change and economic development, suggests that the introduction of new technologies can have the following effects on society{{tiacite|15}}: 

* Initial productivity slowdown and delayed productivity payoff from the new technologies 
* Destruction of human capital (as many old skills are no longer wanted) 
* Technological unemployment (temporary but serious) 
* Widening disparities in the distribution of income, which tends to be temporary until the supply of labor catches up to the new mix of skill requirements 
* Big changes in regional patterns of industrial location (globalization) 
* Big changes in required education 
* Big changes in infrastructure (e.g., the information highway) 
* Big changes in rules and regulations (intellectual property, antimonopoly, etc.) 
* Big changes in the way we live and interact with each other

==What are some of the consequences of the digital and ICT revolutions? ==

First, let us look at the effects of the digital revolution. James Beniger explains: 

:The progressive digitization of mass media and telecommunications content begins to blur earlier distinctions between the communication of information and its processing…, as well as between people and machines. Digitization makes communications from persons to machines, between machines, and even from machines to persons as easy as it is between persons. Also blurred are the distinctions among information types: numbers, words, pictures, and sounds, and eventually tastes, odors, and possibly even sensations, all might one day be stored, processed, and communicated in the same digital format.{{tiacite|16}}

On a societal level, the digital and ICT revolutions make possible better and cheaper access to knowledge and information. This speeds up transactions and processes and reduces their cost, which in turn benefit citizens and consumers. 

The ability of ICTs to traverse time and distance allows human beings to interact with each other in new ways. Distance is no longer a consideration. As Giddens observes, 

:With the advent of the communications revolution, distance has a different relationship to self-immediacy and experience than it used to have. Distance isn’t simply wiped out, but when you have a world where the value of the money in your pocket is affected immediately by ongoing electronic transactions happening many miles away it’s simply a different situation from how the world was in the past.{{tiacite|17}} 

Put another way, so what if two people are located in different time zones? They can still talk, negotiate, and make deals as though they were face to face. As the sociologist Manuel Castells has noted, “Technological revolutions are all characterized by their pervasiveness, that is by their penetration of all domains of human activity, not as an exogenous source of impact, but as the fabric in which such activity is woven.�?{{tiacite|18}}
What else can go wrong???

==Will all countries and peoples be swept up in the technological revolution? ==
The revolution will affect some countries earlier than it will others. For ICT to weave its magic, it must find a hospitable social and political environment. New technologies threaten existing power and economic relationships, and those that benefit from these old relationships put up barriers to the spread of the new technologies. Note, for example, how the music industry has resisted digital audio tapes and Napster. Moreover, laws can deter (or encourage) the spread of new technologies. For example, the lack of legal recognition for digital contracts and digital signatures is holding back electronic commerce. 

Debora Spar states that “life along the technological frontier moves through four distinct phases: innovation, commercialization, creative anarchy, and rules.�?{{tiacite|19}} While individualism and the absence of government are characteristics of the first three stages, government—with its rule making and enforcing capability—is a key player in the fourth stage. This is because 

:The establishment of property rights is one of the most crucial events along the technological frontier. It allows the market to unfold in a predictable way, and gives pioneers a hefty dose of ownership and security. Most important, perhaps, the creation of property rights also marks the difference between pioneers and pirates, between those whose claim on the new technology is legitimate and those whose claim is not.{{tiacite|20}}

It is important to remember that technology is shaped by society as much as it shapes society. Thus, those interested in harnessing the power of new technologies should help create the right environment for it to flourish.

== What is the information economy? == 
An information economy is where the productivity and competitiveness of units or agents in the economy (be they firms, regions or nations) depend mainly on their capacity to generate, process, and apply efficiently knowledge-based information.{{tiacite|21}} It is also described as an economy where information is both the currency and the product. 

While we have always relied on information exchange to do our jobs and run our lives, the information economy is different in that it can collect more relevant information at the appropriate time. Consequently, production in the information economy can be fine tuned in ways heretofore undreamed of. What makes information plentiful in this economy is the pervasive use of information and communications technology. 

:'''Box 4. Banking Without Boundaries '''
{{TextBox|For the first time in 300 years, the very nature of banking has changed. We still handle money, but information, not money, is now the lifeblood of our industry. From what was essentially a transaction-based business, where customers came to you (or didn’t), banking has to make the leap into what is essentially a sale-and-marketing culture. In the new culture, a bank is defined almost solely by its ability to add value to the customer relationship, which breaks down into acquiring, analyzing, integrating, and leveraging of information about, from, and for the benefit of each individual customer. 

The last (but obviously not the least) of our fundamental changes goes to the very heart of how banking is done. What used to happen only in branches (and only during ‘bankers hours’) can now happen not just anywhere in the world at any time of the day or night, but also through just about any delivery channel a customer cares to select—the automated banking machine, the telephone, the personal computer, even the television set. }}
:Source: Lloyd Darlington “Banking Without Boundaries: How the banking industry is transforming itself for the digital age” in Don Tapscott, Alex Lowy and David Ticoll (eds.), Blueprint for the Digital Economy: Creating Wealth in the Era of e-Business (New York: McGraw Hill), 115.

==What are the main features of the information economy? ==
The information economy is global. A historically new reality, the global economy has the capacity to work as a unit in real time on a planetary scale.{{tiacite|22}} Corporations and firms now have a worldwide base for skilled labor to tap. Capital flows freely between countries, and countries can utilize this capital in real time. 

However, some critics claim that a true global economy has yet to be achieved. Stephen Cohen observes that the mobility of labor is undermined by people’s xenophobia and stricter immigration laws. Multinational corporations still maintain their assets and strategic command centers in their home nations, and capital is still limited by banking and finance laws. 

Castells, however, argues that even if globalization has not yet been fully realized, it will only be a matter of time before this happens. Globalization will be affected by government regulations and policies, which will affect international boundaries and the structure of the global economy.{{tiacite|23}}

A second characteristic of the information economy is that it is highly productive. William Nordhaus of the US National Bureau of Economic Research states that: 

:Productivity growth in the new economy sectors has made a significant contribution to economy-wide productivity growth. In the business sector (between 1999 and 2001), labor-productivity growth excluding the new economy sectors was 2.24 percent per year as compared to 3.19 percent per year including the new economy. Of the 1.82 percentage point increase in labor-productivity growth in the last three years relative to the earlier period, 0.65 percentage point was due to the new economy sectors. The contribution of the new economy was slightly larger for well-measured output because that sector is smaller than the business economy.{{tiacite|24}} 

Some critics argue that there is no relationship between profitability and investment in ICT. Castells looks into the history of productivity growth in advanced market economies and observes a downward trend of productivity growth starting roughly around the time that the information technology revolution was taking shape in the early 1970s. According to him, this decline was particularly marked in all countries for serviced activities, where new information-processing devices could be thought to have increased productivity. However, manufacturing productivity presents a different picture. Manufacturing productivity in the US and Japan increased dramatically in 1988-1989 by an annual average of 3% and 4.1% respectively, and productivity increased at a faster pace than during the 1990s.{{tiacite|25}} Castells concludes that economic statistics do not adequately capture the movements of the new information economy, precisely because of the broad scope of transformation under the impact of information technology and related organizational change. There may be a diffusion from information technology, manufacturing, telecommunications, and financial services into manufacturing services at large, and then into business services. 

A third characteristic of the information economy is the change in the manner of obtaining profits. Robert Reich observes that profits in the old economy came from economies of scale—long runs of more or less identical products. Thus, we had factories, assembly lines, and industries. Now profits come from speed of innovation and the ability to attract and keep customers. Where before the winners were big corporations, now the winners are small, highly flexible groups that devise great ideas, develop trustworthy branding for themselves and their products, and market these effectively.{{tiacite|26}} The winning competitors are those who are first at providing lower prices and higher value through intermediaries of trustworthy brands. But the winning is temporary, and the race is never over. Those in the lead cannot stop innovating lest they fall behind the competition.{{tiacite|27}}

==Is the information economy different from the “knowledge economy”, the “new economy”, or the “network economy”? ==

All these terms are used interchangeably, although the various concepts tend to emphasize different aspects of the phenomenon—like “knowledge” instead of “information” or “network” as opposed to “new”. Peter Drucker describes the information revolution as a knowledge revolution. The key, he says, is not electronics but cognitive science.{{tiacite|28}} The software used for computers merely reorganizes traditional work, which had been based on experience. This is done through the application of knowledge, in particular systematic, logical analysis. Setting up an IT structure is not enough. To maintain leadership in the new economy, the social position of knowledge professionals and the social acceptance of their values should be guaranteed. 

The knowledge economy is also a networked economy. The concept stresses the important role of links among individuals, groups and corporations in the new economy. It has been argued that networks have always been an ideal organizing tool due to their inherent flexibility and adaptability. However, traditional networks were not designed to coordinate functions beyond a certain size and complexity. This early limitation has been overcome with the introduction of ICTs, particularly the Internet, where the flexibility and adaptability of networks are brought to the fore, and their evolutionary nature is asserted.{{tiacite|29}}

==What is Coase Law? And how is it related to the ICT revolution and the information economy? ==

Nobel Laureate for Economics Ronald Coase noted that a firm tends to expand until “the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market.”{{tiacite|30}} Coase also believed that the law of diminishing returns applies to firm size: Big firms are complicated and they find it hard to manage resources efficiently. Small companies often do things more cheaply than big ones. Therefore, if it’s cheaper to perform a transaction within a firm, it usually stays there. However, if it’s cheaper to go to the marketplace, then firms go to external suppliers. Thus, a car maker (like Toyota) will buy car batteries from a supplier rather than manufacture batteries in-house if it is easier to do so. 

ICT reduces transaction costs significantly. Large and diverse groups of people can now more easily and more cheaply gain near real-time access to the information they need to make sound decisions and to coordinate complex activities.{{tiacite|31}} Firms can now downsize to the point of producing their main competence and purchasing everything else they need from outside. Thus, instead of massive corporations, what are emerging are small highly focused corporations that farm out production to their allies. This is also known as network production. 

:'''Box 5. Furiously Fast Fashions (excerpts) '''
{{TextBox|… Hong Kong is the center of the garment outsourcing industry. Most of the companies located there own and run factories across Asia that weave, cut and sew garments. But Li &amp; Fung is a different kind of outsourcer… the 95-year-old trading house that once sold ceramics and fireworks overseas doesn’t own a stitch when it comes to making garments. No factories, no machines, no fabrics. Instead, Li &amp; Fung deal only in information, relying on a far-flung network of more than 7,500 suppliers in 37 countries, from Madagascar to China to Guatemala. “There are no secrets in the actual manufacturing. I mean, a shirt is a shirt,” says William Fung, the managing director. “We would rather build on something proprietary, like what information it takes to make that shirt faster or more efficiently.” 

As an order comes in … Li &amp; Fung uses personalized Web sites and e-mail to fine-tune specifications with the customer. It then takes those instructions and feeds them into its intranet to find the right supplier of raw materials and the right factory for assembling the clothes. 

… (Li &amp; Fung’s) division manager Ada Liu explains how she juggled a pants order for a major American clothing brand. She had the fabric woven in China because the factories there could dye it the dark green indigo she needed, and she chose fastenings from factories in Hong Kong and Korea because they are the most durable. Then she sent the raw materials to Guatemala for sewing. “For simple things like pants with four seams, Guatemala is great.” says Liu. “They can do things quickly, and it’s close to the U.S. Delivery takes only a few days.” And if production problems arise in Guatemala, Li &amp; Fung can tap into its worldwide network and send the order to another country to avoid delays. 

As a garment moves through production, retailers can make last-minute changes to orders on the Web site, which tracks the entire production process. About five years ago, when the company was run by phone and fax, Li &amp; Fung would get an order for 50,000 khaki cargo pants - and deliver the goods five months later. Now, until the material is woven, the customer can cancel the order online. Until the fabric is dyed, the retailer can change the color. Until it is cut, the client can change the design or size. “There are generally fewer mistakes and disputes now when we have to make changes because the communication is clearer. That makes [adjustments] easier to do,” explains Liu. }}

==What is e-commerce? ==

The ICT revolution has transformed not only how (and where) goods are produced but also how commodities are exchanged. E-commerce is buying and selling over the Internet or any transaction concluded through an information network involving the transfer of ownership or rights to use goods or services. More precisely, it includes all business transactions that use electronic communications and digital information processing technology to create, transform and redefine relationships for value creation between organizations, and between organizations and individuals. 

The different types of e-commerce are: business-to-business (B2B); business-to-consumer (B2C); business-to-government (B2G); consumer-to-consumer (C2C); and mobile commerce (m-commerce).

==What will happen to agriculture in the information economy? ==
Like the production and exchange of commodities, agriculture will also be transformed by ICT. ICTs will allow farmers to have more accurate information on the factors that are needed to increase crop yield. “Precision farming” or farm management using ICTs will become the norm rather than the exception. 

We can also expect better crops and livestock as a result of agricultural biotechnology. The term “biotechnology” broadly includes “any technique that uses living organisms, or parts of such organisms, to make or modify products, to improve plants or animals, or to develop microorganisms for specific use.”{{tiacite|32}}

The potential applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are varied and promising. These include: 
:(a) improved yield from crops; 
:(b) reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses; 
:(c) increased nutritional qualities of food crops; 
:(d) improved taste, texture or appearance of food; 
:(e) reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals; 
:(f) production of novel substances in crop plants. 


:'''Box 6. Farming Goes Into Space '''
{{TextBox|For most of the twentieth century, farming has been somewhat of an inexact science, more a matter of a farmer developing an innate understanding of the nuances of his land and thereby planting and harvesting his fields accordingly. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, sophisticated technological advancements offer today’s farmers a variety of methods to increase crop yields, selectively apply pesticides, and lower associated costs. The technology that is enabling this revolution in farming processes is on the ground, in the tractors, but it is also up in the sky, circling the globe in a geo-synchronous orbit 12,000 miles above the planet’s surface. 

Twenty-four satellites orbit the Earth, making up the Global Positioning System (GPS) System. These satellites have the ability to pinpoint the location of an object on the ground within a few centimeters. Developed by the Department of Defense for military purposes, GPS has now been opened up for civilian use. In fact, civilian applications have come to outnumber military one almost 10 to 1. Among the former, precision farming seems poised to become the next great application area for GPS. 

How, specifically, are these new technologies helping farmers to improve farming efficiencies? At this point, precision farming can be broken down into three major areas: crop, soil, and positioning sensors — including remote and vehicle-mounted, on-the-go tools that detect moisture levels, protein, water stress, and disease or weed infestations; machine controls that guide field equipment and can vary the rate, mix, and location of water, seeds, nutrients, or chemical sprays; and computerized GIS maps and databases that process the data produced by the first category of tools and generates the “prescriptions” that drive the second category. 

Although improvements can and are being made in the first and second categories, their capabilities are well developed, well defined, increasingly integrated, user-friendly, and ever more affordable. The critical component, and the one that can realize the greatest benefits for farmers, is found in the final category: GIS-based, decision-support software that can guide management practices. It is in this third area where more work remains to be done: building the databases, refining the analytical tools, and increasing the site-specific agronomic knowledge and expertise of the community. }}

==Did the information economy end with the dot-com crash? ==

Not at all. If we look at the history of technology and development, we will see that the dot-com bust is part of the normal pattern of events in any technological revolution. 

The economist Joseph Schumpeter suggests that a technology revolution starts with the introduction of one or more technologies that enables the new cluster. 

The new technology cluster, at first little noticed, achieves successes in early demonstrations. Technical people start small companies based on the new ideas. These new companies compete intensely in this early turbulent phase, when government regulation is largely absent, and as successes mount in a technical free-for-all environment. The promise of extraordinary profit looms. The public begins to speculate. 

The middle phase sees a sustained build out or golden age of the technology, during which the technology becomes the engine of growth for the economy. Large companies and oligopolies reign, and the period is one of confidence and prosperity. 

In the last phase, the technology matures. Technological possibilities are saturated, production moves to places on the periphery, and complacency sets in. Profits at home are low, and entrepreneurs start scouting for new opportunities. The economy becomes ripe for the next revolution.{{tiacite|33}}

It was not the information economy that died with the dot-com crash. Only the hype died. The downturn in ICTs and the dot-com crash simply ended the first phase. We are now just entering the middle phase, the “sustained build out or golden age of the technology”.</text>

==Will the widespread introduction of ICT lead to mass unemployment? ==

Jeremy Rifkin suggests that the rise of productivity as a consequence of ICT deployment affects the amount of time worked in two ways.{{tiacite|34}} First, labor and time saving technologies have allowed companies to eliminate and dismiss workers en masse. Second, those who manage to hold their jobs are made to work longer hours. For firms a smaller workforce means saving on the cost of providing benefits such as health care. 

But the history of the industrial revolution suggests that workers will not disappear; only particular kinds of workers will. Peter Drucker gives us a clue on what kinds of work will disappear. According to Drucker, “the Information Revolution has routinized traditional processes in an untold number of areas.” {{tiacite|35}} Just as the industrial revolution mechanized weaving, the information revolution will replace what has been automated by robots. The scenario is not much different from what transpired in previous eras and technology revolutions. 

There will always be room for workers, but the areas or fields of demand will change. 

==What kind of workers will be needed? ==

The breadth of new work in the information age is immense. New workers can be
seen in traditional industries (old workers renewed), in new ICT-related services and
content provision (the information workers), in infrastructure development and maintenance of the information economy (information managers and entrepreneurs) and in a host of related areas. 

Among the most in demand and sought after workers are information technology (IT) professionals. According to a 1999 US Commerce Department study: “For more than 15 years, employment in the core IT occupations—computer scientists, computer engineers, system analysts and computer programmers—has grown at an astounding pace. The growth rate for computer scientists and system analysts has even accelerated in recent years.”{{tiacite|36}} The recent downturn has not changed this trend; it has only slowed down the demand. 

But it is not only IT professionals who will thrive. What Robert Reich calls “symbolic analysts”—engineers, attorneys, scientists, professors, executives, journalists, consultants and other “mind workers” who engage in processing information and symbols for a living—will occupy a privileged position in that they can sell their services in the global economy. In an economy where information is critical, symbolic analysts or “knowledge workers” will constitute an elite group. 

:'''Box 7. The New Workforce (excerpts) '''
{{TextBox|...[T]he knowledge workers, collectively, are the new capitalists. Knowledge has become the key resource, and the only scarce one. This means that knowledge workers collectively own the means of production….

Effective knowledge is specialized. That means knowledge workers need access to an organization—a collective that brings together an array of knowledge workers and applies their specialism to a common end-product. … 

Knowledge workers… see themselves as equal to those who retain their services, as ‘professionals’ rather than ‘employees’. The knowledge society is a society of seniors and juniors rather than bosses and subordinates. 

… although women have always worked, since time immemorial the jobs they have done have been different from men’s. There was men’s work and there was women’s work. … Knowledge work, on the other hand, is ‘unisex’, not because of feminist pressure but because it can be done equally well by both sexes. 

Such workers have two main needs: formal education that enables them to enter knowledge work in the first place, and continuing education throughout their working lives to keep their knowledge up to date. 

Although the emergence of knowledge as an important resource increasingly means specialization, knowledge workers are highly mobile within their specialism. They think nothing of moving from one university, one company or one country to another, as long as they stay within the same field of knowledge. 

The knowledge society is the first human society where upward mobility is potentially unlimited. Knowledge differs from all other means of production in that it cannot be inherited or bequeathed. It has to be acquired anew by every individual, and everyone starts out with the same total ignorance. 

The upward mobility of the knowledge society, however, comes at a high price: the psychological pressures and emotional traumas of the rat race. There can be winners only if there are losers. This was not true of earlier societies. The son of the landless labourer who becomes a landless labourer himself was not a failure. In the knowledge society, however, he is not only a personal failure but a failure of society as well.}}

:Source: “The Next Society: A Survey of the Near Future,” The Economist (November 3, 2001), 8-11.

==What are attention givers? ==

Another category of workers that will emerge are attention-givers—people who care for, tend to, or oversee children, the elderly, the disabled, the depressed and anxious, as well as more or less healthy adults who want more attention for themselves and are able and willing to pay for it.{{tiacite|37}}

Two reasons account for the growth of the attention industry. First is the increasing number of people who work harder and subcontract family responsibilities, many of which involve giving attention. Second, with the growing productivity of machines (computerized machine tools and robots inside factories, and, in the service economy, automated bank tellers, automated gas pumps, voice activated telephone answering systems, and digital devices), they will soon be capable of doing just about everything. Everything, that is, except personal attention. So those with jobs that have been replaced by highly productive machines sell personal attention instead, and this trend will continue as the years pass.{{tiacite|38}}

==Will there still be farmers in the future? ==

The information revolution will not eliminate farmers, just as the industrial revolution did not eliminate them. But farming methods will change yet again. More information will help farmers to irrigate only those areas that need water and provide for more effective use of fertilizers, among others. In addition, agricultural biotechnology genetically modifies plants and food sources to maximize their reproduction and nutritional value. 

Aside from increased yield, faster communications and transactions and lower transportation costs also ensure more efficient delivery of farm inputs that lead to lower prices and better inventory.

==What about entrepreneurs? What role do they have in the new economy? ==

It has been suggested that the Internet is a natural environment for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are innovators who implement change within markets through the introduction of new goods, new methods of production or new markets. Gregory K. Ericksen believes that enterpreneurs will flourish in the new Internet society: 

:…the Internet world calls for a personality portfolio that comes naturally to entrepreneurs. It demands a willingness to take risks, a whole-hearted commitment to the enterprise, a sense of timing, and a readiness to act fast. The challenge of the Internet is not technology, whish is the enabler. The challenges and the opportunities are based on problem solving and innovations that deliver true value. Ideas that make a difference can and must be put into action quickly.{{tiacite|39}}

==How do we nurture entrepreneurs? ==

Entrepreneurs flourish in an environment that allows the free flow of ideas, encourages risk taking and accepts failure as a necessary part of doing business. Creating entrepreneurs is also linked to an environment of lifelong learning. The European Commission defines lifelong learning as “all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competence, within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective.”{{tiacite|40}} Lifelong learning involves acquiring and updating all kinds of abilities, interests, knowledge and qualifications to enable citizens to adapt to the information age. If designed and implemented properly, ICT use in education can promote the acquisition of the knowledge and skills that will empower students for lifelong learning in the 21st century. 

:'''Box 9. Educating Entrepreneurs '''
{{TextBox|The Consortium for Entrepreneurship Education supports the concept that entrepreneurship is a lifelong learning process that has at least five distinct stages of development. This lifelong learning model assumes that everyone in our educational system should have opportunities to learn at the beginning stages, but the later stages are targeted to those who choose to become entrepreneurs. 

Each of the following five stages may be taught with activities that are infused in other classes or as a separate course. 

Stage 1 - BASICS: In primary grades, junior high and high school, students should experience various facets of business ownership. At this first stage the focus is on understanding the basics of our economy, career opportunities that result, and the need to master basic skills to be successful in a free market economy. Motivation to learn and a sense of individual opportunity are the special outcomes at this stage of the lifelong learning model. 

Stage 2 - COMPETENCY AWARENESS: The students will learn to speak the language of business, and see the problems from the small business owner’s point of view. This is particularly needed in vocational education. The emphasis is on beginning competencies that may be taught as an entire entrepreneurship class or included as part of other courses related to entrepreneurship. For example, cash flow problems could be used in a math class and sales demonstrations could be part of a communications class. 

Stage 3 - CREATIVE APPLICATIONS: There is so much to learn about starting a business it is not surprising that so many businesses have trouble. We teach future doctors for many years, but we have expected a small business owner to learn everything by attending several Saturday seminars. 

This stage may take place in advanced high school vocational programs, two-year colleges where there are special courses and/or associate degree programs, and some colleges and universities. The outcome is for students to learn how it might be possible to become an entrepreneur. 

Stage 4 - STARTUP: After adults have had time to gain job experience and/or further education, many are in need of special assistance in putting a business idea together. Community education programs are widely available in the vocational schools, community colleges, 4-year colleges and universities to provide startup help. 

Stage 5 - GROWTH: Often business owners do not seek help until it is almost too late. A series of continuing seminars or support groups can help the entrepreneur recognize potential problems and deal with them in time. }}

==How will the Internet affect the individual? ==

The Internet and the ICT revolution have created “sovereign individuals”— individuals who are empowered because they have access to new learning opportunities; are able to sell their own ideas, services or products directly to others; and can access medical information to make their own choices about health care. These sovereign individuals also have reliable and up-to-date information about government policies and programs that allows them to become better citizens. 

Moreover, the convenience and the anonymity provided by the Internet have led some people to turn to the Internet for emotional and psychological needs. The Net has become a means and method not only for doing business, but also for reaching people on a social and personal level. The latter has elicited some concern in the field of psychiatry. The Addiction Research Foundation in Toronto now accepts Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) as a real problem. Internet junkies, as those with IAD are called, interact more with their PCs than with real people. Psychiatrists consider this not just addiction but dependence, which is characterized by obsessiveness, a loss of control, and an inability to stop even if the person wants to and understands the dangers.{{tiacite|41}}

==Given its negative effects on individuals, shouldn’t the Internet simply be banned? ==

Technology is not sole the culprit. Robert Putnam has documented a decline in civic engagement and social participation in the US in the past 35 years, resulting in major consequences on both the societal and the individual level. This is a major concern. As Putnam writes, 

:the quality of governance [is] determined by longstanding traditions of civic engagement (or its absence). Voter turnout, newspaper readership, membership in choral societies and football clubs… [are] the hallmarks of a successful region. In fact, historical analysis suggested that these networks of organized reciprocity and civic solidarity, far from being an epiphenomenon of socioeconomic modernization, were a precondition for it.

Technology, particularly the Internet, is definitely helping change social relations, but not in ways that its critics suggest. Castells describes the impact of the Internet as people organize themselves into a social network. “Networked individualism,” as he describes it, “is a social pattern, not a collection of isolated individuals.” Individuals will build networks, both on-line and off-line, based on their interests, values, affinities, and projects. Because of the capabilities of the Internet for communication, people will build virtual communities that are different from physical communities. These communities, however, are not necessarily less intense or less effective in binding and mobilizing people. Furthermore, a communication hybrid is now developing in our societies, bringing together both the physical and the virtual space as the material support of networked individualism.

'''How will the Internet affect the family?'''
Technology allows families living in different locations to stay in touch with each other. We are now able to send text messages to relatives all over the world. Those who are working overseas are able to keep in touch with their families back home via the Internet. Children are able to learn more about their parents’ home country via the Internet. 

But it also cannot be denied that in recent years people have been spending less time with their families because of information and work overload. Work takes more and more time, and even when a family member is physically present, work is intrusive, preoccupying and unpredictable. Reich believes that the new family now requires a complex set of logistical arrangements for the various members to respond to the economy’s new demands.{{tiacite|44}}

Changes in family structure and family attitudes are directly parallel to changes in the economic system that began in the 1970s. In the old system of large-scale production, most men had steady jobs and solid wages, while women had fewer job opportunities. However, in the new system of continuous innovation, we see less predictable earnings and wider disparities in earnings. This induces harder work in terms of time and emotional energy.{{tiacite|45}} 

Nevertheless, although the emerging economy is more stressful, it generates more opportunities to earn more money for talented men and women alike. Almost all women now have the option of having a job and need not be entirely dependent on a male breadwinner.{{tiacite|46}} Gender and racial issues in employment may soon be a thing of the past. Talent is what matters most.

==What is the impact of ICTs on communities? ==

ICTs make possible communities not bound by space. In these “communities of choice” proximity is not a factor for intimacy. Examples of communities of choice are Web forums, newsgroups and mailing lists, which are generally organized topically. Strangers who have similar interests are encouraged to read each other’s messages and communicate, giving each other advice, information and updates. Forums for all fields of interest or concerns and issues exist online, and a person can find others similarly situated with whom to form possible friendships based on common interests, or support groups if suffering from afflictions rare or otherwise. 

For this reason, Castells tends to disagree that Internet use lowers social interaction and causes greater social isolation. He does agree that in certain circumstances, perhaps for individuals suffering from addiction or dependence, Internet use tends to become a substitute for other social activities.{{tiacite|47}}

:'''Box 10. Asháninka@the Peruvian Amazon (excerpts) '''
{{TextBox|In an open grass hut on the edge of the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon jungle, an unlikely sight heralds a revolution: a computer on a rough plank table, displaying Internet web pages. The anachronistic beige box, owned by a village of indigenous Asháninka, called Marankiari Bajo, is connected to the Internet by high-powered radio. The tiny community, located more than 500 metres above sea level and 400 kilometres from Lima (a journey that includes many changes in elevation), is remote — yet in touch with the world. Perhaps more importantly to the villagers, it’s also networked with other Asháninka communities nearby. Until recently, they didn’t even have telephones. 

The Asháninka do not see the Internet as the beachhead of a cultural invasion from the North. Rather, they have seized it as a tool to reinforce and perpetuate their own culture, to build a larger sense of community purpose among the 400-odd Asháninka villages scattered across South America, and to tell their own story to the world. In the process, they bypass outside news media and governments, which they think tend to marginalize them. … In the course of embracing the Internet, the Asháninka are moving from an oral to a written culture. Parents hope their children will be able to learn new things that the Asháninka have not known before. But the community also still believes that elders have something to teach their youth about succeeding on Asháninka terms, even while they prepare to enter a world larger than Marankiari Bajo. In the meantime, the Internet gives villagers the chance to set up strategic alliances, not just with other Asháninka communities nearby, but with First Nations around the world, says Castro. 

“It’s difficult for me to synthesize the experience sometimes, but on the way we’ve found friends, we’ve learned to dialogue and to agree. This has permitted us to strengthen our local capacities,” he concludes. “This whole experience has shown us that we’re not alone — we have friends who are in the same circumstances as we are.” }}

==Do other communication technologies affect societies the way the Internet does? ==
A mode of communication that is more prevalent in the developing world than the computer-based Internet is the mobile phone. In most of Asia the mobile phone has become a familiar gadget. Interestingly, mobile phones are not used only for making voice calls but also for short messaging. It is believed that in the developing world more people will access the Internet via mobile phones than computers. 

Castells observes that “cell-telephony” also fits a social pattern organized around communities of choice and individualized interaction based on the selection of time, place, and partners of the interaction. In addition, the development of wireless Internet increases the possibility of personalized networking to a broader range of social situations. This enhances the capacity of individuals to rebuild structures of sociability from the bottom up.{{tiacite|48}} 

Kraut and Lundmark of the Human Interaction Institute of the Carnegie Mellon University issue a cautionary note. Based on their studies, they conclude that the Internet is not a substitute for real human interaction as a means for emotional and social fulfillment. The use of the Internet can be both highly entertaining and useful, but if it causes too much disengagement from real life, it can also be harmful. Until the technology evolves to be more beneficial, people should moderate their use of the Internet and monitor the uses to which they put it.{{tiacite|49}} While there are clear benefits to virtual communities formed around infocommunication networks, a balance should be maintained and social isolation minimized.</text>

==What is globalization and how is it related to the ICT revolution? ==

Technological development, from better transportation and carrier services to the telephone and mass media, has created a smaller, more integrated world. Now, the ICT revolution is making the world even smaller and more integrated. Communications, trade and employment, personal and political transactions are now occurring on a global scale, in real time, ignoring boundaries between states. 

Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz defines globalization as 

:…the closer integration of the countries and peoples of the world which has been brought about by the enormous reduction of costs of transportation and communication, and the breaking down of artificial barriers to the flows of goods, services, capital, knowledge, and (to a lesser extent) people across borders.{{tiacite|50}} 

It is important to underscore that globalization is not just an economic phenomenon. It affects all aspects of life. 

At least four factors have contributed to globalization: (1) technological change, particularly the ICT revolution; (2) the spread of market-based systems; (3) domestic politics—pro-globalization forces are more politically significant; and (4) inter-state rivalries.{{tiacite|51}}

==How will globalization affect the nation-state? ==

Anthony Giddens suggests that globalization affects the nation-state in three ways.{{tiacite|52}} First, globalization, especially the global marketplace, takes certain powers away from the nation-state. Nation-states are not as in command of their economic futures as they used to be. The best example of this is the increasing inability of governments to control their currencies. Exchange rates are now determined by other people’s assessment of a country’s economic well-being. 

At the same time, says Giddens, globalization creates new possibilities and motivations for local cultural autonomy and identities. This “push down effect” of globalization is the reason for the revival of local nationalism and local forms of cultural identity in all parts of the world. It may seem strange but the more we globalize, the more we localize. 

The third effect of globalization is that it also pushes sideways. This is best seen in the emergence of regional groupings, which Keniche Ohmae calls “regional states”.{{tiacite|53}} Both Giddens and Ohmae give as an example the area of Catalonia around Barcelona in northern Spain: Catalonia overlaps with southern France, but it is linked to the Spanish economy. 

Clearly globalization is a complex set of partly contradictory forces. It is not, as globalization critics suggest, a single force pulling in a single direction.

==How do the Internet and the ICT revolution affect governance? ==

Governance can be simply defined as “organizing collective action”.{{tiacite|54}} It implies the organization of rules that allows, prescribes and prohibits certain actions. A narrower definition of governance relates it to government or the decision-making processes in the administration of a state. ICT has a major effect on governance in both its broad and narrow sense. The Institute of Governance (Canada) believes that ICTs: 

:… create new expectations among citizens about how governments should interact with them, and how services should be delivered. Internet technology and recent advances in applied genetics are significantly redefining the boundaries of personal choice and private influence, and of collective decision-making on matters of public importance.{{tiacite|55}}

At one level, governments that use ICT will be better able to govern. E-government, or the use of ICT to enhance the access and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, is a necessary element in the government’s drive for good governance. E-government promises not only a more efficient and effective government but a more transparent one as well.

==How does ICT transform international politics? ==

Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, Jr reject the view that the information age will radically transform relations between nations. Their position is based on their belief that countries are already embedded in patterns of complex interdependence where “security and force matter less and countries are connected by multiple social and political relationships.”{{tiacite|56}} However, they judge that 

:The information revolution alters patterns of complex interdependence by exponentially increasing the number of channels of communications in world politics—between individuals in networks, not just individuals within bureaucracies. But it exists in the context of an existing political structure, and its effects on the flows of different types of information vary vastly.{{tiacite|57}}

They also agree that in the 21st century, “information technology, broadly defined, is likely to be the most important power resource.” 

Other scholars have proposed the concept of noopolitik,whichrefers to a dimension of international relations that is related to the formation of a ‘noosphere’ or a global information environment. Noopolitik is projected as an alternative to realpolitik, the latter being the traditional approach to fostering the power of the state in the international arena, by negotiation, force, or the potential use of force. In a world characterized by globalization and shaped by information and communication, the ability to act on information flows, and on media messages, becomes an essential tool for fostering a political agenda.{{tiacite|58}} 

With noopolitik, diplomacy will now include not only governments but also the societies they represent. This new diplomacy may prevent confrontation, increase the opportunity for alliances, and foster cultural and political hegemony. Embedded in this new diplomacy is the capacity to intervene in the process of mental representation underlying public opinion and collective political behavior at the national level.{{tiacite|59}}

==What is cyberwar? Is it the same as information war and cyberterrorism? ==

Cyberwar, according to James Dunnigan, is the use of “electronic networks, and information, …as part of a weapon system”.{{tiacite|60}} It includes warplanes using electronic devices to jam enemy radars to elude their missiles as well as hacking into the enemies’ bank accounts and/or their servers and information networks. He distinguishes cyberwar from “information war”, which is using information and news as weapon. Information war or propaganda war, claims Dunnigan, has been around for thousands of years. Cyberterrorism is a narrower concept, and is defined as “the premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and data which result in violence against noncombatant targets by sub national groups or clandestine agents.”{{tiacite|61}} 

The emergence of these terms is related to the fact that more and more governments and businesses are becoming dependent on computers and information systems. Databases of highly sensitive and confidential information are stored on computer systems. Air traffic control, banking and finance accounts, water utilities and other public utilities are assisted by computer programs and networks as well. Thus, these systems become targets of those who wish to threaten the government or the economy.

==What is cybersecurity? ==

Cybersecurity is about combating threats and crimes in cyberspace. It includes passing appropriate laws and policies, as well as developing capabilities and institutions to prevent fraud and fight threats. 

At the national level, government cybersecurity efforts have focused on creating the appropriate policy and legal environment, protecting critical infrastructure against cyber attacks and improving the security of the national information system. At the global level, various efforts are now underway to create a harmonized policy infrastructure to enable a robust and globally integrated system capable of responding to cyber threats in a coordinated and timely manner. In December 2002, the UNGA adopted resolution 57/239 calling for a “global culture of security”.{{tiacite|62}} In the Asia-Pacific, APEC Leaders have issued a “Statement on Fighting Terrorism and Promoting Growth” which includes an APEC Cybersecurity Strategy to protect communications and information systems.{{tiacite|63}} In their statement APEC leaders have announced their intention to: (1) enact cybersecurity laws that are consistent with international norms; (2) identify national cybercrime units; and (3) establish institutions that exchange threats and vulnerabilities (such as computer emergency response teams or CERTs). 

While a focus on cybersecurity is important, analysts believe that cyber terrorist threats to computer structures are implausible. This is because terrorism is like lightning, taking the path of least resistance. Moreover, currently it is easier to blow something up than to figure out how to damage it by hacking into and manipulating a computer system.{{tiacite|64}}</text>

==What is the digital divide and why is it important? ==

The digital divide separates the information rich and the information poor. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development defines the digital divide as the difference between individuals, households, businesses and geographic areas with regard to (a) their opportunities to access ICTs and (b) their use of the Internet for a wide variety of activities. It is the gap between those who have real access to information and communications technology and who are able to use it effectively, and those who don’t have such access.{{tiacite|65}}

Lack of access to ICT goods and services poses social and economic disadvantages. More and more, developing countries are recognizing that they cannot compete in the new global market unless they take advantage of the ICT revolution. Countries that do not undertake measures to enhance their ICT infrastructure risk not just being marginalized but also being completely bypassed in the new global order. The experience of a number of countries, like Singapore, Malaysia and Korea, demonstrate that bold actions in bringing their countries into the digital age pay off. 

:'''Box 11. Internet Access Under African Skies by Noah Elkin '''
{{TextBox|In absolute terms, the number of internet users in Africa is abysmally low. The entire continent has a user population that is approximately half that of Canada, even though its population is nearly 20 times as large. Penetration rates are likewise miniscule—currently, less than 1% of Africa’s population uses the internet, while penetration rates top 50% in North America. As a result, Africa, with the exception of South Africa and some of the more developed North African countries, barely appears on the radar in most global internet studies. 

This may not be the case in the future. According to a recent report by Mike Jensen, an independent monitor of information and communication technology development in Africa, internet usage has progressed considerably throughout the continent in recent years and shows no sign of slowing down. All countries there enjoy internet access, at least in the capital city, while few countries could make that claim just five years ago. By mid-2002, Jensen had tallied 560 internet service providers (ISPs) across Africa, noting that competition for dial-up subscribers exists in most countries. 

However, high fees, a recurring problem in developing countries, keep the subscriber rolls from growing. Jensen’s analysis indicates that the average monthly cost for 20 hours of dial-up account usage (a standard measure used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD]), which includes ISP charges and local call fees but not the cost of a renting the telephone line itself, is an astronomical $60 per month. This figure is nearly three times the average monthly rate recorded by the OECD in the US, and, as Jensen notes, exceeds the average per capita income in many African countries. 

Those Africans who cannot afford a phone or a computer—in other words, most of the continent’s population—have responded by sharing paid subscriptions (a popular strategy in developing areas), with an estimated three to five people using a single subscription. Residents of urban areas, where the telecommunications infrastructure is typically the most highly developed in any given country, have flocked to public access points such as cybercafés, internet kiosks and community telecenters, where equipment and costs can be shared by a large number of users. 

However, these arrangements often leave out the majority of the population, given that the population of most African countries remains overwhelmingly rural. The extant challenge lies in extending the communications infrastructure throughout each country in such a way that the build-out does not make installation and usage costs too onerous for consumers and small businesses to take advantage of it. And entrepreneurs must develop creative business models that are based on shared internet usage, such as community internet centers offering connectivity plus international money transfer, small business assistance and educational services. This is one way of creating a self-sustaining technology base in Africa. }}

==How do we measure the digital divide? ==

The digital divide is usually measured in terms of citizen/population access to ICT. Among the indicators for measuring access are (1) telephone density (teledensity); (2) personal computer (PC) deployment and penetration; and (3) number of Internet users. 

Teledensity is the ratio of population to telephones (traditionally defined as fixed or wired telephone lines). This indicator of the divide must be redefined to include cellular/mobile phone use since in a number of developing countries there are more mobile phones than wired phones. Taylor Nelson Sofres Interactive (TNS) estimates that 57% of the adult population (defined as those between ages 15 and 65) in the Asia-Pacific region have a mobile phone.{{tiacite|66}}

Personal computer penetration and deployment has also been used to measure access, since the PC is the most common way of accessing the Internet. However, recently more and more ways of accessing the Internet have been devised. In Japan, people can access the Internet through their mobile phones. Those from developing countries share PCs, usually in an Internet café or in school. 

The number of Internet users is also a way of looking at the digital divide. Statistics show that only about 10% of the world’s population is online. Furthermore, most of these Internet users are in the developed Western countries: the US, Canada and Europe account for about 63% of the world’s Internet users. The Asia-Pacific’s share is about 30%. Africa and the Middle East combined account for less than 2% of the universe of Internet users. 

Equally disturbing is the fact that the global Internet population is predominantly male.Again, there are marked regional differences in the gender digital divide. In the Asia Pacific, the ratio of Internet users is about 60% men and 40% women. In the US and Canada the gender distribution is more balanced. 

:'''Box 12. Asian Women Love E-mail '''
{{TextBox|More and more Asian women are discovering the joys of getting in touch over the internet. 

The number of them who used e-mail and internet chat leapt towards the end of last year, according to recent figures by the net measurement company NetValue. 

“Towards the end of 2001, women were definitely interested in keeping in touch with people over the internet,” said NetValue President Jack Loo in a statement. 

“We saw more female users sending e-cards, sending and receiving e-mail, joining chat rooms, and posting up messages in forums.” 

The figures reinforce the commonly held belief that women are better communicators than men, using new technology to share experiences. 

'''Chat takes off'''

The highest growth was in Hong Kong, where women flocked to use webmail and send electronic greetings cards during the holiday season. Between October and December 2001, the number of Hong Kong women using webmail jumped 104.7%. There was also an increase of just under 80% in those sending e-cards.

There was also considerable growth in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.

The study also showed that more women were attracted by chatting over the internet, especially in Korea where more than half of all female internet users headed to chat sites.

But Singaporean women are fast catching up, with more than a fourfold jump in number of female chat users at the end of last year.

'''Women’s voices''' 

…Experts say the internet is tailor-made to help women find their voices, citing the rise of women’s organisations across Asia. 

The figures from NetValue also reflect the increasing numbers of women who are going online in Asia. 

They now account for more than 40% of internet population in the Asia-Pacific region. }}

==Is lack of access the only problem? ==

It is already received wisdom among those who are working to bridge the digital divide that providing access to technology is only one of many obstacles that must be addressed. Internet access is not enough. The Children’s Partnership argues that content is one aspect of the digital divide that has been neglected. The four content-related barriers to greater Internet uptake across society are: (1) local information barriers; (2) literacy barriers; (3) language barriers; (4) cultural diversity barriers. 

Local content is determined by the commercialized nature of the Web. Commercial content providers tend to focus on content that delivers returns to their investments. Thus, Internet users from developing countries, such as farmers, for example, rarely discover information that is relevant to them. Compounding the problem is that non-profit, community-based initiatives to create content face sustainability problems. 

Literacy is another concern. Literacy includes not only basic and functional literacy but also technological literacy. Older people who may be literate may find using a computer and accessing the Internet an intimidating experience. A related concern is creating inexpensive content that is accessible to all, including illiterate people. Perhaps this aim will be achieved through voice recognition technologies. 

The language barrier compounds the literacy issue. Over 68% of Internet content worldwide is in English. In e-commerce, English is even more dominant, with over 94% of links to pages on secure servers in English. However, although there are currently fewer sites for non-English speakers, the trend is expected to change soon.

==How can we bridge the digital divide? ==

Studies have shown that technology diffusion is slow and costly and developing countries “cannot assume that relevant new technologies will flow easily to them across international borders”.{{tiacite|67}} 

Governments play a vital role in bridging the digital divide. This is particularly true in developing national information infrastructures that will increase Internet access among the population. Specifically, governments should develop a policy and legal regulatory environment conducive to the creation of a robust national information infrastructure, including a regulatory environment that would increase competition and keep prices down. Government should also consider lowering or removing import duties and/or sales taxes on IT goods and services. This would contribute towards increasing PC penetration rates. Finally, governments’ own use of technology to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and transparency (e-government) could stimulate growth in the private ICT sector. 

Governments should also encourage alternative access to the Internet. If in the developed world the PC through the telephone or cable networks is the main mode of accessing the Internet, developing countries should seriously consider the use of wireless technologies and devices to connect to the Internet. 

:'''Box 13. Mobile Internet for Developing Countries '''
{{TextBox|Mobile communications has exploded in many developing nations. Mobile has often been the first competitor to sluggish government-owned fixed line telephone systems. Instead of waiting for years for a fixed line, and sometimes paying high line installation fees, citizens in many developing countries can now get a mobile connection on demand and need only to pay for the card that activates their handset. Furthermore, because wires do not need to be laid, mobile networks can be installed relatively quickly and are appearing in formerly ‘unwired’ places such as ‘up-country’ Uganda. Another big driver of mobile in developing countries has been the pre-paid card which turns the mobile handset into a portable, personal pay phone. Pre-paid service has allowed millions of users who would not normally financially qualify for subscription-based service to become mobile users. 

One of the reasons that wireless Internet seems logical for developing countries is that mobile phones outnumber PCs. In addition, mobile phones are beginning to exceed fixed lines in a growing number of developing countries. Of course, many of those handsets cannot access the Internet but most could be used for SMS (short messaging service), a precursor of Internet use. SMS is exploding in many developing countries. Take the Philippines for example where one of the leading mobile operators is Globe Telecom. At the end of 2000, it had 2.6 million subscribers (of which 86% were pre-paid) generating 25 million SMS messages a month. Revenues from SMS increased almost 500% in 2000 and accounted for 17% of Globe’s wireless revenue. 

Is it realistic to expect that the latest mobile Internet applications will also be launched in developing countries? The Congo, one of the poorest countries in the world, was one of the first nations in Africa to get WAP in June 2000. It was introduced by Celtel Congo, which launched its mobile service only in December 1999. A year and half later, Celtel had grown to be the largest telecom operator in the Congo with 14,000 subscribers. Celtel’s WAP users can access content such as local news, exchange rates, travel schedules and overseas WAP sites. }}

==Is government’s role limited to developing the physical infrastructure? ==
The problem with focusing too much on providing the infrastructure to enhance access is that the public may have Internet access but will not find anything useful or relevant on the Net anyway. Since governments are the biggest repository of information that is important to citizens, and since information is a public good, governments’ role as a content provider is also critical. 

Some governments address the issue of content directly. For instance, the Information Stores (Boutiques d’information), which is operated by the government of Burkina Faso, provides agricultural production and marketing information to rural farmers. The Information Boutiques collect and provide information about judicial matters, facilitate courses and mediate between the local population and services. It was designed to meet the information needs of the rural population of Burkina, who do not have sufficient access to information supporting basic economic, social and political activities.

==Is there a role for the private sector in bridging the digital divide? ==

The private sector, through investments and economic activities, plays an important role in bridging the digital divide. The numerous Internet cafes in the developing world are a testament to fact that the drive for profit does not preclude doing social good (in this case making the Internet more accessible). Moreover, the development of new IT businesses contributes to employment and economic growth in general. 

A number of global IT companies are also keen on helping to provide people with the necessary skills to succeed in the information age. Oracle’s Oracle Academic Initiative, Sun Microsystems’ Java Competency Center, Cisco Systems’ Cisco Networking Academy, and other similar efforts not only help make their graduates more employable but also upgrade skills in the community. That they also ensure a steady supply of workers for these corporations certainly makes it a win-win-win situation for individuals, communities and corporations. 

Corporate social responsibility efforts are also useful in ensuring broader access to ICT goods and services. Microsoft’s international community affairs program aims to bring the benefits of ICT to disadvantaged people in countries where it does business. In China, Microsoft is sponsoring Project Hope, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that aims to create five computer labs or cyberschools. The project will involve teaching computer skills to disadvantaged youth, who will have Internet access and the highest quality teachers and curricula in China. The same is being done in Indonesia, where Microsoft is working with Pact Indonesia to create six computer centers and offer IT skills development for disadvantaged youth. 

In the Philippines, Coca-Cola Export Corporation has entered into a joint project with the Foundation for IT Education and Development, a non-profit organization, to operate the ed.venture project, which provides computers and Internet connectivity, training and post-training support services to high schools in the Philippines. By using schools as an entry point to the community, ed.venture and similar projects are laying the foundation for greater community participation in the digital universe. 

:'''Box 14. Tuning In to The Village Voice '''
{{TextBox|Under the name Radyo Natin, or Our Radio, MBC has launched more than 400 low-power FM stations since late (2001), with another 400 in the pipeline. This network of tiny radio stations represents an effort by MBC to convince national advertisers that they can reach virtually every consumer in the Philippines at the local level. For the stations’ operators, the money they make will depend on convincing small local businesses to advertise, while also selling blocks of the stations’ airtime to local politicians, religious institutions and others with a desire to reach the community. 

Using a combination of low-cost transmitters and satellite-programming muscle developed in Manila as part of its traditional radio network, MBC, the oldest broadcaster in the Philippines, stands poised to revolutionize local radio. For the first time, tiny local stations are able to deliver the latest music and news from Manila in tandem with local-language news and information about the village or the neighborhood. … 

The network is so new that it is difficult to say if the local stations will generate consistent profit for the operations. One thing is certain, however: Never before in Asia has a company come up with a formula for such widespread low-power broadcasting. Traditional so-called ‘community’ radio has relied on foundations and funding agencies like the United Nations to set up small stations in remote communities in the developing world. But frequently, when the money from the agency dries up, the stations go off the air. With Radyo Natin, MBC is betting that operators will develop sufficient local-revenue streams to keep the network going and that national advertisers will give the home networks a steady flow of advertising pesos to make the venture profitable. … 

If all goes as planned, by the end of (2002) MBC will have 1,174 stations in its network, including its 74 traditional big stations, the 100 larger Radyo Natin properties and the 1,000 tiny local stations currently being established. }}

==What is the role of nongovernment organizations? ==
Non-government organizations (NGOs) play a number of roles in bridging the digital divide. NGOs help define the issue and mobilize resources to bridge the digital divide. The work of the Benton Foundation is an example. This non-profit organization produces and coordinates the Digital Divide Network (DDN), which serves as “a catalyst for developing new, innovative, digital divide strategies and for making current initiatives more strategic, more partner-based, and more outcome-oriented, with less duplication of effort, and more learning from each other’s activities.”{{tiacite|68}}

NGOs are also engaged in policy work, helping develop proposals for global action on the digital divide. This is seen in the role of the non-profit organizations in the Digital Opportunity Task Force (DOT Force), a body created by the G8 Summit in July 2000. The DOT Force report, presented at the 2001 Genoa Summit, proposed a nine-point action plan to resolve the digital divide.{{tiacite|69}}

NGOs also act as technology providers (in some instances acting as Internet service providers and/or application services providers). An interesting effort along this line is that of Jhai Foundation’s Remote IT Village Project in Laos.{{tiacite|70}} Faced with no electricity or telephone wires and harsh conditions, Jhai Foundation is developing the following: 

* A rugged computer and printer that draws less than 20 watts in normal use (less than 70 watts when the printer is operating) and that can survive dirt, heat and immersion in water; 
* A wireless local area network with relay stations based on the 802.11b protocol, that will transmit signals between the villages and a server located at the Phon Hong Hospital for switching to the Internet or the Lao telephone system; and 
* A Lao-language version of the free, Linux-based KDE graphical desktop and Lao-language office tools. 

It is expected that Lao villagers in the five pilot areas will use these facilities to make telephone calls within Lao PDR and internationally (using voice-over-Internet technologies), and for the activities that are so important for their start-up enterprises, such as accounting, letter writing and email. 

NGOS also play a significant role in bridging the digital divide particularly as content providers and trainers. The Community Learning Centers in Ghana are a case in point. 

:'''Box 15. High Tech/Grassroots Education: Community Learning Centers (CLCs) for Skill Building (excerpts) by Mary Fontaine '''
{{TextBox|Since November 1998, three Ghanaian NGOs have been managing and running CLCs in Accra, Kumasi, and Cape Coast. The purpose of the centers is to empower individuals and organizations for local development by providing public access—particularly for low-income populations—to the Internet and other ICTs. In just a little over two years, the centers grew from small, relatively obscure offices to popular establishments with their waiting rooms filled. They served nearly 14,000 clients during the first quarter of 2000 alone, 77 percent of whom took advantage of the training opportunities in typing, word processing, spreadsheets, computer literacy, and Internet orientation that are offered in addition to simple access to computer equipment. That’s over 10,000 individuals who gained increasingly important computer-related skills. Trainees include students, teachers, and researchers as well as business people, staff from NGOs, medical practitioners, artisans, merchants, local officials, and telecommunications workers. Ranging in age from eight to 67, with 85 percent between 18 and 40, the vast majority of clients are males. However, female enrollment has been growing steadily, in part due to the CLCs’ creative outreach campaigns.

… The CLCs in Ghana and Benin are providing practical, hands-on, and affordable training to thousands of people from all walks of life, who are developing skills that simply cannot be acquired anywhere else—even at some of the major universities. Individuals participating in the training perceive it to be highly empowering, due not only to the employment opportunities it opens up but also to the ready access to global information and networking it provides. In the long term, it may have the same empowering effect on low-income communities as a whole. For now, the training programs are clearly meeting a need and helping to satisfy a growing demand that remains otherwise unfulfilled. 

Beyond the impact on individuals and communities, the operation of CLCs is having an interesting impact on NGOs as well. Their entry into the telecenter business illustrates a growing trend in the NGO world toward a kind of “social entrepreneurship” that is neither strictly non-profit nor for-profit. Generating revenue to run a business is a relatively new undertaking for most NGOs, especially small, indigenous groups in developing countries. The NGOs in Ghana and Benin deserve credit for their courage in taking the risk on behalf of their constituents—and congratulations for making it work. }}

==What about international organizations? ==

The digital divide has reached the top of the agenda of numerous international and regional organizations. 

The United Nations’ ICT Task Force, for one, aims to find new, creative and quick-acting means for spreading the benefits of the digital revolution and averting the prospect of a two-tiered world information society.{{tiacite|71}} The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has projects to boost Internet connectivity and access in some of the poorest countries in the world. These include the United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS), a volunteer corps to train groups in developing countries in the uses and opportunities of the Internet and IT, and the Sustainable Development Networking Program (SDNP), an initiative to kick-start networking in developing countries and help people share information and expertise relevant to sustainable development. The UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Program (APDIP) aims to promote and establish information technology for social and economic development throughout the region. 

The World Bank’s Global Information and Communication Technologies Department (GICT) seeks to accelerate the participation of client countries in the global information economy; to promote private sector investment in developing countries, which will reduce poverty and improve people’s lives; and to promote innovative projects on the use of ICTs for economic and social development, with special emphasis on the needs of the poor in developing countries. The World Bank’s Information for Development Program (infoDev) is a global grant program that promotes innovative projects in the use of ICTs for economic and social development in developing countries. The Development Gateway is a development portal that provides access to information and knowledge on development activities.{{tiacite|72}} Through this initiative, the World Bank hopes to make it easier to share experience and knowledge in development, and offers up-to-date information on projects, resources, best practices and expertise on such subjects as poverty, governance, gender, IT, development and environment. 

At the regional level, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum has adopted an e-APEC strategy, which has three pillars: to create an environment for strengthening market structures and institutions; to provide an environment for infrastructure investment and technology development; and to enhance human capacity building and promote entrepreneurship. The e-ASEAN initiative is an effort of the 10 Southeast East Asian states to develop a broad and comprehensive action plan to develop competencies within ASEAN to enable it to flourish in the global information economy.</text>

Developing countries recognize the need to harness ICTs for development. However, the ICT uptake has been largely unequal. The digital divide is a problem that both government and the private sector must work together to address. Without doubt, the ICT revolution is changing the course of history, and developing countries must equip themselves with better information and policies that would enable them to join the digital revolution. The aim of this primer and the series on the Information Economy, Society and Polity is to provide policy makers and opinion leaders in developing countries of the Asia-Pacific with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends and issues surrounding the information age. The other primers in the series are: 

*Nets, Webs and Information Infrastructure 
*E-commerce and E-business 
*Legal and Regulatory Issues in the Information Economy. 
*E-Government 
*ICT and Education 
*Genes, Technology and Policy: An Introduction to Biotechnology 

It is our hope that these primers will spur the continuing efforts of developing countries to prepare for the information age. 

Much has been written about the information revolution. Many initiatives have been undertaken and some are to be applauded for their success while others need further support and guidance. The signs of the times—digitization, convergence, globalization, as well as their various impacts on politics, economics, social structures and culture—all foreshadow a future in which information is the key component. We must heed these signs if the future, the new era of information and progress, is to be ours.</text>

== Original Acknowledgement ==

Shahid Akhtar played a crucial role in making this series a reality. He mooted the idea during our first meeting and provided funding for it. He not only gave important inputs during the writing and publishing phases, but was also very understanding when deadlines were not met. 

Mr. Roberto R. Romulo, generous mentor, provided the “enabling environment” that made writing and publishing this series on the Information Economy, Society and Polity a lot easier. 

Janet Pearce, Fellow at the Center for Telecoms Management, University of Southern California, and Chris Coward, Director of the Center for Internet Studies, University of Washington, read and critiqued this primer on the information age. 

Rudy, Patricia, Joey, Zorah, Edwin and Vicky/Bibi were game enough to undertake the project with me. Margaret Uy readily agreed to be drafted when I needed help. 

Patricia Pascual made leading this project less demanding. Katch Nakpil and Shelah Lardizabal provided the critical administrative support during the lifetime of the project. So did Yenny, Nannie, Mel, Evelyn, Kitty, Claire, Myra, Rhiza, Macki, Ruel and Len. 

Pat Arinto skillfully copyedited the primers. Jenny Pascual gave the series its look. Reynaldo Lane made sure that we have an online version of the series. Ruth Pison and Veni Ilowa helped fine tune the layout. 

The UNDP-APDIP team not only facilitated the project but also provided critical inputs that made the primers better. 

Jose Estrella provided the inspiration and the motivation to see this (and other projects) through. 

I dedicate this work to my parents.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">These books detail the concepts, issues and trends surrounding different aspects of information and communications technology for development (ICT4D), including, e-government, e-commerce, ICT for education, ICT for poverty alleviation, Internet governance, biotechnology, etc.

ICTs are information-handling tools – a varied set of goods, applications and services that are used to produce, store, process, distribute and exchange information. They include ‘old’ tools such as radio, television and telephone, as well as ‘new’ tools such as computers, satellite, wireless technology and the Internet. ICTs can connect vast networks of individuals and organizations across great geographic distances at low cost. As such, ICTs foster development and facilitate the flows of information, capital, ideas, people and products.

These books are donated by [http://www.apdip.net UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme] (UNDP-APDIP), and are located on the [[Wikibooks:Information technology bookshelf]].

UNDP-APDIP aims to promote the development and application of ICT for sustainable human development in the Asia-Pacific region. These books are originally part of the [http://www.apdip.net/publications/iespprimers e-Primer for the Information Economy, Society and Polity Series].

      <text xml:space="preserve">These books serve as an introduction to various aspects and dimensions of free/open source software (FOSS) issues, including, FOSS in education, FOSS and government policy, localization, open standards and licensing.

FOSS is software that can be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed without restriction. It provides a framework for the usage and sharing of intellectual capital in a way that is applicable to many areas of development. The adoption of FOSS presents opportunities for industry and capacity development, software piracy reduction, and localization and customization for diverse cultural and development needs.

These books are donated by the [http://www.iosn.net International Open Source Network] (IOSN) and the [http://www.apdip.net UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme] (UNDP-APDIP) and are located on [[Wikibooks:Computer software bookshelf]].

IOSN is an initiative of UNDP-APDIP and supported by the [http://www.idrc.ca International Development Research Centre] (IDRC) of Canada. IOSN aims to promote the adoption of FOSS, open standards and open content for sustainable human development in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a network with a small secretariat based at the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok and three centres of excellence – IOSN ASEAN+3, IOSN PIC (Pacific Island Countries), and IOSN South Asia, based in Manila, Suva and Chennai respectively.

These books are originally part of the [http://www.iosn.net/foss-primers e-Primer on Free/Open Source Software Series].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Acceleration is defined as change in the velocity of an object.  Thus, any object which has been set in motion from rest, or stopped from moving, or which has changed direction of motion from a straight line, has undergone some acceleration.  

The mathematical dimensions of acceleration are dV/dt, or in other words, change of velocity with respect to time.  This is equivalent to (dx/dt)/dt or dx/dt² and so acceleration involves itself, only distance and time.

The acceleration of any isolated object is evidence that some external force has acted upon it (as expounded in the physical laws of Isaac Newton).  This accelerating force can be described mathematically by the equation F = mA (force = mass x acceleration), which can be rearranged to A = F/m.  Therefore, acceleration is directly proportional to the force acting on an object, and inveresely proportional to the objects mass, which correlates with everyday experience; the greater the push, the faster an object is accelerated, and the heavier the object, the more difficult it is to accelerate.

The observation of accelerations is of fundamental importance in experimental physics.  It is through these observations that otherwise invisible forces can be detected and quantified.  For example, it was through the observation of the acceleration of an apple downward from a tree that Sir Isaac Newton was led to the hypothesis of universal gravitation.  And, it is possible through such observations to quantify not only the force involved, but also the mass of an object (if the force is known) - this is how the mass of subatomic particles can be measured, for example.

As the relative velocity of an object approaches the speed of light, the mathematical description involved in acceleration becomes more complicated; more and more of the kinetic energy of an object becomes manifested as an increase in its mass, making acceleration progressively more difficult.  This is of no consequence in observations made under 'ordinary' conditions, however.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

This is the new homepage for the Wikibooks Counter-Vandalism Unit. This is a sister organization to the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism Unit|Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism Unit]].

The CVU is a WikiProject that monitors for and helps to repair vandalism. All Wikibookians are encouraged to help combat vandalism, not just the members of this WikiProject.

== Who can join? ==

Anybody, not just admins, can join the CVU. Nearly all users can work to repair vandalism, but admins can go the extra step of blocking the offenders. 

To join the CVU, all you need to do is add your userpage to [[:Category:Counter-Vandalism Unit Members]]. You can do this easily by putting one of the following templates on your userpage:

{|
 | {{tl|User CVU2-en}}
 | {{User CVU2-en}}
 |-
 | {{tl|User CVU1-en}}
 | {{User CVU1-en}}
 |}

If other users would like to create additional templates, post them here!

Joining the CVU doesn't get you any special rights or privileges. As a member, you are not &quot;more eligible&quot; to be elected as an adminstrator, bureaucrat, or checkuser. You don't have any extra authority on Wikibooks or any other WMF project, and your opinion is not more important in discussions. However, you will be helping to protect a great project, and you will be building a strong community atmosphere&amp;mdash;that's reward enough. After all, admins would have more work if it weren't for you, then they couldn't take care of &quot;admin stuff&quot;.

== What do I need to do? ==

You don't ''need'' to do anything, but all help is always appreciated. You can choose your own involvement in the WB-CVU: you can join all the IRC channels, monitor all the pages, and fight all the vandals, or you can sit back and watch all the action. Some things that are helpful are:

*Add [[WB:AN|Administrators' noticeboard]] to your watchlist. 
*Join the [irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-en-wb #vandalism-en-wb] chatroom to monitor for, and report vandalism
*Join the [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikibooks #Wikibooks] chatroom to monitor for reports of vandalism (and just to chat!)
*Report all vandalism in the IRC chatrooms or the [[WB:AA]] page
*Monitor the recent changes list, ether [[Special:Recentchanges]] on Wikibooks, or on the [irc://irc.wikimedia.org/en.wikibooks #wikibooks] chatroom. Rapid account creation, pages moved to inappropriate destinations, and edits by anonymous users should all be examined for vandalism.
*Cleanup and revert all vandalism that you see, if you are willing and able. Sometimes a vandal may be long gone, but his vandalism edits might have not gotten reverted.

In essence, there are a lot of things that you ''can do'', but there is nothing in particular that you ''need to do''. If you want to help out, any little bit is always appreciated.

== How to Spot vandalism ==

*[[Special:Recentchanges]]: The list of recent changes to the site. Suspicious edits (page moves to bad destinations, edits with obscene summaries, frequent edits by anonymous or newly-created users) should be inspected. 
*[irc://irc.wikimedia.org/en.wikibooks #en.wikibooks]: the real-time IRC counterpart to [[Special:Recentchanges]].

Here are some common things to look for in the recent changes list:
*Pages moved to inappropriate locations. For instance, a common attack involves a similar entry:
*:(Page [[Main Page]] moved to [[Main Page On Wheels!]])
*:Pages moved in this style are often referred to as &quot;WoW attacks&quot;.
*The creation of pages, or the movement of pages with the following words in the title: &quot;Briefs&quot;, &quot;Penis&quot;, &quot;Nazi&quot;, &quot;Banger&quot;, etc. 
*Many quick edits/page moves from an anonymous account, or from a new user.
*New user accounts that are made to look like other, respected users. Keep in mind that a upper-case i, and a lower-case L both look the same on some fonts:
*:[[User:Jimbo WaIes]] is not the same as [[User:Jimbo Wales]], even if they look alike!


If you see an edit that looks suspicious, open up the history diff, and see what was changed, and if it is appropriate.

== How to report vandalism ==

There are various places where you can report vandalism:
*[[WB:AN]]: The &quot;Administrators' noticeboard&quot; page. All CVU users should add this page to their watchlists.
*[irc://irc.freenode.net/Wikibooks #wikibooks]: The primary Wikibooks IRC chatroom. Come here to talk, and report vandalism.
*[irc://irc.freenode.net/cvn-wb-en #cvn-wb-en]: The WB vandalism reporting chatroom. Come here to report vandalism

Also, if you suspect that multiple vandal user accounts are coming from the same location, you can ask an admin with '''checkuser rights''' to examine them. With checkuser rights, an admin can see if multiple usernames are from the same IP address, and block that address from editing Wikibooks. For a current list of users with checkuser rights, see [[WB:ADMIN]]. To report such cases of sockpuppetry, leave a message on the talk page of a checkuser. Note that use of sockpuppets is not forbidden as long as they are not used to vandalize and gain advantage in votes and discussions.

== Advanced tools ==
* Check [[meta:Meta:WikiProject on open proxies#Confirmed for blocking|WikiProject on open proxies]] regularly. Block new open proxies and unblock IPs removed from open proxy list
* Run your own anti-vandal bot like [[w:User:ClueBot|ClueBot]]
* Ask for [[WB:ROLL|rollback]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Pete,

I am definently behind on some of our projects... but as i am currently trying to do peer reviews for 2 authors, i don't know where to look for the peer reviews! I have not done an article of my own, but i figure i need to turn in the things on time before i turn in my things that are late. Am I just not looking in the right place? Or do I have to submit my 1000 word article before i review others?   [[User:Andrewwall017|Andrewwall017]] ([[User talk:Andrewwall017|talk]]) 01:26, 16 February 2009 (UTC) 


''''''Bold text''''''[[User:Mcott004|Mcott004]] ([[User talk:Mcott004|talk]]) 18:48, 9 February 2009 (UTC) Pete, I sent an emial to the ECI email address, i have some unfortunate circumstances happen this past week with my grandmother, their is more info in the email that states why the user page wasnt comeplete as well as the first part of wiki article.

Pete,  

Thanks for the message.  Hope you have a great evening. [[User:Cdamb002|Cdamb002]] ([[User talk:Cdamb002|talk]]) 01:15, 7 February 2009 (UTC)





Thanks a lot , Pete! I hope I can figure this out (adding audio and video). Have a great day![[User:Teachtheworld|Teachtheworld]] ([[User talk:Teachtheworld|talk]]) 19:49, 4 February 2009 (UTC)


Hello PbakerODU,

Good morning! It was nice to see you last night at the main campus. I wish I had the time to talk and ask questions about uploading videos and picture slides for our first article project. Do you mind to shoot me an email or at the talkpage about the procedures, and step-by-step on how to do it? 

By the way, I like the fish you are holding in the picture. Fish has been one of our vital foods in the Philippines.

Thank you so very much, Pete![[User:Teachtheworld|Teachtheworld]] ([[User talk:Teachtheworld|talk]]) 18:08, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

----



I am sincerely sorry, i mistook you for a vandal. I have unblocked you, and I am sorry for the inconvenience. If you have any questions, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Page redirects ==

I would be more then happy to assist you with any problems you are having. What material do you want to redirect to where? For that matter, what book are you working on? anything you need, just leave a message on my user page, and I should get back to you pretty quickly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:19, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

:I fixed your page redirect problem. The new page that you created was &quot;...of Education&quot;, and it should have been &quot;...of Americal Education&quot;. The link should work fine now. By the way, when you leave a message somewhere, you can type &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (four tildes) to automatically sign your name, and produce a link back here to your user page. It's handy sometimes. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Link Problems ==

Your problem is actually a common one, so don't feel bad about it. In a link, the &quot;#&quot; (pound sign) is a special character: it, and everything after it, is ignored when making a link. So a link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Page # This stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is exactly the same as a link to &lt;/nowiki&lt;[[My Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The easy solution to this problem is to delete all the pound-signs from your links, and possibly replace them with another symbol. For instance:

*&quot;My Page Part 1&quot;
*&quot;My Page-1&quot;
*&quot;My Page (1)&quot;
*&quot;My Page:1&quot;
*&quot;MyPage/1&quot;

If all your links are like that, it might take a while to change them all over. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:00, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

== hello ==

test

== [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] - please categorise ==

Hi PbakerODU,

I'll add categories to the pages you've already created, but please add &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to these pages as you move them. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:49, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

:Sorry... I thought you knew what that meant :). All you do is when you load the page add &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; to the bottom of the page. That way the page will automatically appear on [[:Category:Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|this page]]. This just helps keep track of the pages of the book, in case one isn't linked somehow and needs to be found, etc. It also allows category searches, helping people find the book. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==

A category is both an organizational and (less often) a navigational aide, that helps to lump related pages together. Often-times a book will have a category for all it's pages. This way, when you click the &quot;Related Changes&quot; link in the &quot;toolbox&quot; area (lower-left side of the screen), you will see all the changes and edits that have happened in all the pages in the same category. For instance, if other people are working on your book, you can keep track of all the changes by ensuring that all the pages are in the same category, and then click &quot;related changes&quot;.

It isn't a requirement, but in general wikibooks likes pages to be categorized. If you are specifically against the categorization, you don't have to do it, but I warn you that some people will come in and categorize all your pages anyway, whether you want them to or not. 

I hope this clears some things up. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Favor ==

If you wouldn't mind, I would like to ask you a small favor: I've been nominated to receive &quot;checkuser rights&quot;, which is a tool that would allow me to fight vandalism (like the kind that struck your book this week) here at wikibooks more effectively. If you wouldn't mind going to the [[WB:RFA|nominations page]] and voting for me, I would appreciate it very much. I need 25 votes total, so every little bit helps. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Signatures on the chapter pages... ==

I take it these are assignments? I rolled one back before I realised what it probably is. [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:35, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

== Yup, I have a few ideas... ==

Hi Pete,

I'm a bit busy today, but I have some ideas for templates to help the project along. 

2 questions: 

#Are your students being graded on their assigned chapters? If so, do you think it would be better if the wikibooks community left things alone on those chapters for the duration of the class? 
#I'm thinking of moving the current main chapter pages to the discussion pages (for &quot;sign-up&quot; use), and just having the main pages provide links to the chapters. I'll make a template for that that puts the sign-ups in a box that explains what the signups are about. Sound OK?

1 request:

:It would be nice to have an &quot;about this project&quot; page... with information about the class you're instructing, the institution, the goals, why you're using wikibooks, etc. At least I personally would like to know :).

I'm usually logged on between 4AM and 6AM on weekdays, so if your students need admin assistance in the middle of the night (Eastern US time), I'll be happy to answer early the next day. Also you might want to let them know about the irc channel: it's on freenode, #wikibooks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

::Pete: I'm going to reply on my talk page point-by point, if you don't mind. Will appear in a few minutes. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

:::Reply is there now. Put my talk page on your watchlist... if I'm replying to your messages in the future, I'll say &quot;hey Pete!&quot; in the edit summary. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:26, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

== Another question... ==

I was going to make up a template, then had some doubts after seeing how the signups are being done. Are different students working on different versions of the same chapter? If so, this is a bit strange... why do it on a wiki if the chapters are being written by particular invididuals? Isn't that kind of negating the advantages of using wikis? The normal advantage of a wiki is that it lets different authors collaborate on a particular project, such as an article or chapter. 

I'm just a bit confused about what you're doing now :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:44, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

Adding: I do understand the difficulty raised by &quot;how to assign grades&quot;, but perhaps having the last chapter (written during the last 2 weeks or so of the session) be [[How to grade students who participate in writing wikis]] :).[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

== Adding templates ==

Hi Peter,

Our vandal patrollers keep reverting your student sign-ups (sorry about that), so I decided to make some templates after all. Here's how to do it:

#'''Move the page content to the discussion space''': the easy way to do this is to just click on &quot;edit this page&quot;, copy the content, then click on &quot;discussion&quot; and add the content there. (You could do this with pagemove too, but it's much more complicated).
#'''Add a template to the talk page''': Simply add the following (you'll see why the &quot;foreward&quot; part is there when you see what the template does):
      &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:classprojtk|Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Foreword}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#'''Add a template to the module page''': Add the following:
      &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:classproj|Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Foreword}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#'''Clean up the module page''': Remove the signatures from the module page (they are now on the discussion page, and the template will make this clear to your students). Also, if it's not already there, don't forget to add a category tag to the pages, using this text:
      &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Anyhoo, sorry it took me a bit longer than planned to make these up... it took me a while to figure out what you were doing, and then by the time I did it looked like a lot of work for not much benefit. However, this seems to be drawing the ire of the vandal fighters (adding signatures to module pages is considered vandalism), so it really should be done. This should be done both to the main chapter pages (already done on [[Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Chapter 1]]), and to the individual pages ([[Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Chapter_13/How_has_multiculturalism_changed_our_views%3F_3|like this one]]). 

I'll help you with this if you're badly strapped for time, but I'm a bit strapped too... perhaps a few students might help? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:23, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

:Hi again, yup, probably best to add the cat tags to all of them (but not to the talk pages!), so we can keep track of them later. 
:As far as mistakes, I think the only major problem is having multiple versions of each chapter... or at least this is a problem insofar as what's going to be left on wikibooks when you're done (it's not ''really'' a textbook if there are multiple versions of each chapter, and it's actually &quot;against the rules&quot; to do this (it's called &quot;forking&quot;, see [[Wikibooks:Forking_policy]]... it's listed as a &quot;proposal&quot;, but I'm pretty sure the rule comes from Jimbo Wales, so it's more or less enforced anyway). I'm just worried that we (i.e., the &quot;regular wikibookians&quot;) going to end up with an awful mess when you're done. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

::No problem... 100% behind ya! Just trying to make sure I understand what's going on :).
::BTW: below, I added signatures for user Tvhsore. You'll probably end up needing to do this from time to time in your position, so here's the trick: First, go through the edit history to figure out who it was that left the comment, then copy the username, then type {{tlx|unsigned|username}} to add the &quot;the preceding unsigned comment...&quot;. [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== Meeting ==

Mr Baker
I met with Dr Allen on 8/25 created an account and started on a topic. I was out of town the next week, but worked on the book. Dr. Allen said it was good to be first so that I would have my pick of the topics. Today I get e-mail on the &quot;new&quot; outline(minus my entries). All the early prep wiped out. SOOOO, I start again tonight on the &quot;new outline&quot;. I wanted &quot;How we discipline today&quot;. I finally figure out the workings of the book, use the talk page to find all the topics taken. Can I please have the wild card 6.7.2 as some &quot;How we discipline today&quot; topic. I can't sign up for the topic, I keep trying, but I think I might have been blocked out by not saving while in the talk page.

== A Question about Citation of Copyrighted Materials ==

Hi Pete,

She can certainly discuss it, and cite by simply providing a link to the YouTube &quot;page&quot; containing the cut. It might be copyvio on the YouTube side though... not sure what to do about that. 

She can find plenty of links to more about Colbert and Wikipedia at: [[w:Wikipedia:Wikiality_and_Other_Tripling_Elephants]]. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:39, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, maybe she shouldn't link it. See [[w:Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#What_is_our_stated_policy_on_YouTube.3F]]... the wikipedians are a bit more sophisticated about this sort of thing than we are here, and the conversation there seems to imply that this is a big no-no. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

== Calvin, Hobbes, and copyrights... ==

Absolutely not! Aside from the fact that the image isn't public domain, the student put a {{tl|PD-user}} tag on it, when I'm guessing he/she didn't create the image. This is serious stuff (i.e.: lying about ownership), and if students are found doing this dort of thing, they may find themselves blocked from editing wikibooks (probably not for long, but our resident copyright hawk (not me) is pretty strict about these things). Please make it clear to your students that violating copyrights on wikibooks is pretty much the same thing as plajurism (sp?)...  aside from having the benefit of their peers and other wikibookians helping them write their chapters, they're also going to be under the scrutiny of anyone who happens to pop by, and copying materials that is not under a licence like the GFDL, PD, CC, etc. will inevitably be brought to light (that &quot;check and balance&quot; system would work better if it weren't for the multiple versions of each chapter...less people watching I would think). 

The student who downloaded the image should see the image's talk page ([[Image talk:Chimage.gif]], and explain where it came from (and if it wasn't legit, just say so and explain... no big deal). It will be deleted shortly in any case.

==finding images (and perhaps even images of nemo...)==

Hi Pete,

Probably the best place to start is at commons (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), other than that I just got a bunch of hits googling &quot;public domain comics&quot;... creative strings of google search words (&quot;creative commons image grits&quot;, etc.) could yield surprising results :), and might be a good experiment for the students as well, both in terms of writing wikibooks and finding free materials for classroom use. (BTW: &quot;creative commons&quot; is a type of &quot;copyleft&quot; that's used for the majority of free-use images). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

== background colors ==

What color? (You might just check out the code at [[User:Minun]] and figure it out from there... or I can have a look later).

By the way, there are about [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Uncategorizedpages&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=600 300 uncategorised pages in your book]... if you have a chance to add the tags to them, that would be great (there are some other uncatted pages further down the list that belong to [[Wikiversity]], but that list tops out at 1,000 and so they've been bumped - I'm working on the ones not in your book). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

:&lt;big&gt;'''Wow!'''&lt;/big&gt; Thanks so much for the herculean categorisation effort there... can't wait to see what pops up on Sunday when the list is updated :). BTW, sorry if I wasn't clear before about needing them on ''all'' the pages. If I had been thinking ahead, I would have just included it in the template (there's always next time).
:Anyway, how are you feeling now about doing this sort of project on WB? I've had time to read a few of the pages (ones that I had categorised), and a lot of it is very good material. Would you consider doing it again? If so (or even if not), would you accept if I nominated you for admin? This would be helpful for you in future projects, whether class-related or otherwise. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:39, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

==categorization, etc.==

Hi Johnny,

I had meant to do this categorization for weeks, now, but you know how easy it is for things to get pushed to the back-burner.  Today is a perfect opportunity for me to get this done, and I think it will be finished today.  Thanks for the reminder!

:Thanks... I was feeling like a big nag when I sent the reminder, and as I may (or at least should) have mentioned before, categorizing isn't an enforced policy, but it does make certain tasks a lot easier (such as keeping track of books, stub-sorting, and (as in this case) assisting in the import of pages for forking purposes (which is a fancy wikiway to say &quot;sending things to another wiki to be developed as something other than a textbook (whew)&quot;). 

This project is going very well.  We are feeling a bit of heat from the administration for the usual reasons, (you know, they're all very worried about the quality of a student-authored textbook), but the students really seem engaged by the process.  We've actually gotten very little negative feedback from them, which comes as a bit of a surprise to me since they've all been educated in the traditional way with teachers doling out the required information and students scrambling to write down every bit of it.  This process is a huge departure from that model, and they seem to be loving it.

:Yeah, I sort of figured the students were enjoying it, judging by the sheer volume of edits in your project over the past month. I'm guessing the faculty will be won over by the time it's done, especially once the wheat/chaff issues are resolved at the end of the semester :). 

As far as continuing the project goes, we are planning on it.  The first step is to determine a way for next semester's students to be equally engaged in the process now that the bulk of the textbook has already been generated.  I've been thinking of a couple ways we could go about this, but what do you think?

:Well, I've been wondering about that... this will be for the same course? One option would be to select the best versions, and make up a &quot;print version page&quot; using those, print the whole thing out, and ask the students to read the whole thing (arduous, I realise) over the first two weeks or so, while using the class time to discuss the mechanics of wiki-editing. Then just have them choose a version to rewrite or expand upon (either by choice or by chapter-based lottery... have the students sign up for the chapter, then randomly assign them to the versions). 

:Problem with this is that I don't think you could do it too many times... by the end of the second or third run you're going to have a serious, ready-for-print GFDL textbook with little need for improvement. But then you could adapt it for another class: perhaps if the faculty becomes convinced the wikibooks component could become a slight modification on the credit system (e.g., bumping a 3 credit course to 4 credits, or (as they did where I went to undergrad) have these classes qualify as a certain kind of prerequisite (at my school (Temple U) you needed to take a certain amount of &quot;Writing Intensive&quot; courses, and perhaps you could suggest a requirement for students to have one &quot;Wiki Project&quot; course). 

My only concern about becoming an administrator is that there are still some serious gaps in my knowledge of the Wikibooks system, (as you know from all of my frantic messages to you over the past months), but the good news is that I'm becoming very comfortable with what I do know, and I'm sure as I pick up new info. and strategies, it'll all become easier.  I would be honored if you felt it legitimate to nominate me, and I'd certainly accept were I to receive the necessary votes.  Thanks very much for the compliment!

:There's not as much involved as you might be thinking: all you have is 3 new tools (delete, protect, and block). The only thing you really need to learn is how to use them according to policy, and who to ask you're not sure. 

Last, I wonder if it's possible for our textbook to be nominated for book of the month, or would our &quot;Class Project&quot; status disqualify us for consideration?  I know, if the book got on the list, that would really be great for the students' morale.  What do you think?

:It's a wiki! If you want to &quot;have it nominated&quot;, all you have to do is nominate it :). (You'd have my vote, BTW, but only '''after''' it's done, due to the whole &quot;multiple versions of chapters&quot; thing). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:44, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

== reverting... ==

Hi Pete, 

Not sure exactly what you're asking. If you want to revert a page, click on the &quot;history&quot; button, choose the version you want to revert to (click on the date stamp), hit edit, then hit save. If there's a particular page you're having trouble with, let me know and I'll take a peek.

=== Had No Idea ===

Hi Johnny, I had no idea it was this easy.  Thanks for the info.  

:Yah, I was a bit worried that I might be insultingly pointing out the obvious... as I've said before, there are a lot of things about your approach to this book that don't really take full advantage of the wikiness of wikibooks. Let's chat a bit over winter break (your winter break, I mean, I don't get breaks)... I've been reading parts of your book from time to time and it's pretty amazing what your students have done with this. 

It seems that the book is really coming together nicely, and the students' reception of this type of project has been great.  We are currently kicking around several variations of this project for next semester and have generated quite a bit of hype, (miraculously not all negative), around the university.  

:I'd be perfectly happy to answer questions you're not sure about. If you'd like to chat with me on the phone, I'll send my # to you over email or IRC.

Another question for you - do you know how I can track the number of times our book is viewed?  Maybe this is a function not available to everyone, but I was just wondering. 

:Nope. This comes up often, but there are no pageview counters available on wikimedia projects. A third party counter can be included, but that's a bit controversial. 

Thanks again for all your advice and support throughout this process.  It has been a great and eye-opening experience for everyone involved.  Hope you have a healthy and happy Thanksgiving!

:You too. Make sure to eat too much :).

== Print versions... ==

Honestly I really don't know much about how the print versions work (I print stuff from time to time, but only page by page). I think [[User:Whiteknight]] might be the man to talk to on that subject.

Nice to see so much activity in your wikineck of the wikiwoods :P! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Print version ==

Hello PBaker, I would be happy to help with your print version! First things first, you can create the page for your print version at
:[[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Print Version]]
That's the preferred way to name a printable version. Once you have created the page, copy+paste this tag into your new page:
:{{tl|print version notice|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Print Version}}
And copy+paste this tag into your TOC:
:{{tl|Print version}}
Now that you have your tags lined up, you want to copy+paste your entire TOC into your print version page. What you want to change is &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[[Book/Chapter]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; links so that they say &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{:Book/Chapter}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The curly brackets and the colon will cause the chapter to be included into the print version automatically. Now, what you will end up with is your entire book on a single page (which can take a long time to load in your browser). If your book has a cover page or a page with a list of authors, or whatever, you can use the same kind of link to include those pages into your print version as well. At the end of your print version, include the following tag:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:GFDL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
And that will cause the GFDL license to appear in your book as well (which is needed for legal reasons). Once your print version is all completed, you can direct your browser to:
:http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?page=Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education&amp;printable=yes
to see the final product. 
I'll see if I can find some good examples that you can follow for this. Let me know if you need anything else. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:I might not be right about this, but I think you need a colon inside those brackets (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Book/chapter}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I'm not completely sure about that, but if what Whiteknight mentioned doesn't work, try that for a spin. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

== Images and copyrights... ==

Hi Pete... someone expressed some concern on the mailinglist about images that are being uploaded by some of your students that either don't have copyright tags, are apparently copyrighted under a non-free license, or both. Have you talked to the students about this? For a primer, see [[commons:Commons:Licensing]]. Make sure they know they can end up being blocked from editing if they continue to upload copyvios after warning, too. :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:11, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

:Just a quick reiteration of this point, if images and text that are uploaded to our site are not properly licensed, they can be deleted. It can be detrimental for a book to have a large number of images deleted because of copyright problems. Since this is a class project, we likely won't want to discipline your students for violating copyright, but considering that this could become a legal issue, we might need to do exactly that. 
:If you could please just take a quick minute to explain to your students the necessity of not violating copyright (a topic that many students are probably not familiar with), it would be well appreciated by everybody here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

::We've had problems in the past where groups of students have uploaded copyrighted images improperly, and they got deleted. I would much rather send you a kind message about it now, then to try and explain later why all the images in your book were deleted. We do have a team of people who do delete copyrighted images, so I am only glad that I got in touch with you about this before the images were deleted! I'm no lawyer, but if you have any questions about copyright or images, or if any of your students have questions about it, please let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:25, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

== New student-written text about educational psychology ==

Hi,

I left this message (see below) on Dwight Allen's user talk page, but then realized that maybe I should be addressing it to someone else responsible for the Social &amp; Cultural Foundations book. Would you be that person? If it is not you, please let me know who might be the best person to write to. Thanks, [[User:Klseifert|Klseifert]] 16:14, 26 July 2007 (UTC)




Dear Dwight,

I teach educational psychology at the University of Manitoba, and I am thinking about creating a student-written textbook about educational psychology. It would be reminiscent of your Wikibook about the social and cultural foundations of education.

I've read a lot of the behind-the-scenes advice that I could find about doing this (including your course syllabus for ECI 301, and the discussion pages for your Wikibook). My overall impression is that I should be able to do something along these lines, but it will have to be more modest, at least at the beginning. The reasons are that I have only about 70-75 students per year, only a handful of graduate students, and no grant to support this project at the moment. Nonetheless I would like to see what can be done.

I believe that you may have published an article or two about your experiences and/or assessment of the course, but I haven't been able to locate them. Can you point me in the right direction, and/or send me appropriate reprints (electronically is fine)? Any advice, ideas, or cautions would also be most welcome.

Thanks,

==Am I missing something?==

Am I missing something here about the Social &amp; Cultural Foundations book?  When I go to the latest edition it seems to be incomplete but earlier editions seem to have a lot of content. If this is a book then I would expect the content to be immediately available and the development of the new edition to be clearly signposted as a &quot;work in progress&quot;. But perhaps I have misunderstood your layout. Have you considered a &quot;print version&quot; and a PDF for your best edition so that a casual reader can just get straight on and read the book? (I have noticed that you are populating edition 3 at a fair pace but is this the right approach for book production, emphasising the course rather than the book?)[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:32, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[:Image:Asian fan dance2 with text 2.JPG]] ==

When you use someone else's image, you have to follow its license. Most of all, you have to mention the original image and its author! If it is not required by the license, it's at least a matter of good manners. Furthermore, if you have share-alike license, like the one in [[:Image:Asian fan dance2.jpg]], you have to license your derived work under the same license - not adding or substracting anything. So it's illegal to add GFDL license as you have done. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:09, 4 September 2007 (UTC)
: Unfortunately, there is no one single page which would explain everything in a friendly way. Wipedia entries: [[w:GNU Free Documentation License]] and [[w:Creative Commons licenses]] provide some help. On Wikimedia Commons, when you see a photo page, you have &quot;(Reusing this image)&quot; link (near &quot;Permission&quot; row in information table). It also gives some explanation. Finally, when you have image under Creative Commons license, you can click on the link to its license and get a brief and understandable summary of terms of the license.

:I have already changed [[:Image:Asian fan dance2 with text 2.JPG]] to make it fully &quot;legal&quot;. In the future, when you upload works under free licences found somewhere else (or their modified versions), you should mention source and author in image description (&quot;Based on ... by ...&quot;) and choose the same license as the original (it's the safest solution although you are not always obliged to do this; from the drop-down list of licenses select one from section &quot;Free-licensed work found on another websites&quot;). You can always change license of the uploaded image in order to fix you mistake by editing its description page. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:48, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Elementary Education ==

Hey Pete, it's good to hear from you. creating a &quot;subdivision&quot; or whatever is very easy. Everything we do is based on categories. Tag the first page of all the books you want in this subdivision with something like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subject|Education|Elementary Education}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; This will put the books into both categories (or, if you prefer, you can pick just one or the other). Set that up, and I'll create a page to keep track of everything at [[Subject:Elementary Education]], or whatever you want to call it. If you give me a list of books, I can do all the categorization myself (I have a bot that can automate tasks like this). Regardless of what you choose to do, it's very easy to make changes like this! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:05, 23 April 2008 (UTC)

As to video, there is some support on MediaWiki, although we here at Wikibooks don't utilize it as much as we should. There are also limitations, only Ogg Theora videos can be posted onto Wikimedia because of copyright and security concerns. For more information about how video is uploaded and supported, see [[commons:Commons:Media_help]]. For some examples of video files and how they work, see [[commons:Category:Video]]. I know that there are software developments in the works to improve support for video, but I don't know the status of any of them. If you have a good video, upload it to commons instead of here, since images and video that are on commons can be easily shared among all wikimedia projects (Wikibooks in other languages, and other projects like Wikipedia and Wikiversity). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:00, 23 April 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Authors Page ==

The subject of an &quot;Authors&quot; page is a tricky one. However, despite the problems, it certainly isn't &quot;vandalism&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. For licening reasons we do tend to discourage them. For class-related projects, however, such pages can actually be an organizational benefit.

The [[GFDL]] license, which is used here on Wikibooks, requires us to attribute the work done by our contributors. One of the &quot;best&quot; ways (and by &quot;best&quot; I mean most automatic) is through the history pages. In the history page you can see a complete record of who edited what and when. However, the license also permits authors to be listed a title page or an &quot;authors&quot;, unless authors choose not to. However this has, in the past, lead to arguments over who qualifies as an &quot;author&quot; of a book, who is entitled to list their names where, etc. Many productive contributors tend not to list themselves manually in such lists, and many unproductive people do. To avoid problems like these, we try to discourage people from doing this. 

For class projects it's typically fine because it helps the class to stay organized, and it helps the students to receive attribution for their work that they wouldn't have otherwise because students tend not to remain here as productive members after their classes are over. Tieing a book to an educational institution also helps to make the book seem more authoritative, and helps to raise the perception of accuracy that readers have. It's also good PR for us to say that &quot; A class from this university did great work on our website&quot;. 

This said, putting your signature on ''every'' page in a book, or signing each individual contribution, is not approved of and probably can be taken as vandalism. If you keep everything on an &quot;Authors&quot; page, there shouldn't be a problem&quot;. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:49, 24 April 2008 (UTC)

I just wanted to say hi and let you know we have some things in common.

:Thanks for the well-wishes! The move has been going extremely smoothly so far. My bot operates like a queue, where we put all the jobs into a list, and then I click the &quot;start&quot; button to run through the entire list a once. Once I click the start button, it is able to run a job every 2-4 seconds until the list is empty. Further the list is populated automatically (the bot makes it's own list of pages, which will include pages at the end of the book that you may have already edited) and it will simply ignore pages that have already been edited. So, it doesnt make much sense for you to start at the end of the book, since my bot will have to read in those pages anyway and attempt to edit them.

== Re: Peer Review Response Pages ==

These edits look like no problem whatsoever, and I'll try to make these edits starting tonight. You're planning to write a new edition of this book, or some other book, next semester too? We should really find a way to templateize all these things you're doing and all these edits you're making. I've got some ideas for some templates that we can use to &quot;autoload&quot; pages with the necessary text. Once a student clicks on a special link, it takes them to an edit page that already contains all the text that's supposed to be there. That is, unless the page already exists, and then it shows you the text that's already there. For an example of this mechanism, check out my [[User:Whiteknight/Book Creator Gadget|Book Creator Gadget]]. You type the name of a book you want to create into the box and click &quot;Create&quot;. If the book already exists, it shows the existing text of the page in the edit box and prints a warning that the page already exists. If it doesn't exist, the edit box contains a basic outline for a new book, and a set of instructions are displayed about how to fill it out.

For next semester, we could have an entire interface like this set up for your students: They click on a special link that auto-loads the page with all the necessary text, and some instructions are printed for them to teach them how to fill it out. It saves you work (since the software creates the page automatically when the students try to edit it).

Until then, I'll make the final changes with my bot. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:04, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

== Re: Making Pages Uneditable ==

Hey Pete,

Pages can be made uneditable, a process called &quot;protection&quot;. Only admins can protect pages. If it's a big issue for you, maybe it's worthwhile for you to become an administrator yourself. You certainly are busy enough around here, at least during the semester. The community usually likes admins who are willing to do general help for the entire site, not just for a single book. Take a look at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance]] to see if there are any little jobs you would be interested in adopting, some of them can be very therapeutic and give you a chance to get away from your book and your students for a while.

If adding &quot;Wikibooks administrator&quot; to your list of tasks is the straw to break your camel's back, don't worry about it. Protecting pages is very easy, and you can always ask me to do it, or ask for some help at [[WB:ADMIN]], a noticeboard that most of our admins watch and respond to. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:41, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello Pete, happy to help! My bot uses a very general programming interface, so subtracting from pages is just as easy as adding to pages is. I'll start looking at the problem and hopefully have a solution ready for it soon.

On another note, I think we should talk about what kinds of boiler-plate text like this you want to have for this upcoming semester. I assume you are still going to want these rating buttons, talk page rubriks, rating pages, etc. I think we could create parameterized templates for these purposes, and that will help to make creating these pages and features (and then removing them later) much easier.

Please ensure your students are familiar with [[Help:Uploading files]] before they upload files. I've seen many pictures uploaded for use either on their user pages or for the student-authored textbooks that I end up having to delete because of a lack of licensing information.  I've talked this over with others and I cannot make exceptions to the policies simply because an image is used on someone's user page. I also do not like deleting images that may be useful in your textbooks. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 9 July 2009 (UTC)


Thanks for the link, Adrignola!  I will pass this link along to the students.  We instruct them in Information Literacy, but we clearly need some work still.  Hope you have a great day!

== Peer Review Templates ==

Greetings again. While doing maintenance I came across a great many peer review templates for [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]] Edition 4 that are not linked to by the book. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LonelyPages&amp;limit=50&amp;offset=450 the start of them in Special:LonelyPages]. Examining the articles they'd correspond to, some articles have links to peer reviews on the talk page where reader responses go and other articles just have the talk page set up for reader responses. Will these peer review templates that are not linked to by any of the pages of your book be used? If not, then I'd like to delete them. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 14 July 2009 (UTC)



Hi Adrignola,

I checked your link and found 652 such peer review templates!  Incredible!!  I'm sorry these pages have been sitting there unused for so long.  The root of this problem lies in the fact that I haven't yet found an efficient way to &quot;delete&quot; pages.  Can you advise?  Regardless, that fourth edition was, for all intents and purposes, &quot;completed&quot; in May 2009.  Now, the bulk of the editing is taking place in [[Foundations and Assessment of Education|this book]].  As such, getting rid of those unused pages is no problem.  Other Wikibookians you can contact about any of this series of texts are [[User:Jkauf007|Jamie Kaufman]] and [[User:Jenniferjkidd|Jennifer Kidd]].  

Thanks for all the hard work you're pumping into these texts.  We really appreciate it!  Have a good one.

: It's good to have reassurance before deleting so many pages. Page deletion can only be performed by administrators, due to the high-impact nature of the action.  If you need individual pages deleted in the future, the addition of the {{tlx|delete|Your reasoning}} template code on the pages will attract the attention of an administrator shortly. Because you've provided the other contact personnel above, I'll be able to consider any of them or yourself as authorized to request a deletion.  Thanks for the feedback.  I will take care of the pages detailed above so that you can continue to write great textbooks. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:27, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

Hey Geoff,

Thanks for helping us organize all this stuff!  It's amazing how many module pages we have floating around.  All the content found on the page you linked above is also found at its correct location--[[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 1/Table of Contents/Chapter 6/6.2.2|here]].  As such, the page you linked above can be deleted if you've got that admin responsibility.  Thanks again, and have a great day!

My name is Pete, and I'm from Virginia.  I fish and grow a garden.  Since 2006, I've been a Wikibookian.  Along with some stellar colleagues, I've worked mainly on [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] and [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment|Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]]--seven semesters' worth of student-authored textbooks written exclusively by teachers in training at [http://www.odu.edu Old Dominion University].  

I received a BA from [http://www.wm.edu The College of William &amp; Mary] in 2005, finished my MS at ODU in 2007, and am about one year away from a PhD in Education.

Feel free to drop me a line on my [[User talk:PbakerODU|talk page]] if you want to chat about the weather or the Wikibook we're working on together or if you want to go fishing with me.

I suggest a more wikibook-like style CVU-picture. For that purpose I made 43px size pic of the wikibook logo. You can see the result here:
[[User:Aschoeke/Template:User_CVU2-en_test]]. {{User:Aschoeke/Template:User_CVU2-en_test}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I also made a big one ;) I don't know why, but my browser doesn't show the pic correct. Please feel free to comment. The result:
[[User:Aschoeke/Template:CVUnav_test]]. {{User:Aschoeke/Template:CVUnav_test}}

:I do like the idea of making these changes, we should separate out our group of the CVU from other groups of the CVU. I included a second template (and by &quot;included&quot;, i mean &quot;stole from wikipedia&quot;) that uses a WMF picture, not a WP one. We should probably come up with our own logo if we don't like the WP one. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:06, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

== Why the logo looks like that... ==

There's a big uproar at wikipedia over the CVU... apparently someone decided to poop on wikibooks as well. See [[w:Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism_Unit_%28third_nomination%29]] for details. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:23, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

:I'm not sure I understand the situation? They want to delete the CVU logo? If this is the case, perhaps we need to start creating our own version of it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

:While I am thinking about it, is there anybody who would be willing to create a new logo for our CVU project. The new logo should probably not contain the wikibooks or the wikimedia logo, or likenesses thereof. We would need two logos: a square one for use in the usebox templates, and a larger one for use on the [[WB:CVU]] page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:50, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Genomes change overtime. There are mutations, deletions, insertions, and other rearangements that can change the genes and genome of an organism. When we reconstruct the phylogeny of a group of organisms, we must first create an alignment where each column, site, corresponds in each tip. This must be done because each phylogenetic method conducts per site reonstruction.

In this chapter we discuss a few of the most common methods for alignment creation. This gives a basic overview, however there are many methods to practically carry out alignment estimation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Announcing/Preview|This chapter examines the history of announcing, positioning it within the broader context of the art of vocally communicating to an audience.}}
== Announcing's Ancient Roots ==

The profession of announcing is considered to be a relatively recent one.  But the origins of modern announcing practice can be traced back thousands of years, to the earliest recorded efforts to improve the process of vocally communicating to a public audience.

Almost three thousand years ago, the citizens of Greece would debate the important issues of the day in the [[w:ancient agora of Athens]].  The agora was the public forum where decisions were made, justice was determined and policies established.  Essentially, if you wanted to get something done in Athens, you went to the agora and gave a persuasive speech.    Now as you might imagine, some people were better at giving speeches than others.  Those who were good at it could make a pretty decent living by charging others for their talent. Some of the most successful ancient Greek &quot;speakers for hire&quot; became known as [[w:sophists]], and their practice was called ''sophistry.''  Like modern day announcers, the sophists were professional communicators.

Perhaps the most famous sophist was [[w:Protagoras]], who lived in the fifth century BCE.  He was reportedly a master of [[w:orthoepeia]], or the proper use of speech.  In other words, he had a way with words.  Perhaps his best known words were these:&lt;ref&gt;This is referenced in Plato's Theaetetus, available from Project Guttenberg at http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/thtus10.txt.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cquote|'''Man is the measure of all things:&lt;br&gt;of things which are, that they are so,&lt;br&gt;and of things which are not, that they are not.'''}} Now think about that saying for a moment.  It sounds pretty good, but what do you think it means?  Some people think it means that people decide what is true and isn't true, at least for themselves.  But it's not entirely clear if that was what Protagoras was getting at...and that may have been his purpose.  You see, Protagoras and other sophists were skilled at speaking well; they didn't seem as interested in speaking clearly.  That may be why today, the word sophistry has come to mean &quot;subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/sophistry.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sanzio_01_Plato_Aristotle.jpg|thumb|right|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right)]]It could be that sophists have been given a bad rap.&lt;ref&gt;For an interesting defense of Protagoras, see http://www.geocities.com/inescapableennui/s12.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  After all, just about everything we know about them come from their two most famous critics: Plato and his student Aristotle, widely regarded as the founders of Western philosophy.  They didn't much care for the sophists.  For one thing, they didn't think it was right to get paid to speak on behalf of others.  But more importantly, they felt the sophists gave too much emphasis on form, and not enough on content.  To put it simply, they argued sophists cared more about how they said something than what they said.  And that could lead to people believing something just because it sounded good, even if it wasn't true.  Sort of like a [[w:Ron Popeil]] commercial.

Aristotle did more than criticize the sophists; he wrote a book about public speaking, one that has informed much of western thought on the subject for over two thousand years.  The book was simply called &quot;Rhetoric,&quot; although today it is most often referred to as &quot;Aristotle's Rhetoric.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Actually, it would be more accurate to say Aristotle's book was called &quot;Rhêtorikos,&quot; but even that is a &quot;transliteration&quot; of the actual Greek letters ῥητορική.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was written in Greek, of course, but you can read one of the more popular English language translations [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html here].  Aristotle is considered to be the founder of the field of '''rhetoric,''' the study of persuasive speech.  Aristotle argued that if one is going to be successful as a persuasive speaker, one must not only persuade an audience, but speak the truth.  Rhetoric would become one of the three original &quot;liberal arts&quot; of the trivium (the other two being logic and grammar), which was one of the earliest recorded organized approaches to education.  For much of human history, becoming an educated person meant studying rhetoric.

So you might be wondering what all this ancient Greek stuff has to do with announcing.  Well, it's important to understand that the professional practice of announcing is greatly shaped by cultural norms--widely held beliefs of what's right and wrong, good and bad, true or false.  And many of our strongest cultural norms are rooted in traditions that date back to antiquity.  So if you want to learn how to be a good announcer, a good place to start is by learning more about what people mean by &quot;good.&quot;  And a good place to start learning that is by understanding Aristotle's ideas about rhetoric.

== The Modes of Persuasion ==

There were many things that Aristotle wrote about rhetoric, but much of what he said he summed up in this passage:&lt;ref&gt;This is from Part 2 of Book 1 of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' at http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cquote|'''Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds.&lt;br&gt;The first kind depends on the personal character of the speaker;&lt;br&gt;the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind;&lt;br&gt;the third on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself.}}

These three &quot;modes of persuasion&quot; have come to be known as Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.  You may have heard those words before, perhaps in a speech class.  You may even remember what they mean.  I'm going to suggest a real simple way to think about these three concepts.  I realize that such an approach glosses over a lot of the details, but I think it fairly captures the &quot;bare essence&quot; of Aristotle's concepts.  If you have a tough time remembering what these three important words mean, try this...

* When you think of '''ethos''', think of '''ethics'''.  In essence, ethos is a persuasive appeal based on the ethical character of the person making the argument.  If I say something like, &quot;trust me, I know what I'm saying,&quot; and you have no reason to believe that I'm not a good and trustworthy person, you may indeed be persuaded to trust me.  And if you do, I've just succeeded in using the first mode of persuasion: ethos.  Of course, ethos is not exactly the same as ethical, but the two words share a common etymological history.  The concept of ethos was one of Aristotle's main arguments against the sophists.  In a sense, he was saying that the sophists' emphasis on the techniques of public speaking wasn't enough, that if you really want to be a good speaker, first make sure you are an ethical speaker.  In other words, don't just speak...speak the truth.

* When you think of '''pathos''', think of &quot;emotion.&quot;  Of if you prefer, think of em'''path'''y or sym'''path'''y.  Both empathy and sympathy contain the word &quot;path&quot; inside of them, just like '''path'''os.  And both empathy and sympathy refer to emotions.  When you seek empathy from someone, you want them to share the emotions you are feeling,  When you seek sympathy from someone, you want them to have emotions toward you (to &quot;feel&quot; for you, or &quot;feel sorry&quot; for you).  In either case, when you stir the emotions of an audience--when you get them to cry or laugh or feel sad or feel happy--you are engaging the second mode of persuasion: pathos.  So if I say something like, &quot;you love your children, so please please buy life insurance so your kids don't have to go hungry if you die,&quot; I'm attempting to use pathos.  I'm appealing to your emotional side.  Many, if not most of the messages delivered by announcers make extensive use of pathos.

* When you think of '''logos''', think of '''logic'''.  In order to persuade someone to do or buy something, it helps if it makes sense to do so.  No matter how much of a believable person you seem to be (ethos), and no matter how much you engage my feelings toward your message (pathos), part of me will resist being persuaded if I can't grasp the logic of your argument.  So the third mode of persuasion, logos, can be a very important part of a persuasive message.  This is especially true if you are trying to persuade someone to do something that has significant consequences.  There's very little consequence in deciding what kind of soda to buy.  There's much more consequence in deciding what kind of house to buy.  Announcers who work in broadcast news rely on logos (along with ethos and pathos) to communicate effectively.  It may not seem like newscasters are in the business of persuasion, but to some extent they are, since they must persuade you to watch them, and hopefully watch them regularly.  News stories that are clearly written, logically sound and internally consistent are more likely to be successfully communicated.

Ethos, pathos, logos... these three concepts of Aristotle's have had profound impact on our understanding of the process of communication for thousands of years.  And they still have impact today.  While we might use different words to describe these concepts, Aristotle's three main points about effective communication have withstood the test of time.  They have certainly shaped the practice and study of public speaking, and by extension, they have significantly influenced many of the practices of the announcing profession.  While announcers might not credit Aristotle for the role of ethics, emotion and logic in the effort to persuade an audience, these three &quot;modes of persuasion&quot; are very much apparent in much of what announcers do every day.

== The Rise of Journalism ==

Powerful people (at least the smart ones) have long known that information about what was happening in the world could help them stay in power.  Rulers would gladly pay for &quot;inside information&quot; about what their enemies were up to.  [[w:Espionage|Espionage]] is one of the oldest professions, and documented examples of spying can be found in ancient Chinese, Egyptian, Hebrew and Indian societies.
[[Image:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|right|Thucydides]]
Now espionage and journalism may seem like two very different professions, but they share more than you might think.  Both spies and journalists rely on carefully observing what they see.  Both carefully document the details of what they observe.  Both tend to identify the most relevant information from their observations by drawing from the dominant sociopolitical perspective of their culture.  And both try to concisely but thoroughly report those details in a way that their &quot;customers&quot; can understand and take advantage of.  Of course, spies usually work in secret, risking their lives in the pursuit of the &quot;truth.&quot;  Journalists only do that some of the time. 

The nascent democracies of the ancient world recognized the power of information.  Participants in the ancient Greek agora needed to be fully informed in order to make effective decisions.  While many of the &quot;speakers for hire&quot; in the ancient agora were paid to deliver persuasive messages, others pursued the arguably more noble cause of regularly reporting information.  And perhaps the most famous &quot;reporter&quot; of the ancient world was [[w:Thucydides|Thucydides]], who pioneered a very careful system for documenting evidence in reporting.

== The Birth of Broadcasting ==

The first time a human voice was heard on radio was on Christmas Eve (December 24), 1906.  [[w:Reginald Fessenden]], a Canadian inventor and pioneer in radio technology, used this occasion to demonstrate a system for transmitting voice over the airwaves.  Fessenden transmitted a signal from Brant Rock, Massachusetts to ships at sea, in which he included a reading from the Bible, some holiday music and a wish to all of the sailors who could hear him: &quot;Have a Merry Christmas.&quot;  Because his experimental broadcast included music from phonographic records, Fessenden could be called the first &quot;disc jockey,&quot; although it would be decades before that term would be coined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

Eggs (also called ova or oocytes), and sperm are called &quot;Sex Cells&quot;.  A single egg cell is called an ovum, and a single sperm cell is called a spermatozoa.

== Meiosis ==

The process of producing sperm or eggs is called '''meiosis'''. Readers who have some background knowledge in biology may recognize a similar term: &quot;mitosis&quot;. Mitosis is the separation of a cell into two new cells, each with a complete set of DNA.Mitosis is in other words somatic. In meiosis, however, the resultant cell has only half the necessary DNA: 23 chromosomes, one from each pair. During conception, the 23 chromosomes from the sperm and the 23 chromosomes from the egg are combined to create a human fetus with 46 chromosomes.These are also called body cells.

== Sperm ==

Sperm are produced in vast quantities in the testicles, and sperm production is a constant cycle in the body. One of the 23 chromosomes in a sperm cell may be shaped slightly differently than the rest - this is referred to as a Y chromosome.  A sperm cell with all 23 chromosomes the same shape is said to have an X chromosome.  A child resulting from fertilization of an egg by a sperm with an X chromosome will be female, and a child resulting from fertilization of an egg by a sperm with a Y chromosome will be male.  

There are sperm-sorting processes available to increase the likelihood of a particular sex for couples using [[Sexual Health/Fertility and Infertility#Intra-Uterine Insemination|intrauterine insemination]] to achieve pregnancy.  Some [[Sexual Health/Fertility and Infertility#In Vitro Fertilization|in vitro fertilization]] clinics offer couples the option of sex testing before choosing which embryos to transfer.  For couples seeking pregnancy the traditional way, however, there is no way to control which type of sperm fertilizes the egg.

== Eggs ==

Egg cells are released from the ovaries, usually one or two per menstrual cycle.  Every egg has an X chromosome.

During fetal development, a female fetus will have developed between 6 and 7 million eggs by the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy.  Most of the eggs gradually waste away; by puberty, the average female has 300,000 eggs remaining.  During menopause, the body stops releasing egg cells. 

== Fertilization ==

[[Image:Sperm-egg.jpg|left|framed|A sperm meeting an egg.]]

'''Fertilization''', also called '''conception''', happens when a sperm cell combines with an egg cell, usually in the uterus. Once the first sperm enters the egg, the egg's cell membrane solidifies, to prevent multiple sperm from entering.

As the egg cell begins to divide, it is called a '''zygote'''.

Typically, fertilization occurs in the fallopian tubes. For couples that need to use [[Sexual Health/Fertility and Infertility#In Vitro Fertilization|in vitro fertilization]] to achieve pregnancy, fertilization occurs in a laboratory, and the resulting embryos are later placed in the uterus.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Hybridization'' refers to the combining of the orbitals of two or more covalently bonded atoms. Depending on how many free electrons a given atom has and how many bonds it is forming, it will hybridize in a certain manner. The electrons in the s and the p orbitals combine in certain manners to form the bonds. In particular, for most of the atoms of interest in organic chemistry (which form at most four bonds), the more free electrons an atom has, the less &quot;p&quot; character the hybridized bond will have, because the free electrons will take up some space of the p orbitals.

It is easy to determine the hybridization of an atom given a Lewis structure. First, you count the number of pairs of free electrons and the number of ''sigma'' bonds (single bonds). Do not count double bonds, since they do not affect the hybridization of the atom. Once the total of these two is determined, the hybridization pattern is as follows:

 Sigma Bonds + Electron Pairs     Hybridization
               2                       sp
               3                       sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
               4                       sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The pattern here is the same as that for the electron orbitals, which serves as a memory guide.

== Understanding SQL Server 2005 Editions ==
There are five different Editons of the SQL Server 2005. Three of them have 64 bit native versions, the rest is 32 bit only.

=== Enterprise Edition ===
Largest, 32 bit and 64 bit, supports the largest online transaction processing ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLTP OLTP])

=== Standard Edition ===
32bit and 64bit, small and medium enterprises

=== Workgroup Edition ===
Small Enterprises, no limits on size of users, for small servers

=== Developer Edition ===
Same as Enterprise without production licence

=== Express Edition ===
MSDE for SQL Server 2005; free(also for clients access); replacement for Access

== Some hints to remember Features ==
Express; Workgroup; Standard; Enterprise

Number of CPUS: 1;2;4;unlimited. Think of a formula such as CPUs of a Edition == Previous Edition *2 expect for Enterprise.&lt;br&gt;
Memory 1GB;3GB, Limit based on OS, Limit based on OS&lt;br&gt;
64 bit support: Express und Workgroup can only have 64 bit support via WOW([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_on_Windows WOW]&lt;br&gt;
Max DB Size: Express has 4 GB limit

Partitioning is only supported by Enterprise Edition&lt;br&gt;
Database Mirroring is supported by Standard and Enterprise&lt;br&gt;
Fail Over Clustering is supported by Standard(two Nodes) and Enterprise&lt;br&gt;
PDF Rule: Remember Partitioning, Database Mirroring, Failover P == 1 only one edition supports&lt;br&gt;

Log Shipping: All but Express&lt;br&gt;
Management Studio All but Express&lt;br&gt;
Database Tuning Advisor: Standard and Enterprise&lt;br&gt;
Full Text Search: All but Express&lt;br&gt;
SQL Server Agent Job Scheduling: All but Express&lt;br&gt;
Best Practives Advisor: All&lt;br&gt;
Notification Services Standard and Enterprise&lt;br&gt;
Service Broker: All (Express Subsriber only)&lt;br&gt;
Merge Replication: All (Restriction on Express and Workgroup)&lt;br&gt;
Transactional Replication: Restriction on Express and Workgroup&lt;br&gt;
Oracle Replication: Enterprise&lt;br&gt;
Web Services (Http Endpoints): Standard and Enterprise&lt;br&gt;
Report Server: All&lt;br&gt;
Report Builder All but Express&lt;br&gt;
BI Development Studio Express and Workgroup have Report Designer only&lt;br&gt;
Enterprise Managemnet Tool: All but Express&lt;br&gt;
Native Support for Web Services: Reporting Services for Express and Workgroups only&lt;br&gt;
Analysis Services for Standard and Enterprise only&lt;br&gt;

Rules of thumb:
* Express Edition is limited nearly everywhere: It has only Report Server and Best Practices Analyzer and in some only a feature as subscriber only
* Enterprise Edition has everything
* Standard does not support: Oracle Replication and Partitioning and has some Restrictions on Fail Over clustering:
* Workgroup: hardest to Remember: It does not include the features to maintain large databases

== How to Install MS Sql Server 2005-2012 ==

Installation

The Minimum System Requirements

Windows 32 bit System (Minimum Vista with SP2 or Server with SP2 installed), Intel or other supporting processor with at least 2.66 GHz Speed (My personal suggestion ), RAM should be 2 GB or more (if you want to run several applications such as Visual Studio with this server) ” The more you have, the more it will be better”.

[Note:32 bit Systems do not exceed more than 3 GB RAM, if you use 4 GB then it will utilize only 3 GB RAM]

Here we go

Is .Net Framework 3.5 or with SP1 or 4.0 installed? If not then here is the official link (I don’t like unofficial, mind you… ). Read the instructions,when downloading and installing and make sure it has been installed.
Now , its time to install your Sql Server Database.


1. Right click on the SQLEXPRWT_x64_ENU.exe or SQLEXPRWT_x86_ENU.exe SQLEXPRWT_x64_ENU.exe and click ” Run As Administrator”

2. The installation wizard will appear and it will ask for several options.Set your desired language.Choose that option which indicates

“New Standalone Sql Installation or Add Features ” and click Next to proceed. A small auto-check will run and when it gets approval for all the pre-requisites, you will be asked to use the evaluation version or if you have bought a key then enter this and use the full version which has whole lots of benefits.Click Next

3.Accept Terms and conditions and check Updates checkbox (recommended) and click Next.

4.If updates are present then you won’t get any error. Otherwise, an error will be shown and you have to click next in order to install the updates (That’s why I was telling that enable auto update man…. ).If you have the connectivity issues, check the firewall and allow for both inbound and outbound traffic in the allow rule for this type of application. After the errors have been removed, you have to select the features to install.

5. Everything after this will go smoothly. You will be asked to add either the default instance or the named instance .There is nothing to get worried about those instances sort of creatures.

“Take the easiest example. We have the main SQL Server Database which resides in my server computer and it is called manager-pc.The other employees of my company have specific needs from this server .

I assign the instances of my Server as follows:

Employee1 has been assigned the instance from my Database Server as
manager-pc/instance1 for writing queries etc.
Employee2 has been given more rights in the form of manager-pc/instance2 instance and so on.
* If someone has to show the reports from the instance of the server assigned to Employee2; he has to address the instance2 of manager-pc. So basically, he needs to refer to
manager-pc/instance2.
* If someone has to connect to the default instance, he needs to go to manager-pc directly.
The instances are really great from preventing data corruption or intrusion,hacking,sql injection related issues
Just relax.It’s simple :)”
6. The disk space requirements screen is quite obvious to show you the required space as well as available
7. Now, here comes the screen asking you to configure the network settings.I will suggest you to assign account to each service on individual basis as it is recommended by the Microsoft. However, I use my own server’s administrator account for all the services. It is upto you to set the services to start manually or automatically.It needs some study material from here when making this decision.Click the Next button to proceed
8. The Database Engine Configuration screen gives you the option to choose the type of authentication.
Here ,we have the default user login id sa which is kept intact and we choose Mixed Mode and assign a good password . Click Next.
9. The next screen will take you to either change the path of the Data Directory or keep it unchanged and click??? Click what? obviously NNNNN…Next
10. In order to store the unstructured data in your database such as images or files etc, you should enable filestream by checking it and then click Next button
11. Let the Multidimensional Data Mining option checked and click Next
12. Error Reporting should be checked for descripitive explanation about the condition of the errors, if they occur in your server. this helps us to send the errors to Microsoft directly and yes; they help.
13. Installation configuration rules auto-checking screen appears and you have to……………………..You have to do nothing dear but click Next after the check completes.
14. Click Next on Install screen
14. Installation ……….. sit back and relax .After successfull completion ; click Next. Here , you may have to do one more thing ! Shout out lowder and say “Oh my” if the installation gets failed!!!!!
15. Installed ….congrats
16. After installation, check to see whether the required services are working ; Sql Server Configuration Manager is there to help

      <text xml:space="preserve">On one machine, there can be more editions

Default Instance: Only one. Please note some of the MS products using the SQL Server request the default instance (For instance the Team Foundation Server).

== Determining Multiple or Single Instances ==
Multiple Instances mean more administration overhead. Additional Instances require additonal resources: Memory and processor capacity-

Advantages of multiple instances
* testing multiple versions
* testing service packs, dev databases and applications
* different customers require their own system and user databases with full administrative control or their instance
* desktop engine is embedded in the applications, because every application can install each own instance

      <text xml:space="preserve">Decide on Security and collation

SQL Server Agent and SQL Server run as Windows Services.

They run in a context of a user account. Determining which account is an important decision. 

Questions: 
* Should use use a separate account for the SQL Server service and the SQL Server Agent service, or should you use the same account for both?
* Should you use a built-in system account or a domain user account?

Remember:
The SQL Server jobs require to interact with the SQL Server Agent service. When the SQL Server Agent service must interact with different servers, DBAs create different accounts for these two services to avoid giving the SQL Server service more permission than it needs.

Build-in System account or Domain user account

You can choose between: Network service account, local system account, or a dedicated domain user account.

The Network service account is a special built-in system account that is similar to authenticated user accounts. This account has the same level of access to system resources and objects as members of the Users group. Services that run under this account will use the credentials of the computer account to access network resources. Not recommended to use.

The local system account is a Windows OS account that has full adminstrativve rights on the local computer but has no network rights. You can use this account for development or testing of servers that you do not integrate with other server applications or to interact with any network resources. Not recommended.

Recommended: 
Create and use one or two dedicated domain user accounts for the SQL Server and SQL Server Agent services.


== Authentication mode ==
Windows and Mixed mode. Default is Windows: Only users that have previously authenticated to the Windows OS can connect to the SQL Server 2005 instance.

Mixed is recommended for Legacy.

== Determining Collation Setting ==
You define the default collation for a SQL Server at installation. The SQL Server uses the collation setting to determine how non-Unicode character data is stored and how to sort and compare Unicode and non-Unicode data.

Default will be selected of Windows.

      <text xml:space="preserve">data files contain data and objects (tables, indexes and so on) and log files contain transaction log.

filegroups are grouped datafiles for easier admin.

== Data Files ==
There are primary and secondary Data Files.

The primary has the extension mdf and contains data and all information regarding data (such as information on the secondary data files). For optimal performance do not store data there.

The secondary has the extension ndf. No administrative data is stored here. There is a maximum of 32,766 secondary data files.

== Log Files ==
Extension ldf. Each db needs at least one log file. You can create more than one

== Filegroups ==
Logical structure of data files. 

Also there are primary and secondary filegroups. The primary contains the primary data file and every secondary data file not stored in a specific filegroup. There can be up to 32,766 secondary file groups.

Filegroups can be configured as read only. 

The filegroups are created with the SSMS or with the CREATE DATABASE command.

Five parameters have to be considered: Name, Filename, Size, Maxsize and Filegrowth

== Configuring Raid Systems ==
There are Raid Levels 0,1,5 and 10. It has to be considered to be used in high performance environments.
Configuring Database Files with RAID Systems
RAID systems are arrays of disk drives that provide fault tolerance, more storage
capacity, and better performance for the disk subsystem, depending on the configuration.
Although RAID hardware systems are not part of the SQL Server configuration,
they directly affect SQL Server’s performance. There are a variety of RAID levels,
each of which uses a different algorithm for fault tolerance. The most common RAID
levels used with SQL Server are 0, 1, 5, and 10.
■ RAID 0 is also known as disk striping because it creates a disk file system called
a stripe set. RAID 0 gives the best performance for read and write operations
because it spreads these operations across all the disks in the set. However,
RAID 0 does not provide fault tolerance; if one disk fails, you lose access to all
the data on the stripe set.
■ RAID 1, also known as disk mirroring, provides a redundant copy of the selected
disk. RAID 1 improves read performance but can degrade the performance of
write operations.
■ RAID 5, the most popular RAID level, stripes the data across the disks of the
RAID set as does RAID 0, but it also adds parity information to provide fault tolerance.
Parity information is distributed among all the disks. RAID 5 provides
better performance than RAID 1. However, when a disk fails, read performance
decreases.
58 Chapter 2 Configuring SQL Server 2005
■ RAID 10, or RAID 1+0, includes both striping without parity and mirroring.
RAID 10 offers better availability and performance than RAID 5, especially for
write-intensive applications.
The RAID configuration that is best for your database files depends on several factors,
including performance and recoverability needs. RAID 10 is the recommended RAID
system for transaction log, data, and index files. If you have budget restrictions, keep
transaction log files in a RAID 10 system, and store data and index files in a RAID 5
system.

== Best practices ==
1. Do not put data files on the same drive as os files
2. Separate transaction log files from data files
3. database tempdb should be on a separate drive (Raid 10 or RAID 5)

== -kHandleSize parameter needs to be decalared! ==

PROBLEM!!!!

-kHandleSize is a parameter in the method drawBounds and in the return value for the method handleRect; and needs to be declared somewhere! The proceeding methods are in different files as well so the scope of -kHandleSize goes beyond either file.

This omission prevents the application from compiling!

Also the source files are not available from the link in this Wiki Books directory as they are supposed to be. A missing page error appears when the link to download the source is clicked. This is an excellent tutorial and it's a shame that it is not usable in it's current form.


== _dragShape undeclared ==

The _dragShape data object in WKDDrawView is undeclared as well and causes a compile time error. -Boogityboo04

whoever wrote this, thank you

== Some Problems and Fixes ==

Thanks for this very helpful introduction; you've obviously spent a lot of time on it. I've found a few problems with the page &quot;Wikidraw's view class&quot; (some noted by previous users). Here they are:

1. kHandleShape is not defined in WKDShape.m. The answer to this is to define a static int up about the @implementation section:

  static int kHandleSize = 3;

2. _dragShape is not declared in WKDDrawView.h. I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be a WKDShape*, right? So you need to add this:

  WKDShape* _dragShape

3. There are some #imports missing. If I recall, you need #import &quot;WKDShape.h&quot; in WKDDrawView.{h,m}.

4. You forgot to write the implementation for currentTool in ToolsController.m. This is easy: just return _curTool.

5. There is a bug in how WKDDrawView learns about tool changes (via notifications). If the user changes tools but there are no documents open, then nothing will be subscribed to the event, and sCurrentTool won't be changed. But I gather that this whole notification business is more for teaching the concept than good design, so you might just want to mention that it has this flaw.

Thanks again for all your work!

== Updates requested ==

I'm liking the book, but it's getting to the point that it takes some guess work in order to get through it, because XCode has changed so much since it was originally written, and the instructions could use some &quot;fleshing out.&quot;
Nevertheless, thank you to everyone for making this available!

At this point, I'm voting that we make an effective rewrite of this book.  The material here is fantastic, but, as mentioned, is sorely in need of an update.  Yes, it was targetted towards 10.3, but a &quot;beginner&quot; is likely going to have 10.6.  Also, some sections get kind of hard to follow, in my opinion (especially when trying to translate to newer versions of Xcode).  All in all, taking what material is here and adding a bit more structure and polish could result in an excellent resource!  --[[Special:Contributions/12.34.246.73|12.34.246.73]] ([[User talk:12.34.246.73|talk]]) 19:01, 25 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all: SQL Server Mail does not depend on Extended Mapi

'''Prerequesites for Database Mail:'''
* Database Mail has to be enabled via the Surface Area Configuration Tool, Database Mail Configuration Wizard or the sp_configure.

* Service Broker needs to be enabled in the Database mail host database msdb

* The Database Mail externals executables need access to the SMTP Server

Four Components: Configuration Component, Messaging Component, Database Mail executable, Logging and auditing component.

The configuration components consists of a ''database Mail account'' and a ''Database Mail profile''. The Database Mail account contains the information that SQL Server uses to send e-mail messages to the SMTP server, such as the SMTP server name, the authentication type, and the e-mail address.

==Operations==

===Squaring a matrix===
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 a=[1 2;3 4];
 a^2;
&lt;/source&gt;
a^2 is the equivalent of a*a. To square each element:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 a.^2
&lt;/source&gt;
The period before the operator tells MATLAB to perform the operation element by element.

===Determinant===

Getting the determinant of a matrix, requires that you first define your
matrix, then run the function &quot;det()&quot; on that matrix, as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 a = [1 2; 3 4];
 det(a)
 ans = -2
&lt;/source&gt;
====Symbolic Determinant====

You can get the symbolic version of the determinant matrix by declaring the values 
within the matrix as symbolic as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 m00 = sym('m00'); m01 = sym('m01'); m10 = sym('m10'); m11 = sym('m11');
&lt;/source&gt;
or 
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 syms m00 m01 m10 m11;
&lt;/source&gt;
 
Then construct your matrix out of the symbolic values:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 m = [m00 m01; m10 m11];
&lt;/source&gt;
Now ask for the determinant:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 det(m)
 ans = m00*m11-m01*m10
&lt;/source&gt;

===Transpose=== 
To find the transpose of a matrix all you do is place an apostrophe after the bracket.
Transpose- switch the rows and columns of a matrix.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 a=[1 2 3]
 
 aTranspose=[1 2 3]'
&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 b=a' %this will make b the transpose of a
&lt;/source&gt;
when a is complex, the apostrophe means transpose and conjugate.

Example
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
a=[1 2i;3i 4];
a'=[1 -3i;-2i 4];
&lt;/source&gt;
For a pure transpose, use .' instead of apostrophe.

==Systems of linear equations==

There are lots of ways to solve these equations.

===Homogeneous Solutions===

===Particular Solutions===

===State Space Equations===

==Special Matrices==

Often in MATLAB it is necessary to use different types of unique matrices to solve problems.

===Identity matrix===

To create an identity matrix (ones along the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere) use the MATLAB command &quot;eye&quot;:

 &gt;&gt;a = eye(4,3)
 a =
    1   0   0
    0   1   0
    0   0   1
    0   0   0

===Ones Matrix===

To create a matrix of all ones use the MATLAB command &quot;ones&quot;

 a=ones(4,3)

Produces:
 a =
 
     1     1     1
     1     1     1
     1     1     1
     1     1     1

===Zero matrix===

The &quot;zeros&quot; function produces an array of zeros of a given size. For example, 

 a=zeros(5,3)

Produces:

 a =
 
     0     0     0
     0     0     0
     0     0     0 
     0     0     0


This type of matrix, like the ones matrix, is often useful as a &quot;background&quot;, on which to place other values, so that all values in the matrix except for those at certain indices are zero.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Row reduced echelon form==

To find the Row reduced echelon form of a matrix just use the MATLAB command rref

Example:

 a=[1 2 3; 4 5 6];
 b=rref(a); 

It's that simple. (I believe that MATLAB uses the Gauss-Jordan elimination method to make this computation; don't quote me on that (I'm not even sure if there are other methods)).

==Inverse==

To find the inverse of a matrix use the MATLAB command inv.
(note that the matrix must be square)

Example:

 a=[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9];
 b=inv(a);

==Cofactor, minor==

==The Jacobian==

 t=jacobian(e,w);

e is a scalar vector, w is a vector of functions. Also, this does not solve equations symbolically unless you define the w vector functions as symbolics prior to executing this statement. 

Example:
 
 syms x y z;
 w=[x y z];
 e=[1 2 3];
 t=jacobian(e,w);

      <text xml:space="preserve">Java has a concept called block that is enclosed between the { and } characters, called curly braces.  A block executed as a single statetement, and can be used where a single statetement is accepted.  

After a block is executed all local variables defined inside the block is discarded, go out of scope.

== Must they? ==

Regarding numbers 2 and 3, I don't know if that's accurate. The Ant Manual seems to indicate otherwise on number two (see the chart at the top of [http://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html]). It looks like it agrees with you on number three (just below the table referenced above), but when I tried it, Ant 1.7 doesn't complain. Not a big deal probably, as the majority of build files will obviously need both. Thanks for the work done here. I'm just getting my feet wet with Ant, and the manual has far too much detail for a newcomer.</text>

== How can I mask excludes? ==

If I have the files:

 file1.txt
 file2.txt
 file3.txt
 file4.txt
 file5.txt
 file6.txt
 other1.txt
 other2.txt

How can I create a patternset that includes:

* Every .txt file, except:
** Files named &quot;file*.txt&quot;, which should be excluded, except:
*** Files named &quot;file1.txt&quot; or &quot;file2.txt&quot;, which should be included

The resulting set should be:

 file1.txt
 file2.txt
 other1.txt
 other2.txt

Of course, in my real-world situation I have a quite larger number of files and enumerating &quot;file[^12].txt&quot; is not acceptable.

Thanks!

An '''essay''' is an unofficial document on wikibooks, written to express a particular opinion about the project. Essays that advocate a particular method of doing things may become an [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines#Policies|official policy]] or a [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines#Guidelines|guideline]] if they are accepted by the community at large. Essays can be used in a discussion to distill and solidify a particular viewpoint, so that people don't need to be constantly arguing the same points over and over again.

Essays, unless they are generally accepting as being important for the community, should be written in the User: namespace.

Essays that violate Wikibooks policies or guidelines may be deleted.

An essay should be tagged with the {{tl|Essay}} template. The template adds the page to [[:Category:Wikibooks essays]].</text>

      <comment>/* Bureaucrat = User */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}
== Administrators ==

Administrators are, or they should be, normal users. Any user, theoretically, can be nominated for, and elected as an administrator. Administrators however, have certain differences in ability from &quot;normal users&quot;. Some people say they have &quot;privledges&quot;, some people say they have &quot;extra tools&quot;, and some people claim they have a few &quot;restrictions lifted&quot;. 

Administrators are produced through an RFA discussion, and are awarded their new title by a bureaucrat. However, the very existance of administrators gives rise to the administrator problem.

== The Administrator Problem ==

the administrator problem is one of distinction. How distinct are administrators from ordinary users? How easily can one become the other? It should be reasonably easy to create an admin, but how easy is it to make an admin into a regular user again? 

But even if it is easy to make one into the other, who decides that the transformation should happen, and based on what metric? Bureaucrats create and &quot;uncreate&quot; admins, but how much discretion can a bureaucrat use in the process?

== Badge of honor: Sysop ==

Sysops are usually promoted via community consensus. After a long discussion, the community either is or is not in favor of the sysop, and a bureaucrat performs the promotion. And if one bureaucrat doesn't promote the candidate, another one will.

Sysops are judged by the community on a number of metrics, depending upon the voters involved. Some people might value a particular quality in a person, and may condemn them on equally particular qualities. Some users may quantify a candidate based on their edit count, or their activity in fighting vandalism. Some people like candidates who are active on VfD, or who are active in policy. Some users may like a candidate for no other reason then because they are friends. Either way, the voting for an admin is a terribly arbitrary process. 

And it has to be. If the process weren't dependent on the whims of the users, it would be a built-in facet of the wikimedia software. After a certain time, and after jumping through certain hoops, a person would automatically be promoted. But this isn't the way it is: Admins need to pass metrics that are hard to quantify: they need to be &quot;trusted&quot;, they need to be &quot;Active&quot;, they need to be &quot;helpful&quot;. And it turns out that if people think they are trusted, or active, or helpful, that's all that matters. So it boils down to a popularity contest of sorts, where the people who are generally liked are rewarded, and the people that are generally disliked are not. 

And so adminship becomes a badge of honor: If people like you, you get the badge, and if people don't like you, you don't get the badge.

== Admins as lifetime members ==

There are no concrete metrics either for when an admin should lose the privledges. Some people hotly contend that admins should only be de-badged due to flagrant abuse or misuse of the tools. A user who receives adminship, if they don't abuse them flamboyantly, simply keep them forever, whether they are needed, or used, or not. In essence, adminship is a lifetime membership, where there are no requirements other then &quot;don't do anything really bad&quot;.

== Concrete metrics ==

A solution to this admin problem is to instantiate a series of concrete metrics. And if the metrics aren't solidly concrete, they should still be well respected. Meta, for instance, requires that a user must have at least 100 edits on that project to be a candidate for adminship. Wikibooks, if we were going to institute a minimum, would probably require more then that. Can you imagine a person being well-known enough, and well-liked enough after 100 edits to become an admin? 

People should display a need for administrator tools, and an understanding of how they are used to become candidates. Administrators who do not use their tools, or who are completely inactive at this project should not need to keep them. In short, adminship should neither be a badge of honor, nor a lifetime membership: adminship should be tools that are given when needed, and taken when not needed. An RFA shouldn't be a popularity contest, but instead a jury: to decide whether the professed need for the tools is accurate and genuine.

== Admin = User ==

An admin is just a regular user, but they aren't always treated as such. The conversion from user to admin should be &quot;no big deal&quot;, and the transition back should also be &quot;no big deal&quot;. If a user is absent for a month, they should lose their administrative privledges. In essence, if you don't use it, you've displayed no particular need to have it at all. Now, this is not to be a punishment, and if an absent ex-admin returns, and wants to reapply for admin tools, they should be granted with a minimum of fuss. 

As an example, consider an admin who has been away from wikibooks for two months. At the end of the first month his adminship was removed, and a month later, he returns. Now, when he comes back and finds that his admin rights are gone, he goes to reapply for them, and says &quot;I've been gone for two months, for reason X, and I've returned to become an active wikibookian again. I would like to have my old admin powers back, because they will help me&quot;. Barring any immediate complaints, his powers should be restored.

== Bureaucrat = User ==

A bureaucrat is also just an ordinary user, and the transition from bureaucrat to user should be easy and painless as well. If a person meets all the metrics to become an admin, ''and'' meets the additional trust and activity requirements, they should be allowed to become a bureaucrat. However, if a bureaucrat is absent and returns, they shouldn't necessarily become a bureaucrat again, because they have violated the trust from that second requirement: They were not available to the community and were not active members. However, they certainly should be able to become an admin again. Once an admin, they can display their trustworthiness and activity, and become a bureaucrat again through the normal channels.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because the Moody / Crouch impersonation is so central to the fourth book, I am strongly suggesting that we allow both the false Moody and the real one to appear in the Character pages under [[../Alastor Moody/]]. If there are no details about Moody in the fourth book &quot;Role in the books&quot; section, it would be a spoiler indeed, one that even a Beginner Spoiler wouldn't be able to avoid. &quot;A major character?

Dequervain's tenosynovitis of the first dorsal extensor compartment is a common affliction in any hand practice.  The predisposing anatomic variation of a separate compartment for the extensor brevis has been emphasized.  There is frequently an instigating unaccustomed increase in activity described.  Post partum incidence is especially noteworthy with the proposed reason being the manner in which a newborn is cradled in the palm with the thumb abducted to broaden the grasp.  

Conservative modalities for treatment include NSAIDS, splints and corticosteroid injections alone or incombination.  A recent literature review favors injection alone between these three having the best overall success rate of 83%.
[http://www.jabfm.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/2/102?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=&amp;hits=&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;fulltext=+tenosynovitis&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT/ conservative treatment]

Stenosing tenovaginitis captures the effect observed when decompressing the tendons of the first dorsal extensor compartment.  A separate compartment for the extensor pollicus brevis is encountered in 80% of cases.  Typically a release including the division or excision of the septum between the abductor longus and extensor brevis achieves the aim.  Releasing along the dorsal margin of the compartment affords a shelf of supra-tendinous retinaculum which is sufficiently broad to prevent subluxation of the tendons.  Care to retain the thinner portions of the retinaculum proximally and distally may also help in avoiding this complication.  Respect for the branching radial sensory nerve avoiding forceful retraction, an assistant should only need finger tips to hold the retractors which if they are protecting the nerve should be repositioned periodically as an extra assurance against post operative dysesthesia.  Bulky and inflammed tenosynovium is excised.  Grossly dissociated tendon substance is debrided where it interferes with gliding.  The ridge of bone between the EPB and AbPL is left undisturbed.  
Closure with 5-0 nylon, usually 4 sutures simple or horizontal mattress is sufficient.  Infiltration of the subcutaneous layer with 0.25% marcaine helps with post operative analgesia.  A soft dressing of xeroform 4 by 4 gauze sponges cast padding and a 2 inch ace wrap is sufficient.  If there is concern for the possilibility of subluxation the retinaculum can be reconstructed with partial additional release enabling a width of retinaculum to be repaired over the tendons creating a capacious oblique pulley.  Anchoring to the dermis creates undesirable dimpling.  Splinting post operatively for a few weeks is an interum measure when simple release seems worrisome from the standpoint of potential subluxation or if a reconstruction of the retinaculum has been performed.  Circumduction exercises with the thumb may mitigate against adhesion formation if immobilization is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Pasta-Brontosaurus.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|An old image of the Brontosaurus&amp;mdash;wrong head, wrong lifestyle!]]
The ''Brontosaurus'', whose name means &quot;thunder lizard&quot; in Greek, is one of the most famous dinosaurs of all. However, there is no dinosaur that is named Brontosaurus!

A long time ago Dr. O. C. Marsh discovered a small four legged dinosaur with a long neck.  He decided to name the dinosaur ''Apatosaurus'' meaning ''deceptive lizard''.  Later the same scientist discovered a much bigger dinosaur of the same type.  Because the back bones seemed different he decided it was a different dinosaur.  This dinosaur was so big he decided to name it ''Brontosaurus''.  When scientists looked at these fossils later they realized that the Apatosaurus was the same animal as the Brontosaurus.  Scientists use the first name given to an animal, so they decided to rename the Brontosaurus to Apatosaurus because Apatosaurus came first. Scientists now know that the back bones of the Apatosaurus grew together as the animal gets bigger.  It was because the back bones changed that Dr. Marsh thought they were different animals. The animal is still believed and taught as a different type of dinosaur. So kids learn Brontosaurus is a whole different dinosaur just like they learn that pluto is still a planet. When they grow up they believe brontosaurus is still a dino so that hurts their career and life.

[[File:Apatosaurus_Camarasaurus_head_compairison.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|160px|(Top) the correct Apatosaurus head; (Bottom) the wrong Brontosaurus head.]]
Dr. Marsh also made the Brontosaurus very popular.  He put the first full dinosaur skeleton on display in a museum for everyone to see. The bones he put on display where his Brontosaurus bones, and Brontosaurus became very popular. Dr. Marsh made some  other mistakes about the Brontosaurus.  When he put the Brontosaurus skeleton together some bones were missing, even the skull.  He used bones from other dinosaur digs that he thought belonged to Brontosaurus.  He accidentally put a head from a dinosaur called the ''Camarasaurus'' onto the body of an ''[[Wikijunior: Dinosaurs/Apatosaurus|Apatosaurus]]''.  He also thought the Brontosaurus had lived mostly in the water.  This was another mistake!  The rocks that scientists find Apatosaurus bones in do not come from swampy areas.     

It took almost 100 years after Brontosaurus was first named for two scientists, Jack McIntosh and David Bermanbase, to find these mistakes, and put the right head on the right body at last!

==Introduction==

'''''Note:''' If you are not aware of the general interpretations of the Korean alphabet, please first read [[Korean/Alphabet|Alphabet]] before continuing.''

''This page uses the International Phonetic Alphabet to transcribe pronunciation.  All text within square brackets'' [skwɛər ˈbrækət̩s] ''uses that system. See the [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Wikipedia entry on IPA]] for more information.''


The few essential pronunciation rules and exceptions in this lesson will improve your accuracy in speaking and interpreting Korean.

==Plain, aspirated, and tense==
In English, certain pairs of consonants, like ''p''/''b'', ''t''/''d'', ''s''/''z'', and ''k''/''g'', have a pronunciation that differs mostly in whether they are [[w:Voice (phonetics)|voiced or voiceless]].  Korean consonants do not have that same distinction, but rather differ according to whether they are &quot;plain&quot;, &quot;aspirated&quot;, or &quot;tense&quot;.

{{Korean/Consonant jamo chart
| heading=Some consonant jamo are plain, some aspirated, some tense:
| hide the following:
|ㄴ=|ㄹ=|ㅁ=|ㅇ=|ㅎ=}}

Aspirated consonants (ㅋ, ㅌ,  ㅍ, and ㅊ) are pronounced with a burst of air that does not accompany their plain counterparts.  To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, put a hand or a lit candle in front of your mouth and say &quot;tore&quot; ([tʰɔɹ]) and then &quot;store&quot; ([stɔɹ]). You should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with &quot;tore&quot; that does not appear with &quot;store&quot;. In English, the ''t'' should be aspirated in &quot;tore&quot; and unaspirated in &quot;store&quot;.  In Korean, the aspirated consonants are like the ''t'' in &quot;tore&quot;, in that you must expel a burst of air to say them correctly.

Tense consonants (ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, and ㅉ) are said with a harder, stiffer voice than their plain counterparts.  With these &quot;tense&quot; consonants, the diaphragm, glottis, and tongue are tense.  For example, imagine you were to say &quot;duck!&quot; kind of loudly.  The hard ''d'' sound in &quot;duck!&quot; is like the sound made by the Korean ㄸ.

==[[wikt:ㄹ|ㄹ]] (''rieul'')==
Proper pronunciation of the Korean letter ㄹ takes some practice for most English speakers.  It is pronounced sort of like a half ''r'' and half ''l'' sound. Specifically, it is either an [[w:Alveolar tap|alveolar tap]] or an [[w:Alveolar lateral approximant|alveolar lateral approximant]], depending on the following sound.  While difficult at first, mastery is fairly easy.

==Initial, Middle, and Final Consonants==

Korean alphabet charts have two tables: initial sounds, and final sounds.  The sound of a Korean consonant can change slightly when it is preceded or followed by another consonant.  For example, [[wikt:ㄱ|ㄱ]] can be pronounced as a voiced sound (the English ''g'') or voiceless (like the English ''k'').  To know how to pronounce such letters, it's important to know the difference between an initial, a medial, and a final consonant.

===Initial Consonant===

An initial consonant is any consonant at the beginning of a word.  Initial consonants (especially at the beginning of sentences and phrases) are usually pronounced voiceless.  For example the [[wikt:ㅈ|ㅈ]] in the word [[wikt:저|저]] (&quot;I&quot;) is typically voiceless, especially as first word of a sentence.  That makes it sound more like &quot;ch&quot; than &quot;j&quot; to an English speaker.  The consonants that follow this rule are [[wikt:ㄱ|ㄱ]], [[wikt:ㄷ|ㄷ]], [[wikt:ㅈ|ㅈ]], and [[wikt:ㅂ|ㅂ]].  Thus, initial ㄱ sounds more like &quot;k&quot; than &quot;g&quot;, initial ㄷ sounds more like &quot;t&quot; than &quot;d&quot;, initial ㅈ sounds more like &quot;ch&quot; than &quot;j&quot;, and initial ㅂ sounds more like &quot;p&quot; than &quot;b&quot;:

Examples:
* [[wikt:가|가]] ([ka]): initial sound is unvoiced.
* [[wikt:다|다]] ([ta]): initial sound is unvoiced.
* [[wikt:바|바]] ([pa]): initial sound is unvoiced.
* [[wikt:자|자]] ([ʨa], &quot;cha&quot;): initial sound is unvoiced.

===Middle Consonants===

Consonants that come in the middle of a sentence can follow some complex sound changes, but the two most important changes are whether the consonant follows another consonant or a vowel.  For example, the word [[wikt:막대기|막대기]] (&quot;stick&quot;) has a middle consonant-consonant sequence (ㄱㄷ) and a vowel-consonant sequence (ㅐㄱ).  In many cases, a middle consonant with a preceding consonant becomes slightly more tensified, meaning a &quot;tighter, stronger&quot; pronunciation.  So the ㄷ becomes a slightly harder &quot;d&quot; ([d̬]), but the second ㄱ is pronounced &quot;normally&quot; ([g]).  The same consonants listed in the section above ([[wikt:ㄱ|ㄱ]], [[wikt:ㄷ|ㄷ]], [[wikt:ㅈ|ㅈ]], and [[wikt:ㅂ|ㅂ]]) are also mainly the ones that follow this rule.

Examples:
* [[wikt:막대기|막'''대'''기]] ([mak̚'''d̬'''ɛːgi]): Middle consonant ㄷ follows another consonant, so it is more tense.
* [[wikt:막대기|막대'''기''']] ([mak̚d̬ɛː'''g'''i]): Middle consonant ㄱ follows another vowel, so it has the standard pronunciation.

===Final Consonants===

A final consonant is a consonant that either ends a word, or is preceded by another consonant.  Examples are found in [[wikt:밥|밥]] ([pap̚], &quot;rice&quot;) and [[wikt:식사|식사]] ([ɕik̚sa], &quot;meal&quot;).  Notice that ㅂ is the final letter in 밥.  This causes its pronunciation to shorten to an [[w:Unreleased stop|unreleased stop]], like the ''p'' in the English word &quot;apt&quot; ([æp̚t]).  The ㄱ in 식사 also has a similar change.  It's pronounced similar to the ''c'' in the English word &quot;act&quot; ([æk̚t]).  ㄱ,ㄷ,ㅈ, and ㅂ follow this rule in final position.  Other consonants can sometimes follow more complex rules.  Some of them will be discussed here, but many are very complex and will be discussed in the [[../Advanced Pronunciation Rules/]] section.

Examples:
* [[wikt:밥|밥]] ([pap̚], ''bap''): Final consonant ㅂ is at the end of the word, so it sounds tensed and abbreviated.
* [[wikt:식사|식사]] ([ɕik̚sa]): Final consonant ㄱ is followed by another consonant, so it sounds tensed and abbreviated.

==[[wikt:ㅇ|ㅇ]] (''ieung'')==

[[wikt:ㅇ|ㅇ]] (''ieung'') is a special letter in Korean, because sometimes it makes a sound and sometimes it doesn't.  This is determined by whether it is in the initial, middle, or final position.

* In initial position, such as in the word [[wikt:엄마|엄마]] ([ʌmma], &quot;mother&quot;) ㅇ is not pronounced, and the vowel becomes the initial sound.
* In the middle position, there are two possibilities.
**  When ㅇ follows a final consonant, that preceding consonant replaces ㅇ.  For example, [[wikt:한국어|한'''국어''']] (''Han'''gugeo''''', &quot;Korean language&quot;) has an ㅇ following the final consonant ㄱ in 국 .  That ㄱ is pronounced as if it replaces the initial ㅇ of the following syllable, thus the word is pronounced as if it were written &quot;한'''구거'''&quot; [hangugʌ].
** However, when ㅇ is ''not'' preceded by a consonant, such as in the word [[wikt:아이|아이]] ([ai], &quot;child&quot;), it is silent.
* Finally, if ㅇ is in the final position, such as in [[wikt:강|강]] ([kaŋ], &quot;river&quot;) or [[wikt:영어|영어]] ([jʌŋʌ], &quot;English language&quot;), then it is pronounced [ŋ], similar to the ''ng'' in the English word &quot;si'''ng'''&quot;.

Examples:
* [[wikt:엄마|'''엄'''마]] ([ʌmma]): ㅇ in initial position is not pronounced.
* [[wikt:한국어|한국'''어''']] ([hangugʌ]): ㅇ in middle position with preceding consonant is replaced by the consonant (한'''국어''' -&gt; &quot;한'''구거'''&quot;).
* [[wikt:아이|아'''이''']] ([ai]): ㅇ in middle position with no preceding consonant is silent.
* [[wikt:강|'''강''']] ([kaŋ]): ㅇ in final position is similar to ''ng'' sound.

==Final-initial pairs ㄴㄹ and ㄹㄹ==

The final-initial pairs ㄴㄹ and ㄹㄹ each become [ll] (or for some speakers, [ɭl]):

Examples:
* [[wikt:몰라|몰라]] ([molla], low form for &quot;don't know&quot;)
* [[wikt:곤란|곤란]] ([kollan], &quot;troubles, difficulty&quot;)
* [[wikt:원래|원래]] ([wʌllɛ], &quot;originally&quot;)

Note that the final-initial pair ㄴㄴ does ''not'' follow this rule.  Each ㄴ in ㄴㄴ retains its natural sound ([n̚n]).

==T-stops==

There are a few consonants that, when they are in the final position, are pronounced [t̚] (an unreleased ''t'', like in the English word &quot;[[wikt:atlas|a'''t'''las]]&quot;).  These characters are: [[wikt:ㄷ|ㄷ]], [[wikt:ㅅ|ㅅ]], [[wikt:ㅆ|ㅆ]], [[wikt:ㅈ|ㅈ]], [[wikt:ㅊ|ㅊ]], and [[wikt:ㅌ|ㅌ]]:

* [[wikt:맛|맛]] ([mat̚], &quot;flavor, taste&quot;)
* [[wikt:꽃|꽃]] ([g̬ot̚], &quot;flower&quot;)
* [[wikt:끝|끝]] ([g̬ɯt̚], &quot;end&quot;)
* [[wikt:돋보기|돋보기]] ([tot̚pogi], &quot;magnifying glass&quot;)
* [[wikt:맞다|맞다]] ([mat̚da], &quot;to correct&quot;)
* [[wikt:있다|있다]] ([it̚da], &quot;to exist&quot;)

However, if an ㅇ (''ieung'') follows a t-stop letter, then the normal sound is simply carried over:
* [[wikt:맛이|맛이]] ([maɕi], as if it were spelled &quot;마시&quot;)

==Exercise==

Pronounce the following:
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:독일|독일]]
| answer = [togil]: unvoiced initial ㄷ, final ㄱ moves into subsequent initial position }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:분류학|분류학]]
| answer = [pulljuhak̚]: unvoiced initial ㅂ, final-initial pair ㄴㄹ, unreleased final ㄱ }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:멧돼지|멧돼지]]
| answer = [met̚dwɛʥi]: final ㅅ as t-stop }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:공병|공병]]
| answer = [koŋbjʌŋ]: unvoiced initial ㄱ, nasal final ㅇ }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eukaryotic cells divide through a process called mitosis followed by cytokinesis.

==Mitosis==
Mitosis in itself is the division of the nucleus inside the cell. However, once the nucleus divides, the whole cell divides shortly afterwards, known as cytokinesis.

The stages of mitosis are as follows:

===Interphase===
Interphase is considered by most to be a resting phase. It consists of G1, S, and G2.

===Prophase===
Just prior to mitosis, the pair of centrioles duplicates. During prophase, the two pairs of centrioles migrate to opposite poles. Centrioles form spindle fibers, which become microtubules and eventually attach to the centormeres. Fibers, known as asters, radiate from the centrioles outward.

===Metaphase===
The spindle fibers enter the nuclear region, extend from the centrioles to the centromere, and attach at a point known as the kinetechore. Once the spindle fibers are attached, they align the centromeres along the equatorial region of the nucleus known as the metaphase plate, so that the arms of the chromosomes point towards the poles of the cell.

===Anaphase===
The centromere divides and the two chromatids separate from each other, forming two identical daughter chromosomes. The spindle fibers attach to the centromere and pull the newly-divided chromosomes towards the poles and away from the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers appear to move, but in fact, the microtubules are continuously formed at one end of the spindle fiber and then disassembled at the other.

===Telophase===
After the chromosomes reach the poles, a nuclear membrane forms around each set of daughter nuclei and the chromosomes uncoil and elongate, once again becoming invisible. The spindle fibers break down and disappear. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow, an indentation in the cell membrane, begins to develop between the daughter cells. This marks the end of mitosis.

This recipe for '''beanburgers''' has been adapted from a Somerfield recipe as part of a Food Technology GCSE course in the UK. By &quot;adapted&quot;, I mean &quot;changed almost unrecognisably&quot;. The original is [http://www.somerfield.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/recipesearch/recipe.asp?recipe=Beany+Burgers+%26+Tomato+Salsa here]: you can see for yourself.

These beanburgers work best in [[Cookbook:Pita|pita breads]] (crisped up in the oven), with tomato and lettuce. Alternatively, they taste nice with a spicy tomato sauce.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* 1 red or yellow [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], chopped
* A generous pinch of each of: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:Coriander|ground coriander]], [[Cookbook:Chilli Powder|mild chilli powder]], [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]] and [[Cookbook:turmeric|turmeric]]
* 2 tins of mixed [[cookbook:beans|beans]] or mixed pulses, drained
* 2-3 medium [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, grated
* 40 g [[Cookbook:Rolled oats|rolled oats]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] (leave out to make it vegan. Without it, the burger breaks and frays much more in the pan)

== Procedure ==
# [[cookbook:Fry|Fry]] the onions and pepper (in a little bit of oil) with the spices for a couple of minutes. Leave to cool.
# Mash the beans in a large bowl.
# Add the carrot, onion, pepper and oats to the mashed beans and mix until well combined.
# Add the egg slowly (you probably won't need all of it). You don't want a mixture that's too sticky.
# Shape the dough into 6 to 8 burgers and lightly flour each side.
# Fry the burgers (in a little bit of oil) for a few minutes on each side, until golden.
# Serve hot.

Hi Mikec,

I moved the pages into a book form: see [[History of Quebec and Canada]]. Have you had a look at [[Canadian History]]? It might belong as part of that book.

If you're writing a course as opposed to a text, you might consider doing this at wikiversity, as they're quite anxious for materials. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:13, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

 |-
 | style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; |
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Hello,

I've moved 2 pages you created into the book &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, as they seemed to be written as chapters of that book. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== Pictures ==

As you can see at the top of this page, &quot;All unlicensed images uploaded to wikibooks before November 1, 2006 will soon be deleted.&quot;  You have uploaded images and some of them are untagged. You can see them [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;max=500&amp;img_user_text=A.K.Karthikeyan&amp;grouped= here].  Please review them and add appropriate tags.  If you have any questions, feel free to [[User talk:Think Fast|ask me]].  --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 04:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[:Category:LOC:TH 1]] ==

I do not know what this should be called but it isn't a &quot;category&quot; and is incorrectly named for a book.  Please look at the links on the welcome message to see what our policies here are - many thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:37, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

== [[Semiconductor Electronics]] ==

I think that maybe this book should be merged with [[Semiconductors]]? That book has been around for a while, and doesnt have any contributors. Let me know what you think, but I would like to see the two books combined. If you are interested, you can do whatever you want with it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:13, 26 October 2007 (UTC)

Answer : I don't want to merge this with Semiconductors. This book is about semiconductor Electronics. This will not deal in detail the science behind semiconductors but will deal with current flow in semiconductors. I want to keep this book simple as possible. Once I have read the book semiconductors, I might think of merging.

:Okay, that's fair. Thanks for the quick reply! I'll remove the merge notice, and maybe post a link from one book to the other. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:59, 26 October 2007 (UTC)

== Artificial Intelligence/My research results ==

The page [[Artificial Intelligence/My research results]] mentions that you developed a learning circuit.
Please tell me more about that circuit.
What was the circuit?
How well did it work?
Is that circuit one of the ones already mentioned elsewhere in the [[Artificial Intelligence]] book?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:56, 3 January 2008 (UTC)

== [[:Image:SE Si lattice.svg]] ==

Which image was this derived from? It need to be noted on the image page. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:15, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

== Re: [[Microprocessor Design]] ==

I'm happy you like this book, I've put a lot of effort into it. It does need more work, and I've been busy lately with other projects. I hope that other people can work to improve and expand it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:21, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

==Tips==
If you add {{tl|BookCat}} to pages you create, you'll have an alphabetical index of pages for the book linked from the bottom of the page.  Additionally, if you use {{tag|source}} rather than {{tag|pre}}, you'll get syntax highlighting. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:42, 15 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

Are you still interested in learning Latin? The Wikiversity language courses won't take off until at least another half year, probably more, but since there are so many people interested in Latin both here and elsewhere I decided to go ahead and offer distance classes based on the free online Latin course I wrote. Please see [http://latin.for-selfstudy.info/latinclass.htm] for details.

== Hi there ==


Hi, 
I noticed you were a contributer to the Japanese Wikibook. Do you agree with some of the changes i made? It seemed that the book was in a state of confusion, with no real structure so I decided to make it more textbook style, and start at the very start. I am willing to continue, with as much help as i can get of course. :)

Thanks for that link, it really furthered my understanding..

Ed -- 02:06, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

====Plan====

Looks Great. i Think each of those sections should be a chapter?? And i would defiantly put the kana, and maybe some sort of introduction type thing in the first chapter.

looks great though.


=====-=====
Yeah its really getting there. 

I'm going to England for holidays for a month, so you might not hear from me for a while. I think if we can basically try to do the same thing as some of the 'finished' language books we'll be on the right track.

Hopefully one day I'll be able to teach my friends Japanese using just this book :0

Cheers.

Do we need a dialects page? the hougen page does exactly that so shouldn't we just rename the links to it instead of copying it over to new page. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 00:29, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

==[[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson 6]]==
You &quot;cleaned up&quot;&quot; this one a little to well: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese%2FKana%2FLessons&amp;diff=995272&amp;oldid=988683
There were some very good sites at the bottom of the module, titled &quot;Games&quot;. Maybe this should be renamed in a more Wiki-style: &quot;External links&quot;. But the fact is, that some of these links are very good excercises for somebody who wants to learn hiragana/katakana. Excercises like those are of vital importance to learn kana quickly.
Maybe you can re-clean it??? Regards, [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 05:32, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

I just put the links back, with a different paragraph title and an extra line to explain what these are. Later I will go through all the links to see which ones are REALLY useful... Or you can do it, if you like... [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 05:35, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

Hi Balloonguy,

I just added a comment on [[Talk:Japanese#Wow._This_is_a_mess]] which I wanted to draw your attention to as you've been involved in this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:13, 10 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is designed to cover a variety of separate topics that a genealogist should be familiar with as a means to document the stories and store related images about their family tree.  This book is not written to show a genealogist how to prepare and present their GEDCOM information, rather to supplement this information in a way that will be valuable to future generations.

| '''CAUTION'''
'''Don't''' let this information scare you away.&lt;br&gt;
Some of it looks complicated, but if you stick with it ...&lt;br&gt;
You'll find that it is really very easy to manage.

This process will work on non-PC computers. HTML files are specific Internet-based files that the browsers were created to read. The folders, filenames, and image types are all the same from machine to machine.

The only variation here will be what program you use to edit the HTML (.htm or .html) files. On a PC, I use and recommend Notepad which is included with Microsoft Windows.

After saying all this, this book is not designed to teach HTML, but to teach those pieces of Internet-design that will be useful to a genealogist preparing to document their family history on the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
May be the scientific view of the world looks as a stable and finished system. That is not the case. There are still many open questions in this conception of the world and also fundamental things are not clear yet. Openness becomes thus a virtue of this conception of the world.  Every once in a while something in science changes and obvious contradictions are a stimulus for advancement.


==Citations==
* '''The more we learn about the world, and the deeper our learning, the more conscious, specific, and articulate will be our knowledge of what we do not know, our knowledge of our ignorance.''' For this, indeed, is the main source of our ignorance — the fact that '''our knowledge can be only finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite.'''
** ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' Karl Popper (1963)


==Physics==

This is a list of some of the unsolved problems in physics . Some of these problems are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining some observed phenomenon or experimental result. Others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail. Lastly, some even border on the pseudo-sciences, e.g. the fringes of science which are widely discredited by today's community of physicists, but may some day show promise or conclusive evidence.&lt;!-- cleanup because looks like Original Research. Needs objective criteria for what is or is not an unsolved problem. For example list of problems reported in abc or listed by xyz. Similar to Hilbert's list, or as listed by NASA. Suggest cite each one to one of the external links? What are the criteria for reputable source or authority? --&gt;

===Phenomena or established occurrences in search of a scientific explanation===
; Accretion disc jets: Why do the accretion discs surrounding certain astronomical objects, such as the nuclei of active galaxies, emit relativistic jets along their polar axes?
; Accelerating universe: Why is the expansion of the universe accelerating, as we have observed? What is the nature of the dark energy driving this acceleration? If it is due to a cosmological constant, why is the constant so small, yet non-zero? Why isn't it huge, as predicted by most quantum field theories, or zero for some yet unknown symmetry reason? What is the ultimate fate of the universe?&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/open_questions.html Open Questions in Physics] Usenet Physics FAQ, 2006, Open Questions, Cosmology and Astrophysics item 5&lt;/ref&gt;
; Amorphous solids: What is the nature of the transition between a fluid or regular solid and a glassy phase? What are the physical processes giving rise to the general properties of glasses?
; Arrow of time: Why did the universe have such low entropy in the past, resulting in the distinction between past and future and the second law of thermodynamics? Why does time flow in one direction at all, on macroscopic scales, when there does not seem to be an arrow of time on the scale of fundamental interactions?&lt;ref&gt;Open Questions item 4&lt;/ref&gt;
; Ball lightning: Are these glowing, floating objects real?  How can they be explained?
; Baryon asymmetry: Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the universe?
; Cold fusion: What is the theoretical explanation for the apparent production of excess heat and helium in palladium metal when it is saturated with deuterium?
; Corona heating problem: Why is the Sun's Corona (atmosphere layer) so much hotter than the Sun's surface?
; Cosmological constant: Why doesn't the zero-point energy of vacuum cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?
: Why does the cosmological constant have the value that it has, is it zero and is it really constant?&lt;ref&gt;[http://feynman.physics.lsa.umich.edu/strings2000/millennium.html Physics Problems for the Next Millennium] University of Michigan Strings 2000 Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

; Universe asymmetry: What are the origins of asymmetries in general in the Universe?

===Theoretical ideas in search of experimental evidence===
; Axions: Is the Peccei-Quinn theory (''i.e.'' mechanism) the solution to the strong CP problem? What are the properties of the predicted axion?
; Cosmic inflation: Is the theory of cosmic inflation correct, and if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical inflation field giving rise to inflation? 
; Extra dimensions: Does Nature have more than four spacetime dimensions?
; Faster-than-light: Is it possible to go faster than the speed of light?  Is it possible to transmit information faster than the speed of light?
; Gravity: Is our universe filled with gravitational radiation from the big bang? From astrophysical sources, such as inspiralling neutron stars? What can this tell us about quantum gravity and general relativity?  Does gravity behave as predicted at very small distance scales?
; Information: Do physical phenomena irrevocably destroy information about their prior states?
; Magnetic monopoles: Are there any particles that carry &quot;magnetic charge&quot;, and if so, why are they so difficult to detect?
; Matter: Why is there matter at all? What was here before the Big Bang? How did the four fundamental forces appear?
; Proton decay: Many theories beyond the Standard Model predict proton decay. Do protons decay?  If so, then what is their half-life?
; Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the non-perturbative regime: The equations of QCD remain unsolved at energy scales relevant for describing atomic nuclei. How does QCD give rise to the physics of nuclei and nuclear constituents?
; Quantum gravity: How can the theory of quantum mechanics be merged with the theory of general relativity to produce a so-called &quot;theory of everything&quot;? Is string theory the correct step on the road to quantum gravity, or a blind alley? Is there any way to extract experimental information about the nature of physics at the Planck scale? 
; Quantum mechanics in the correspondence limit: Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse, give rise to the reality we perceive? 
; Size of the universe: Is there anything beyond the limits of the theoretical boundaries of the observable universe?  
; Standard Model Higgs mechanism: Does the Standard Model Higgs particle exist?  More generally, does inertial mass have a basis or mechanism separate from gravitational mass? 
; Supersymmetry: Is supersymmetry a symmetry of Nature? If so, what is the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking?
; Technicolor: Does Nature make use of strong dynamics in breaking electroweak symmetry?

===Problems solved recently===
; Solar neutrino problem (2002): Resolved by a new understanding of neutrino physics, requiring a modification of the Standard Model of particle physics - specifically, neutrino oscillation.
;Quasars (1980s): The nature of quasars was not understood for decades.  They are now accepted as a type of active galaxy where the enormous energy output results from matter falling into a massive black hole in the center of the galaxy.
;Long duration Gamma ray bursts (2003): Long-duration bursts are associated with the deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar.

==Biology==

Some '''unsolved problems in biology''' include:

;'''Life''': How did it start? Is life a cosmic phenomenon? Are the conditions necessary for the origin of life narrow or broad? Did life start on this planet or was there an extraterrestrial intervention (for example a meteor from another planet)? Is immortality possible?
;'''DNA / Genome''':  What are all the functions of the DNA? Other than the structural genes, which is the simpler part of the system? What is the complete structure and function of the proteome proteins expressed by a cell or organ at a particular time and under specific conditions? What is the complete function of the regulator genes? The building block of life may be a precursor to a generation of electronic devices and computers, but what are the electronic properties of DNA? Does Junk DNA function as molecular garbage?
;'''Consciousness''' / '''Self''': What is it? Why is it necessary for many animals (especially mammals) to dream? What are the inheritable characteristics of intelligence? 
;'''Bioelectromagnetism''': How do animals possess long-range navigation and migration abilities? How was the homing ability developed? How can some animals detect earthquake precursors? What are the effects of natural electric fields? 
;'''Viruses''' / '''Immune system''': What are the signs of current or past infection to discover where Ebola hides between human outbreaks? What is the origin of antibody diversity? What is the relationship between the immune system and the brain? 
;'''Viking's methane''': The Viking lander detected emissions of carbon-14-containing methane, which indicates the possible presence of life on Mars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Site Hosting=
If you are interested in making a family site, having a way for your family to keep connected and see the progress on your family tree, read further. In this scenario, family members could share old photos and copies of documents.

Let's begin by examining the various packages and sizes that some companies offer.  There are a variety of sizes and even more confusing is the bandwidth, domain parking, subdomains, storage space, and more.  Let's go over some of these terms.

'''Remote Hosting'''
This means that some company is providing space (similar in concept to space on your computer's hard-drive).

==General Terms==
:Let me cover some of the terms and what you should look for:
:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:;Storage Space:5-75GB (or GIG); generally 5-25GB is more than enough for a basic web page. This can differ based on your site usage (that is, storing LARGE images will cut into your space; 1,000 photos will easily store in a 1-2GB space)

:;Domain Name:There are several basic concepts that apply here. A domain name is the address that people type in to get to your page.

:;Domain Parking:This is a method of registering a domain name without having it point anywhere (generally it points to you hosting storage space); this is a method of ensuring you have it in the future.

:;Subdomains:Generally you get 10 of these; the simplest explanation is that they replace the www (ie. my domain is www.fornal.org and my subdomain is bob.fornal.org)
|}

==Pricing==
:'''All prices listed are US Dollars.'''

:When considering Hosting companies, the simplest method is &quot;word of mouth.&quot; Generally, go with a company that you know (the next best thing is a company that someone close to you knows) that is inexpensive and reliable.

:What is inexpensive to me and you are probably two different things; same with reliability.

:A good price is about $5.00/month (that's $60.00 per year). You generally can register a domain name with the hosting company and it is included in the cost, but it can be registered independently and simply redirected the hosted space.

:Separate domain registration is about $35.00 per year; these can decrease is paid in bulk - 10 years goes for about $180.

:This is a good place to point out one other thing to watch for. When looking at a hosting company, make ABSOLUTELY sure that the registered domain name is yours - that you take it with you if you switch companies. Some of the hosting companies will register it for you (included in the cost), but you can't take it with you when you leave them.

==Storage Space==
:Let's take a look at the &quot;space&quot; issue ... how much space do you need for a web-site. Years ago, when PCs were just coming into their own, a friend asked if a 10MEG (NOT GIG) hard drive would be enough ... my response at the time was, &quot;that's more space than you'll ever need ... you can store TEN books in that amount of space.&quot;

:There might be a good amount right now, but as we all know, computer technology continuously changes and tomorrow ... next month ... next year, that will change.

:Also remember, that unlike most personal web-sites, sites designed to display genealogy information have a lot of content and can often be around for the long-term ... I'd like my kids (don't have any yet) and grandkids to be able to access the pages I am designing right now.

==FTP and E-Mail Accounts==
:Another two items to consider are FTP and E-Mail accounts.

:Generally when you are using a remote hosting company, you can configure an unlimited number of emails to your domain name (you can have an account for yourself, your father, your wife, brother, and sister-in-law). These accounts generally allow for 10MB of emails, but this does vary slightly from host to host.

:Also, you can generally configure FTP accounts where individuals can create their own web pages and upload/download files. This is relatively straight forward - you generate a username and password that is linked to a folder that you created. The person that you give the account information to logs in using some FTP software (ws_ftp is one) and they can then transfer files (you mentioned pictures - this is one way they can get them to you without bogging down an email account).

==GIG Transfer==
:'''GIG Transfer''' indicates how much information can be transferred per month.

:For example, assume that there is a single web page that is 1k (1,000 characters) in site with two images, one being 20k and another being 29k in size. These three files are 50k in size total.

:If 200 people got on this month and downloaded this page (which includes the images), you would have transferred 10,000k (or 10MEG) of information.

:The transfer can be kind of nerve-wracking for someone just starting out. You want slightly more than you think you need an in both these cases, it can be difficult to estimate:

::{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
# How much is transferred on average and
# How many people per month are going to download files and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
# Which files are going to be accessed most frequently.
|}

:It often comes down to a best-guess, but also remember that you will be starting slow. Generally, you can generate about a page per day of content (you can generally estimate about 50k of non-image files). And, you also have to remember that people then need to find your site and it will take months, or even years, for a good following and consistent transfer of files.

==GIG Transfer/Linking==
:Linking to other sites does not affect transfer, but when they link to your site (ie. images) it can.

:This brings up a point ... if you have the images stored in another location (say a site that hosts images free), you can sometimes place that image on your page without having to have the image actually on your site. This is called &quot;hot linking&quot; and some of the image sites will not allow it (because it affects their transfer rates).

==Subdomains==
:Subdomains point back to a folder within the hosted site that can make the domain name much shorter and cleaner (for example, http://bob.fornal.org/Genealogy instead of http://www.fornal.org/Bob/Genealogy/). It also provides the capacity to have multiple users/accounts on one hosted site:

::{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
# '''My site''': bob.fornal.org
# '''My wife's''': jen.fornal.org
# '''My brother''': tim.fornal.org
# '''My sister-in-law''': kristin.fornal.org &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:These subdomains also have the added benefit of looking much more professional. For example, if you intending to use your space as a virtual resume, you can post the following on correspondence:

::{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:'''Resume''': name.surname.org
:'''E-Mail''': name@surname.org &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:... which looks better than ...

::{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:'''Resume''': www.surname.org/name/Resume.html &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:'''E-Mail''': name@surname.org
|}
:There are other uses for subdomains; it comes down to your creativity ... another that is useful is configuring: '''images.surname.org''' as a subdomain which allows all site images to be placed in one location and use a MUCH shorter path.

==Redirection==
Redirection is a concept where you enter a web address and you are provided pages from abother address ... for example, you enter '''www.fornal.org''' and get pages that are located at '''www.i-cuhere.com/~bob/genealogy'''.

This basically means that you host the pages and someone else can make it display the information as if it were somewhere else.

==Cloaking==
Cloak a URL means that the address from the example, '''www.i-cuhere.com/~bob/genealogy''', can be hidden so that the end-user does not see it.  If you entered '''www.fornal.org''' to get to the pages, that is all you see in the address at the top of the browser.

* Wiki software has a feature to move pages. That functionality can not be used for merging two pages with simular content. As merging two pages are probably not easy, an '''append functionality would be nice to have'''.  The append functionality would append the history information as well. So the merging process would look like this: 1.) Append one page to the other. 2.) Delete the old appended page. 3.) Reorganize the content of the new page.  The page structure will be lost, but the content history will be preserved. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 14:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

::::: Use case is a systematic description of the user-system interactions. Many times user interacts with the system in different times that results similar response from the system. Similar interactions can be part of different business processes. Also one user interaction can be sub-divided to smaller ones. It can be, but does not have to be. We divide if one of the sub use case can be reused in a different business flow. 
:::::For example in a retail application, we have two business flows. One is to buy an item, the other is to return an item. During creating the use case, we recognize that in both interactions the taxes need to be calculated. So we can create a use case called &quot;Calculate Taxes Use Case&quot; and we include it to both the &quot;Buy Use Case&quot; and &quot;Return Use Case&quot;.

== Overview ==

'''''Armando Dippet''''' was the headmaster of Hogwarts before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. He is a wizened and frail-looking wizard when we see him, bald except for a few stray wisps of white hair.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Here, we see Professor Dippet only through the memories of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s diary. Tom is requesting permission to stay in the school over the summer; Professor Dippet turns him down, saying that the attacks on the students have made that quite impossible, and if they do not cease he may have to close the school down. In the Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle mentions Professor Dippet contemptuously in passing, saying that Tom was able to fool him easily, but was never sure that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus_Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] was fully convinced.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Professor Dippet is one of the portraits hanging in Professor Dumbledore's study. Shortly after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] is attacked, just before Christmas, Dumbledore needs the portrait of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black]] to carry a message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|12 Grimmauld Place]]. Phineas Nigellus feigns tiredness, and many of the other portraits in the office are outraged; the portrait of Dippet, in particular, is angered, saying that they are sworn to serve the current Headmaster of Hogwarts.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Professor Dippet's portrait in the Headmaster's office does say a few things during the course of this book, and it is mentioned that Tom Riddle had approached Dippet upon his graduation to ask for the post of teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Dippet had turned him down, saying that he had not yet had enough experience, that he was as yet too young.

When Harry is in the Ministry, looking through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s office for the locket, he happens to see a copy of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book about Dumbledore. On the cover, it is noted that she is the bestselling author of the book ''Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?''

== Analysis ==

From the limited number of times we see him, it is hard to get much of a feel for Professor Dippet. One gets the impression that he is a standard mid-level functionary, trying hard not to rock the boat, and rather worn out at the demands that being Headmaster of a school full of adolescent wizards and witches is putting on him. He quite possibly may resent having been left in charge to deal with the opening of the Chamber.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# To what extent did Armando Dippet understand Tom Riddle?
# How did Armando Dippet's Headmastership effect Dumbledore's development as a Headmaster?
# Did Dumbledore tell Professor Dippet how he felt about Tom Riddle? If not, why not? If he did, how much of Dumbledore's concern did Dippet accept? Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Site Creation=
The next phase is to determine what you want to place on the web-site. Once you've determined what, then you need to determine what the best way to present it is. In determining how to present the information, you need to decide how you want to develop the web pages. The basis for all web-pages is HTML.

If you want to learn HTML code, you can write a basic web-page using a program as simple at Notepad. Most Microsoft Applications (i.e. Word, Publisher, Powerpoint) can generate HTML web-pages, although they tend to generate very code heavy pages. What this means is that they often use many times more code than necessary, which makes the pages load slower.

There are several commercial packages for generating pages. Also, most of you should be familiar with the fact that most genealogy programs can generate HTML pages to display your information.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&quot;Repetition and patience are two key elements of good design.&quot;''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bob and Lisa, 2006
|}

==Personal Preferences==
:I am best at designing web-pages using Notepad, writing simple code in HTML. It is remarkably easy and I will be discussing this topic in more depth here.

:There are several commercial packages (ie. Dreamweaver) that develop WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) web pages. I will not be exploring these options.

==Determining Content==
:Don't worry about the content quite yet. Let's examine some core pieces and some code that will make it easier to plan how to present the information. This might give you some ideas that could change things slightly.

==Introduction to HTML Coding==
:HTML is a programming language; but, only in the simplest sense. If you have any experience with OLD word processors, some of you might remember having to turn Bold on and off (being able to toggle between a set of flags and an awful color coded scheme). HTML is much like this.

:To make something bold we are going to use what are called '''Tags'''. In HTML, we generally have Opening and Closing Tags.

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:Opening Tag for Bold Text: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;
:Closing Tag for Bold Text: &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:'''Note''' the forward slash &quot;/&quot; indicates a Closing Tag.

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:'''Example'''

:&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;This is bold.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; produces ... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:'''This is bold.'''
|}

==HTML Files==
===.htm versus .html===
:Hopefully everyone has seen files with one of these two extensions. The only real difference is that one has an &quot;L&quot; and the other does not. Virtually all servers see them as the same type of file.

:Remember, whichever one you use, be consistent because it does matter which is used when the name of the file is used in a link. If the filename is '''bob.htm''' and I enter '''bob.html''' in an address, it will not work because '''bob.html''' does not exist.

===index.htm (or index.html)===
:Regardless of which method you use for the extension, the index file is the most important file for our purposes. This file is the default file to be opened if no other file is specified.

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:'''Example'''

:'''http://bob.fornal.org/Genealogy/''' actually opens ... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:'''http://bob.fornal.org/Genealogy/index.html'''
|}

:If you have to enter a path over and over, the first address is the one you would want to use, simply because it is shorter.

===Basic HTML Structure===
:Ok, here is the basic structure for almost all HTML files:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt;SAMPLE PAGE&amp;lt;/TITLE&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/HEAD&amp;gt;

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sample text goes here.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/HTML&amp;gt;
|}

:Notice how the Opened/Closed Tags are '''nested'''; that is, the Open/Close TITLE Tags are nested inside the Open/Close HEAD Tags, which in turn is nested inside the HTML Tags.

:Also, the text inside the Tags is ALL CAPS. HTML Tags are Case Insensitive; that is, you can enter them in ALL CAPS or ALL LOWERCASE. This is preference only; select one and stick with it.

:There are a few minor variations to this structure, but almost all the time this will be the basic structure for a web-page that you are creating.

==PRACTICE: Index.html==
:Before you begin, create a folder where you will store the web-pages we are going to create and develop. I would recommend creating a folder called '''Internet Files''' on your desktop (this is what I will refer to in the future).

:Now, let's copy the following and paste it into a Notepad document:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;CCCCFF&quot;
|
:&amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt;'''Your Name Here'''&amp;lt;/TITLE&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/HEAD&amp;gt;

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;'''Your Name Here'''&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is my first Index File.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/HTML&amp;gt;
|}

:Notice the new '''Tag''' in the code listed, '''&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'''. This is a Break Tag that tells HTML to place a line-break (same as pressing the Enter Key in a word processor) at this location. 

----
:'''Read the following COMPLETELY before executing this process:'''

:Once you have pasted this file into Notepad, use the following process to save the file:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;CCCCFF&quot;
|
:# Click '''&lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;ile''', then '''Save &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;s ...'''
:# Change the '''Save As &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;ype''' to '''All Files'''
:# Change the '''File &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;ame''' to '''Index.html''' (YES, the filename is case sentitive) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:# Make sure that '''&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;ncoding''' is '''ANSI'''
:# Make sure that you are saving into the correct folder
:# Click the '''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ave''' button to finish this process.
|}

:Now that you have saved the file, close Notepad ... open the '''Internet Files''' folder ... double-click on the '''Index.html''' file to see what you have created.

:;Note:The '''Index.html''' file that you have created will be displayed in your browser (ie. '''Internet Explorer''') when you double-click on it. You just created a basic web-page; it just hasn't been placed on the Internet yet.

==PRACTICE: Modifying the Index.html File==
:Let's re-open the file with Notepad and make some modifications. Right-Click on the file and select '''Open Wit&lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;''', then Notepad. This should open the file and you should now see the code you entered previously.

:Locate the &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt; Tag and change the next few lines to read ...

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;CCCCFF&quot;
|
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;BODY BGCOLOR=lightgrey&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Arial, Tahoma&quot; COLOR=blue&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;'''Your Name Here'''&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is my first Index File.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/FONT&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;
|}

:OK, here we've added a few parts. Within the &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt; Tag, there is a modifier that changes the background [[/color/]]. (BGCOLOR) to light grey.

:Also, notice the &amp;lt;FONT&amp;gt; Tag and the modifier that sets the Font Face to Arial (Tahoma, if Arial does not exist on the system) and the Font [[/color/|Color]] to blue.

:Now, click '''&lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;ile''', then '''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ave''' to save the changes you just made (notice that it is MUCH easier to save after doing the Save As process the first time).

:Finally, double-click the file to see what these changes did to the '''Index.html''' file.

==PRACTICE: Adding Images==
:Placing images on a web-page is easy, but keep a couple of things in mind. Often, it is the images that make pages load slowly - smaller is better, but maintain a good balance of size and clarity - smaller is better until you can't tell what the picture was when you started.

:There are three basic types of images allowed (there are others, but these are the most common):

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:# '''BMP''' - Windows Bitmap, very clear and often VERY LARGE.
:# '''JPG''' - JPEG, often clear and good size with complex images, but can pixelize (odd fuzzy effect) at times.
:# '''GIF''' - Compuserve GIF, excellent small file sizes and allows for simple animation types, but often drops clarity because it uses a maximum of 256 colors, which is VERY limited.
|}

:The best thing that you can do until you get more familiar is to use a graphics program like Paint Shop Pro (PSP) to save an image that you want to use in all three formats, then look at the file sizes and view the images on your local page to see how clear they are and choose what fits the situation best (size or clarity).

:Select any image and place it into the '''Internet Files''' folder.

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;CCCCFF&quot;
|
:Change this line ...
::This is my first Index File.

:... to the following ...

::This is my first Index File. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;lt;img src=&quot;'''Image Name Here'''&quot; alt=&quot;'''Short Description'''&quot; border=1&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:OK, now let's take a look at what you just added.

:This statement reads, Image Source equals {filename}, Alternate Description equals {description}, Border Size=1.

:The alternate description is handy if the image does not load for some reason and also for the vision-impaired.

:Border=0 turns the border off.

==Image Locations==
:Before you move on to learn about linking web-pages, you need to understand that the image file does not have to reside in the same folder as the web-page that uses it.

:Often, you will want to create a folder specifically for storing images. This helps to keep the clutter down and makes locating files simpler.

:Also, you can reference images from other sites. For example, my picture located to the left here is actually on my domain (http://bob.fornal.org) in an images folder. This can be good for organization, but many sites do not allow this (called '''hot linking''') because it affects the download of the site that hosts the image.

==Linking Web-Pages==
===Linking Basics===
:There is one way to code a link; but conceptually, there are several types. For the moment, there are the two simple types - linking to '''local pages''' and linking to '''external pages'''.

:Let's take a quick look at the HTML code before we get into the details. Here is what it looks like:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://bob.fornal.org&quot;&amp;gt;My Site&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}
:On the page you get something like this:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:[http://bob.fornal.org/ My Site] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:This is a link that takes you to bob.fornal.org; remember, you are actually seeing bob.fornal.org/index.html (index.html is the default file that the system will display if it is not specified).

===PRACTICE: Linking to Local Pages===
:OK, now let's set up an example that will allow us to explore this in a little more depth.

:Inside your '''Internet Files''' folder, create another folder called, '''Genealogy''' (remember that once these files are on the web, they WILL BE case sensitive).

:Copy the '''Index.html''' file, that you created previously, into the new folder.

:Edit this new file and change a few things:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;CCCCFF&quot;
|
:# Remove the &amp;lt;img ... &amp;gt; Tag.
:# Change the background and font colors. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:# Change the header and text.
|}

:'''Save your changes'''.
:(basically, we are doing this so that we can see that the pages are different)

----
:Now, edit your original '''Index.html''' file and add the following code:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;Genealogy/Index.html&quot;&amp;gt;Genealogy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:HREF is a Hypertext Reference; simply, something that refers to a web-page address. This HTML Tag places a link to the new '''Index.html''' file.

----
:Now, in the '''Genealogy/Index.htm''' file add the following code:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;../Index.html&quot;&amp;gt;Main Page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:This HTML tag places a link on the '''Genealogy''' page that goes back to the original '''Index.html''' file that you created.

:Notice the '''../''' in the HREF address. This tells you that we need to go up one (1) level in the tree structure.

===PRACTICE: Linking to Exernal Pages/Sites===
:OK, we've talked about placing images onto a page. You should now understand that an image can be referenced from the same folder that the web-page is in, or from another location (either in the same domain or on another web-site all together).

:The true strength of the Internet is the ability to reference other pages ... the work that other people have done. This is done with '''Links'''.

:As we saw with images, there are basically two types of links - internal and external.

:;Internal Links:Connections to pages on your site; minimal or no path information is required.

:;External Links:As you've probably figured out, these are connections to web-pages on other sites. In this case, you need to include full path information.

----
:In both cases, we use the same HTML tag. Here is a simple example of an external link for you to place on either of your practice pages:

:;Remember:Use the &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; to place Line Breaks.

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://bob.fornal.org/Recipes/&quot;&amp;gt;Bob's Recipes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:... which becomes ...

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:[http://bob.fornal.org/Recipes/ Bob's Recipes] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

==Tables==
:Now for a slightly more difficult topic. Tables are important when you are first beginning to develop web-pages. Much later, you will most likely learn about Style Sheets (not difficult to do, but a lot added onto what you are already getting). Until then, tables are one of the easiest methods to tweak/adjust alignment (left, center, right).

:Before we talk about the tags, here's the simple part; with most software, when we talk about a table, it has rows (across) and columns (down). For our purposes, we will have Table Rows (across) and Table Data (cells on a row). The number of cells in the first row determines how many columns there are for the rest of the table.

:Here are the three Tags that we will use:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:# '''&amp;lt;TABLE&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/TABLE&amp;gt;''' - Table Open/Close &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:# '''&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;''' - Table Row Open/Close
:# '''&amp;lt;TD&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;''' - Table Data Open/Close
|}

:What we need to do now is discuss each of these and some of the options individually to provide some depth of understanding when we get to some examples.

===TABLE Tag===
:This is the '''&amp;lt;TABLE ... &amp;gt;''' Tag that we discussed previously.

:Think of this as setting up or configuring the outer box and background of the entire table.

:Here are three of the settings that you will use most frequently:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:'''width=&quot;#&quot;''' - where # is in either pixels or percent.
:'''border=#''' - where # is the thickness of the border in pixels.
:'''bgcolor=COLOR''' - where COLOR is the [[/color/]] of the background (same as we used on the BODY Tag). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

:So, you might enter something like (this is an example ... do not enter it into your pages):

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot; border=1 bgcolor=lightgreen&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

===TR Tag===
:Here is the most BORING of the three Tags ... Table Row.

:There are a few options available, but generally we will not be using them.

:So, you will most often enter something like this:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

===TD Tag===
:OK, now that you've seen the BORING one, let's see the one that will keep you busy ...

:This is the Table Data Tag ... all of your information (Data) will go inside these Open/Close Tags. By information, we are talking about anything that you can display ... at this point, you know how to enter text and images (you can link from within here, too).

:There are four options that you will frequently see (the first two you've had already:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:# WIDTH - same as TABLE Tag
:# BGCOLOR - same as TABLE Tag
:# '''align=NNN''' - NNN is the horizontal alignment, options are (Left, Center, Right) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:# '''valign=NNN''' - NNN is the vertical alignment, options are (Top, Center, Bottom)
|}

===PRACTICE: Create a Table===
:Let's start with a simple example, here's information from a 1930 US Federal Census Record:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:Name: John Fornal 
:Home in 1930: Glastonbury, Hartford, Connecticut &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:Age: 42 
:Estimated Birth Year: abt 1888 
:BirthPlace: Poland 
:Relation to Head of House: Head 
:Spouses's Name: Victoria 
|}

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:Household Members:
:Name Age 
:John Fornal 42 
:Victoria Fornal 40 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:Joseph Fornal 15 
:Stella Fornal 13 
:Annie Fornal 10 
:William Fornal 5 
|}

:As you can see, each line breaks down into two items ... easy to convert to a table.

----
:Paste the following code into one of your pages ...

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;CCCCFF&quot;
|
:&amp;lt;TABLE&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Name:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;John Fornal&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/TR&gt;&amp;lt;TR&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Home in 1930:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Glastonbury, Hartford, Connecticut&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:&amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Age:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;42&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Estimated Birth Year:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&gt;abt 1888&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;BirthPlace:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&gt;Poland&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Relation to Head of House:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&gt;Head&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt;Spouses's Name:&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TD&gt;Victoria&amp;lt;/TD&amp;gt;
:&amp;lt;/TR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/TABLE&amp;gt;
|}

:Can you see how this information fits together, how it is nested?

:Copy the code you just entered and make another copy just below it using Notepad. Take the Household Members information provided above and see if you can create a table with the information on your own ...

==Headers==
Try these Tags as headers (or titles) in the code you have created previously ...

'''&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;This is a Large Header&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;This is the Next Smaller Header&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;This is the Next Smaller Header&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;This is the Next Smaller Header&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''&amp;lt;h5&amp;gt;This is the Next Smaller Header&amp;lt;/h5&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''&amp;lt;h6&amp;gt;This is the Next Smaller Header&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''&amp;lt;h7&amp;gt;This is the Smallest Header&amp;lt;/h7&amp;gt;'''&lt;br&gt;

There are seven headers available, generally only five are necessary most times ...

==Bold, Italics, Underline==
Here, you will not see the Underline Tag (&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;) used; it has been deprecated (removed) from standard HTML code, although it is supported by most browsers still, because it often gets confused with linked items.

&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;This is the '''BOLD''' Tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This is the &lt;i&gt;ITALIC&lt;/i&gt; Tag&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This is the '''&lt;i&gt;BOLD, ITALIC&lt;/i&gt;''' Tag&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A daughter of Zeus and Demeter, Persephone is both the goddess of the underworld as well as grain. The beautiful Persephone was stolen by Hades to be his wife.  Demeter, with her child missing, roamed the earth looking for her, abandoning  all her other duties.  Time passed, the crops would not grow, and humans and animals began to starve.  Seeing this, Zeus stepped in to fix the situation.  He sent Hermes to  order Hades to return Persephone.  Hades said that he would gladly let her go.  As she was leaving, Hades entreated her to eat a pomegranate. When Persephone later told her mother of her experience, Demeter grieved to learn that Persephone had eaten the fruit, for the laws of Hades state that Persephone then must return for good! Demeter refused to let her daughter go, so Zeus reached an agreement: Persephone would stay with Hades for one-third of the year at a time (which would become winter), and with Demeter for the rest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are lucky you will not need much feed and your cattle can graze on what grows in the pasture.  However, in many places seasonal feed is needed.

== Hay ==
[[Image:Field of hay bales05.jpg|right|300px]]
Hay is the most common form of feed available for cattle.  If you have a field available that is easily accessible to equipment you can grow your own hay.  However, there are many farmers who grow more hay than they need and sell the extra.  Some will even deliver to you for an extra price.  To find them you can go through your local classifieds.

=== Growing your own hay ===
Hay can easily be grown on flat fertile land. As an alternative of using commercial fertilizer, many farmers are using chicken litter. The rising price of commercial fertilizer is the cause of the increasing use of chicken litter. Too much chicken litter can cause the grass to have too much nitrogen. The excessive amount of nitrogen can be harmful to your cattle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there,

seeing you work, I wonder if you want to build up a book within your user profile? May be you want rather to use the http://en,wikibooks/wiki/*-namespace.

If you have any questions, don't hesistate to ask me :)

== Your new book ==

Hello, and welcome to wikibooks!

I couldn't help but see your comment on [[User talk:Aschoeke]] about the creation of your new book. There is some information to be found at [[Help:How to start a book]], and I have also personally written an essay on the subject from my experiances in creating new books. My essay can be found [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|HERE on my user page]]. 

Windows and Linux are subjects that I know a little bit about, so if you need help working on or creating your book, let me know and I would be glad to help. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:45, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

''I also think that it is very difficult for several people to come up with a coherent structure together, it is much better if one person works out a coherent and comprehensive structure on which others can then improve. I feel too many Wikibooks are not that effective at teaching because they suffer from a poor structure.'' --- I couldn't agree more :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is my opinion that this module is out of place here in the algebra book, and that this material would better fit into the [[Communication Systems]] book (which already features some information about error-correction and digital coding). If nobody minds, I would like to perform the merger sometime soonish. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:I don't directly object, but it is important somehow when moving modules around like this to note that some topics are inter-discliplinary and it may be useful to try and write about some topics in several different ways.  Discussion about error correcting codes from a mathmatical viewpoint might be written slightly different than how it would be discussed from a Communication Systems viewpoint.  One is highly theoretical and the other is more pragmatic on how can I use this right now.
:That said, I don't see how this material is going to be used by people who are trying to learn Algebra, as this is some pretty advanced mathmatics that is involved here.  I would expect this material more for something like a Descrete Mathmatics or Finite Mathmatics textbook intended for upper-division college students, not a freshman Algebra textbook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:01, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the quick reply on a page that seems &quot;out of the way&quot;, at best. I agree with you that this module is highly-interdisciplinary, but I also must point out that the subject in this page has absolutely no business being in a book about &quot;algebra&quot;, even if the hamming calculation does require the use of matrices (it also is going to require things like modulo-two arthmetic, which aren't well explained here). It also, on second though, might not belong in the [[Communication Systems]] book either (at least, not the way it is written now). I am working on creating a new book about [[User:Whiteknight/Data Coding Theory|Data Coding Theory]], which would be a perfect home for this module, but i haven't had the time to implement it yet. Perhaps I will just keep an eye on this page, and merge it when I finally create the more appropriate book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Subject + &quot;be&quot; verb + noun/adjective */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Some basic sentence patterns in Bengali are given below.

==Subject + &quot;be&quot; verb + noun/adjective== 
There are different ways of expressing the verb &quot;to be.&quot; The &quot;to be&quot; verb that deals with personality and character traits is mostly omitted in the present tense (e.g., the forms আছি, হই, হও, হয়, etc.).

* I am. - আমি - Ami.
* You (sg.) are. - তুমি - Tumi
* He/she is. - সে - Shay
* We are. - আমরা - Amra
* You (pl.) are. - তোমরা - Tomra
* They are. - তারা - Tara
* John is. - জন  - John


* I am well. - আমি ভাল (আছি)। - Ami bhalo (achi).
* He is tall. - সে লম্বা। - Shay lomba.
* She is beautiful. - সে সুন্দরী। - Shay sundori.
* You are intelligent. - তুমি বুদ্ধিমান। - Tumi buddhiman.
* We are humans. - আমরা মানুষ। - Amra Manush.

In the other tenses, the verb &quot;hooya,&quot; which means &quot;to become&quot; can be used. 

Another way of expressing the &quot;to be&quot; verb is to use the verb stem &quot;ach-&quot;, which literally means &quot;to be present.&quot;

*Ami ekhane achi. - I am here.
*Tumi ekhane acho. - You (sg/informal) are here.
*Se ekhane ache. - He/she (far/informal) is here.
*Amra ekhane achi. - We are here. (I/we have the same conjugated verb)
*Tomra ekhane acho. - You (pl/informal) are here.
*Tini ekhane achen. - They are here.

==Conjugating Verbs==
In Bengali, verbs are learned from the verbal (&quot;-ing&quot;) form versus the infinitive (&quot;to . . . &quot;) form. Generally, the different subjects are conjugated by replacing the ending &quot;a&quot; by the following endings.

*Ami (I)/Amra (We): &quot;-i&quot;
*Tumi (You sg/informal): &quot;-o&quot;
*e/o/se (he/she in different locations from speaker): &quot;-e&quot;
*Apna (You sg/formal)/ Ini/Uni/Tini (he/she in different locations): &quot;-en&quot;

The locations for the third person pronouns are for here, there (near), and there (far), respectively. In addition, Bengali doesn't conjugate verbs or change subject pronouns to reflect gender of the person/people spoken about.

Where do we go from here?  We have the basic tools, now how do we use them ... best use, most effective design?  These are excellent questions and what we will try to do here is expand on the basic skillset that you currently have and provide some concrete examples that will completement those skills in the development of your Genealogical Web-Site.

==Examining Other Code==
Look at the code others use to generate their pages, in particular if you like what you see.

'''BUT''' (this is a big one), don't let it throw you off when you come across code that looks daunting (it WILL happen) or complex.  Your first thought might be, &quot;I can't do all that.&quot;

You might not be able to do it all. That's part of the fun, learning to do it in small steps.

First, remember that HTML, at its core, is easy ... you don't need to be a programmer to be a successful author. The main reason that the code for many pages looks so complex is that it was likely created with a Visual Design Tool (WYSIWYG - What You See Is What You Get) ... which has a knack for generating things that are very difficult to read; as opposed to being hand-generated (what we are trying to achieve here).

Also keep in mind that apparently large-complex sites and pages were most likely created over time; every web-site is changed and approved, built a piece at a time.

===Viewing the Source Code===
Looking at the HTML code that others have created is easier than you think, but remember the prior warning, some of them can look very complex.

While you've got a web-page open, use the '''&amp;lt;Right-Click&amp;gt;''' and select '''View Source''' (if View Source does not show up on the list, make sure that the mouse is not hovering over an image).

This method allows you to view the source on any web-page ... there will be a FEW sites that will block the '''&amp;lt;Right-Click&amp;gt;''' option, but most allow it ...

==Images==
===Backgrounds===
===Size versus Detail===
===Storing and Retrieving===

==Making Sure It Can Be Found==
:The most frustrating thing for most genealogists is locating information.  Those thousands of searches can be very frustrating.  What we want to cover here is how to ensure that the information that you've spent all this time developing can be located when someone is looking for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following is an annotated selection from Plato's dialog, ''Protagoras''.  There is, of course, a potential issue with using Plato's fictionalized account of Protagoras' views as authoritative of Protagoras' actual views, especially given the animosity which Plato demonstrated towards the Sophists.  Nevertheless, we have few alternate sources, and only fragments of Protagoras' own writings have survived.

In addition to providing us with a fuller understanding of Protagoras' view, this work also provides us with a depiction of the commonly accepted method of argumentation of the time and place.  A story is told using myth or respected poetic sources – most especially Homer, and not the immoderate contemporary authors which we will see Aristophanes disparage later in this text – and then a more, to our ears, normal argument is given.  Thus, proper respect is given to tradition, and reason is used as verification of tradition, not as an entirely independent source of normativity.  Keep this form, and this example of it, in mind as we move forward into the Platonic texts; this will help make sense of one reason why Socrates was so troubling to the Athenians.

The selection below is taken from Wikisource's version of ''The Protagoras'', which is available in full and without annotations, here:
[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Protagoras Plato's ''Protagoras'']

----


When Protagoras heard me say this, he replied: You ask questions fairly, and I like to answer a question which is fairly put. If Hippocrates comes to me he will not experience the sort of drudgery with which other Sophists are in the habit of insulting their pupils; who, when they have just escaped from the arts, are taken and driven back into them by these teachers, and made to learn calculation, and astronomy, and geometry, and music (he gave a look at Hippias as he said this); but if he comes to me, he will learn that which he comes to learn. And this is prudence in affairs private as well as public; he will learn to order his own house in the best manner, and he will be able to speak and act for the best in the affairs of the state.

Do I understand you, I said; and is your meaning that you teach the art of politics, and that you promise to make men good citizens?

That, Socrates, is exactly the profession which I make.

Then, I said, you do indeed possess a noble art, if there is no mistake about this; for I will freely confess to you, Protagoras, that I have a doubt whether this art is capable of being taught, and yet I know not how to disbelieve your assertion. And I ought to tell you why I am of opinion that this art cannot be taught or communicated by man to man. I say that the Athenians are an understanding people, and indeed they are esteemed to be such by the other Hellenes. Now I observe that when we are met together in the assembly, and the matter in hand relates to building, the builders are summoned as advisers; when the question is one of shipbuilding, then the ship-wrights; and the like of other arts which they think capable of being taught and learned. And if some person offers to give them advice who is not supposed by them to have any skill in the art, even though he be good-looking, and rich, and noble, they will not listen to him, but laugh and hoot at him, until either he is clamoured down and retires of himself; or if he persist, he is dragged away or put out by the constables at the command of the prytanes. This is their way of behaving about professors of the arts. But when the question is an affair of state, then everybody is free to have a say-carpenter, tinker, cobbler, sailor, passenger; rich and poor, high and low-any one who likes gets up, and no one reproaches him, as in the former case, with not having learned, and having no teacher, and yet giving advice; evidently because they are under the impression that this sort of knowledge cannot be taught. And not only is this true of the state, but of individuals; the best and wisest of our citizens are unable to impart their political wisdom to others: as for example, Pericles, the father of these young men, who gave them excellent instruction in all that could be learned from masters, in his own department of politics neither taught them, nor gave them teachers; but they were allowed to wander at their own free will in a sort of hope that they would light upon virtue of their own accord. Or take another example: there was Cleinias the younger brother of our friend Alcibiades, of whom this very same Pericles was the guardian; and he being in fact under the apprehension that Cleinias would be corrupted by Alcibiades, took him away, and placed him in the house of Ariphron to be educated; but before six months had elapsed, Ariphron sent him back, not knowing what to do with him. And I could mention numberless other instances of persons who were good themselves, and never yet made any one else good, whether friend or stranger. Now I, Protagoras, having these examples before me, am inclined to think that virtue cannot be taught. But then again, when I listen to your words, I waver; and am disposed to think that there must be something in what you say, because I know that you have great experience, and learning, and invention. And I wish that you would, if possible, show me a little more clearly that virtue can be taught. Will you be so good?

That I will, Socrates, and gladly. But what would you like? Shall I, as an elder, speak to you as younger men in an apologue or myth, or shall I argue out the question?

To this several of the company answered that he should choose for himself.

Well, then, he said, I think that the myth will be more interesting.

Once upon a time there were gods only, and no mortal creatures. But when the time came that these also should be created, the gods fashioned them out of earth and fire and various mixtures of both elements in the interior of the earth; and when they were about to bring them into the light of day, they ordered Prometheus and Epimetheus to equip them, and to distribute to them severally their proper qualities. Epimetheus said to Prometheus: &quot;Let me distribute, and do you inspect.&quot; This was agreed, and Epimetheus made the distribution. There were some to whom he gave strength without swiftness, while he equipped the weaker with swiftness; some he armed, and others he left unarmed; and devised for the latter some other means of preservation, making some large, and having their size as a protection, and others small, whose nature was to fly in the air or burrow in the ground; this was to be their way of escape. Thus did he compensate them with the view of preventing any race from becoming extinct. And when he had provided against their destruction by one another, he contrived also a means of protecting them against the seasons of heaven; clothing them with close hair and thick skins sufficient to defend them against the winter cold and able to resist the summer heat, so that they might have a natural bed of their own when they wanted to rest; also he furnished them with hoofs and hair and hard and callous skins under their feet. Then he gave them varieties of food-herb of the soil to some, to others fruits of trees, and to others roots, and to some again he gave other animals as food. And some he made to have few young ones, while those who were their prey were very prolific; and in this manner the race was preserved. Thus did Epimetheus, who, not being very wise, forgot that he had distributed among the brute animals all the qualities which he had to give-and when he came to man, who was still unprovided, he was terribly perplexed. Now while he was in this perplexity, Prometheus came to inspect the distribution, and he found that the other animals were suitably furnished, but that man alone was naked and shoeless, and had neither bed nor arms of defence. The appointed hour was approaching when man in his turn was to go forth into the light of day; and Prometheus, not knowing how he could devise his salvation, stole the mechanical arts of Hephaestus and Athene, and fire with them (they could neither have been acquired nor used without fire), and gave them to man. Thus man had the wisdom necessary to the support of life, but political wisdom he had not; for that was in the keeping of Zeus, and the power of Prometheus did not extend to entering into the citadel of heaven, where Zeus dwelt, who moreover had terrible sentinels; but he did enter by stealth into the common workshop of Athene and Hephaestus, in which they used to practise their favourite arts, and carried off Hephaestus' art of working by fire, and also the art of Athene, and gave them to man. And in this way man was supplied with the means of life. But Prometheus is said to have been afterwards prosecuted for theft, owing to the blunder of Epimetheus.

Now man, having a share of the divine attributes, was at first the only one of the animals who had any gods, because he alone was of their kindred; and he would raise altars and images of them. He was not long in inventing articulate speech and names; and he also constructed houses and clothes and shoes and beds, and drew sustenance from the earth. Thus provided, mankind at first lived dispersed, and there were no cities. But the consequence was that they were destroyed by the wild beasts, for they were utterly weak in comparison of them, and their art was only sufficient to provide them with the means of life, and did not enable them to carry on war against the animals: food they had, but not as yet the art of government, of which the art of war is a part. After a while the desire of self-preservation gathered them into cities; but when they were gathered together, having no art of government, they evil intreated one another, and were again in process of dispersion and destruction. Zeus feared that the entire race would be exterminated, and so he sent Hermes to them, bearing reverence and justice to be the ordering principles of cities and the bonds of friendship and conciliation. Hermes asked Zeus how he should impart justice and reverence among men:-Should he distribute them as the arts are distributed; that is to say, to a favoured few only, one skilled individual having enough of medicine or of any other art for many unskilled ones? &quot;Shall this be the manner in which I am to distribute justice and reverence among men, or shall I give them to all?&quot; &quot;To all,&quot; said Zeus; &quot;I should like them all to have a share; for cities cannot exist, if a few only share in the virtues, as in the arts. And further, make a law by my order, that he who has no part in reverence and justice shall be put to death, for he is a plague of the state.&quot;

And this is the reason, Socrates, why the Athenians and mankind in general, when the question relates to carpentering or any other mechanical art, allow but a few to share in their deliberations; and when any one else interferes, then, as you say, they object, if he be not of the favoured few; which, as I reply, is very natural. But when they meet to deliberate about political virtue, which proceeds only by way of justice and wisdom, they are patient enough of any man who speaks of them, as is also natural, because they think that every man ought to share in this sort of virtue, and that states could not exist if this were otherwise. I have explained to you, Socrates, the reason of this phenomenon.

And that you may not suppose yourself to be deceived in thinking that all men regard every man as having a share of justice or honesty and of every other political virtue, let me give you a further proof, which is this. In other cases, as you are aware, if a man says that he is a good flute-player, or skilful in any other art in which he has no skill, people either laugh at him or are angry with him, and his relations think that he is mad and go and admonish him; but when honesty is in question, or some other political virtue, even if they know that he is dishonest, yet, if the man comes publicly forward and tells the truth about his dishonesty, then, what in the other case was held by them to be good sense, they now deem to be madness. They say that all men ought to profess honesty whether they are honest or not, and that a man is out of his mind who says anything else. Their notion is, that a man must have some degree of honesty; and that if he has none at all he ought not to be in the world.

I have been showing that they are right in admitting every man as a counsellor about this sort of virtue, as they are of opinion that every man is a partaker of it. And I will now endeavour to show further that they do not conceive this virtue to be given by nature, or to grow spontaneously, but to be a thing which may be taught; and which comes to a man by taking pains. No one would instruct, no one would rebuke, or be angry with those whose calamities they suppose to be due to nature or chance; they do not try to punish or to prevent them from being what they are; they do but pity them. Who is so foolish as to chastise or instruct the ugly, or the diminutive, or the feeble? And for this reason. Because he knows that good and evil of this kind is the work of nature and of chance; whereas if a man is wanting in those good qualities which are attained by study and exercise and teaching, and has only the contrary evil qualities, other men are angry with him, and punish and reprove him-of these evil qualities one is impiety, another injustice, and they may be described generally as the very opposite of political virtue. In such cases any man will be angry with another, and reprimand him,-clearly because he thinks that by study and learning, the virtue in which the other is deficient may be acquired. If you will think, Socrates, of the nature of punishment, you will see at once that in the opinion of mankind virtue may be acquired; no one punishes the evil-doer under the notion, or for the reason, that he has done wrong, only the unreasonable fury of a beast acts in that manner. But he who desires to inflict rational punishment does not retaliate for a past wrong which cannot be undone; he has regard to the future, and is desirous that the man who is punished, and he who sees him punished, may be deterred from doing wrong again. He punishes for the sake of prevention, thereby clearly implying that virtue is capable of being taught. This is the notion of all who retaliate upon others either privately or publicly. And the Athenians, too, your own citizens, like other men, punish and take vengeance on all whom they regard as evil doers; and hence, we may infer them to be of the number of those who think that virtue may be acquired and taught. Thus far, Socrates, I have shown you clearly enough, if I am not mistaken, that your countrymen are right in admitting the tinker and the cobbler to advise about politics, and also that they deem virtue to be capable of being taught and acquired.

There yet remains one difficulty which has been raised by you about the sons of good men. What is the reason why good men teach their sons the knowledge which is gained from teachers, and make them wise in that, but do nothing towards improving them in the virtues which distinguish themselves? And here, Socrates, I will leave the apologue and resume the argument. Please to consider: Is there or is there not some one quality of which all the citizens must be partakers, if there is to be a city at all? In the answer to this question is contained the only solution of your difficulty; there is no other. For if there be any such quality, and this quality or unity is not the art of the carpenter, or the smith, or the potter, but justice and temperance and holiness and, in a word, manly virtue-if this is the quality of which all men must be partakers, and which is the very condition of their learning or doing anything else, and if he who is wanting in this, whether he be a child only or a grown-up man or woman, must be taught and punished, until by punishment he becomes better, and he who rebels against instruction and punishment is either exiled or condemned to death under the idea that he is incurable-if what I am saying be true, good men have their sons taught other things and not this, do consider how extraordinary their conduct would appear to be. For we have shown that they think virtue capable of being taught and cultivated both in private and public; and, notwithstanding, they have their sons taught lesser matters, ignorance of which does not involve the punishment of death: but greater things, of which the ignorance may cause death and exile to those who have no training or knowledge of them-aye, and confiscation as well as death, and, in a word, may be the ruin of families-those things, I say, they are supposed not to teach them-not to take the utmost care that they should learn. How improbable is this, Socrates!

Education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood, and last to the very end of life. Mother and nurse and father and tutor are vying with one another about the improvement of the child as soon as ever he is able to understand what is being said to him: he cannot say or do anything without their setting forth to him that this is just and that is unjust; this is honourable, that is dishonourable; this is holy, that is unholy; do this and abstain from that. And if he obeys, well and good; if not, he is straightened by threats and blows, like a piece of bent or warped wood. At a later stage they send him to teachers, and enjoin them to see to his manners even more than to his reading and music; and the teachers do as they are desired. And when the boy has learned his letters and is beginning to understand what is written, as before he understood only what was spoken, they put into his hands the works of great poets, which he reads sitting on a bench at school; in these are contained many admonitions, and many tales, and praises, and encomia of ancient famous men, which he is required to learn by heart, in order that he may imitate or emulate them and desire to become like them. Then, again, the teachers of the lyre take similar care that their young disciple is temperate and gets into no mischief; and when they have taught him the use of the lyre, they introduce him to the poems of other excellent poets, who are the lyric poets; and these they set to music, and make their harmonies ana rhythms quite familiar to the children's souls, in order that they may learn to be more gentle, and harmonious, and rhythmical, and so more fitted for speech and action; for the life of man in every part has need of harmony and rhythm. Then they send them to the master of gymnastic, in order that their bodies may better minister to the virtuous mind, and that they may not be compelled through bodily weakness to play the coward in war or on any other occasion. This is what is done by those who have the means, and those who have the means are the rich; their children begin to go to school soonest and leave off latest. When they have done with masters, the state again compels them to learn the laws, and live after the pattern which they furnish, and not after their own fancies; and just as in learning to write, the writing-master first draws lines with a style for the use of the young beginner, and gives him the tablet and makes him follow the lines, so the city draws the laws, which were the invention of good lawgivers living in the olden time; these are given to the young man, in order to guide him in his conduct whether he is commanding or obeying; and he who transgresses them is to be corrected, or, in other words, called to account, which is a term used not only in your country, but also in many others, seeing that justice calls men to account. Now when there is all this care about virtue private and public, why, Socrates, do you still wonder and doubt whether virtue can be taught? Cease to wonder, for the opposite would be far more surprising.

But why then do the sons of good fathers often turn out ill? There is nothing very wonderful in this; for, as I have been saying, the existence of a state implies that virtue is not any man's private possession. If so-and nothing can be truer-then I will further ask you to imagine, as an illustration, some other pursuit or branch of knowledge which may be assumed equally to be the condition of the existence of a state. Suppose that there could be no state unless we were all flute-players, as far as each had the capacity, and everybody was freely teaching everybody the art, both in private and public, and reproving the bad player as freely and openly as every man now teaches justice and the laws, not concealing them as he would conceal the other arts, but imparting them-for all of us have a mutual interest in the justice and virtue of one another, and this is the reason why every one is so ready to teach justice and the laws;-suppose, I say, that there were the same readiness and liberality among us in teaching one another flute-playing, do you imagine, Socrates, that the sons of good flute players would be more likely to be good than the sons of bad ones? I think not. Would not their sons grow up to be distinguished or undistinguished according to their own natural capacities as flute-players, and the son of a good player would often turn out to be a bad one, and the son of a bad player to be a good one, all flute-players would be good enough in comparison of those who were ignorant and unacquainted with the art of flute-playing? In like manner I would have you consider that he who appears to you to be the worst of those who have been brought up in laws and humanities, would appear to be a just man and a master of justice if he were to be compared with men who had no education, or courts of justice, or laws, or any restraints upon them which compelled them to practise virtue-with the savages, for example, whom the poet Pherecrates exhibited on the stage at the last year's Lenaean festival. If you were living among men such as the man-haters in his Chorus, you would be only too glad to meet with Eurybates and Phrynondas, and you would sorrowfully long to revisit the rascality of this part of the world. you, Socrates, are discontented, and why? Because all men are teachers of virtue, each one according to his ability; and you say, Where are the teachers? You might as well ask, Who teaches Greek? For of that too there will not be any teachers found. Or you might ask, Who is to teach the sons of our artisans this same art which they have learned of their fathers? He and his fellow-workmen have taught them to the best of their ability,-but who will carry them further in their arts? And you would certainly have a difficulty, Socrates, in finding a teacher of them; but there would be no difficulty in finding a teacher of those who are wholly ignorant. And this is true of virtue or of anything else; if a man is better able than we are to promote virtue ever so little, we must be content with the result. A teacher of this sort I believe myself to be, and above all other men to have the knowledge which makes a man noble and good; and I give my pupils their money's-worth, and even more, as they themselves confess. And therefore I have introduced the following mode of payment:-When a man has been my pupil, if he likes he pays my price, but there is no compulsion; and if he does not like, he has only to go into a temple and take an oath of the value of the instructions, and he pays no more than he declares to be their value.

Such is my Apologue, Socrates, and such is the argument by which I endeavour to show that virtue may be taught, and that this is the opinion of the Athenians. And I have also attempted to show that you are not to wonder at good fathers having bad sons, or at good sons having bad fathers, of which the sons of Polycleitus afford an example, who are the companions of our friends here, Paralus and Xanthippus, but are nothing in comparison with their father; and this is true of the sons of many other artists. As yet I ought not to say the same of Paralus and Xanthippus themselves, for they are young and there is still hope of them.

Hi! While you're adding navigation to pages, could you also add it to the bottom of each page, especially for long pages? Going back to the contents pages takes about the same amount of time as scrolling up, so navigation at the top of pages isn't really helpful to readers. I made &amp;#123;{[[Template:chapter navigation|chapter navigation]]}} specifically for this purpose, and added the functions of TopNav into it, although a simple &quot;next&quot; link is fine. Thanks! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

This module assumes
* you, the reader, know a little about programming using C and assembly.
* you have a MPLAB ICD 2 and a PICDEM 2 Plus demo board.
* you have [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller | selected a PICmicro microcontroller]] and want to program it. (Examples in this book will be focus on PIC18F452 microcontroller since it came with the demo board. The same process works with most other PICmicros).

Before getting started,
* install latest MPLAB IDE from [http://www.microchip.com Microchip Technology Inc] and MPLAB C18 compiler. When this book was written, the latest MPLAB version is 7.40.

== Getting Started with Simple I/O ==

We will start with a simple input output program using PORTA and PORTB. Let light some LEDs on the board. We should assign value 0x0A to PORTB. This will light up LEDs at RB3 and RB1. Everytime the switch button at RA4 is pressed, the value will be negated; thus the LEDS will switch between RB3/RB1 and RB2/RB0.

First, start your MPLAB IDE. In the menu bar, select Project &amp;rarr; Project Wizard. Hit next, and select PIC18F452 as your device. Select next again. Under Active Toolsuite, select Microchip C18 Toolsuite and MPLAB C18 C Compiler (mcc18.exe) under Toolsuite Contents. Now, we have to give a name to our project and select a directory for it. Since we going to do a simple I/O, let us name it Simple_IO at Project Name. Then, select a directory. In this case, I would use c:\example\simpleIO. Hit the next button. We do not have any files to add to the project. So, hit the next button again. Now, we are finished with the Project Wizard. Hit the finish button.

Once the project is setup, we should create a C file called SimpleIO.c. At the menu bar, select File &amp;rarr; New. Once the new editor pops, select File &amp;rarr; Save As. At the new window, save the newly created file as SimpleIO.c. On the Project Window (where Simple_IO.mcv is the title) right click on Source Files. Select Add Files... from the menu. Select SimpleIO.c from where you save just now. On the same window, select Linker Scripts and select Add Files... from the menu. Under Microchip C18 C compiler directory (default is C:\MCC18), go to c:\''installed directory''/lkr and type 18f452.lkr at the File name. Type the following code into the editor.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
#include &lt;p18f452.h&gt;

// Configurations
#pragma config OSC = HSPLL, OSCS = ON, PWRT = ON, BOR = OFF, WDT = OFF, LVP = OFF

// Main body
void main() {

    // Initializing ports
    PORTA = 0;
    PORTB = 0;

    // Set RA4 as input and RB3-RB0 as output
    TRISA |= 0x10;
    TRISB &amp;= 0xF0;

    // Set value 0x0A to PORTB
    PORTB = 0x0A;
	
    // If button is pressed, toggle PORTB
    while(1) {
        if(PORTAbits.RA4 != 0)
            PORTB = ~PORTB;
    }
}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Hit the save button on the toolbar or from the menu bar, select File &amp;rarr; Save. Next, click on Project &amp;rarr; Build All or Build All button at the toolbar at the top. Make sure you have no error or warning at the Output window. Hook up your MPLAB ICD 2 to your computer and connect PICDEM 2 Plus Demo board to the ICD (Please refer to the manual provided). Now, select Debugger &amp;rarr; Select Tool &amp;rarr; MPLAB ICD 2. Make sure there is no error at the output window. Next, click on Debugger &amp;rarr; Program to program the microcontroller. Once you have successful programed the microcontroller, click on Debugger &amp;rarr; Run. You can also hit the Run button at the toolbar. On the demo board, LEDs at RB3 and RB1 should light up.

Now, pressed the switch at RA4 on the demo board a few times. Noticed something wrong? The LEDs do flick, but do not switch between RB3/RB1 and RB2/RB0 all the time. And if you just pressed the switch without releasing it, all the LEDs do light up. This is not something that we want. Let us look at the code again to find out what is the problem. Noticed that in the while loop, as long as RA4 is read 0, value at PORTB will be inverted. With the microcontroller running at 16MHz, a flash push at the switch, which may consume up to 500us, may cause the value in PORTB to invert more than 1000 times. That is why the LEDs appear to be light up in random whenever the switch is pushed. The code has to be modified to detect a push, and a release at the switch.

				//this will turn on the LED hooked to RB7
      delay_ms(500);  		//wait half a second, delays for 500ms 
      output_low(PIN_B7);     //send a “0” to pin RB7, making RB7 “Low” at 0v
      delay_ms(500);		//wait half a second, delays for 500ms
   }
}

Notes
You can easily add more LEDs and make them flash in different patterns.
For more readable code, use
#define RED_LED   PIN_B7
#define GREEN_LED PIN_B6
…
…
output_high(RED_LED);
output_high(GREEN_LED);

In the score, this is doubled by the clarinet. The tuning can be very problematic, as the two instruments have different pitching tendencies in this tessitura.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In my quest to construct a circit that mimics a neuron in the brain, I ended with a circuit that exhibitted the following results

There are two types of learning

* Memorized learning
* Algorithimization

== Memorized learning ==

Lets take the case of Fibonacci series 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34 .............. Say you want to train a circuit the when given a number n gives out the nth Fibonacci number. Example if given n=5 the circuit gives out 3 and so on. When we try to train the circuit by this way the circuit simply remembers that at n=0,1,2,3,4,5 and so on the output must be 0,1,1,2,3 etc.

== Algorithmization ==

But instead if we train give a seed value of 0,1 and variable n which represents a feed back we can get a circuit that forms a algorithm that can generate Fibonacci series, rather than one that just remembers.

If a circuit undergoes algorithmized training it can generate output for previously encountered and non encountered values that are given as input. Else if a circit has learned by memorization it can give right output for previously trained values, but may give out erroneous output for previously nonencountered inputs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Migrating from Windows to Linux =
==Introduction==
===About this Wikibook===
There are already several introductory Wikibooks on GNU/Linux, such as [[Linux Guide]] and [[Linux For Newbies]]. This Wikibook will be different in that it is much more clearly defined in terms of its 'audience' as well as the Linux distro used :
* it will be targeted at those who use PCs on a regular basis but have no desire to become experts. Typically these will be people who have used Windows for years, want to migrate to GNU/Linux, but are scared of a steep learning curve. This will be an instructional resource easing the transition by teaching people who to employ the skills they have acquired in a GNU/Linux environment.
* the distro used is Kubuntu 6.06 LTS. Deciding on a specific edition of a specific distro avoids tons of technical problems. Also, KDE is most similar to Windows and (K)ubuntu is widely regarded as one of the most user-friendly distros.
* common tasks can be shown side-by-side in Windows and free software 
===Principles===
With GNU/Linux, users are in control of their computer, opening up enormous possibilities for using software. In addition, there are usually many different ways of achieving the same goal. This Wikibook will focus on showing you how to do the most common tasks in ''one '' way - the way that's most appropriate for its audience. To achieve this, we'll have to make choices, based on the folowing principles:
* choose tasks that most Windows users regard as standard
* choose the software that is most similar to Windows
* show how it's achieved in Windows and Linux side-by-side, using screenshots (although not too many screenshots - text and screenshots should take up similar space)
* when the solution shown is less than perfect, point towards further resources that may be more powerful but less appropriate for ex-Windozers (e.g. link towards the Wikibook about OpenOffice.org)
* make users apply basic concepts and new knowledge using tutorial exercises
=== Assumptions ===
* Skill level - Knowledge the user is assumed to have. i.e., defining the target audience.
* working , fresh, installation of Kubuntu 6.06 LTS ; refer to possibility of Live CD

===What are the Free Software movement, GNU/Linux, Kubuntu ? ===
===Why would I want to switch ?===
[http:/ /www.opensource.org/docs/peru_and_ms.php]

=== Difficulties with switching from Windows to GNU/Linux===

=== jargon ===
(should mostly be explained in history part)
kernel X KDE GNOME distribution Ubuntu Kubuntu

==Understand - Comparison of Windows and GNU/Linux|Comparison of Windows and GNU/Linux==
This will be a more theoretical part, introducing those concepts that are most relevant for ex-Widows users because they make the GNU/Linux experience quite different. The section should be to the point, rather than going into too much dept, dealing with things at such a level as is relevant for practical use. Pointers towards more detailed info. The following chapters will then refer back to this part whenever these concepts are put into practice.

http:// www.getgnulinux.org/switch_to_linux/linux_from_windows/
[[w:Comparison of Windows and Linux]]
http:// www.psychocats.net/essays/linuxwindowscomparison.php
=== The filesystem ===

Windows:
* tree - hierarchical system of directories and subdirectories ('folders')
* several trees - hierarchy starts with c: - harddrive (partition where the OS is installed)  ;  a: - floppy ; additional e.g. d:-CD/DVD , e: second harddrive, f: USB flash --- these are usually detected when booted, or for USB devices when inserted
* \MyDocuments
* FAT, NTFS
*three letter extension identifies type of file

Linux :
* one single tree -  single hierarchical system, starting with / (root)
* partitions have to be mounted at mount point in the hierarchical file-system
* /home/Desktop
* case-sensitive
* extension doesn't matter much
* vfat, ext2, ext3, ReiserFS
* Linux can read NTFS, but writing NTFS used to be major headache
* Windows not designed to read ext2, ext3, ReiserFS
* FAT can be dealt with well by both Windows and Linux

=== Users ===
Windows:
* when start up, either get to desktop, or need to login with username
* easy to install programmes
* big security problems, virus, rootkits, worms, spyware

Linux:
* very strict distinction - 'normal' user and root user
* root user can access everything - modify system and access all files, create users
* users have access to their files only, can launch programmes but cannot install new software
* Kubuntu has it's own way of dealing with this : sudo, need to type in password of user who installed Kubuntu

=== File Permissions ===
Windows: not really an issue ; did not exist in Windows ME and before
Linux:
* user who owns the file - group - other users
* read - write - execute


[https:// help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions]
[[w:File system permissions]]

=== Community ===
*(k)ubuntu help documetation
*forums
*icq
*bug reports

==Install==
not sure yet if it's good to show installation....
if so, then show dual boot, using second HD

== Make it your own -- Configuring Kubuntu 6.06 ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Color=
:When using HTML, there are to basic ways to describe color:

:{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=&quot;EEEE99&quot;
|
:# bgcolor= &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:# color=
|}

==Assigned Colors==
:The assigned color scheme is easy to use, but can come up with some interesting colors as you learn to experiment with this technique.

:This technique is based on Red, Green, and Blue as the primary colors.  Each of these three colors can range from 0 to 255.  These colors are expressed in hexadecimal (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F) which makes the range 00 to FF.

:Combined, you will see something like this: #RRGGBB, for example #000000 is black and #FFFFFF is white.

:For some examples that might make more sense, go to ... [http://bob.fornal.org/Computer/cWhite.htm My Color Codes], the menu of colors is on the right side of the screen.

==Named Colors==
:The colors assigned utilize two methodologies.  This first is a simple naming convention - there are basically 16 colors within this convention:

:{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 
{| border=0 cellpadding=5 bgcolor=black
|

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Zoology''' is the branch of biology that includes the study of animals and animal life, including, but not limited to, the study of the structure, physiology and classification of animals. Zoology can be subdivided into two categories:

*Vertebrate zoology
*Invertebrate zoology

== Vertebrate Zoology ==

Vertebrate means to have a spinal column or backbone. Animals in this category include species of the phylum Chordata: fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. These are characterized by a segmented spinal cord and a distinct differentiated head. These animals possess internal skeletons which include the vertebral column which at least partially encloses the spinal cord and a skull which houses the brain. Vertebrates also usually possess two pairs of limbs and an outer covering (fur, skin, feathers).

== Invertebrate Zoology ==

Invertebrate means lacking a spinal column. Animals in this category include species of the following: protozoans, annelids, cnidarians, echinoderms, flatworms, nematodes, molluscs, and arthropods. Invertebrates make up 90% of the Earth's animals. They range in size from minute to extremely large. They possess soft bodies and external skeletons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the goals for educational change?}}
{{Rquote|right|You do not get out of a problem by using the same consciousness that got you into it.|Albert Einstein}}

Education in today’s society is becoming exceedingly difficult as students’ interests are constantly changing and more skills are needed to become successful in society.  Also, the society in which we live is completely different from the world twenty years ago, yet the way of educating children and what is taught has not significantly changed.  This shows the need for educational reform.  However, it brings up the question: What are the goals for educational change?  The change in education needs to encompass the following ideas: cooperative learning, differentiation, technology, and conscious discipline.  Cooperative learning is important because studies have found that children, even older children, learn better by actively participating in class instead of passively observing.  In addition, they can learn more from working with other students along with what the teacher has to offer.  Differentiation is also essential because no two children are identical and they may not learn in exactly the same way.  Therefore, the classroom should be taught as individuals instead of a group to best meet the needs of each individual student, taking into account the student’s learning style and preferences.  Technology is changing the lives of both students and teachers everyday as life becomes more and more high-tech and it should be used to the advantage of the educational process.  Finally is conscious discipline, which focuses more on creating and maintaining a relationship with the student versus a reward system.  With these ideas being the basic goals of the education system, the students should be more likely to succeed.

==Cooperative Learning==
&quot;Cooperative learning is a successful teaching strategy in which small teams, each with students of different levels of ability, use a variety of learning activities to improve their understanding of a subject.  Each member of a team is responsible not only for learning what is taught but also for helping teammates learn, thus creating an atmosphere of achievement.  Students work through the assignment until all group members successfully understand and complete it&quot; (Kennesaw State University).

Cooperative Learning as a technique that not only teaches the students more effectively but it also helps to develop their social skills, character, and morals because the students are forced to interact with one another and work as a group.  The Kagan strategy, which was developed by Dr. Spencer Kagan, is a method of utilizing cooperative learning.  The Kagan strategy switches the teaching methods from lesson-based to structure based, so that the students are learning more on their own than being taught directly from the teacher.  It allows the student to not just learn a particular skill, but instead acquire it by actually practicing the particular skill in the classroom.  It uses an embedded curriculum to teach the students math, language arts, science and social studies through methods that require each student to actively participate in each lesson, so what is taught is actually being used (Kagan).

===Elements of Cooperative Learning===
#Positive Interdependence
#* Each group member's efforts are required and indispensable for group success
#* Each group member has a unique contribution to make to the joint effort because of his or her resources and/or role and task responsibilities
#Face-to-Face Interaction
#* Orally explaining how to solve problems
#* Teaching one's knowledge to other
#* Checking for understanding
#* Discussing concepts being learned
#* Connecting present with past learning
#Individual &amp; Group Accountability
#* Keeping the size of the group small. The smaller the size of the group, the greater the individual accountability may be.
#* Giving an individual test to each student.
#* Randomly examining students orally by calling on one student to present his or her group's work to the teacher (in the presence of the group) or to the entire class.
#* Observing each group and recording the frequency with which each member-contributes to the group's work.
#* Assigning one student in each group the role of checker. The checker asks other group members to explain the reasoning and rationale underlying group answers.
#* Having students teach what they learned to someone else.&lt;/small&gt;
#Interpersonal &amp; Small-Group Skills
#* Leadership
#* Decision-making
#* Trust-building
#* Communication
#* Conflict-management skills
#Group Processing
#* Group members discuss how well they are achieving their goals and maintaining effective working relationships
#* Describe what member actions are helpful and not helpful
#* Make decisions about what behaviors to continue or change

==Project-Based Learning==
Project-based learning is an approach to engage students in cooperative investigation.  It is an emphasis on cooperative learning.  In project-based learning, students work together to make sense of what is being taught.  There are two components to project-based learning.  The first component is a question or problem that organizes and pushes the activity.  This question or problem is the meaning behind the project at hand.  The second component is developing tasks that address the question or problem.  

There are four features to use in project-based learning.  The first feature is a driving question.  This question is the problem at hand that the students are working towards finding the answer to.  The second feature is when students explore to help them apply information, learns concepts, and show what they learned in different ways.  The third feature is sharing with other students and teachers that they have learned.  This is referred to as the “learning community.”    The fourth feature is using cognitive tools in showing their ideas.  An example of this would be using computers to show their information.

Students use Project-based learning by:
* Asking and refining questions
* Debating ideas
* Making predictions
* Designing plans and/or experiments
* Collecting and analyzing data
* Drawing conclusions
* Communicating their ideas and finding to other
* Asking new questions
* Creating artifacts 

(Houghton Mifflin)

Project-based learning is a great way for students to learn and share.  Though is may have some downfalls, it has been found to be a great way for students to interact and be motivated to learn.  It teaches students to learn for themselves how to organize and gather information.  It is a great technique to use in any grade level.

==Differentiation==
&quot;The idea of differentiating instruction to accommodate the different ways that students learn involves a hefty dose of common sense, as well as sturdy support in the theory and research of education.  It is an approach to teaching that advocates active planning for student differences in classrooms&quot; (Tomlinson).

Differentiation is essential to classroom instruction because no two children are the same and therefore do not learn in the same way.  In addition, all students have different intelligence quotients (IQs) and learning styles so the teaching needs to reflect that.  It is also necessary to teach the students to think for themselves that way when they get out of the classroom they do not flounder.  In a classroom of twenty-five students, most of them are on different reading levels and some may not even be able to complete certain tasks.  Now the teacher should not differentiate his or her class so that there are twenty-five different assignments but rather so that there are several options and the teacher groups them into the section most appropriate for each particular student.  This allows the students to learn in a way that is best for them to learn the particular material; therefore, making them more likely to succeed in the education system.

'''Four Ways to Differentiate Instruction:'''
# Differentiating the content/topic
# Differentiating the process/activities
# Differentiating the product
# Differentiating by manipulating the environment or through accommodating individual learning styles

==Technology==
This is the era of technology where it encompasses almost every part of a student’s daily life from iPods, to the internet, to computer games, and video games.  As technology drives the students’ lives, the education system has yet to keep up. Many businesses use computers to save time and make work more efficient; however, most classrooms have only one computer in a classroom and then a computer lab that students use once a week or less.  If students were given more opportunities with computers learning could be changed, not just through things like educational video games, students can get on the computer and find information for themselves on the topics being learned in school.  It will help them to learn how to find out information for themselves as well as learn to think for themselves and decipher the information that they find.  Education needs to stay on hand with today’s technology and use its advantages to better teach the students.

==Conscious Discipline==
&quot;Conscious Discipline is a comprehensive classroom management program and a social-emotional curriculum.  It is based on current brain research, child development information, and developmentally appropriate practices.  Conscious Discipline has been specifically designed to make changes in the lives of adults first.  The adults, in turn, change the lives of children&quot; (Bailey).

Conscious Discipline, developed by Dr. Becky Bailey, starts first by having the teacher change his or her attitude and that will in turn cause the students behavior and attitude toward learning to change.  It involves developing a positive relationship with each individual student.  However, it switches the classroom discipline from the traditional reward and punishment for good and bad behavior to one where the classroom is like a miniature community and discipline occurs through thinking.  Conscious Discipline teaches students how to control their emotions and develop social skills as well as problem solving.  It also helps to build the students self-esteem by the sense of community (through students helping one another) that is created within the classroom.  Finally, Conscious Discipline is learned through example since the teacher starts by respecting the student and the student in turn will respect the other students as well as the teacher.

==Conclusion==
With society consistently changing, education needs to change with it and meet the needs of each student in the classroom in the best way possible.  By implementing cooperative learning, differentiation, technology, and conscious discipline students will be able to learn more successfully and develop more skills that will help them to succeed outside of the classroom.  It is important for students to stay interested in education and if they are learning in a way suitable for them that encompasses elements that are significant to today’s society, then education will become stronger and leave a more substantial impact on the student’s life.

{{question-answer|question=Which type of educational change do you feel is most important to a student's education? Why?
|answer=I feel that differentiation is the most important change that could be made in education an a national level. Though differentiation puts more work on the teachers it helps the students learn more effectively. It essentially will make the student feel better about his or herself because he or she is doing better in the classroom since learning has been adapted to their learning style or to help them from struggling so much with the course material. This type of adaptation is essential to the classroom since all students learn differently.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is obsolescence a barrier to effective education?}}
{{Rquote|right|It may seem unfair that just when you reach the zenith of your profession, the world changes and make many of your skills obsolete.  Your expertise becomes a hurdle to overcome as you struggle to see the brave new world.|Allen and Cosby}}

Obsolescence is the state of being which occurs when a person, object, or service is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order (Wikipedia definition).  Obsolescence can be applied directly to Education in many instances.  A barrier is something that poses as an obstacle that must be overcome.  Education like many other fields is constantly changing. “Change” being the key word for this article.  As the world evolves and changes, certain objects or techniques become outdated or obsolete.  This is only one barrier that prevents effective education.  

==Past, Present, Future==
As potential educators we must focus on the past, present, and future.  We can only anticipate new change by being knowledgeable about the past as well as what the future has in store.  In education there are many areas that experience obsolescence.  For example, the technology, textbooks and materials, as well as the teaching methods, even the teachers all run the risk of at some point becoming outdated.
Technology is changing everyday, it is our responsibility to learn new systems and apply them to our classrooms.  As new technology such as computers and calculators become more apparent in the classroom, we must not let them completely replace our traditional methods of learning.

==Changing Technology==
Computers are a great resource for students to use; however, they shouldn’t completely replace former methods of learning.  New technology is improved every day.  The CD-Rom has already replaced the Floppy Disc, as well as CDs replacing tapes.  There is always a faster computer that produces information at a quicker rate.  “Anyone who has ever tried to get rid of an old PC can appreciate the problems colleges and universities have in getting rid of used mainframes and supercomputers. By the time colleges stop using them, there is almost no resale market for most old mainframes, so colleges find new uses for them--as database servers, for example.” (Olsen).  This demonstrates how quickly technology is evolving, making it even more difficult to keep up.

''Educational board games vs. computer'' ''games'' – Some games can lose the aesthetic feel when you are using the computer.  Computers also limit student participation whereas; more traditional games can include an entire class.

''Google''.''com'' ''vs''. ''library'' – As a student, part of learning should be to understand the importance of books and other resources that will aid in their development.  Internet is a great resource, however, not always credible.  Libraries offer great physical resources that can be used.

''Handwriting'' ''vs''. ''typing'' – Typing is an important skill to acquire for the professional world that awaits all students, however, it should not replace the old standby of handwriting.  Focus should not be directed away from teaching handwriting because obviously it is a basic of education growth.

One way to overcome this barrier of changing technology is to incorporate the traditional methods of teaching with the new.  This will allow the teacher to use the computer as well as traditional resources to conduct research and overall learning in the classroom.

Calculators are a part of technology that is updated frequently.  Calculators are very important but not essential in many early childhood classrooms.  Too often students rely on calculators to “do the math” for them instead of taking the time to learn the science themselves.  The basics of mathematics need to be taught and never overlooked.  These basics are the foundation for educational expansion of the mind for the future.  
Educators can overcome this barrier by ensuring the fundamentals of math are still taught as thoroughly as they were ages ago.

==Changing Resources==
As we all know the world is constantly changing.  This makes one thing evident, what was new today will be “old news” tomorrow.  In an effort to keep up with the changing times, there are many researchers that study new developments everyday.  Their jobs are to discover what is unknown and to prove what we believe as being factual.  

With all of these new discoveries and developments in our world, our reliable resources become inaccurate information.  This includes textbooks, maps, and many other teaching materials.  Unfortunately, as we embark on new information, our resources become outdated fast.  At times the text can become outdated before it is even printed.  When I was in school, we would be assigned a new textbook every year.  Inside the front cover would be a list of names (at least 3-5) of students that had used the book in past years.  Today, students are given disposable workbooks as their textbooks.  This allows the most updated information to be used.

Take for example traditional chalkboards.  Classrooms are now being fitted with dry-erase boards because they are easier to use and make less of a mess.  There are many ways that the classroom has to try to keep up with the changing resources. One potential issue with all of the examples given is annual budget.  We must make an effort to overcome this barrier by reserving adequate funding for updated materials.  All an educator can do is put forth the effort to make the material they are teaching accurate not obsolete.

==Changing Teachers==
This may sound weird but is it possible for teachers to become obsolete?  Unfortunately, I think this is possible without the effort of change.  Teachers can become outdated much like technology and other resources.  They will always know the foundations of education.  However, they must be willing to evolve with the changing world.  Some styles of teaching may become outdated and stale.  Teachers may also fall into the trap of teaching what they know and not what they potentially should know.  Teachers never stop learning.  They must always keep an open mind to all angles of education.  

One way to approach this barrier is to keep teachers informed about anything that is changing.  This would include new technology, resources, methods of teaching, the list goes on.  Teachers are the forefront of education.  Therefore, they must set the example.  They should attend meetings or seminars on how to promote new learning methods and apply them in their classrooms and to their peers.

==Obsolescence in a “Faster World”==
As we have talked about change and how it affects the classroom, we must also understand why.  There are obvious reasons why obsolescence exists, however, there is one reason that has become a staple in today’s society.  Convenience!!  Where have we heard this word before?  It can be applied to almost every aspect of our society today.  We have reached a point where obsolescence exists because it is easier, faster, and more convenient.  

“The word processor facilitated the ‘hurry up’ mentality.” ( Bateman )  This explains how if there is a way to speed up the process, we will find it.  People have become impatient and want to use new technology, new techniques to facilitate teaching in a quicker mode.  However, we must remember that students are not robots and they mustn’t be taught in a way that would imply that.   “The Industrial Revolution proved that machines do very capably, take the place of people.  The tutor will be replaced.”  Isn’t it ironic that many online classes create the perfect example?  A traditional classroom with a physical educator can be replaced with a computer, TV screen, or even telecast class.  Please don’t get me wrong, this is a form of obsolescence that I feel is effective.  

==Evaluation==
As educators we must evaluate the new technologies and methods, because with much of the “newness” come a monetary cost. We must remember that the state of obsolescence does not mean that the teaching method, person, or tangible item is not in working, just that the want for it has depreciated because of a new replacement option. The example used in the Wikipedia article “Obsolescence” is a good visual because it refers to Apple’s Ipod. If someone buys an Ipod with a certain hard drive size and screen size and a week later Apple begins selling a new version of the Ipod but with a larger hard drive capacity and a larger screen size, the Ipod that was purchased the week before loses desirability. This does not mean that it does not work any longer, but people would now rather purchase the new model. In a world than changes hour to hour, educators must evaluate desirability and what works. Some technologies may still work and accomplish what needs to be presented and not need replacement because when evaluated the fiscal cost do not outweigh the effectiveness. Then, one may evaluate the content in new history textbook from what they are using in the classrooms at the present time and the fiscal cost may be worth the change because the content is no longer valid. So, as educators we must evaluate the obsolescence of something in regards to if it works (is it still effective) and the fiscal cost of it’s replacement.  

==Conclusion==
Obsolescence is inevitable in any aspect of the world.  We, as educators, must be prepared to minimize the obstacles that this creates.  As we live in an ever-changing environment, we must be able to recognize the importance of obsolescence within reason.  Education needs to grow and be updated. But this can be achieved without neglecting to teach the basic fundamentals of education that can sometimes be taken for granted. “Lack of training focusing on integrating technology in the classroom rather than simply teaching basic skills” can cause major problems (Van Fossen).  The main point is teachers must never stop learning and be able to “integrate” these new changes into their classrooms with minimal difficulty.

{{question-answer|question=What are the pros and cons of obsolescence?
|answer=Obsolescence holds its own space in a changing world.  As things change, practices and objects become outdated.  It is a fact that resources and technology becomes old and needs to be updated, however, there are some practices that need to remain.  There are ways that obsolescence can help make the classroom more effective, such as new textbooks and computers.  Obsolescence helps to keep the students informed of the latest developments.  Students are able to be knowledgeable in areas that their parents may not be.  The definite pro is that we are producing better informed and educated students.  You may ask then why would we ask for anything else?  How is obsolescence a negative?  The answer is quite simple.  Obsolescence only becomes a barrier and a problem, when it is not paired with traditional styles and information that is worthy of keeping around.  This is all about managing when to incorporate new technologies and resources.  The new information is obviously vital; however, we as educators must not forget the basics.  Our society leans towards a lifestyle of convenience and whatever is quickest and easiest.  Therefore, we must not overlook the skills that we may take for granted and forget to teach those to our students. }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is mobility a barrier to effective education?}}

One of the barriers to an effective education, mobility, all too often slips people's minds.  Student Mobility can occur in many different ways such as: A student may change residence without switching to a new school, a student may change residence and subsequently change his or her school, a student may change his or her school without changing residence, etc. (Biernat and Jax). The mobility that results in a school change is the greatest threat to academic achievement and the school environment.  In rural communities families are at risk of being categorized as highly mobile because: Nearly all executive and high ranking managerial positions tend to be in the cities, a higher rate of poverty exists in the rural communities, there is a current trend to “move urban”, etc.

==Who Does It Affect?==
 
Students that are considered to be highly mobile move six or more times in the course of their K-12  education and they come from a variety of different backgrounds.  Some of the backgrounds are as follows: The children of migrant workers, families experiencing domestic violence, families in unstable work and home situations that result from high poverty, and military and immigrant families.  Families that have a low income seem to be a significant factor with 30% of children in these families changing schools versus the 8% of those in families that are well above the poverty line (Walls).

Another group that gets hit very hard by high mobility are urban children.  Students in inner city schools are more likely to switch schools frequently.  “Approximately 25% of urban third graders were highly mobile compared to approximately one seventh of suburban and rural students” (Walls). Some urban schools even report student turnover rates from 40% to 80%.  One of the biggest problems for highly mobile students is its effect on the academics of these students.  It could take anywhere from four to six months for mobile students to recover academically from a transfer.  Also they are half as likely to graduate from high school than their non-mobile peers (Walls).

These students are also known to have major problems adjusting to different school systems. As stated before, it can take students many months to settle after a major move.  Research has found that student mobility is generally detrimental to student achievement (Schleicher). It has been proven that there are multiple issues involving mobility, and half are school related. Students forced to move not only have to leave their current school environment, they must leave all that they have come to know. The uncertainty that comes with having to move away from what is familiar gives children unfair disadvantages during their transfer period. Research also shows that the students that are affected are less likely to go on to higher education. High school completion is the gateway to higher education (Schleicher) and with a constant mobility problem students will inevitably have a harder time reaching their full potential. In the following section further problems of high mobility students will be discussed.

==Problems for Highly Mobile Students==
Frequent relocation interrupts regular attendance, continuity of lesson content, and the development of relationships with teachers and peers.  This can easily lead to a feeling of isolation and can be a big issue for highly mobile students.  When they are constantly moving children are not able to make friends with many people.  They tend to not share strong connections with the ones they do end up befriending because highly mobile students are not used to keeping friends very long.  Every time a student changes schools they have to make new friends and get to know the teachers all over again.  Because of this, it is highly unlikey they will keep a lot of the friends they make.  Also, moving takes time.  It takes time to get things packed up, to find a new place, to actually get everything moved and unpacked, to enroll in a new school, etc.  There are so many things involved in moving it makes the children of these families miss a significant amount of schooling.  “According the the U.S. Government Accounting Office, children who change schools more than three times before the eighth grade are at least four times more likely to drop out of school.  Another study shows successive school changes result in a cumulative academic lag -- students who move more than three times in a six year period can fall one full academic year behind stable students.”(Kerbow)

==Homelessness and Its Ties to Mobility==
Homelessness is another factor affecting student mobility that may not occur to us when we think about it.  However, homelessness is a big factor in the mobility of students.  Homeless families move frequently due to limited length of shelter stays, an ongoing search for safe and affordable housing, or a search for employment.  Also, homelessness affects a child’s educational opportunities because of residency requirements (so obviously if you have no residence this causes problems), guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school records, lack of transportation, and lack of immunization records.  All of these factors often prevent homeless children from enrolling in school.  “In a recent study of homeless children in New York City, 23% percent of homeless children repeated a grade, and 51% percent of these children had transferred twice or more.”(Institute for Children and Poverty) Poor children are also more likely to suffer developmental delay and damage than non-poor children. (Miranda)One thing that a lot of homeless children lack is a proper role model.  As a teacher, showing the student proper behavior can make a drastic difference.  &quot;In poverty, discipline is about penance and forgiveness, not necessarily change.&quot; (Payne) Students in homeless families are often punished for bad behavior and then forgiven.  These children are not always being taught right from wrong, so teachers have to understand that negative behaviors are a result of this.  The students in these families need to be taught a separate set of behaviors for school and the street.

==Conclusion==
{{Rquote|right|Those who educate children well are more to be honored than parents, for these only gave life, those the art of living well.|Aristotle}}

So as we can see there are many ways in which mobility can be a barrier to an effective education.  Whether it is because of homelessness, a parents career choice, being in an immigrant family or otherwise, students in a highly mobile environment have a much harder time in school than non-mobile students.  It is for these reasons that not only do the students have to work harder, but we, as the teachers, should work harder to make sure that these students don't fall behind.  We can do things such as offering after-school tutoring to help those that are lagging behind.  Also, for those students who may have that feeling of isolation, we can inform them of sports or other clubs the school has that we think they might be good at.  This way they get to meet other children their age and being on a team gives them a sense of belonging.  So as one can see, we may not be able to do everything to help the child adjust but we can at least do some things that will make the mobile students transitions much easier.

{{question-answer|question=Discuss some of the things that cause problems for homeless children who are trying to enroll in school.  Give three examples and explain why they cause problems.
|answer=Unfortunately even in America our children are not always able to get the education that they deserve.  Especially the homeless children.  It does not always matter what laws are pasted, or how much it is reinforced for our children to have an education.  There are just some who always fall between the cracks.

Our homeless children have a great disadvantage than just those children who move due to parents career, or family reasons.  Parents of children are to prove residency when enrolling their children into a school.  If you are homeless though, you will not have a residency because you lack a place to live.  This will not allow that child to enter into a school system causing them to slip through the cracks.  

Homeless children may even lack a place to shower; this would cause certain odors and lower the self-esteem of the children.  Even though they may be able to enroll in a school and attend, lack of ability to shower may prevent children from attending schools.  A lowered self-esteem will not help children who do attend school focus on the material, thus this will lower the chance of homeless children learning even if they are in school.

Another thing that will not allow the homeless children to learn may even be the lack of food.  If children are hungry or malnourished then they are worried about eating or finding food.  This is drawing less attention to the teacher and the material.  Thus again allow the children to fall in between the cracks of the system.

As you can see homeless children really need the help of the school system, not only for education, but even basic living needs.  Many schools have free lunch available to low-income families in which homeless children in school would qualify for.  Most middle and high schools have showers for bathing after gym class, homeless children could come and bathe early before school starts, and if homeless the school system could work with parents to find them a job and help with to provide a stable living place.  These are some problems with suggestions on solutions so that our homeless children do not get left behind. &amp;mdash;Julia Marable
----
It is truly a sad occurrence when every child is not given equal opportunity to be schooled and educated. Homeless children are immediately working from behind in regard to achieving their education. 

There is no substitute for a string environment where a child feels protected and secure. In this regard homeless students are extremely hurt in their educational experience. When students grow up with a safe environment they can focus more on their studies and less on whether or not they will safely make it through the night. Also the prospect of going home is often a comforting view for students, and without that sense of peace students will spend more time worrying about the idea of going home than being properly prepared for classes.

Another problem that these students will have is the lack of available study area. Without a strong home environment students will struggle to be able to properly prepare work. Homeless students will run into the trouble of having proper lighting in which to do their work. Also students will be forced to rush their work while there is still enough light to do required reading, and other activities.

One final problem for homeless students is a lack of school supplies. Being completely dependent on others in students need supplies they will have to wait to borrow from others. A need to always borrow from others creates a sense of dependence which can be detrimental for a child trying to achieve an education. &amp;mdash;Keith Smith}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is equity a barrier to effective education?}}

Equity has been a battle for all of mankind since the beginning of time because it involves the moral value of fairness. Even the youngest of children understand fairness and it is often the center of their universe and what they thrive upon. Therefore, there is no contest that equity is a barrier in education. The equity barrier affects three main groups in education: race, gender, and special needs. 

==The Difference Between Equity and Equality==
It is important not to confuse equity and equality. A good definition of both is “Equity refers to fairness which may require different treatment or special measures, for some persons or groups. Equality refers to the same treatment in dealings, quantities or values” (Gray). With a clear definition of each, the equity barrier, which faces race, gender, and special needs, should be coming clear.

==Race==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;A study finds this, “…Asian and Pacific Islanders lead other U.S. populations in home computer ownership (55%). White, non-Hispanic house-holds rank second (46.6%), while other race and origin groups (American Indian/Eskimos/Aleuts, blacks, and Hispanics) lag between 12.3 and 23.4 percentage points behind their white counterparts” (www.ncrel.org/engauge/framewk/equ/racial/equracra.htm). 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

When race and education are mentioned together, the first thing to come to mind is school integration. Integration of schools would fall under equality because it gives all races same treatment with same buildings, books, and teachers. While over the past forty or so years there has been a movement for equality in schools, there is still an equity barrier. There have been studies done correlating home computer ownership and racial equity. Humans now live in a digital world. With the movement, there has been more required to be done on computers. Education has moved to integration of technology into classrooms and today’s students have to rely heavily upon technology and computers. With this, it makes sense to evaluate racial equity in education by evaluating home computer ownership and Internet access.  With teachers asking students to rely on computers in home settings, it makes for an unfair education. A study finds this, “…Asian and Pacific Islanders lead other U.S. populations in home computer ownership (55%). White, non-Hispanic house-holds rank second (46.6%), while other race and origin groups (American Indian/Eskimos/Aleuts, blacks, and Hispanics) lag between 12.3 and 23.4 percentage points behind their white counterparts” (Indicator: Racial Equity). 

With a computer comes the need for the Internet. Internet access is also lower in black and Hispanic households. This is not to say that the only way to learn is from a computer or the Internet but it does provide an edge over a traditional classroom setting. Based upon the percentages from research, there is not equity among races in education. Just as equality has been an on-going effort to provide same treatment among races, strides will need to be made to bring equity to education. 

==Gender==
With all three (race, gender, and special needs) it is important to remember that treating all the same is not always fair. This is especially true in dealing with gender. Learning approaches among genders is not the same because girls often approach learning differently from boys. Because of different learning approaches, genders analyze and solve problems differently. Girls are often auditory learners whereas boys tend to be more visual learners. Females also have to deal with sexual harassment more than males. This affects self-esteem, which contributes to equity problems among genders. When a female is faced with sexual harassment, it makes for an uncomfortable education setting. Comfort, such as room temperature or hunger, affect how one concentrates and one’s ability to learn. Sexual harassment also leads to an uncomfortable learning atmosphere. Most teachers believe that they are unbiased towards genders. Studies show however that teachers tend to give boys more attention in the classrooms in the form of acceptance, praise, criticism, and remediation. Teachers also tend to ask boys higher orders of questions. Also, societal messages about women and girls lower their self-esteems, which negatively affect them in performing to their full potential in school. Females often feel limited in what they can do (Things to Remember About Gender Equity in Schools). How we treat genders today is probably the result of the perceptions of genders from years ago. Equality among genders actually came after the equality among races. There were many misconceptions about women such as they were incapable to learn like men, vote like men, or make important decisions. While society today does not view women in this light, some of the negative undertones involving women and education still remain in societal messages and unintentional biases. 

==Special Needs==
Special needs children are probably the hardest to accommodate with equality and equity. This is probably because even though they are grouped into one category each individual has different needs. There have been plans implemented by the government to accommodate those who do have special needs, such as Section 504. However, there are still glitches in the system that makes it difficult to accommodate each student individually. Not only is there a fiscal cost to accommodating special needs student but there is also the cost of time. There was a time where all special needs children were placed in a classroom among themselves. While these made it easier for educators it was not the best solution for equity. Education is to teach children to be prepared for the outside world and function productively in society. Therefore, keeping children contained in a classroom, which hinders their abilities, is not fair to the child. In order for inclusion and equity to be obtainable for special needs students technology needs to be acquired, input and output features need to be in place to ensure equal access, educators need to be aware and training, and students need to be ready for the real world. This is not to say that every piece of technology in schools needs to be equipped for special needs students but they need to be accessible. Educators need to be aware of what can be offered to students with special needs and be trained in how to apply accommodations to those students.  Schools as a whole as well as districts need to be active in curriculum development, resource allocations, and instruction. If special needs students are constricted to “their” classrooms throughout their entire education, they will not be ready for the real world after school. These children just like every other child need to be introduced to the real world. If they are unable to leave their classrooms, then the real world needs to be able to come to them in the classroom (Indicator: Special Needs Equity). 

==Conclusion==
There is no easy way to ensure equity in schools. Just as bridges are built to cross divides educators must make strides in removing the equity barrier in schools and education. While we continue in our struggle to bring equality to all we must keep in mind that we also need equity and treating all the same is not always fair. Until we find solutions the equity barrier will continue to effect race, gender, and special needs.

{{question-answer|question=Compare and contrast equity and equality? Does one hinder the other?
|answer=Equity and equality are both important for success in education. Equity is to provide fairness to all while equality provides sameness for all. While it is important for their to be likeness in all schools in regards to facilities, accessibility, and the quality of teachers, there also needs to be room for adjustment for every child. For example, it may be okay to demand students in a suburban school area to use a computer for most of their school work while in a home setting. However, if teaching in an inter-urban school with a large ethnic student body where statistics show that computers in the home setting are not accessible for the majority of your classroom you may have them use the school facilities in the classroom settings for computer work and have them complete other work which does not require a computer at home. This is providing both equity and equality for both schools but requiring different work is done at different times. It would not be right to say that equity or equality hinder one another but they do some times make solutions to certain race, gender, and special needs problems difficult to find. Equal is not always fair in the real world. While one person may only need to eat two pieces of pizza to feel full another person may only need one to feel the same fullness. One piece of pizza for each is equal but not fair because it deprives one person of feeling the same fullness as the other. The same applies to educational situations. The important thing is to find a happy medium, which provides every child with an equal and fair chance to succeed with their education so that they may enter into the real world fully equipped. 
----
Equity and equality are both important in the school systems.  All students need to be treated with equality.  This means that they have the same opportunities, the same education, and the same resources.  They also are treated the same by teachers and other people within the school systems.  This sameness is important so each child has the same potential and advantages.  Equity is important to provide each child fair treatment in school.  As we all know, some children require more support, training, resources, or help when learning.  Equity is the process of helping these students through special circumstances.  This allows the students to stay on track and on par with the rest of the class.  Some students may need special learning devices while others may just need tutors or other assistance.  No matter the situation, both are required to provide a stable and productive learning experience.  They work together to help children succeed.  Equality helps all children stay on the same track through school.  Then equity gives specific assistance to each child to help he or she stay with the group.  I believe that one could not work without the other.  If everyone got special measures but there was no equality, then some students would have an advantage other others.  Likewise, if everyone were treated equal, some students would fall behind because they needed additional help. &amp;mdash;Amber Frost}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is accountability a barrier to effective education?}}

One of the many barriers to education in America is accountability.  The ability to show other people that you are capable of doing what they expect you to be able to do is the basic definition of accountability.  While some positives may be found in the holding of teachers and schools accountable, it must be done in the right ways.  Unfortunately, we spend more time and resources on testing than we ought.  We also interrupt the teaching process with testing and test preparation.  Teachers are under an increasingly mounting burden and prospective teachers are dropping like flies.

==Why Accountability? Why Now?==
In the industrialized nation, the trend of business leans heavily on the quantitative measures of productivity.  In the United States, it has become something of an obsession.  The structuring and organizing of American business is based substantially on efficiency and accountability.  In recent years, we have seen not so much a spill over but a flood of these ideas into modern educational practices.  The U.S. is a nation in which it is important to be able to show RESULTS, and if those results cannot be seen, then a change is necessary.

==So They Have to Take a Test.  What's the Problem?==
The problem is that Americans care more about the testing and the results of the testing than about whether students have in fact absorbed the knowledge.   One major problem with using tests is the that form of the test is prejudiced toward those who have trouble taking tests.  The tests do not in any way take into account different learning styles.  The test assumes that all people simply learn by rote memorization.  Educators have known for years that this is the lowest level of the mental processes that involve learning.  The more effective learning styles are completely overlooked by standardized testing.  The other learning styles include:  verbal-linguistic, mathematical, spatial, kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic (Cooper, 2007).  Also, disabled students are required to be accountable for the same information as nondisabled students. (Thurlow, 2005).  The accommodations allowed by most states include only situational changes to the process of taking the test, not to the content of said evaluation.  This being said, a school with higher a than average special education population could be held to a standard that is unfair due to the discrepancy in the average intelligence of the students in the school.  Yet another problem in testing includes the fact that the test takes place in May with a month left to go in most of the schools.  Simple mathematics says that you still have one eighth of the school year left when you take the test.   In addition to the problems in testing, there are also true barriers to education caused by the testing craze.  There isn’t enough money in the school budgets to hire new teachers, but there is plenty of money to hire more proctors for the testing.  Because of this, schools have had to cut back on educational expenditures and increase their money spent on testing.  It has become about the test and not about the subject.  Virginia Beach City Public Schools has had to cut budgetary allowances for everything from technology and telecommunications to books and supplies and bus drivers (Virginia Beach City Public Schools, 2007).  However, the amount of money spent on testing has remained relatively constant.

==Parents Taking Control But Not Responsibility==
According to the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) web page, parents of students in schools that do not meet the required benchmarks will be allowed to enroll their children in an “alternative school of their choice” (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). The parents have the right to expect their child to be successful in education and the right to the resources to make that happen.  The NCLB puts a lot of accountability on the teachers and the schools to do well.  What Americans fail at with their talk of accountability is to put it where it belongs:  on every single person involved in the education of a child.  Start with the student.  Work your way up.  After the student, you have the parent, then the family, and then the community.  Only after all of these other groups, should accountability of the schools and the teachers be taken into account.  Without parental involvement, students are much more likely to fail at academics than with even a minimal amount of support from family.  Many families believe, as NCLB does, that the responsibility of education lay with those paid to do the job.  The teachers.   Some law makers are finally starting to realize the importance of parental participation and accountability with a bill designed to make it easier for parents to be involved by giving them time off to do so (Long, 2007).

==Accountability and Merit PAY==
{{Rquote|right|A gifted teacher is as rare as a gifted doctor, and makes far less money.|Author unknown}}

Over the years, the phrase merit pay has become something of a four letter word in many educational circles.  Merit pay is the idea that, as an educator, if you are good at your job you should make more money.  If you are not good at your job, you should be held accountable for your failures.  There are many problems with this idea.  What happens to a teacher who works in an inner-city school with students who have no desire to do well and no reason, as they see it, to try?  What happens to the teacher in a situation where the students realize the power they have over that teacher's life?  The problem is, the system of accountability is too objective to work for something needing so subjective an evaluation.

==Conclusions==
In conclusion, there are many ways in which accountability can be a barrier to education.  When Americans allow bureaucracy to get in the way of education, when testing and evaluation takes precedence over instruction, and when it is placed on too few people and/or organizations, accountability can become a burden instead of a tool.  With the right implementation, students, parents, and educators can work together to achieve higher levels of learning. However, with even one of the legs of this table not being strong and able to the task, the whole will fail.

{{question-answer|question=Due to the narrow nature of standardized testing there are many ways in which students can feel that they have been cheated by the system.  Some students, though they are very intelligent and know the material, have a great deal of difficulty in taking tests.  Why is a standardized test part of the educational process?
|answer=Outside of academia many people must continue to write essays, solve math problems, and give speeches but very few continue on to complete more standardized test.  Many teaching courses involve the latest buzz word for the day: “Differentiation.” They ask all teachers to differentiate by learning styles using the Say, See, and Do.  However the testing for these classes are still without any differentiation.  The problem with this is that students aren’t fairly evaluated and therefore teachers are not fairly evaluated in turn.  Without fair evaluation you can’t have accountability of teachers because you don’t have adequate testing of students.  Teachers spend a lot of time because of this attempting to teach how to take tests rather than teaching the subject they are paid to teach.  Teachers do not have enough time to spend this much on testing and how to take tests.  Teachers need the freedom to teach in exciting and envelope-pushing ways.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How do we discipline?}}

Working with students for the past several years has raised many questions when it comes to discipline.  Now only a year away from becoming a licensed teacher and with classroom experience in hand I begin to wonder what my main concern will be.  Is it actually the discipline or how the classroom is run that brings on the issues of discipline?  Discipline as defined in Webster’s Dictionary is &quot;field of learning, training, and conditioning to produce obedience and self-control, as a result of punishment...”  We are teaching and training our students and yes, we expect that our rules and codes of conduct produce obedience and self-control.  But are the punishments that go with discipline really effective. Therefore, the question that I must determine as a teacher is what techniques and skills must I research and  need to know in order to keep my classroom under control?  

== What Makes Discipline Difficult ==
The two most important issues are the lack of support from the school administration and parents.  Jim Garbarino, a Cornell University Professor and author of Raising Children in a Socially Toxic Environment states&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that there’s a feeling among educators that “erosion of adult authority” in today’s society makes it much more difficult for teachers and other educators to do their job.  It seems that teachers have to make and establish their own rule of authority because parents and adult figures are not teaching the traditional cultural foundations for the students to build on.   When parents depend on the teacher and the administration to handle discipline with no backing from them, the students are more likely to continue bad behavior and challenge the teachers.  We all know that students should know the basic concepts of respect and self-control, but when it is not taught or modeled in their home environment, then the training of good behavior becomes the teachers’ responsibility on top of the teaching process.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
 The National Education Association is a great link to for reviewing discipline issues and many other topics.  The greatest thing about reading this is that you begin to find out good teachers, think alike.  When you read you will see that you have probably already been using many of the techniques.[http://www.nea.org]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

A non-supportive school administration will make it very hard to establish a strong and effective classroom management plan.  It really is pointless to send a disruptive student to the office, to only have them back in your classroom ten minutes later.  As a teacher you should make your classroom management plan very clear to your principal and other school officials that would handle discipline issues.  Let them know what you expect from your students and help them to understand your technique of running the classroom.  Be sure they are willing to support your beliefs and know that they will follow through should they be needed. 

== What Works ==
Classroom management is important. If you have your classroom strategies down in writing, are consistent in following them and make sure you always have more planned than not enough, then your students will be less likely to find time to cause disruptions.  From the start of the first day of school and for the entire school year, you must take control of your classroom.  Students, parents, and your administration should know right from the start where you stand on running your classroom.  

There are many styles and techniques used in classroom management and each individual teacher must set their own procedures, routines, goals and values. Strong techniques that are win-win situations and based on simple principles of organization and cooperative learning include:

=== Always have Lesson Plans Ready ===
By being prepared and having things ready the night before gives the teacher a stronger hand on being able to be available to the
students and parents as soon as they walk in the door every morning. Why could this work?
* Students can be greeted every day the same way.
* The teacher will beware of which student is in a good mood or bad mood. This will mentally prepare the teacher for the situations to come.
* Students are on task with the classroom objectives for the day and everyday.

=== Develop Monthly Learning Groups ===
Each group developed for the month, work each assignment as a team.  They are responsible to complete the daily objectives and projects as a group.  Each group has a rubric to follow that is based on points that covers cooperation, behavior and objectives. A group cooperative certificate is issued for the most successful group of the month and a teacher luncheon is earned.  This way of classroom management could work because:
* Students learn to work together as a team.
* Students get to learn different cultural styles and beliefs.
* Having a group focus channels excess energy into productive learning as a group because of the responsibly level of each team member.
* Different levels of strengths and weaknesses help them learn to work new strategies to get the work done.
* Positive peer pressure to accomplish the group goals by following the rubric is very strong.
* Student’s work harder to earn the end of the month reward.
This style of learning is discussed in-depth through the “Kagan Style of Cooperative Learning”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; but the key to group learning would be the sense of accomplishments and responsibility that each student shares by helping others in areas they are not strong in.  And lastly, it would give the teacher a stronger handle on the sure of harder to handle students.  Regrouping the students on a monthly basis will also build stronger control for designing groups that will help different students at different levels.

=== Parent Communication ===
Just as students and administration need to know your classroom management techniques, so do parents.  If you want parents to support you and any possible discipline issues that may arise then they need to know what your expectations are.  You can do this by:
* Going over and sharing expectations, procedures, routines and style during open house.
* Develop a parent, student, teacher contract that will be given out the first day of school.  This needs to be signed by all parties.
* Develop a classroom newsletter that keeps parents informed of what is happening.
* Design a website so parents can contact you.
* Offer a monthly family night get together but fun and educational.
* Offer a parent tutoring night – teach the parents what students are learning.
* Be available to the parents.

== One on One Discipline Techniques ==
Although, classroom management might one key to running a well-organized class, there will be discipline issues that need to be addressed.  How to handle different situations are challenged everyday for example, Thomas Gordon, creator of Teacher Effectiveness Training did not agree with Canter’s Assertive Discipline Concept.  But, both techniques have been effective in different ways because no two students are alike and each student needed to be handled in a different manner. 

Many techniques will be learned strategies that you as a teacher will develop as you become more versed at teaching. But I also believe that based on your values and ethics in the classroom and possibly your parenting skills all of these will play a key role on how certain discipline situations will be handled.  Here is a list of some positive discipline techniques, some learned from my readings and some developed through experience.

;Remind, Don't Scold
:Redirect, with a reminder to what is at task.  This can be done as a whole class or on the individual level.
:Group example:  “Class the bell has rung, you should be in your groups working on your journal entry.”
:Individual example: &quot;Mary, please redirect your attention to the front of the room.&quot;

;Tattle Tale Can
:This is the most annoying issue in the classroom.  Use redirection.
:Example:  First, ask the student if the person involved is actually injured or needs assistance, if no, then direct the student to write down the problem and put it into a can.  At the end of the day ask anyone if they have any issues.  Most of the time the issue has been forgotten. 
:Just in case it has not - Tell the students involved you would like to have a conference.  Set it up during recess for no more than 5 minutes.  Let the students involved discuss the problem and only offer suggestions that are considered right choices for both of them.

;Hand Signals
:Make the student aware that you know that a wrong choice is being made through a specific hand gesture.
:Example:  Mark is sitting sideways in his chair playing with Maria’s paper on Maria’s desk.  You quietly look at him and touch your nose so that he knows you need him back on task.

;Don't Threaten or Argue
:Be firm on what is expected.  Ask them what the right choice is based on the classroom policy.

;Praise, Praise, Praise
:Make sure that this very important technique is positively incorporated into your classroom.
:Praise is every student’s ultimate goal — make the teacher happy!

;Plan, Plan, Plan
:Over planning will keep the students busy.
:If you do find yourself in a downtime.  Turn it into a quick regrouping game: (this example is based on that the class knows &quot;Regroup Time&quot; and what the reward is for participating.)
:Example:  Have a group of boxes with different subjects available--they can have basic SOL Questions in them.  Call out &quot;Regroup&quot;, each group leader will run to the boxes and grab one. Once back at their table the teacher will ask one group to ask another group a question from the box.  The group asked will have 10 seconds to answer the question.  If correct they win a group point.

Again, There are so many wonderful techniques that can be used and discussed but the most important thing to remember is do they work for you, is it right for the student, and will it work in the classroom.  Trial and error makes for a some day-harmonized classroom.  

== Conclusion ==
There will always be students and situations that need to be corrected but I do believe that if we run a well managed classroom that is supported by the school administration, and parents, then the classroom will cooperate and run more smoothly.    Most importantly by building your curriculum and classroom structure based on goals, routines, procedures and the cooperative learning concept the discipline issues will be minimal and your classroom will be an enjoyable environment where the students want to learn and have fun learning.

{{question-answer|question=Do you feel that a well organized classroom helps with discipline within the classroom?
|answer=Definitely, I strongly believe that if a teacher is well prepared they will have a better handle on their classroom. I know that we all feel that students should already be taught how to behave in the classroom and outside of the classroom, but reality is, a lot of students are not.  Society has changed so drastically that home values have changed also.  Parents are working two or three jobs and don't have time to deal with their children. &quot;Sad but true.&quot; Grandparents are raising many children and they might not have time for them.  Children have to become more street smart to get through issues in their life.  They might need to figure out how to deal with an issue by themselves, and it might not be what we would consider a good choice.  Without a role model to get goals and values on the outside the child will have a hard time inside the classroom.  So not only does the teacher have to teach the standards she know has to teach what is right from wrong.  And this can only be done if the teacher has laid out a plan that will be followed and maintained with consistency. 

By being proactive prior to and before the students enter your classroom you can grasp a situation at the beginning and head off a disaster. If the parents, students and administration are aware of your values, polices, and procedures from the beginning you have met the first criteria of being organized.  Why, because you have explained your guidelines and if you maintain consistency throughout the year and do not fray from them you always have a strong case when an issue does arrive.  Following through with your guidelines, consistently, in the same manner will also be head off any issues.  You must treat everyone in the same manner. 

Being prepared a head of time will always ensure that you have enough planned to keep the class busy and keep them on task.  I am not saying that the students need to consistently be working on work, you can add in “Fun Time.”  That is also part of being prepared, you want your students to enjoy learning so it never hurts to use humor and play games with the students.  There are so many educational ways to have fun and the students don’t even realize they are learning.  The most important thing is that you are prepared and have enough for the students to do that will keep them busy and learning.

Effective classroom organization is required for successful teaching.  While many students, parents, and those not in the teaching profession might think a teacher’s expertise in content knowledge, presentation skills, or years of experience in the classroom are the only talents of importance, educators know they are not.  The ability to develop an organized classroom is detrimental to properly manage student behavior, and thus, classroom discipline.

When developing an organization plan, teachers must take the time to carefully think about and fine-tune it so it compliments their style of management.  Since not all teachers are alike, not all organizational plans will be alike.  Teachers should organize the classroom so that rules and consequences are clear and understood by all.  Like anything else, this plan should reflect the teacher’s own beliefs so that he/she enforces it with confidence.  Managing discipline by organization should begin at the elementary level so that students learn early on what is or is not acceptable behavior, and the benefits of following school rules

While an organized classroom will help certainly help curtail disciplinary problems, it will not totally eliminate them.  Teachers must still be knowledgeable about types of student behavior and the techniques available to discipline behavior not curtailed by organization skills. &amp;mdash;Robyn George
----
A well organized classroom is very important in order for discipline and growth and development in the classroom.  Students need discipline in the classroom, and with organization this is possible.  Children do not like surprises, and when their daily routine is all upset, children cannot concentrate as well.

I strongly believe that a well disciplined classroom is important when it comes to disciplining a child.  The teacher should have a daily routine, and should also have a plan that allows the student to follow a routine, so they do not feel as if they are stressed.  Children love it when they can feel like they have opportunities in the classroom to excel, but they also need boundaries.  With having the classroom disciplined it allows the child to feel as if they can accomplish more.

The classroom must also be organized for effective teaching.  In order for a student to be able to learn and for the teacher to be able to teach their lesson for the day, there must be discipline.

An organized classroom does not essentially eliminate all behavioral problems; it certainly eliminates some of them.  A well organized classroom allows for the students to grow and excel, not only as a student, but a child as well. &amp;mdash;Cassie Prater
----
I do believe that a well organized classroom helps control discipline in the classroom.  All classrooms need to be organized because all students need to have a since of being controlled so that they will not try to control the classroom.  A classroom that is unorganized causes the students to be unorganized and can cause alot of confusion in the classroom.  A disciplined classroom is great because it minimizes the distractions that will interupt the class and it nips alot of behavioral issues.  A well disciplined classroom is needed in order to have a peaceful learning environment.  If there was no discipline in the classrooms then the students would run all over the teacher and they would not learn anything.  

A organized classroom means that the teachers have to plan before the students get there and know how they want the classroom to be ran.  If the teacher is organized the students will be organized.  If all of the rules are understood at the beginning of the school year and all the expectations are understood then there should be no problem with discipline in this classroom. &amp;mdash;Sharnell Simpson}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Are teachers isolated?}}

Teachers across the country are being heavily recruited by numerous school systems. Programs such as Teach America are striving to bring young teachers into some of the worst school environments in the country, meanwhile other school systems are offering big money to bring in the right kind of talent. Regardless of where a teacher may land, their goal remains the same. To teach. In many cases teachers are met with budget cutbacks and a school system filled bureaucracy, teaching is not just a simple act anymore. With the numerous teaching positions available, teachers simply move on to another district or another school when things turn sour. While there are numerous reasons for teachers to move on, teacher isolation is a major concern. If the education system in America is ever to be turned around then the retention rate of teachers must be improved and decreasing isolation is a key to this happening. Teachers often find themselves isolated from others, isolation can occur because of numerous factors. These factors include: Race, gender, grade level being taught, etc. But what exactly is isolation?

==Isolation==
Isolation is &quot;the process of separating somebody or something from others, or the fact of being alone and separated from others&quot; Besides the obvious social causes of isolation (race, gender, age etc..), isolation can also come from work related issues as well. In California alone 22% of teachers left after their first four years in the classroom (Futernick). In the poorer schools, ten percent of teachers transfer to other schools each year. There are numerous factors that can lead to isolation, one being the overwhelming responsibilities that new teachers often face. New teachers are faced with an entirely new faculty, a new school bureaucracy, and pressures to teach a curriculum entirely based on standardized testing (SOLS), not to mention the pressure from parents. All these factors can cause a new teacher to feel extremely overwhelmed and quickly lose faith in the education process. While isolation can occur at any level of work experience, it is the new teachers that are extremely susceptible to this, as they feel that they are the only teachers suffering through this. The 22% that leave after four years prove just how harsh the first years of an educational job can be.  One of the major causes of stress for new teachers is finding a successful combination of what they feel is important while maintaining the correct SOL-based content in order for their students to pass the standardized testing standards created by the No Child Left Behind Act.

==No Child Left Behind, Teaching to the Test==
No Child Left behind was intended to raise the quality of education in the United States. The policy installed new tests and education requirements for new teachers. In order to access and then raise the bar the government mandated standardized testing for all students. If the school improved then federal money is made available to the school district. However, if schools fail to meet the national standards for two years in a row, then it must give the students the option to transfer to another school. Obviously the decision is a fairly easy one for school systems and that is to prepare the students for the standardized tests. The overall success of this program is disputed. The government states that nine year olds have improved their reading level more in the past five years then the previous twenty eight years (www.ed.gov). In addition, a recent report shows that math skills are also improving on elementary age children. There have been some concern with the equality of testing. Individual states develop the test for their schools. If their scores fall below national benchmarks then they could simply alter the tests in hopes of improving scores. New teachers often come in ready to change the world however they are met with a thick line of red tape and instructions on what and what not to teach. In order for teachers both new and old to combat isolation they must network with each other on a very small and a very large scale.

==Coworkers and Mentors==
A key to combating isolation is to bond with the  fellow coworkers. Granted, the human factor will keep all teachers from getting along together. Teachers share a lot in common and for the new teachers they can be a great source of knowledge and guidance. While at work, teachers can lean on each other for help and support, outside of work teachers can talk about their days and their frustration. Just talking to someone who knows what you are going through is a great way to relieve stress and lessen the feeling of isolation. On a national scale, teachers have large support groups and unions.  Mentoring is quickly becoming the preferred method of combating isolation, as there is no additional cost to the school and the program promotes faculty unity (Heider 2005).  In many schools in the Virginia Beach district have developed a Buddy System, though there is no official designation, where teachers are paired up with other teachers in their grade level.  The teachers who have been paired up have scheduled that parallel each other, which allows the teachers to have time during Recess, Physical Education and Lunch to discuss matters with each other.

==The Buddy System==
Other ways the Buddy System has come into play within the schools are New Teacher Support Programs.  Schools are realizing how important it is to support new teacher's by giving them access to veteran teacher's within the school.  They are able to go and ask questions, seek guidance and meet in discussion groups to help them cope with the isolation that so many teachers feel today.  There is a &quot;Sink or Swim&quot; (Moir) momentum that many school systems are trying to change. &quot;New teacher support programs improve retention and teaching simultaneously&quot;.(Moir) Veteran teachers and administrators have come to realize that &quot;teachers need the opportunity to think and talk with each other on a sustained basis about the day-to-day life of the classrooms.  They need to investigate and analyze questions that feel urgent, troubling, exciting, useful, or in some other way consequential to them, given the circumstances of their individual schools and students.  Serious conversation about shared work is always a powerful resource for the people doing the work&quot;.(Barnes) Like other professions such as Doctors and Lawyers who have the benefit of a work force that collaborates, teachers need the same support for their field as well.  Without it, the isolation of the classroom can become the end of a teachers career.  

==Unions==
Unions offer teachers with a great source of news and information about issues that matter most to teachers. These unions hope to gain enough force to actually influence legislation bot on the local and national level. The National Education Association (NEA) is one of these groups. The NEA is composed of employees from all across the country and range from preschool right on up to the collegiate level. The group pushes for increased education funding, tax cuts for teachers as well as student issues such as a decrease in the interest rate for subsidized college loans[http://www.nea.org/lac/success.html]. The education unions have pushed for increased and equal pay rates for teachers, as well as defended teachers who may have found themselves fired or otherwise incriminated. These unions are meant well and can provide a lifeline to teachers in their darkest hours. But these unions in fact make it harder for many teachers to succeed.

==The Problems with Unions==
{{Rquote|right|But to complain about teachers being underpaid without addressing the issue of merit pay is like staring down the barrel of a gun and fretting about being pistol-whipped. To the teachers unions credit they have obscured the issue such that it’s wrongly about schools not having enough money, or more laughably, New York Times op-eds about how society doesn’t value teachers. Society values teachers quite a bit. They just wisely choose not to value them all equally.|Mark Hemmingway}}
Unions have pushed for equal pay across the board, of course this depends on level of education, and years of experience but outside of that the pay is fairly equal. The education system completely ignores the merit system, where what a person earns depends on how they perform. &quot;This is because unions insist on uniform pay for all teachers regardless of ability. Teaching is not an assembly line where workers come in shifts and are interchangeable. It is a highly specialized profession that requires tremendous adaptability. And more than that, it is far too important a job to pretend that educators are all equal&quot; (Hemmingway). Granted, teaching often depends on students. If a teacher is blessed with an extremely bright group of students then they could like a fantastic teacher without teaching. Reversely a teacher could work their tale off with a difficult group of kids and look like a failure. The issue of merit pay is extremely controversial, however the fact is that the pay grades are so set in stone that a brilliant teacher could find themselves making the same amount as their less qualified coworkers.
{{clear}}
==Conclusion==
Combating isolation is a fundamental challenge for all teachers, but most importantly new ones. Though there are a few ways to combat isolation, the most effective method eschews the different Teacher Unions and looks to coworkers to form important peer bonds with which to build a solid network of assistance (Heider 2005).  However, it is ultimately the teacher in question  to look for this assistance, as networking and peer systems only work when those involved work with the system, and not against it.  Teaching is a difficult profession, and were the teacher in it for the money they would fail in the end as the drive to break the bonds of isolation and the desire to balance the stress in order to reach the students would not be great enough.  Other teachers understand this, and are willing to help anyone who wishes to join them in their quest to educate today's youth.  New teachers need only ask for the assistance and be willing to listen.

{{question-answer|question=Are the standardized tests in place by No Child Left Behind proven to be a legitimate measure of intelligence and has No Child Left Behind actually hindered the education goals teacher and do you believe teachers are now forced to simply &quot;teach by the test&quot;?
|answer=No Child left behind has proven that it has raised the education levels of students particularly in the elementary level, this is a great sign for our education system however it has in fact come at a cost, especially for teachers. First off, one must ask how well does a standardized test measure ones intelligence. For years the SAT was a staple for measuring ones intelligence, it was a tool that aided colleges in selecting the best qualified students. However after years of the SAT remaining largely unchanged the board finally decided to add a essay section. Apparently, answering multiple choice questions was no longer an accurate way to measure ones intelligence. Who is to say that the same won't happen to the current standardized tests in place to measure the intelligence of our students. Since states are allowed to modify the tests, then it is impossible to actually say the statistics are accurate.
The role of teachers has also dramatically changed since the creation of No Child Left Behind. No longer are teachers simply allowed the freedom to teach in public schools like they once did, they must to a certain extent teach what is on the test. In subjects such as mathematics, teaching to the test can be fairly simple however in the case of history where there is so much too cover the teacher may find themselves confined to certain areas. Over
----
I believe that the standardized tests are misleading, in that the tests only measure how much information the student can regurgitate.  After observing SOL-based instruction (in preparation for the tests) I noticed that only a small portion of topics were covered, as additional information was deemed extravagant and ultimately not efficient for testing purposes.  While topics were covered, such as the Water Cycle and the Civil War, the information taught was rather topical and not very educational, since giving additional information didn't allow the teacher to cover more topics.  

Furthermore, I believe that the No Child Left Behind Act has caused a bulk of the problem, as the schools are credited by way of test scores...and the only way for the teachers to effectively obtain consistently high test scores is to mold their lesson plan around the standardized tests.  Essentially, NCLB has taken the power away from the teacher to teach effectively, and instead given the teachers a quota to reach.  Children now are less students and more a statistic for the state and local governments.

The NCLB, Standardized Tests and the ensuing Educational Goals set forth by the NCLB and Standardized Tests were a start in the right direction, but the journey to the goal is supposed to be more important than the goal itself. &amp;mdash;John Sansone}}

When organizing a successful classroom, student dynamics is one of the most important key element to factor into the classroom equation.  This process is extremely difficult due to the wide variety of learners in the student pool.  First time teachers are faced with differences in culture, race, gender, social class, advanced students, inclusion students, physically disabled, and the list continues to mind boggling proportions.  There are educators that support “solutions” to the problems in student dynamics such as separating the genders, advanced classes, and isolating student economic factors.  These attempts have been made, but the dynamic factors still remained as a top element in the structure and maintenance of the classroom, and its impact on learning.    

The different dynamics of a classroom are in a constant state of flux.  A teacher, be it a first year teacher or a thirty year teacher, cannot predict the student dynamics of a classroom before entering it.  When a classroom is finally set up to the teacher’s liking there are always the unexpected factors that occur.  Some of these factors come in the form of new students, student social change, loosing students, and mental state of the student.  Each new change creates an entirely new dynamic structure which needs to be dealt with in a manner of understanding and acceptance.  “Frustration, misapprehensions, and inter-cultural conflict are a more likely outcome if teachers do not deal with diversity in a sensitive manner” (Roux 2001).  Each individual that enters the classroom brings their own personality and preconceptions of other dynamics.

==Dangers Of Stereotyping Students==
Society’s preconceptions are mired with stereotyping, and pre-judging students in regards to their race, gender, and social class.  Stereotyping can occur from the students as well as from the school professionals.  It is the classroom teacher’s job to make sure that these influences do not manifest themselves in the classroom so as to foster a more ideal learning environment.  “Studies that focus on the dynamics of classroom interaction report that teachers discriminate against students who are not white, male, and middle class” (Garcia 1984).  These discriminations are not based on a prejudice of race or gender, but rather it is based on low education expectations due to preconceived stereotypes.  Society is pushing towards the norm of a white male middle class.  Any student that does not fit this description are sometimes considered as an unfavorable element in the classroom.

To escape this trend, educators need to remain open minded towards each of their students.  The students entire personal makeup needs to be considered.  Educators would not consider a Mennonite or an Amish child being as disadvantaged as a child from a poor home.  Both types of students may be coping without the middle class necessities, such as electricity, but it is the poor child that will be held in a prejudged contempt by certain sectors of society.  “Through my experience, many educators cannot cope with the idea that students exist without running water and/or electricity in their homes.  Some teachers think that there is no reason to make a child live without these necessities.  They do not take into consideration that this is a free country and people can choose to live the way that they want to, but it seems that middle class standards are the main standard of comparison towards their students in schools today” (Griffin 2002).  

Educators need to take steps in understanding the whole student, so that preconceived stereotypes can be replaced by an understanding of each students unique social position.  Not all students have a bed or a table in their house and not all have a parental figure in the home for many hours of the day, but society has a preconceived notion that this is common place in every American household.  The economic status of a student needs to be considered when examining the classroom dynamics and its learning structure.  “After the influence of the family, researcher James Coleman concluded 40 years ago, the single most important factor determining student achievement is the socioeconomic status of the school a child attends. In a large-scale government-sponsored study, Coleman found that all children do better in middle-class schools—whatever the schools’ racial makeup“ (Kahlenberg 2006).  Classroom discrimination does not end with the economic status of a student,  but extends to their race, religion, academic abilities, and countless other differentiating factors.  

==Fostering Educational Growth In Students==
If a student does not receive the proper guidance and mentoring,  then the student may never desire to succeed at their education.  The proper mixture of dynamics in the classroom is essential to instill and foster educational growth among all types of learners.  Without this influential mixture from other culture, gender, and  social classes the student body as a whole would suffer. Each dynamic has value to offer to the other dynamics.  Embracing a diverse classroom helps educators to avoid furthering ethnocentrism.  “Most humans by choice or necessity seek out others who feel, think, and believe as they do, especially for intimate social and personal relationships” (Garcia).  It is ethnocentrism that has given educators the issues of clicks.  Clicks can be applied to any group or tight knit unit of people who have a common bond due to a shared dynamic.  Breaking down the barriers erected by clicks is hard, but it is necessary to create a diverse yet conductive educational atmosphere for all students.

==Gender Separation==
Some educators consider mixing the genders in the classroom to be the strongest area of concern.  Males and females are treated differently even if on a subconscious level.  Often, educators can be quoted with statements such as “He’s hyper because boys will be boys” or “She’s quiet because girls are shy and withdrawn”.  These labels have been applied consistently by society, even if unconsciously, and these labels have long-term effects on students outside of the classroom.  “The negative messages teachers imply can have several effects on female students. When combined with social influences, they can lead female students to expect less of their abilities, whereas; beginning in middle school, male students begin to show a higher self-confidence in their intellectual and career abilities” (Barnett 1991).

These factors have led some education institutions to separate the genders into different classrooms and in some cases into different schools.  This is not a new concept as it has been used by many private schools throughout educational history.  Can this concept work in the classroom and be conductive towards educational goals?  Some preliminary research seems to support separating the genders in the public education sectors.  Starting in 1999 the Jefferson Leadership Academies (Long Beach, Los Angeles) became the first public middle school in the country to offer separate classes for boys and girls. Educators found that girls started to have more self-confidence in the classroom, while boys started to have less negative in-class behaviors.  “Student grade point averages for students who had previously attended Jefferson in either grades 6 or 7 increased for all students, male and female, in both grades 7 and 8 under the single gender academy configuration” (Sharpe 2000). 

Keeping the genders together is also seen as a necessary component in the development of young learners.  Students need to develop their adaptive learning and behaviors in a wide variety of situations that they will eventually face in the adult world.  Development of these skills begin at home, but are supported in the education environments.  Separating the genders may lead to a deficiency in these skills.  “Some programs that are based on social and emotional learning theories show great promise in providing a solid foundation of social skills aimed at helping children to cope with many challenges in their lives” (Elias 1995).  The educator needs to balance both academics with social and emotional development.  This is considered by many as the wider range of responsibility for educators towards their students.  Middle school children seem especially prone to experiencing difficulties in these areas of gender relationships.  This may be due to the onset of puberty.  Some schools of thought centers on the idea that gender separation should occur only during the middle school years, while others maintain that any separation is detrimental to the development of the student.  

==Advanced Learners In The Classroom==
Separating the students do not stop at gender and economics, but also delves into the realm of academics.  One particular aspect of academics that needs to be examined is in regards to the advanced learners of society.  There are some educators that maintain having a strong mixture of higher and lower functioning academic students in the same classroom is necessary.  This stance is based on the belief that the lower functioning students will benefit and advance to higher standards by being in the same environment as an advanced learner.  This is also considered important for the socialization development of the advanced learners.

The need then turns to creating an environment that will foster ideal learning for all academic levels in the classroom.  Recent emphasis has been placed on “No Child Left Behind Programs,” but this may be hurting our more advanced learners by not challenging them enough in the regular classroom.  “Unfortunately, instruction in the regular classroom setting is generally not tailored to meet their unique needs.  This situation is putting gifted students at risk of failing to achieve their potential.  Achievement scores are below what might be expected from our brightest population provide the evidence”  (Archambault, Brown, Emmons, Hallmark, Westberg &amp; Zhang 1993).

Regular classroom instruction may be failing our advanced learners, but it is our new generation genius’s that may be suffering academically the most.  When considering this possibility, one has to consider if the child is gifted or truly at genius level.  One way that the public school systems have helped genius level students in the past have been separate education programs, skipping grades, or helping students to advance to college when and if appropriate.  Not every school system adheres to these methods however.  One reported case in Longview, Texas involved a fourteen-year-old girl who was comfortably above an IQ of 145.  “Many school systems are wary of grade skipping even though research shows that it usually works well both academically and socially for gifted students--and that holding them back can lead to isolation and under-achievement” (Cloud 2007).  The school system was apprehensive of skipping her in grades even though she was performing about three grade levels higher than her peers.  The hesitation stems from the educational need to support social and maturity growth.

==Conclusion==
Educators need to set up classrooms that are innovative to every aspect of the learning dynamics.  Some of the education processes that have been tried and true in the past may now be defunct.  Classroom teachers need to be not only versatile in their application methods, but also at being open minded to extreme differences in the student dynamics.  School systems need to make preliminary changes, but the implementation of these changes have to occur with the classroom teacher.  Society also needs to allow for these changes to occur, but this acceptance depends upon society’s need to let go of preconceived stereotypes.  “If we tend to teach as we were taught, and if society resists school change, then how can teachers make significant classroom innovations” (Hunter 1977).  It has been a long process to reach all dynamics of the student population but the process is far from complete.  Student dynamics does impact learning and it will be up to dedicated teachers to try and reach every student that enters their classroom.

{{question-answer|question=If faced with the challenge of implementing an innovative learning environment within a classroom, how would you utilize your teaching techniques so that the curriculum reaches all learners from all dynamics? 
|answer=If faced with the challenge of organizing a classroom to provide for a varying degree of learners, I would formulate a plan that would be flexible for student dynamic changes.  Setting up the classroom would require about a two-week teacher learning curve, stations for advanced and remedial work, and a consistent classroom management plan.  Utilizing these methods would enable me to offer academic assistance to both advancing and struggling students.    

During the first two weeks, I would have to make heavy observations over an in depth academic structure.  Using the observations I could enrich the dynamics of my classroom. Early observations can help you to adjust to ideal seating, identifying leaders, and pinpointing problem areas in the classroom and/or teaching style.  

After the initial classroom organization is complete, a more in depth academic system can begin.  To compliment my teaching method, I would set up stations for my students to work at.  Stations can include advanced and remedial work.  If the station is set up correctly, a student can progress at their own pace without being labeled by fellow classmates.  Using programs on the computer is an excellent idea for the operation of a workstation.  Other types of workstations can be introduced and it is always good to include hands on stations for the tactile learners.

Finally, consistent classroom management plans need to be used so that clear expectations are understood from the first day of class.  Give a syllabus on the curriculum and student expectations for the course.  If a student clearly understands what is expected and tolerated, then there will be less student opposition towards the classroom teacher.

No one plan is ever complete due to the constant change in student dynamics.  It is up to the classroom teacher to be constantly vigilant in observations while implementing a challenging curriculum.  If these observations lead to minute changes in your teaching strategies, then you know that you are effectively engaging your classroom dynamics.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the role of motivation?}}
{{Rquote|right|Instruction does much, but encouragement does everything.|Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe}}

Teaching is one of the most important professions today.  An individual’s education is an essential part of his or her life, that can help shape their outlook on their future.  In today’s classroom, keeping children motivated is a main concern for educators.  The curiosity and aspiration of students to learn can result from different instructional strategies and various factors in and outside the classroom setting.  Teachers should keep in mind that making a positive impact and helping to mold a child’s future is a huge responsibility.  
          
==Categories of Motivation==
Motivation stimulates the interest of students and inspires them to take part in classroom activities.  There are two categories which educators should be familiar with during their teaching process.  Intrinsic motivation comes from within individuals, often from the enjoyment for personal goals they have set for themselves.  Students with intrinsic motivation are more likely to be excited about completing their assignments for the challenge, and not for any type of incentive.  Extrinsic comes from students who are encouraged by rewards, such as stickers, candy, recess or extra credit.  Even though intrinsic strategies are most often recommended, teachers should keep in mind that they should build upon both types of motivation in order to achieve the most success .(Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).  
          
==Instructional Strategies==
A child’s desire to learn seems to get smaller as they grow older.  There are a variety of strategies that a teacher can utilize to help his or her student’s stay motivated.  Assignments should be challenging, but not so difficult that the student will not be able to achieve completion (Lumsden, 1994).   In order to avoid being overwhelmed and discouraged, a large task could be broken down into smaller assignments (Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).  When assigning a task, instructors should remember to verbally state the purpose (Lumsden, 1994).  Expectations need to be clear, with examples of low, average, and high level work (Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).  One should often provide instruction which is self-paced and allow students various choices for assignments (Fisher, 2003).  Children need to realize that there are often many times when there is more than one right answer (Theroux, 1994).  It is also important for teachers to show their class how certain skills can relate to their lives outside of the classroom (Lumsden, 1994).  They should be able to make connections and feel that their work is valuable.  

===Project Based Learning===
Project-based learning could be incorporated into the curriculum to allow students to share new knowledge with their classmates.  A driving question would be asked to make the children wonder and want to participate.  Teamwork and problem-solving could provide students with more than a regular lecture (Fisher, 2003).  If a teacher used technology in his or her classroom, then different computer programs could present information in an attractive and interesting way.  Individuals would also be able to use the computers to complete a project and have pride in their finished product (Theroux, 1994).  
          
Another strategy an educator could consider would be the attribution retraining process.  Practice exercises, socialization, and providing models can help discouraged individuals want to learn.  It would be beneficial to instruct students to retrace their steps to find mistakes instead of giving into the thought of failure (Lumsden, 1994).  In addition to the attribution retraining process, evaluations could be given after assignments are completed.  Such feedback needs to be clear.  Educators who keep in mind a child’s “basic psychological and intellectual needs” have been noted to be the most successful (Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).  Any one strategy may not be suitable for the classroom as a whole.  Individual students are motivated and learn in different ways and paces.  Therefore, teachers need to realize that their strategies may have to be changed frequently to meet each student’s needs.  

==Factors Affecting Motivation==       
Educators should also be aware that there are other factors which can affect a student’s motivation.  The classroom environment plays a large role in one’s learning.  It is said to develop the initial attitudes that students have toward their educational career, the classroom should have an atmosphere that acknowledges the differences of individual students.  Teachers need to create a climate where their class feels a sense of belonging (Lumsden, 1994).  According to Allison Heath, a teacher in Prince George County, Virginia, “respect should be a two way street . . . if a student feels valued, then they are more than likely to be more motivated to take part in class activities” (personal communication, September 17, 2006).  With respect established, meaningful relationships can be formed to possibly result in the student feeling a connection with their school.  Teacher’s beliefs and understandings are other factors which affect the motivational atmosphere (Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).  Ms. Heath goes on to say that “as a teacher, I think it is important to make sure that my students know what expectations I have of them,” during the course of the year (personal communication, September 17, 2006).  By talking to students individually, eagerly answering questions, and frequently incorporating students' thoughts into the lesson, teachers can encourage his/her students' motivation (Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).

===Home Environment===     
Instructors should also be aware of how each student’s home environment can limit motivation.  The level of parental control has been associated with the level of achievement within a child’s classroom (Fisher, 2003).  Especially in today’s society, many parents seem to be involved in their job and do not have time to talk about their child’s school day or help them with homework.  Unfortunately, some children come from abusive or low income families and their classroom is their only source of comfort or belonging.  Former science teacher, Joyce C. Specter, noted the importance of current teachers having an open mind about the circumstances some students may be dealing with at home.  She found that she “needed to let them know that they were an important part of [her] life, since [she] could possibly be their only positive role model” (personal communication, September 16, 2006).  It is critical for teachers to try to involove parents in order to help them create or sustain the student’s motivation to participate in the learning process (Lumsden, 1994).

==Genders==
Genders can also effect motivation. Research suggests that boys receive more negative teacher feedback concerning failure to follow directions, whereas girls receive more positive feedback concerning compliance. Males may be discouraged when they receive negative feedback from the teacher. Females usually are praised more when good things are done. This may be because females interact more with teachers and try harder to please teachers than males do. Gender differences in teacher relations are generally less apparent in early grades like elementary, middle, and junior high school and are fairly consistent by high school (Morgan, 2001). Another reason of this may be because females tend to enhance their social skills when interacting with teachers. This pattern of increasing consistency in gender differences in students' motivation to work with teachers across grade levels suggests that these gender differences are at least partially an outcome of differential socialization practices. 
          
==Effects of Motivation==
{{Rquote|right|People often say that motivation doesn't last.  Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily.|Zig Zigler}}

Once motivation is properly established, it can have a positive influence on students' lives.  Differences in attitudes and an increased energy start to show (Fisher, 2003).  Through various strategies, students will begin to feel more confident about being able to learn new concepts.  Teachers should see students putting forth more effort and signs of thinking more deeply.  Instead of taking part in an assignment of low level difficulty, students may choose more challenging tasks.  With encouragement, individuals will be more likely to complete assignments, rather than giving up when they assume failure.  They should be more prepared for daily activities and find material more interesting.  Ultimately, teachers should notice that the motivational strategies can lead to higher grades and a higher possibility that students will want to learn outside of the classroom setting (Brewster &amp; Fager, 2000).

==Conclusion==
In the world of education, the probability of knowing that one will succeed is important to an individual.  In order to succeed, students need to have motivation to participate in learning.  There are a variety of strategies and actions teachers can implement; however, educators should always remember that everyone has different learning styles and ways of being motivated.  The various strategies can, in some way, help students in their learning process by eliminating the boredom of repetitive assignments or lectures.  Teaching is a profession with a great task of being able to stimulate the minds of children, which includes gaining their interest and making them a positive part of one’s life.

{{question-answer|question=What influences and instructional strategies can play a part in motivation and what effects do they have on students?
|answer=Students can be motivated internally by the drive to learn.  This is intrinsic motivation.  Or, students can be motivated externally, which is extrinsic motivation.  Students motivation is also affected by their home life-whether they are living in poverty or have abusive parents-their gender-males receive more negative feedback than females, which is discouraging-and the amount of respect they receive.  Students can also be motivated by instructional strategies that teachers use that they find interesting, such as Project Based Learning.  Project Based Learning requires students to examine a question, work in groups with each other, and come up with results.  Students are more motivated if they can finish tasks, so large tasks should be broken up into smaller ones.  It is also important for teachers to generate interest in the topics they are studying so that students feel more motivated because they are interested and generally want to learn.  Students also are more motivated if they can work at their own pace, and teachers provide a variety of assignments for students to chose the one that interests them the most.  Expectations are another important factor that influences motivation.  Students do better if they understand what is expected of them and they feel as though they can control the task at hand. &amp;mdash;Meredith B. Lee}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Can discipline be done positively?}}

The primary reason teachers quit teaching is because of the frustrations of trying to control, lead, and guide the dynamics of their classroom. This is one of the many reasons teachers are concerned about discipline in their classrooms. Another obvious reason for concern is that it's easier to teach and learn in an orderly, constructive atmosphere.

The word &quot;discipline&quot; is often associated with negative visions of spankings, punishments, or the strict conformance to an overbearing set of rules. Is there such a thing as &quot;Positive discipline&quot;? The following introduces applicable preparation methods and techniques that are used to address behavioral issues in the classroom. Many tenure teachers use these methods to successfully optimize their classrooms for an effective, efficient, positive teaching and learning experience. First we will define reactive management as that which is controlled, guided, or dominated by corrective responses to behavioral problems. As a solution, teachers work on preparation and supporting behavior that causes efficient teaching and learning. 

Before we discuss these ideas, we need to define the term prosocial. Prosocial behavior is constructive, positive, encouraging, considerate, kind, and respectful. One of the biggest communication barriers between students and teachers is that teachers assume the students know prosocial behavior.
Discipline that is guided by corrective action or reaction responses to behavior problems has at least three damaging effects. One, setting rules, then having punishment or threats of punishments implies that the student has a option. The option is to obey, or disobey and suffer the consequences. If the threats or punishments don't work to enforce the rules, the only recourse for the teacher is increasing the severity of the punishment. In the classroom, prosocial behavior must be understood to be obligatory , not a personal choice or an option. Prosocial behavior is the classroom standard and it is to be practiced until it is learned. Two, written and verbal rules are too abstract and are external. Children internalize them only as their social relationships develop (Reimer, Paolitto, &amp; Hersh, 1983, pp.39-42).  Children see morality as justice and don't internalize justice as adherence to rules. Prosocial behavior must be taught, we cannot passively rely on a child's natural empathic feelings or sense of justice to automatically develop into good behavior (Eisenberg &amp; Mussen, 1989, p. 6) Teachers must teach the attitudes that fuels prosocial behavior instead of promoting an unending list of rules. Three, rules lead children to bypass the fundamental idea of respect. If children are focused on a set of rules, instead of the bases for the rules, students justify misbehavior that isn't addressed on the list of rules.

The framework for Disciplining to prosocial behavior is built by preparing the physical, instructional, and managerial components of teaching. Although there are times that a teacher must react with corrective interventions, preventive, and supportive interventions are always preferable, for both the student and the teacher. These ideas will be discussed below and developed into a practical, applicable guide for positive classroom discipline. The teacher hones and optimizes each component by continued preparation and reflection.

'''Building Personality'''
From http://www.guest-teacher.com/forums/funnystories.php

* My first year in the business of substituting I found myself in an 8th grade US History class. The students sensed my &quot;newness&quot; and let me have it, or so they thought. One boy walked to the window, opened it and threw his book out. The class roared, waiting for a response. I walked toward the window and the boy; he jumped out the window. A quick response of shutting the window and asking the class to carry on with the assignment worked in heading off problems. I then sent a note to the office and they handled the situation. I walked out of school that day and wondered if I'd be back. &quot;I really like elementary school!&quot; The secret is to keep your sense of humor. -- - Submitted 2004-01-01

* I was subbing in an 8th grade science class that was showing a National Geographic video on predators and prey. This particular segment was about tigers. Being A National Geographic video, I thought to myself that there might be a scene where two tigers might be mating. &quot;Nah,&quot; I thought, and shrugged it off. Indeed, fifteen minutes into the movie, they started going at it. &quot;Ooohh, they're doing it Kitty style!&quot; was one of the many comments I heard. Trying to maintain a serious face, I walked over to the VCR and attempted to skip this segment. Naively, instead of pressing the &quot;stop&quot; button, I just pressed the fast forward button. You can only imagine what the kids saw next, only twice as fast! -- - Submitted 2004-01-01
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Being prepared is the key to preventive intervention. Early on, teachers should become familiar with the schools procedures and policies. Teachers can also get to know their students by reviewing their records. Know the challenging students along with the exemplary ones. There are countless books and articles on case studies of social problems that occur in the classroom. One way of preventive intervention is being prepared for the student's behavior. The teacher must get on top of the situation. Planning classroom movements to lunch, recess, special periods, rest room etc. are just a few items that can be prepared for prosocial behavior. Remember, preventive means making decisions ahead of time. There are also physical or material preparation that can be done with the classroom (such as the seating arrangement) that create a safe, constructive facility for learning. Providing structures, thought out lesson also helps to guide constructive class time.

==Supportive Intervention to Prosocial Classroom Discipline==
How can teachers support and promote prosocial behavior during the class period? They can actively lend assistance to help students learn prosocial skills. Teachers also need to model the behavior they expect from their students. Students need instruction on what to do, but it's just as important to give them ongoing help to achieve success. This is a difficult discipline for some teachers to practice. Maybe its human nature that adults seem to overlook or ignore correct behavior. It might be helpful to keep a record of the times that desired behavior occurs by recognizing the incident and complementing the students.

Schools as a whole also have a part to play in promoting prosocial behavior among students, according to Kidron and Fleischman. Schools can train teachers to integrate value-based lessons into their classroom management routines. The authors suggest giving students a say in class decision making or assigning academic tasks to pairs or small groups of students to bolster students’ understanding of democratic principles. Schools can also foster a caring community by encouraging members of the school community -- teachers, school administrators, cafeteria workers, and school bus drivers -- to model caring and respectful behavior. Schools can best encourage prosocial behavior by using consistent positive disciplinary practices that include clear expectations, discussions, and modeling. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, a program distributed by the U.S. Department of Education, has shown that implementation of a similar program can improve students' behavior and academic performance (Kidron &amp; Fleischman, 2006).

==Reflecting or Correcting Prosocial Classroom Discipline==
Along with the above mentioned techniques to preventative discipline you must also have a designated set of rules and procedures in the event something does happen.  These rules should be clearly visible to the students and reviewed every few weeks to check for understanding (Lavay).  This may not sound like it is preventative but letting the students know what will happen if they break the rules can be a deterrent for some students and lead to better classroom behavior.  When a student does break the rules it is important to maintain the rules.  There should be no exceptions and the teacher should “stick to their guns” when it comes to the appropriate procedure.  If the teacher is lenient to one student the other students will see that and try to take the same leniency that the teacher showed the other student (Lavay).  Quick and effective discipline for one student will stop future behavior problems from other students.

It needs to be understood, that no matter how much preparation or guidance is done, there will be need for corrective action for misbehavior. Teacher shouldn't internalize this as failure, but as a reality that comes with teaching. Don't take it personally, and don't make it personal. It's business, and it's part of the job; handle it professionally by diffusing the situation and minimizing the disruption to the lesson plan. 

There are nonverbal, verbal, and physical responses. There are also methods and policies for reacting to more serious problem behaviors. Sometimes no response is the best response. Don't make a big issue out of a small, isolated event. Another nonverbal response is catching the student's eye, without others noticing, and shaking your head or finger as a signal of disapproval. Also, another way is to move closer to the student as you're lecturing, sometime teacher proximity can rectify the situation. The idea is to keep the continuity and efficiency of the classroom, and maintain teacher and student dignity. 

Verbal responses can be done by talking to the student in a tone that others can't hear and express your disapproval of their behavior. Another way is by addressing the student directly and publicly or by addressing the classroom as a whole. Keep your cool, don't scream or raise your voice, be professional. Remember, the &quot;push&quot; or persuasion is for you to lose your cool, and temper. This disrupts the classroom and loses your respect with the students. 

In very rare incidents, humor can be used to resolve the issue. More often than not, humor will complicate the dynamics of the student, teacher relationship and end up doing more harm that good. Never use sarcasm. After the teacher has developed a relationship with the student, understands their background and character, a teacher might venture out and test the waters by using humor to address some behavioral issues. 

There are also physical responses to behavioral disruptions. Never strike a student! A student can be relocated within the classroom (maybe beside the teacher's desk). Remember that a student that has lost their temper or is throwing a tantrum needs to be calmed. Avoid saying things that fuel the fire. Diffuse the potential physical situation by letting them cool down. Challenging them causes the situation to eventually come to a head, and everyone loses. There can be consequences to their behavior after they have cooled down and had time to adjust their disposition. For more serious problems (guns, knives, etc.) consult your school policy and resources (on sight police, counselor, physiologist, etc.) available to help with potential extreme violence.

==Tips for Classroom Discipline==
;It's easier to get easier
:Teachers have to have good classroom management and discipline from day one.  Then you can get easier as the year goes on. 
;Fairness is key
:If you expect to be respected, you must be fair to all students.
;Deal with disruptions with as little interruption as possible
:Deal with them immediately and with as little interruptions to the class as possible
;Avoid confrontations in front of students
:Deal with discipline issues privately so they do not &quot;lose face&quot; in front of their friends.
;Stop disruptions with a little humor
:Sometimes a good laugh will help get things back on track in the classroom.

==Conclusion==
In addressing discipline problems in the classroom, it's important that teachers are able to laugh at themselves. Managing a classroom is difficult. Teachers aren't failures because of the social problems that occur in their classroom. Social problems occur in the military, government, business, church, special interest groups and families. When dealing with any group of people, you will be dealing with social problems. Take these issues into perspective, by not internalizing or taking them personally. Address it professionally by structuring a positive classroom discipline using three components. First, be prepared. Second, instruct, assist, promote, and practice prosocial behavior in the classroom. And third, review past successful practices of reactive intervention when misbehavior occurs. Each teacher can succeed by optimizing each component with continued preparation and reflection. If it was easy, everyone would be a teacher.

{{question-answer|question=What are positive ways to get the class to stop talking during a lecture?
|answer=When you are teaching, I strongly believe that there is little room for lecturing.  In my experience as an educator I have learned to make the lesson interactive therefore any and usually all discussion is productive and applies to the lesson at hand.  However, if the scenario were different, I would suggest diverting the person who is interrupting into a positive conversation about the lecture.  Perhaps the student has prior knowledge of the subject, and would like to share.  If the disruption is unrelated to the class topic, my first method of recourse would be a simple gesture to be quiet.  

There are instances when quiet gestures do not work, and more strict methods of discipline are required.  In this case, some other methods include taking away a privilege.  This will depend on the grade level involved; however some popular things are bathroom breaks, free-time, and even adding in extra homework problems.  These have all been fairly productive, and can be adjusted to fit the grade level and students involved.

Lastly, and not the preferred method, is administrative involvement.  This is always the last recourse, however if there is a single student inciting commotion, and disrupting the learning environment, I feel it would be appropriate.  
----
There are many ways to make students stop talking during a lecture. The first thing a teacher must accomplish is control over the classroom. If you have good classroom management skills you can get your students to stop talking during a lecture. My question would be: why can’t students talk during a lecture? In my experience as a teacher I think that making my lessons interactive is what helped my students learn the material. Nevertheless, it is impossible to make all lessons interactive, some content material must be taught by lecture. However, the more you get the students involved the more they want to learn, or even better the more they learn without realizing that they are learning.  Before each of my lectures my students explain to me what they already know or remember about the subject matter. This method eliminates some of the monotony of a lecture and allows the students to talk. When the students are done talking and explaining they know that there will be some lecture.

For those lectures that can not be interactive there are several ways to prevent the class from talking. First, be prepared for the lesson. As a teacher, you should have gone over the material that will be covered and know what and how you are going to teach. This eliminates the chit-chat among the students that would occur if a teacher was trying to prepare his/her lesson or thinking of how to going to explain the material. Another way to manage the classroom, is to have a set of rules and procedures posted for the students. If a student can see the rules and know the consequences of breaking a rule it may deter them from disruptive behavior. Finally, good use of non-verbal and verbal responses are key. Do not make a big deal out of a small isolated event. Use non-verbal responses by trying to catch the student’s eye, shaking your head,or moving closer to the student during the lecture to let them know of your disapproval. This methods keep the lecture moving and corrects the problem at the same time. If you use a verbal response remember to keep your cool and do not scream at the students. You can choose to address the student individually in class, outside of class, or address the class as a whole.  Again, the key component in addressing discipline during a lecture is classroom management.  &amp;mdash;Amanda Esparza

There are many positive ways to encourage students to stop talking during a lecture. For one a teacher should always create eye contact with each student through out the duration of the lecture. Creating eye contact intermittently can keep the students alert and aware of what is being said. Eye contact can also help to signal who is ready to answer when a question is about to be asked as well as who is not ready to answer a question. Asking questions is another positive way to keep classroom talking to a minimum especially when a rotation of different students are consistently called-on to answer those question. When the same students are being asked to answer every question asked this gives times for the talkers to start up a conversation, so being consistent in calling on everyone in the classroom is a good way to keep the talking to a minimum. The lecture should also be exhilarating and not just monotonous information reading from a power point. When students are bored with the lecture and the lecturer conversations start to occur and that is why lectures should have some sort of interaction besides just question and answer sections. As an educator you want to be able to provide exciting hands on lectures that will involve all of the students to participate with other students as well as the teacher allowing them to use those talking muscles for something educational. There are many hands on activities that students can do with one another or that follows along with the teacher without talking occurring. Granted, when you lecture you want to be able to get the important information across and help every student understand the material, but this can be something fun and interactive. If all of these positive ways are included into each lecture the chance for social talking could be held to the minimum with out having to yell or discipline students regularly. &amp;mdash;Emily Hampton
----
A teacher's job is to teach, therefore they should do their best to do so. This includes effective teaching that keeps a class involved with a lecture. If a teacher finds a way to make a certain subject more interesting they will more than likely not run into the problem of a classroom that talks during the lecture. I find that another resourceful way to keep a classroom involved during a lecture is changing up the routine schedule of the class from time to time. Instead of always keeping the class trapped inside the classroom, why not move the lecture outside into a different environment. This way it will captivate the students and grab their attention. Other effective ways for getting a class to stop talking during a lecture would be using the silent treatment and random name call punishment. A teacher could regain the attention of their classroom by standing in front of the classroom silent until the class realizes that the teacher is waiting on them to pay attention. The random name call is simple because it gains the attention of the student that needs to be singled out in order to pay attention. If a child is not paying attention during the lecture a teacher could simply ask a question referring back to the lecture to let the child know that the teacher caught them in the act of not pay attention. &amp;mdash;Elizabeth Poplawsky}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Are teachers interchangeable?}}

&quot;If a teacher gets hit by a bus, can another smart and well-prepared teacher replace the first one and achieve similar learning outcomes with the students?&quot; asks The Teaching, Learning, and Technology (TLT) Group in a recent blog.  At first glance, this question is startling.  The depiction is harsh, but the point is clear: no one wants to be the kind of teacher who, for whatever reason, can be easily replaced.  Likewise, a teacher is trained in his specific content area: not to be tossed from one subject to the next with very little consideration of his background.  

Out-of-field teaching is a problem in the United States.  Interchangeable teachers, who teach subjects they are not certified for, comprise about one fourth of the teachers in public middle and high schools across the United States (&quot;One fourth of classes have out of field teachers&quot;).  Is the education system harming its students with under qualified teachers or is a certified teacher in one subject able to effectively teach a host of others?

==Why Out-of-Field Teachers?==
Schools want their students to succeed, so why then would they allow the use of out-of-field and uncertified teachers to continue?  Whether they hold certification in a certain subject or not, some teachers simply excel.  Their students thrive and the school sees no reason to replace them with a certified teacher.  In other cases, it is more expensive to hire a teacher specifically for every subject in the school.  For less money, a teacher certified in a science can also teach another.  Though school systems are insisting that schools become more creative in hiring qualified teachers for quality learning, schools complain that teachers who are willing to work part-time is difficult and distance learning has not yet been proven effective (Chaika).

==What The Statistics Show==
{{Rquote|right|Unlike Canada and many European and Asian nations, the United States treats elementary and secondary school teaching as low-status work and teachers as semiskilled workers.  Few would require cardiologists to deliver babies, real estate lawyers to defend criminal cases, chemical engineers to design bridges, or sociology professors to teach English.|Richard M. Ingersoll}}

So which teachers are teaching subjects outside of their certified areas? Schools in underprivileged areas, rural areas, and where minorities exceed fifty percent of the population have statistically the greatest number of out-of-field teachers (&quot;One fourth of classes have out-of-field teachers).  Science and math teachers are suffering the most in both the aforementioned schools and all other schools.  Twenty-eight percent of all math teachers lack even an equivalent to a minor in math, while eighteen percent of science teachers are missing such preparation.  In addition, science teachers are shuffled from subject to subject, regardless of certification, to make up for the critical shortage of science teachers (Chaika).  Out-of-field teaching is not confined to only math and science, however.  Nearly eighteen percent of social studies teachers and twenty-two percent of English teachers in high schools lack, at the very least, a minor in the subjects (Chaika).  

However, holding a college degree in a particular subject is not the only factor that should be involved when accessing a teacher's quality.  That is only the minimal requirement and does not insure that a person can actually teach the subject (Ingersoll).  Taking classes on instruction and actual teaching certification should also be important factors as to whether a teacher can teach.

==The Teachers' Opinions==
There are many sides to the issue of out-of-field teachers, from the views of the students to the mandates set by the government.  One of the most important opinions though, must come from the people who are put in the position to teach a subject that they are potentially not equipped to.  Many schools look for teachers up until the very last second and, upon finding no one, do not cancel the class, but simply hand the subject over to another instructor.  This person may not have any background in this subject and finds himself unprepared once school start.  These teachers often use the textbook as a crutch.  They will not be able to as easily or thoroughly teach the material or answer student questions because they do not have the preparation.  Sometimes, a teacher may not even like the subject he is teaching (Chaika).  If a teacher does not have a passion for his subject, how can he possibly instill a desire to learn the subject in his students?

Even when teachers do not mind their out-of-field assignment, there are a number of obstacles to overcome in order to effectively teach the subject.  For instance, many schools will not pay for sending their teachers back to school to take classes.  Therefore, if a teacher decides to go back to school, he is most likely to obtain an advanced degree to increase his earning potential (Chaika).  In addition, school systems do not offer adequate support to out-of-field teachers.  They do not provide additional material on the subject or allow teachers the time to learn the subject or how to teach it on their own.  A teacher has been trained to teach his subject, not a subject randomly assigned to him.  Therefore, in addition to obtaining knowledge about the new subject, he also must learn how to teach it (Ingersoll).

==The Government Weighs In==
The No Child Left Behind Act required all states to insure that their teachers were &quot;highly qualified&quot; in their respective subjects by the 2005-2006 school year.   The U.S. Department of Education defines a &quot;highly qualified&quot; teacher to be one who earns a bachelor's degree, is certified in the state in which they teach, and prove that they know the subject.  This would ultimately get rid of all out-of-field teachers.  In 2004, responding to complaints from the states, it was modified to allow certain flexibilities.  Rural and science teachers were given extra flexibility.  Rural teachers were given three years to be certified in each additional subject they teach.  Science teachers can now be certified in a &quot;broad field&quot; or in each individual area of science (&quot;New No Child Left Behind Flexibility&quot;).  However, one in four schools failed to meet the NCLB standards by the 2005-2006 deadline.  These schools face losing government aid.  Additionally, schools recieving poverty funding from the government can potentially lose administrators and instructors who are removed by the federal government (Ohlemacher).

==Conclusion==
Now one returns to the scenario of the bus.  In his blog, Steve Gilbert wonders whether it is &quot;something to brag about&quot; if all instructors are interchangeable (&quot;Bus Test vs. Embarrassment Test&quot;).  If a school is able to pass the &quot;bus test,&quot; does that make it successful in the eyes of the government or the students?  Is it more important to have a teacher who can instill a passion for learning his subject in students or should students get the most basic, mediocre learning experience?   

Very few states prohibit the use of out-of-field teaching, even after the No Child Left Behind Act--but Virginia is among them (Chaika).  If school systems stop using out-of-field teachers and, instead, use teachers are certified for the classes they teach and, in turn, have a passion for that subject, the passion for learning might be absorbed by their students.

{{question-answer|question=You just graduated and landed your first teaching job.  Congratulations!  You've modified lesson plans from your student teaching and are ready to get out there on your own.  However, three weeks before the first day of school, your principal calls to meet with you.  He tells you that in addition to the subject you are certified in, you will be teaching an additional class.  Write 200-300 words on how you would handle this situation.
|answer=Though this is a difficult situation to be put in, I would hope that I had a few classes in the subject during my coursework in college.  To be best prepared, I would obtain the SOLs for the class and compare them to the textbook the school uses.  I would make lesson plans based on the two and supplement them with the textbooks from college and information I could obtain from other teachers.  Provided that I had the time and the money, I would find the number of classes I would be required to take for the extra certification in the subject.  Though I could not feasibly take all of the classes and teach simultaneously, I would attempt to take one a semester until I could become fully certified.  It is most important that I can convey the information to the student in a knowledgeable, enthusiastic manner.
----
Since it is only three weeks before classes start, I would first look at the SOLs for that subject to get an idea of what is expected of me as a teacher.  I would then see if I could meet with a teacher who is certified to teach the subject to get lesson plan ideas and tips.  Teachers should always go to each other for help because that could be the best and fastest source of information if ever in a bind.  Also, since I am a new teacher, this would help me get to know some of the teachers that I will be working with.  Another person to go to would be the principal of the school.  The principal is always willing to help teachers, especially new ones, when they need help or are put in a situation such as this.  However, I would also look into taking a course or courses to educate myself on the subject that I am teaching, and hopefully, eventually I will become certified to teach the subject area.  I would take this class during the year while I am teaching, since I wouldn’t have enough time to take the class before school starts in three weeks. &amp;mdash;Sarah Hobbs
----	
It is hard to say how I would react.  I want to teach math, science, and social studies.  Literature however is not my cup of tea.  So if I was told I would have to teach literature I suspect there would be a problem.  I would have to start with observing some of the best literature teachers there are in the school.  I would get with the lead teacher and see what there lesson plans and tactics are.  I would have to find a way to be current and up to date in the subject area.  I also would have to do a serious mood adjustment which includes creating excitement.  I would do this so I can actually get my point across to students. I would hope to find a fulfillment from literature and hopefully make literature much more interesting than the classes that I have taken.  Despite my teaching qualifications and mood I would create an environment that would make literature a top priority.  This would be a classroom that is dedicated to the joy of literature while achieving all points of interest set forth by the school board and the state.  I would research and find different techniques for this subject.  Find out what works best for students.  Unfortunately temporarily the text will have to be a crutch.  Hopefully overtime I would strive to become more knowledgeable and lean more and more away from confusing texts for the student. &amp;mdash;Heather Olson
----
If I found that I had to teach another subject alongside of my subject that I am certified in three weeks prior to school starting I would try my best to teach at the subject matter in a fun and exciting manner.  I would first t look at previous SOL tests.  I would see what the material is that that the student will be tested on, and then I would look to see if there is an itemized list of which ones students have missed in the past and write them down so that I can constantly refer back to them.  Then I would look at the text and start reading it paying note to everything.  While reading the book I would take a mass amount of important notes.  This would be similar to a situation a few years back when I was a student and had to learn the material.  The only difference now would be that I have to teach myself the material.  After that I would start making my rough lesson plans.  And then to make the class enjoyable and exciting I will place different activities that would help the students tie in the lesson, so that they may better comprehend it. &amp;mdash;Jessica Davis

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we recruit, select, and train new teachers?}}

Finding effective, efficient teachers is the goal of all school systems.  However, new teacher recruitment and retention seems to be a growing problem for many parts of our country.  According to research “over the next decade, the United States will need to hire 2 million teachers due to rising enrollments, increasing retirement rates of current teachers, and high rates of attrition for beginning teachers.” (Darling-Hammond 254)  With the amount of new openings becoming available, some schools may become desperate to hire new employees, and this may lead to unqualified teachers taking some the positions.  This type of hiring poses a problem for the school systems since in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) there are “regulations requiring that all teachers in core academic subjects be ‘highly qualified’ by 2005-2006.” (Liu 324)  To realize the implications of the NCLB and to understand the practices of school systems currently, a few core questions must be analyzed.  The questions are:  How are school systems currently recruiting and selecting the new teachers that are needed?  Once hired, how are school systems defining the roles of new teachers, and how are these new teachers being trained?  Once a new teacher is hired, it is important that the individual understand what is expected of him/her, and for retention purposes, it is important that some amount of training is given.  This chapter will discuss in greater detail the answers to the hiring and selecting, defining roles, and training questions.

==Recruitment and Selection==
As mentioned previously, schools may, and in some cases have, become desperate enough to higher teachers who may not be qualified.  Linda Darling-Hammond and Barnett Berry, in an article titled ''Recruiting Teachers for the 21st Century:  The Foundation for Educational Equity'', have found in their research “in 1994…27% of new entrants to public school teaching had not completed the requirements for a state license in their main assignment field.” (257)  This type of selection is not occurring due to the lack of new teachers entering the working world.  In fact, Darling-Hammond and Berry found that “only about 65% to 70% of newly prepared teachers obtain jobs after they graduate, and many report that they cannot find jobs.” (258)  How is the hiring process conducted in a way that allows unqualified people to take positions that certificated teachers could fill?

===Quality Teachers===
Good teachers make the difference in the life of a child and can make the difference in the school by being a creative individual.  That teacher could add to the solution rather than create yet another problem.  Simply assisting students toward becoming successfull in the classroom helps them to become successfull in the workplace.  Unfortunately most school systems aren't seeking an individual who will be creative, nurturing or encouraging instead, they will look at the status of their education and check to see if they are within the guidelines of a highly qualified teacher.

===Hiring Process===
There are several reasons that new teachers do not find jobs within the educational realm, and why unqualified personnel are hired.  First, we will look at how districts can organize the hiring process.  The first approach is the centralized approach.  In this method, “administrators at the district office carry out most of the hiring activities, … typically rely on standardized procedures for processing large batches of applications, and tend to use generic job descriptions, standardized interview protocols, and/or criteria for evaluating candidates. (Liu 332)  In the case of centralized approach, Edward Liu and Susan Moore Johnson found in their research that this leads to many districts hiring a teacher based on his/her general qualifications and will find him/her a specific school at a later time. (332)  The second approach is a decentralized one.  In this method, the schools are allows to carry out their own hiring procedures.  This tactic allows for a much more personalized interview, and also allows the candidates and the schools more contact with one another. (Liu)  Most hiring is done through a combination of centralized and decentralized approaches.  

Liu and Johnson studied the various methods of hiring between four states in their report titled ''New Teachers’ Experiences of Hiring:  Late, Rushed, and Information-Poor''.  The top reason that these researchers came up with for fully certified teachers not to be hired by the school system was actually on the part of the districts’ hiring process.  The reason is timing.  Most teachers in the four states studied, according to Liu and Johnson, were hired one month before school started, and some were hired after school had already begun.  (Liu 345)  Due to the late timing, most qualified teachers may have already taken jobs elsewhere, whether in education or in business.  The reasons for the delay in job offers include:  not being able to predict enrollment rates accurately; budget decisions may be state or municipality; any transfer processes of tenured teachers must be complete before hiring new teachers; and the district personnel offices or systems are poorly organized, inefficient, or dysfunctional. (Liu 352)  Whatever the cause, these issues make it hard for qualified teachers to be hired within the schools or their choice.

==&quot;Highly-Qualified&quot; Teachers==
As of the 2005-2006 school year, all teachers were expected to be what No Child Left Behind called, “highly-qualified” teachers.  A “highly-qualified” teacher is defined as a teacher who has met the state’s licensing and certification requirement and meets all necessary criteria. The criteria are that the teacher must possess a bachelor’s degree in the subject he/she chooses to teach, pass a state given test that gauges the knowledge the teacher holds in their chosen field, and must pass a test in any other subject they plan to teach.  For example, if Mr. Jones has a bachelor’s degree in both science and math, then he must pass a science and math state test in order to be able to teach both subjects.   All teachers must meet the NCLB standard of “highly-qualified” teacher’s, even the experienced ones (Wikipedia).  NCLB allows for experienced teachers to show their subject competency through a program called HOUSSE, or High, Objective, Uniform State Standard of Evaluation, in which states are able to create another way for teacher’s to demonstrate their competency (“New NCLB”).

==Roles==
Whether the teacher hired is qualified or not, there are still certain roles that he or she must fill.  Everyone knows the basic role of a teacher is to be a teacher.  To teach is “to show or help (a person) to learn (how) to do something” (Agnes 1468) such as a skill or trait.  This role is most commonly thought also as being a lecturer.  However, this is not the only role that school districts want their teachers to fill.  Other roles include demonstrator, listener, a person who empowers (Holtrip), and a disciplinarian.  Dr. Stephen Holtrip, a professor at Huntington University in Huntington, Indiana, gives other examples of the main roles that teachers must take on in his statement, “Obviously, teachers wear many hats:  friend, counselor, judge, mentor--hundreds of roles and different roles for different classes, students, and extra curricular duties.”  

As if the above listed duties are not enough, teachers are also expected to be collaborators with their colleagues, learners of new ways to instruct, and secretaries of the paperwork that is required of them.  With all of these roles placed upon new teachers, its no wonder that the stress of the job can get to some of them.  In addition to the stress of taking on the roles, there is also no, or very little, training that is given to new inductees.

==Training==
Training for new schoolteachers is almost non-existent.  The training that is given is usually limited to a district orientation or occasional workshop.  Linda Molner Kelley uses a good simile in her article ''Why Induction Matters'', “Although other professions provide transitional assistance for new members, … historically the education profession has ignored the support needs of its new recruits and has been described as ‘the profession that eats its young.’” (438)  The type of training that new teachers can received through a good induction program can actually increase the chance of retention and low attrition rates. 

===Partners in Education===
{{Rquote|right|To teach well, we need not say all that we know, only what is useful for the pupil to hear.|Anonymous}}
Kelly examines a program named Partners in Education (PIE) offered through the University of Colorado of Builder.  The PIE program “emphasizes reflective teaching practices, individual mentoring from an expert teacher each week, frequent networking with other novice teachers, and inquiry-based graduate study tailored to each teacher’s professional needs and classroom situation.” (Kelley 440).  The steps listed above make the PIE program well-rounded, and also help the future teachers to learn cooperative thinking, as well as reflective and creative.  The different ways to solve a problem will help novice teachers to be able to fit in most of the roles expected of them.  Mentoring is probably the most helpful item in the above list.  Mentors can coach new teachers in areas such as classroom management, lesson planning, and disciplining.

In fact, Kelley states that the PIE mentors are expected to assist the PIE teachers in areas such as “short- and long-term planning, developing standards-based lessons and authentic assessments, differentiating instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners, creating classroom communities, and collaborating with colleagues and parents.” (443).  Induction, when coupled with mentoring as the PIE program is, is an effective way to help new teachers fit in more comfortably to their new roles once hired by the school system.

==Conclusion==
Hiring new teachers is becoming a larger concern for many school systems in the 21st century.  Being able to shorten the hiring process to offer more jobs to new teachers in the spring will help to ensure quality teachers will take the positions that are open.  Once these new teachers are hired, however, training is required for the teacher to hit into his/her roles, which will help to decrease attrition.  With school systems being able to retain highly qualified teachers, the students will be the most benefited through the enhanced process.

{{question-answer|question=Timing and training are two of the biggest issues that need to be overcome in the hiring process of new teachers.  What, in your opinion, is one way to solve each of these problems?
|answer=In order to solve the issue of time in the hiring process, school systems need to invest the money for hiring new teachers.  Enrollment can be difficult to judge, but districts should have some idea as to the amount of new teachers needed for the coming year.  The district or state needs to allot money for each district based on a ratio of the previous years enrollment.  Having the funds ready for new teachers will reduce the amount of time a school system must wait in order to hire new teachers.

Training can also be solved through district approved induction programs that include a mentor teacher to help coach the novice teachers on issues that cannot be covered through college courses.  Mentor teachers already have years of experience they can readily share with new teachers.  In addition, workshops that cover topics of technology integration or classroom management can also be helpful for new teacher training.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How has technology impacted instructional design?}}

Technology has proven to be one of the greatest inventions of all time. Not only does technology enhance learning practices, it also allows for many new types of learning experiences. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary technology is defined as the study, development, and application of devices, machines, and techniques used for manufacturing and productive processes (Webster 340). Without the innovations of technology teachers would have a limited domain for instructional design. However, by incorporating technology into the learning environment teachers are now able to expose students to many things that were impossible in the past. 

==Technologically Advanced Counties==
Many studies have been performed within different countries to determine which country appears to be the most technologically advanced. In a report presented by the magazine ''Education Week'' showed that schools within the United States lag behind other nations concerning internet availability(“U.S. Schools”). According to the seventh annual report from ''Education Week'' the United States proved to have the leading number of computers per student however, most of those computers did not have active internet connections (“U.S. Schools”). This report explained that although the United States has a substantial number of computers for students, the computers are often set up to aid students without providing them access to the internet. Simply allowing the students to use the computers without internet access is similar to cheating each person out of his or her own personal learning adventure.

==Guided Discovery==
Technology can be implemented into curriculum in numerous ways. For example, programs like Blackboard, Digital Storytelling, Softchalk, and Breakthrough to Literacy provide students with a sense of “guided discovery” . The National Education Association Research Division reports that there is currently a national goal to help students gain higher order thinking skills (Gokhale). Today’s society faces a rapidly changing technological world where workers need to be able to think creatively to keep the United States economically competitive with other countries. Therefore, Dr. Charles E. Wales of West Virginia University has devised an initiative known as “guided discovery” (Gokhale). The idea of guided discovery is fueled by the belief that through labs and properly designed computer simulations it may be possible to revolutionize education. Research shows that students retain information more effectively when they use their problem solving skills. In other words, Dr. Wales believes that allowing students to perform more “hands-on” projects will help them better retain information.

&lt;u&gt;Student Retention of Subject Matter&lt;/u&gt;

Subject matter that is read - 10% retained

Subject matter that is heard - 20% retained

Subject matter that is viewed &amp; heard - 30% retained

Subject matter that is viewed w/ directions given - 50% retained

Subject matter that is hands-on or simulated - 90% retained
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Instructional Technology==
The use of technology to provide or support education is known as instructional technology(Abbott). Instructional technology allows teachers to introduce students to new information through guided discovery rather than lectures. Studies have shown that the attention span of children and young adults have grown shorter over the past years (Abbott). With the shorter attention spans, instructors now have a reason to incorporate as much technology as possible into a lesson to keep the students interested. 

==Software Programs==
There are hundreds of software programs that are available to educators. One basic program that is commonly used is Microsoft PowerPoint. PowerPoint allows users to create projects that involve graphics, audio files, as well as video files. In other words, PowerPoint can easily be used by novice technologists. Another program that has become popular within the last decade is titled HyperStudio. HyperStudio [http://www.hyperstudio.com HyperStudio] is a product that provides students and teachers with an immense range of media-creation tools (“HyperStudio”). With brainstorming tools, visual organizers, project planners, and multimedia presentation capabilities HyperStudio has the capacity to encourage project-based learning, collaborative learning, and create assessment components (“HyperStudio”). SoftChalk [http://www.softchlk.com SoftChalk] is another software program that has proven to be beneficial to both instructors and students. This program allows educators to build lessons filled with pop-up text annotations, self-assessment quizzes, and interactive learning games (“SoftChalk”). SoftChalk is simple to use and does not require learning a complex software system.

==Conclusion==
In conclusion,the world of teaching has changed a great deal within the last decade. It is safe to say that technology has had a lot to do with implementing most of those changes. Although the idea of technology in the classroom sounds exciting, society must first realize that there are many obstacles to overcome. First, educators must be certain that the technology being used is educational and not just fun to operate; second, funding for educational equipment must be met so that every student will have an equal opportunity; third, the United States is in dire need of making the internet available in all school districts and for every computer that is being utilized by a student. Once these flaws are eliminated, educational technology and software will be extremely beneficial teaching modules.

{{question-answer|question=In your opinion, what is the greatest problem concerning American schools?
|answer=In my opinion, the greatest problem concerning American schools are the student faculty ratios. I feel that the student faculty ratio has become a significant problem because more students in a class results in less attention from the teacher. When classrooms are overcrowded teachers spend more time on classroom management and assisting weaker students than giving each student equal attention. 

One possible solution to this problem is to split school districts evenly. School boards across America should even out the number of students per classroom to about twelve students per teacher. With fewer students per classroom teachers will be able to give attention to each individual student instead of only giving attention to students with greater need. 

In conclusion, American schools could use a close evaluation to enhance their performance. Many of the problems that American schools face can be fixed without much thought. The problem is however, that no one is “thinking” or devising a plan to fix such problems. Hopefully, in the near future there will be a positive change adopted so that all students will be able to achieve his or her dreams.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the positives and negatives of class size?}}
{{Rquote|right|Small classes in the elementary grades are not the solution to the problems of American schools...Instead, small classes provide an essential opportunity for instruction to be more effective and for students to become optimally involved in the learning process.|Jeremy Finn|Finn, 2002}}

Reducing class size is one of the most popular and expensive proposals in educational reform today. Extensive research has been done to study the effects of class size on student achievement, however the results continue to be mixed. Although parents and educators both overwhelmingly support measures to reduce the number of children per classroom, many policy makers wonder if small class benefits outweigh the costs involved.

==Class Size vs. Pupil-Teacher Ratio==
Determining class size is very straightforward once you understand the difference between class size and pupil-teacher ratio. Unfortunately, the two terms are often used interchangeably and this results in a great deal of confusion. Class size is simply the number of students in a classroom that the teacher is responsible for on a regular basis. In contrast, pupil-teacher ratio is a statistical measure of the total number of students in a school divided by the total number of full-time educators. This number is often substantially lower than class size because it includes teachers who do not have a regular classroom assignment (speech, music, special education, etc.). On average, the difference between class size and pupil-teacher ratio is 10 students (Achilles, Finn, &amp; Pate-Bain, 2002). Schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 15 will average approximately 25 students per classroom. While many schools have a relatively small pupil-teacher ratio, in reality students in those schools are often the product of overcrowded classrooms.

==The Research==
Much of the basis of support for class size reduction programs stems from Project Star (Student Teacher Achievement Ratio), a groundbreaking research study initiated by the State of Tennessee in 1985. Beginning in kindergarten and continuing through the third grade, students were randomly assigned to either a small class with 13-17 students, a large class with 22-26 students, or a large class with a teacher aide. More than 12,000 students in 329 classrooms participated in the 4-year longitudinal study (Finn, 2002). Project Star's findings revealed that students in small classes consistently outperformed students in larger classes in all subject areas. Those who benefited the most started the program early and spent multiple years in small classes. The research also indicated that while all students benefited from smaller classes, the positive impact on minority and low-income students was greatest. Follow-up research has continued to show lasting, long-term gains for those students who participated in the study, even after making the transition to larger classes in middle and high school. Since the completion of this social experiment, similar studies have been conducted in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and California. In each instance, the research findings were consistent with those of Project Star (Finn, 2002).

==Who Benefits?==
Advocates for reduced class size argue that students and teachers both benefit substantially from smaller classes and that smaller classes lead to more effective teaching and improved learning. The key is maximizing those benefits through early intervention, duration, and intensity (Achilles et al, 2002). Students in small classes during the early years show the greatest gains and those gains continue to multiply for each additional year spent in small classes. Students in smaller classes spend more time actively engaged in the learning process, while teachers spend less time managing the classroom and more time providing academic instruction. There are fewer classroom disruptions in smaller classes and discipline problems are greatly reduced. Teachers can provide each student with the individualized attention that is often lacking in a larger classroom setting. These elements combine to form a more productive learning environment that results in enhanced student performance. Increases in student achievement continue to be seen through high school and beyond. Other long lasting effects tied to the class size reduction during formative school years include reduced in-grade retention, reduced dropout rates, and an increase in the desire to attend college. Students aren’t the only ones who benefit from smaller classes; teachers say they are more enthusiastic about their job and benefit from increased morale.

==What are the Costs?==
Not all the research supports smaller class sizes, even though the desire to reduce class sizes throughout the Nation is strong. The enormous cost of funding these initiatives has lead policy makers to take a closer look at the issue. Most states are struggling to maintain current levels of spending on education. The cost of building thousands of schools and hiring the additional teachers needed to staff them is a financial burden many states fear they cannot afford. Some school districts have begun to divert budget resources earmarked for support services to pay for smaller classes. Other schools have been forced to reduce programs just to provide the necessary classroom space to comply with mandated class sizes. In many areas, computer rooms, music rooms, special-education rooms, and the like are being converted into traditional style classrooms. As supplementary services and programs continue to be cut from schools, many worry that the reduction will hurt those students who need additional services most. 

Other pitfalls to reducing class size exist. States who have jumped into class size reduction programs too quickly and without careful planning have found that a significant shortage of qualified teachers exists. Many districts have been forced to hire teachers who lack credentials and have little or no experience just to meet the increased demand, the results of which could lead to an overall decline in educational quality. Those who appose class size reduction argue that quality teachers make the difference, not class size and that highly qualified professional educators are the key to improved student performance.

==Alternatives==
Many states are being forced to reevaluate how their educational resources are used and to examine alternatives to class size reduction initiatives. Some areas are considering extending the school day or the school year giving students and teachers the opportunity to capitalize on additional instruction time. Others feel it is more important to focus available resources on professional development and additional training and support for teachers. Some research has shown that the benefits of additional training for teachers may have a bigger payoff per dollar spent than class size reduction (Picus, 2000). Many schools hope to use additional technology resources in the classroom as an effective tool to individualize student learning. 

In the past, placing teacher aides into the classroom has been a popular alternative to reducing class size in the hope that it would provide students with small class benefits while costing substantially less. Policy makers should be cautioned that the research does not support this hypothesis. Analysis of the Project Star data has shown “no significant difference between classes with teacher aides and full-size classes without aides” (Finn, 2002, p. 555). Many propose eliminating teacher aides altogether in favor of hiring additional teachers.  

One radical alternative proposed by Saul Cooperman, former New Jersey Commissioner of Education, calls for an increase in both teacher’s salaries and class size. He feels that “brighter teachers are the best hope we have of increasing student performance” (2006, p. 41) and that the first step is attracting a better pool of teacher candidates. He also argues that the individual attention seen by most as a benefit of smaller classes is more intention than reality and that few educators modify their teaching methods based on class size fluctuation.

==Conclusion==
Class size reduction is currently one of the most popular educational reforms in the Nation. It also comes along with a multi-billion dollar price tag. Although research on the issue continues to be mixed, overwhelming public support for smaller classes continues to grow. The pressure is mounting for States to take action and reduce class size, although there is often a lack of funds to do so. Many policy makers want hard proof that the cost of funding class size reduction programs does indeed lead to increased student achievement.

Many alternatives to smaller classes are being considered and tough choices will have to be made. States who have current class size reduction programs in place or who are considering such measures should weigh the costs and benefits carefully. The implementation of class size initiatives should be well planned. Adequate funding and the availability of highly qualified teachers are essential. Programs that maximize the effects of smaller classes start in kindergarten or first grade and continue for at least the next several years. Simply reducing class size is not the cure-all to low academic achievement. Great attention must be focused on better training for teachers and the quality of instruction they provide. Above all, society must continue to work towards the goal of greater student achievement for all.

{{question-answer|question=In what way can class size reduction programs be implemented to maximize the effects on student achievement?
|answer=Research has shown that class size reduction programs implemented in kindergarten or first grade have a long lasting impact on student performance. Multiple years of small class instruction increase student achievement exponentially. Children educated in a small class setting consistently outperform their large classroom peers in all subject areas. When funding is an issue, districts should target schools with a high population of minority or at-risk youth because they have been shown to make the greatest gains. Highly educated professionals are also essential to a successful class size reduction program. Programs should not be initiated without proper planning or a shortage of qualified teachers may result. Many fear this shortage can lead to an overall decline in the quality of instruction and negate the positive effects of class size reduction.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Credentialism&amp;mdash;how has this impacted education?}}
{{Rquote|right|It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.|Albert Einstein}}

What is credentialism?  According to a dictionary, credentialism is “excessive reliance on credentials, esp. academic degrees, in determining hiring or promotion policies.  American Heritage Dictionary states that credentialism is “overemphasis on diplomas or degrees in giving jobs or conferring social status”.  Because of  NCLB requirement, the administrators of school systems have to follow the guideline and rely on applicant’s credentials when they hire him or her as a teacher.  Teachers who do not meet this requirement have to work on this requirement.  Did this impact the education?  If it is so, how did this impact the education?

== Advantages ==
To reform the school system and improve students performance in the nationwide, the federal government enacted the No Child Left Behiend Act of 2001(NCLB).  This includes accountability for students performance, teacher quality, and information for parents.

Under the law, states have to ensure that all children are taught by effective teachers.
The No Child Left Behind act of 2001 (NCLB) requires that (by the end of the 2006-7 school year) all teachers must be &quot;highly qualified&quot; as defined in the law. A highly qualified teacher is one who has (1) fulfilled the state's certification and licensing requirements, (2) obtained at least a bachelor’s degree, and (3) demonstrated subject matter expertise. The procedure for demonstrating subject matter knowledge depends on a teacher's tenure and level of instruction (Desimone, Laura M.; Smith, Thomas M.; Ueno, Koji, 2005).

This means that teachers who do not have enough credentials or degrees cannot have teaching jobs.  Teachers who have not fulfilled the licensing requirements have to take classes for licensure and attend workshops.  Teachers who have completed the requirements for this process express the differences.  In the article of Michael N. Riley, teachers express these comments below.

* A focus on making learning objectives much clearer and more specific.
* A commitment to the learning of all kids and an accompanying and complementary willingness to measure effectiveness of instruction and the instructor by the success of  each and every student.
* A deeper understanding and more frequent use for formative assessment.
* A practice of modifying instruction any time, even in the heart of a lesson, driven by the understanding and  
performance of the students. (Riley, 2007)

Teachers who have content knowledge in the subject but do not know what to do in the classroom can learn so many strategies of how to deliver the lesson, assess student’s work and modify instructional strategies in the program of licensure.  Teachers who meet requirements as being “highly qualified “ are more likely to use effective instruction than those who do not meet these requirements.  

No Child Left  Behind includes funds for the teacher and principal quality training and recruitment.  The money is designed to help states and school districts improve teacher and principal quality and recruit quality staff.  To make sure that more teachers get qualified, the Department of Education allocated $2.85 billion in 2002 and $2.93 billion in 2003 through Improving Teacher Quality state grants to help teachers become highly qualified if they are not already (Desimone, Smith, Ueno, 2005).  According  to Safier, teacher certification increase and greater increases in instructional expenditures are correlated with the increase of highly qualified teachers (Safier, 2007).

== Disadvantages ==
Administrators of school systems are dealing with how to meet the staffing needs of schools with qualified teachers.  Patricia C. Pratt-Cook, the human – resources director, in Memphis, Tenn., said she has sometimes had to rehire teachers who had not attained highly qualified status because she found no better candidates for their jobs (Keller, 2007).

Since the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires the highly qualified teachers for all students, this created the shortage of teachers in certain areas, such as special education, foreign languages, math and sciences.  According to the article “Reducing the Special Education Teacher Shortage,” colleges and universities produce only half the number required to fill vacant positions (Medina, Peltier, Thornton, 2007).  Because of insufficient   candidates, highly qualified special education teachers are not available for all classrooms.

In addition, NCLB requires that all children, including those with disabilities, are at proficient levels as measured by state academic assessments by the 2013-14 school year.
This pressures many educators, and more special education teachers will request to transfer to regular education positions or leave the profession (Medina, Peltier, Thornton, 2007). 

The problem of relying so much on credentialism is if the society emphasizes only credentials and degrees to hire somebody there is a chance to miss the certain value of characteristics for jobs such as experiences, devotion, and adaptability. 

Many state-financed preschool programs require teachers to have four year degrees.
Yet some researchers are skeptical about the link between teacher credentials in preschool and outcomes for children ( Jacobson, 2007).  Some community colleges have good early childhood programs to become effective teachers for preschools.  If some females who raised their children want to be preschool teachers but have to obtain four year degrees, this credentialism makes it hard for those people to teach preschools. 

== Conclusion ==
Credentialism really impacted the education in good and bad ways.  The requirement of certain credentials for teaching ensure the teacher’s quality.  Teachers who are highly qualified know about what effective ways to teach the subjects, which affects student’s achievement.  In contrast, there are teacher shortages in some areas.  Without sufficient amount of teachers, students cannot receive quality education.  Policy makers and advocates have to consider what should be done to solve these problems.

{{question-answer|question=In your opinion, is credentialism the best way to find qualified teachers?
|answer=I want all children to be educated by qualified personnel, but sometimes it is hard to find the correct person for the job.  There are some people that have the experience, passion  and adaptability for classroom purposes.  Unfortunately, not all of these have a degree or set foot in a school.  On the other hand, the people that have the degrees and some experience don’t always have the right technique and devotion to teach.  Knowledge itself doesn’t make you an expert to teach students.  The proper teaching technique and ways to keep the kids thinking is what is needed in the classes.  It is also vice versa.  Teachers who have enough knowledge and teaching technique and have established classroom success do not always have certifications. Teachers quit and take jobs at private school or other places because of the pressures associated with the credentialism. Finding teachers by the degree gets the fresh minds for schools and students, but there are some problems that  policy makers need to deal with.
----
In both my opinion and my experience, the resounding answer is NO! I began my teaching career as a substitute just before the advent of NCLB. I specifically chose to return to my former high school because I wanted to give back to my community: a high poverty, rural area. “Having a knack” for teaching caused me to become the most requested and sought after sub at the school. When I asked to be considered for a permanent teaching position, I was refused, because my BA was in Sociology, and the school was forced to hire anyone with an Education degree over me, so I left for the sports &amp; recreation industry. After over 10 years in this industry, I qualified as a career switcher. I am now an Elementary/Middle school Health &amp; PE teacher at my former Elementary school. My particular career training has been instrumental and easily adaptable to teaching. I also know a fully licensed , bi-lingual pre-school lead teacher from Florida, but her Florida credentials don’t transfer to Virginia. Even though she is often placed in the lead teacher role, she is only recognized and paid as an assistant. 

Often, the most highly credentialed person is the best person for the job, but not always. In any other field, credentials may get you noticed and/or in the door, but performance keeps you there. Sometimes a person with no credentials can excel in that field because of natural ability. I feel the teaching profession should continue to actively recruit/pursue people outside the education field to become teachers. I’ll take field expertise over classroom expertise any day. Until the teaching industry becomes like the “real world” and hires the best person for the job, regardless of a piece of paper, and pays for the best, it will lag behind. &amp;mdash;Mike Hancock}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the roles of paraprofessionals?}}

Paraprofessionals, sometimes called teachers' aides, are important to the educational system.  From my experience, they are paramount in all classes, especially special education classes.  I had the opportunity to volunteer at a preschool where I worked with paraprofessionals, teachers, and students.  I decided to spend my time volunteering in a special needs classroom where there were 8 students, 2 paraprofessionals, and 1 teacher.  All of the students needed and deserved special attention because they had special needs ranging from ADHD to autism.  The paraprofessionals’ presence provided the extra attention that was needed.  Without them in the classroom, the students would have been extremely hard to manage.

== Paraprofessionals Defined ==
According to about.com, a paraprofessional is a special education worker who is not licensed to teach, but performs many duties both individually with the students and organizationally in the classroom (about.com).  Paraprofessionals have been around for over 50 years.  Throughout the years, they have performed simple tasks such as monitoring the lunchroom and monitoring playground time.  Over the years, their duties have evolved.  Para’s are now involved with instructing small groups in classrooms, helping the teacher modify lesson plans to meet the needs of individual students, and under the direction of the teacher, administer assessment activities to the students (Bartholomay 2001).

=== Paraprofessionals in Special Education Classes ===
Paraprofessionals work specifically with general education students until they reach first grade.  There after, they mainly work with special education students (Goodman 2007).  In the special education classes, each student has an IEP, Individual Education Program (Baumel 2007).  Children get assessed for an IEP if the parent feels that their child requires special education. A multidisciplinary team evaluates the child and writes up the IEP, which is reviewed every year.  The parent is active in the process of creating the document.  The IEP document presents the levels of educational performance the child should achieve and the goals they should accomplish in that year (Baumel 2007).
I recently interview a Pre-K special education teacher.  She shared with me the IEP goals for her students and how the paraprofessional helps with the documentation of the goals.  There are seven areas where the students must perform in order to meet the goals: gross motor fine motor, expressive language, receptive language, social/personal, self-help, sensorimotor/preacademic.  In the preschool setting, the teacher and paraprofessional carefully observe each student and document when they reach their goal.  Here are some tasks that the paraprofessional and teacher look for.

*''Gross motor'': student can kick a ball four to six feet.
*''Fine motor'': student can cut a five inch circle with assistance from the paraprofessional.
*''Expressive language'': student can name pictures of objects seen in books.
*''Receptive language'': student can follow two-step commands involving sequence.
*''Social/personal'': student can play group games, like hide-and-seek, without constant adult supervision.
*''Self-help'': student can button up coat.
*''Sensorimotor/pre-academic'': student can label all primary colors. (Goodman 2007)

== Training/Educational requirements== 
The training for paraprofessionals is mainly on-the-job.  In some studies, paraprofessionals find a need for more training besides the basic on-the-job training and workshops. Training the paraprofessional’s places more obligations for the teachers because they have to supervise and mentor the paraprofessionals along with teaching the students (Bartholomay 2001).  

Due to the implementation of No Child Left Behind Act, the educational requirements for paraprofessionals have changed.  Previously, the main requirements were high school diploma, some college education, and/or an associate’s degree (Goodman 2007).  Those requirements still apply, but now paraprofessionals are required to take the ParaPro test.  The test is an assessment of math skills, writing skills and reading skills for prospective practicing paraprofessionals (ETS 2007).

== Relationship between Teacher and Paraprofessional== 
It is important for the teacher to establish a good relationship with the paraprofessional early on.  In the beginning of the year, it is best for the teacher to explain the role that the paraprofessional will have in the classroom.  One of the most important things that the teacher has to explain to the paraprofessional is the limitations that they have with the parents.  The policies for parent and paraprofessional interactions may be different in each school system, so it is extremely important that they are aware.  In some case, the parent may ask the paraprofessional about their child’s performance in class.  The first reaction would be to tell the parent about the child since they observe the child’s performance every day.  If the policy of the school is that only the teacher disposes the information, the teacher has to provide the paraprofessional with the correct language to redirect the parent to the teacher.  A good thing that the teacher can do with the paraprofessional is to have a weekly meeting.  At this time, they can address any concerns or issues that may be present in the classroom.  If any problem ever occurs between the paraprofessional and the teacher, it is important to discuss the issues privately.  In doing so, the teacher does not lessen the paraprofessional’s effectiveness in the classroom (Hauge 2006).

==Are Paraprofessionals Unappreciated?==
{{Rquote|right|...some teachers do not know what to do with us in the classrooms; this should be taught at college level during methods class.  For teachers and administrators that do not have this class, then it should be brought into the school system as workshops.  We are all here for the kids and we need to learn together to be as productive as possible.}}

Some paraprofessionals in some school districts feel unappreciated.  Since they do not have to obtain a bachelor’s or master’s degree, some administrators see them easy to replace.  Some things have been done to make the paraprofessional’s feel appreciated.  In Texas, the state legislature declared that the second Wednesday in May is Paraprofessional Recognition Day (Williams 2003).  The recognition is important because paraprofessionals need to know that they are important to the educational system and that they are valued.
{{clear}}
== Conclusion==
For over the past 50 years, paraprofessionals have been an important asset to the educational system.  Now their position requires more responsibilities and extra qualifications.  The most important aspect of the paraprofessional’s job is to develop a good relationship with the teacher.  Once a good relationship is developed, the teacher and paraprofessional can work in harmony and provide the students with a comfortable and secure environment.  It is also important that the teachers and administrators appreciate the work that the paraprofessional does.  When appreciation and respect are there, it establishes trust between the teacher and paraprofessional.

{{question-answer|question=Explain the positives and negatives of having a paraprofessional in the classroom.
|answer=There are many positives of having a paraprofessional in the classroom.  Their presence reduces the student to teacher ratio in the class.  The para can also do clerical tasks such as making copies for the teacher. When groups of students have to use the restroom, the para can monitor them.  That allows class time not to be interrupted. Along with positives that occur when paras are present in the classroom, there are also negatives. If the relationship between teacher and paraprofessional is not a good one, they will not be as effective at instructing the students. Another negative is that it put extra responsibility on the teacher.  The teacher has to teach the paraprofessional along with the students.  But overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.
----
Having a paraprofessional in the classroom has a positive and negative side just like anything else in life. On the positive side of things, having a paraprofessional in the classroom may help the teacher manage the classroom better. For example, it can reduce the student to teacher ratio in the classroom so that a student or students that need extra attention may receive it. The paraprofessional may reinforce the rules of the classroom and discipline (for instance, taking a student to the principal’s office) while the teacher continues to teach the class without interruption. The paraprofessional may escort students to lunch, art, or PE, while the teacher sets up the classroom until the students arrive back. The paraprofessional may perform secretarial duties to help the teacher like stapling tests, grading papers, making copies, or writing homework on the chalkboard. All this things can help the teacher in a major way a take off a lot of stress the teacher already has. These are only a few of the positive aspects of having a paraprofessional in the classroom. There are certainly many more.On the negative side of things, the teacher may have a problem with training the paraprofessional on the job because the teacher may feel as though they have a heavy enough workload. Also the paraprofessional and the teacher may have different views and beliefs in classroom management, grading, discipline, etc. That may cause a lot of conflict. The paraprofessional may not follow the teacher’s or the school’s rules and cause the teacher to be in jeopardy of losing their job. There are many more negative aspects but these are the main ones. If the teacher and the paraprofessional communicate regularly and establish the way things are going to go in the beginning of the school year these negative aspects can be avoided. &amp;mdash;Danielle Eagins}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What does it mean for leadership to be ethical?}}

Ethical leadership in education is essential in order for principals and teachers to run effective schools.  Principals must show ethical judgment in dealing with teachers as well as students.  Teachers hold the responsibility of ethical judgment, not just to ensure their well-being, but also to act as an example to their students.  Students learn many of their ethical values at school.  It is important to understand the difference between ethics and the law.  “Ethics refers to a system or code of morality embraced by a particular person or group” (Cooper, Ryan p.395).  The law is defined as “a system of rules that governs the general conduct of a particular community’s citizens” (Cooper, Ryan p.395).  While it is true that many laws are grounded in ethics, not all laws are ethical. An example is the segregation of schools in America before the Civil Rights movement.  To make a school work, principals and teachers must work within the law, but they must also create a trusting working relationship with each other and their students through ethics.

==Principals==
Principals have a double responsibility of being leaders to teachers and students. Here are some examples of how principals should treat their teachers:  
# Contracts are not broken unilaterally.  
# Anonymous information is not used to injure others.  
# One does not personally profit from the position held.  
# Confidential materials are kept confidential.  
# One does not use school employees and school materials for personal matters.  
# Expense accounts are not falsified. 
# School leaders tell the truth, have integrity, and adhere to the ethics of the profession (Phi Delta Kappa ’98).  

All of these rights are things that teachers should be able to count on from their principals.  However, that power must never be abused, a principal should never act as a dictator.  The relationship between students and principals has always been a stressed one. Children tend to dread being sent to the principal’s office, because they have that air of authority.  Principals have difficult jobs in that they are often the people parents complain to first and they have to report to the superintendent.  Suppose you were a principal and one of your students had a problem with the way a teacher said something in class, they report it to their parents, and before you know it the superintendent is calling you on the phone demanding the dismissal of that teacher.  The teacher has not had any kind of due process in this case.  There are two kinds of due process “substantive due process, which has to do with the issue itself” and “the other, procedural due process, which concerns the fairness of the process followed” (Ryan, Cooper p.405).  The teacher should have been given an investigation into the case before the superintendent called you.  Do you have the gumption to tell your superior “no”?   In short, principals must “work with employees who are more articulate now than ever in voicing their needs, with parents who wish to become more involved in the day-to-day operations of the schools, with legislators who desire to provide more detailed direction to schools regarding specific programs or activities, and with school boards feeling the pressure from all of the groups, who desire to ‘keep control’ or ‘manage’ the schools” (Phi Delta Kappa ’98).

==Teachers==
Teachers have a responsibility to act as an unbiased ethical example to their students.  One way for teachers to start this is to decide on what ethical code of conduct to use in their classroom.  This involves identifying several traits and attitudes they feel their students should follow, and then modeling these behaviors.  One example is placing the student’s needs before their own, students seeing this may one day come to appreciate the effort (Killion, 2001).  Teachers today are up against great ethical obstacles; a 2002 poll by the Josephson Institute of Ethics (a non-profit organization) discovered that 74% of 12,000 high school students admitted to cheating on a test the year before (Lehr, 2003).  This being the case, it becomes imperative that teachers teach ethics to their students.  Teachers are in a position of power, they have the authority to send students to the principal's office, decide grades, and have parent-teacher conferences.  Everyone remembers at least one teacher in their grade school career they were afraid of.  Teachers also must learn to regulate themselves so that they do not abuse their power.  After all “stewardship asks leaders to acknowledge their own human faults and limitations rather than hiding behind their status and power” (Lashway, ‘97).  The National Education Association (NEA) has a code of ethics that is used by the teaching profession as a whole.  In it’s preamble it states that “The educator, believing in the worth and dignity of each human being, recognizes the supreme importance of the pursuit of truth, devotion to excellence, and the nurture of democratic principles” (Ryan, Cooper p.402).  It then goes on to list two basic principles, a commitment to the student, and a commitment to the profession (Ryan, Cooper p.402)  In a way, being a teacher is a bit like being a doctor, including the pledging of ethical treatment to those they serve.  Ethical decisions will not always be cut and dry.  “An ‘ethical dilemma’ is not a choice between right and wrong, but a choice between two rights” (Lashway, ’97).  For example: Making a choice between two students who are both equally qualified to be on the debate team.  Being a teacher requires the skills to make decisions that are not always easy. In addition to student responsibilities, teachers have their own code of conduct or responsibilities to adhere by which may include all or some of the following: instructing students by using guidelines of courses of study provided for the grade and subject matter taught, planning instructions in order to provide efficient teaching and learning, keeping accurate attendance on a daily basis, counseling students who have any problems or referring students to the principal if problems are severe, storing and using supplies and equipment properly, reporting any repairs to the office, attending faculty and staff meetings, sponsoring school or class clubs upon the request of the principal, using the cumulative records of each student to aid in understanding their progress to help them individually, evaluating the achievement of each student and recognizing development, understanding the school board’s policy, and fulfilling any duty assignments etc.  These responsibilities should be performed every day during the school year by the teacher unless otherwise instructed.  The student is always the top priority, and the teacher’s main responsibility (Teacher Responsibilities).

==School Success==
A successful school is one governed by ethics.  It is not only a delicate balance of what is right and wrong, but of opinion and circumstance.  Conveying this idea to employees, parents, and students has been the challenge of teachers and administrators since schools began.  The “moral imperatives of the effective leader embody shared values, trust, honesty, fairness, equity, empowerment, human dignity, doing the right thing, rule of law, justice, and beneficence” (Phi Delta Kappa ’98).  For any human being this list can be overwhelming, but for teachers and principals it is imperative that they live by it for the sake of each other and their students.

{{question-answer|question=Does the principal have a greater responsibility to the teacher or the students?  Is there a way to balance the two?   Explain.
|answer=A principal’s job is a very difficult one.  When it comes to balancing between responsibility to student or teacher, I think it must be handled on a case by case basis.  The principal should never, without consulting the teacher, undermine their authority; however, in extreme cases (abuse, sexual misconduct) it may be necessary.  In most cases the teacher’s word should be accepted as law.  Every situation will be different and should be handled as such.  Never should a decision be made without evaluating all the facts and consequences.  For example, if a principal does not agree with a teacher’s recommendation, should he or she act against the teacher?  Would this lead to the teacher’s authority and ability to effectively control his or her classroom to come into question (by the students)?  I believe if there is a question the principal should discuss this with the teacher before acting against their requests.  This enables the teacher to keep respect from students and enables the principal to understand the teacher’s request and reasons for it.  There will be some cases where this is not possible.  In these cases it is important for the principal to act diplomatically and be prepared to explain his or her reasons for those actions.  Grey area will come up and should be dealt with accordingly.  A principal is very simply the judge and jury of the school, when it comes to students or teachers. &amp;mdash;April K. Smith}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the legal issues?}}

In every school system in America there are legal issues that are presented.  Each state has there own legal issues that they have as a guideline as to what is right and what is wrong.  Also, they have to meet their state standards.  There are certain laws that each school in the United States must abide by.  Since my fellow classmates and I plan on becoming teachers I plan to focus on the information that will be the most important to us.

==Zero Tolerance Policy==
The zero-tolerance policy is a policy that every education system must follow.  This term is used to describe misbehavior in the school system.  The zero-tolerance is a policy of having no tolerance for transgressions: any infraction of existing laws and regulation, regardless of mistakes, ignorance, or even extenuating circumstances, will be met with full punishment[http://en.wikipedia.org/wki/Zero_Tolerance_(schools)].  Examples, of this would be fighting and drugs.  A student possessing or getting caught using drugs on school property governed by a zero-tolerance policy could immediately suffer the highest possible consequence for their actions.  Many organizations avoid these policies because it binds those in authority to an action, regardless of circumstances.  The policy must be written extremely explicitly or it may have negative consequences[http://en.wikipedia.org/wki/Zero_Tolerance_(schools)].  The school may not make up rules as they go because it does not inform the students between right and wrong.  In some jurisdictions, zero-tolerance policies have come into conflict with freedom of religion rules already in place allowing students to carry, for example, kirpans.  Most policies were enacted after the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance_(schools)].  This act was put into place to give the students an opportunity to act like adults, but have discipline when necessary.  Zero tolerance results in expulsion or suspension irrespective of any legitimate explanation.  In many instances it also results in having the student arrested.  In April 2003 the American Bar Associated Journal gathered some information about the effects of the zero tolerance policy.  Nationwide, statistics gathered by the Justice Policy Institute and the U.S. Department of Education show that crime of all sorts is down at public schools since 1990- some studies say by as much as 30 percent.  Less than 1 percent of all violent incidents involving adolescents occur on school grounds.  Indeed, a child is three times more likely to be struck by lightening than to be killed violently at school[http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/juvjus/zerotolerancereprt.html].  This policy is important to all members of the education system.  It is the basic guidelines that we have to follow in order to know how to take control over a certain situation and what the punishment for that student will be.

==No Child Left Behind Act==
The No Child Left Behind Act is an act that is nationwide to help make sure that all students are getting the resources and material they need to be successful in the classroom. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, commonly known as NCLB, is a United States federal law that was passed in the House of Representatives on May 23, 2001 and signed on January 8, 2002, that reauthorized a number of federal programs aiming to improve the performance of U.S. primary and secondary schools by increasing the standards of accountability for states, school districts and schools, as well as providing parents more flexibility in choosing which schools their children will attend. It promoted an increased focus on reading and re-authorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind]. This act is one of the best things that the government inquired into the school system. The No Child Left Behind act requires that (by the end of the 2006-2007 school year) all teachers be “highly qualified” as defined in the law. A highly qualified teacher is one who has (1) fulfilled the state’s certification and licensing requirements, (2) obtained at least a bachelor’s degree, and (3) demonstrated subject matter expertise. The procedure for demonstrating subject matter knowledge depends on a teacher’s tenure and level of instruction. Elementary teachers must pass a state test demonstrating their subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading/language arts, writing, mathematics and other areas of basic elementary school curricula. Middle and high school teachers must demonstrate a high level of competency in each academic subject area they teach, such demonstration can occur either through passage of a rigorous state academic subject or successful completion of an undergraduate major, a graduate degree, coursework equivalent to an undergraduate major or an advanced certification or credentialing. These requirements have caused some difficulty in implementation especially for special education teachers and teachers in small rural schools who are often called upon to teach multiple grades and subjects[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind]. This act puts pressure on the teacher to make sure they are helping the students and giving them enough help when necessary. During the year the child will be watched and make sure they are getting the proper information. This act requires that the teachers send home progress reports and report cards, so the parents can watch the progress of their children. The progress of all students will be measured annually for math and reading in grades 3-8 and at least once during high school[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind]. This act makes sure that each child is educated to the best of their ability.

==Americans With Disabilities Act==
The act that helps students with disabilities and special education would be the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). President George H.W. Bush introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. The ADA is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits, under certain circumstances, discrimination based on disability. It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Disability is defined, as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limit’s a major life activity.” The determination of whether any particular condition is considered a disability is made on a case-by-case basis. Certain specific conditions are excluded as disabilities, such as current substance abusers and transsexuality[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act]. The ADA is one of the best acts that could have been interpreted into the school system because it allows every individual the same opportunity whether they have a disability or not. These students are not treated equal and are able to go to regular classrooms with other students. 

==Religion==
Throughout school many educators have been faced with the issues of religion. They had to face the fact of whether it could be taught in public schools or if the information they were providing their students had anything to do with religious views. It is stated that any school event is not allowed to have anything to do with religion associated with it. In many cases the Lemon Test is used to decide if the subject has religion in it. The Establishment Clause is a clause where the government cannot decide on one particular religion. A major question that is faced is whether or not students should be allowed to prayer during a school functioning. In its most recent consideration of prayer in the public schools, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that student-led, prayers before football games violated the Establishment Clause. The Ninth Circuit, on two occasions, has found that school districts must necessarily refuse to allow students to deliver sectarian prayers or proselytizing speeches at graduation to avoid violating the Establishment Clause (Epley, B). Another problem that is discussed is the moment of silence. A sharply divided Supreme Court invalidated moments of silence for prayer more than 20 years ago, but the battles over moments of silence continue. The Fourth Circuit upheld a Virginia statute mandating a moment of silence in all classrooms during which “each pupil may, in the exercise of his or her individual choice, mediate, pray, or engage in any other silent activity which does not interfere with, distract, or impede other pupils in the like exercise of individual choice”(Epley, B). It is important to know that in Virginia Public Schools that each student is allowed to exercise freely during the moment of silent. 

One of the biggest issues with religion that is being discussed in the school is the subject of Creationism/Intelligent Design. Control of the curriculum has often been a contentious issue, dating to the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial. The most recent decision involves an attempt by a Pennsylvania school district to mandate the teaching of Intelligent Design in high school biology. Intelligent Design is considered a theological argument. The Court concluded that the purpose of including Intelligent Design in the curriculum was to promote religion in public schools and that the policy failed both the Lemon Test and the Endorsement Test (Epley, B). In the United States there is not an official religion, so many parents do not want their children being taught Intelligent Design because some believe it goes against their religion.

==Conclusion==
The public schools have many policies that a teacher must abide by, but the ones presented here are the most important.  We must use these policies when we are an educator to do our best and succeed at our career.

{{question-answer|question=Why is the Zero Tolerance Policy important to education? What would you do with a student in your classroom that breaks a rule?
|answer=One of the most important policies that was contributed to the school systems in the United States is the Zero Tolerance Policy. This policy does not allow students to break rules and regulations without proper discipline. If a student fails to follow certain rules and regulations they will be given full punishment. For example, many schools do not allow the use of alcohol, drugs, or fighting. The student signs the Code of Conduct at the beginning of the school year to say that they will abide by all rules and will not break any of them.
Students in my classroom are going to break the rules to a certain degree and as the educator I am going to have to take charge. For example, if two students were to fight in the middle of my classroom I will have to make the decision on what to do with these students. The first thing I would have to do is get these children out of my classroom, so that my other students are not in danger. As the educator it is my responsible to protect each student in my classroom to the best of my ability. After I got these students out of my classroom I would call the principal or security officer to come escort these children to the office. Once the students get into the office they will have to talk to the principal. After the students are done talking I will have to give my version of the story. Once all information is given the principal will make a decision based on what he has been told. The Zero Tolerance Policy gives the principal the right to make decisions based on the information provided. This policy addresses the fact that the school system does not allow fighting. The principal has the choice to give the students in-school suspension, out of school suspension or expel them based on his opinions of how bad the situation is. This policy is important and it will be an issue that many educators will have to face.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How are schools financed?}}

&quot;Money doesn't grow on trees&quot;.  That was the saying that most parents used when their child would ask them for money.  If money did grow on trees, economic and educational resources would not be as scarce as they are now.  Schools struggle everyday to find funds for their students.  It becomes more difficult as technology and population begin to expand.  One event that sparked the need for better resources and technology in schools was the launch of Sputnik.  It established that the expectations that school improvement was tied to national political and economic goals(Everhart70).  This goes back to the United States wanting to be the powerhouse over all the other countries.  This placed stress on schools for their students to improve in technology and all around education.  In order for this to occur, there was a higher demand for educational resources.  The resources usually either come from the state or federal government.  There are various ways schools can receive financial.  The various strategies are spelled out throughout this section.

==State Funding==
The states provide some funding for public schools.  They provide funding for the infrastructure and for academic resources.  Most of a school's funding actually is generated from the state.  There are various funding mechanisms that schools can use in order to gain more money for resources. 

===Grants===
One funding mechanism is grants.  The good thing about grants is that the money does not have to be repaid to the donor.  The type of grants given differs from state to state.  The categories consist of flat grants, equalizing grants, categorical grants, and full state funding(Sielke 654).  While most might think that a huge percentage of their funds are allocated through grants, this is not the case.

===Voter Approved Bond Issues===
The vast majority of states rely on voter approved bond issues to fund some, if not all, of their infrastructure needs(Sielke 654). A lot of schools are in dire need of infrastructure funding.  Some schools are dirty and unsafe for students.  Students should not be forced to learn in an unhealthy environment.  Who wants to wake up every morning knowing that they have to stay and learn in a run down school for at least six hours?  Most would prefer not to suffer through that.  Thus people would assume that the voter approved bond issues are a reliable source to receive funding aid from.  However, there are a few problems with this financial source.  The problem with these bond issues is that they are tied to property wealth.  So basically, the rich just keep getting richer.  The amount of property wealth limits the size of the bond issue and places a heavier burden on taxpayers in low wealth districts(Sielke 654.) The schools that are in low-income areas are the schools that need the most funds.  Unfortunately, if they were to use this source, they would not receive nearly as much funds as another school may receive.  

==Federal Funding==
The federal government also plays a role in school funding.  Probably not a large of a role as the state, but it is beneficial.  The federal government also offers grants to the schools.  Federal competitive grants account for $100 Billion of the $400 Billion distributed in assistance programs annually(Gosmire 161).  There is money out there for schools.  They may have to search a little harder for the funds.  Obviously, the federal government is not a large contributor.  There is an extra $300 billion dollars that can be allocated to some schools.  A person can never stress enough the importance for applying for grants.

===Federal Impact Aid===
The legislature for Federal Impact Aid was passed in 1950.  It was originally intended for the sole purpose of providing financial relief to local school districts that were burdened by activities of the federal government (Zimmer,Buddin,Gill 939).  This burden could contain a multitude of things.  One main problem is the increase in population at a certain school.  When there are more people, more resources are needed to accommodate them.  Currently, the federal impact aid program provides $900 million per year in subsidies to approximately 1,400 local school districts which enroll 12 million eligible children (Zimmer et al.)  If the government were to allocate the maximum funds the schools could receive, the monetary amount will be a lot higher.  The government seems to always find a way to deprive funds from people who need it the most.  They can spend billions of dollars on wars, but what about the youth.  They are the key to the future.  We want competent leaders in the future.  The government should be more willing to give up the maximum amount of money.  To determine how much money each school is allowed, the government has a funding formula.  This formula creates the basic support payment that is partially distributed to the schools.  The first part of the formula is the weighted adjustments for the federally-connected students.  The federally-connected students are the students eligible for aid. Listed below are the federally-connected students and their weighted adjustments.

Children of military parents living on base=1.0

Children living on Native American Reservations=1.25

Children of federal civilian employees living on federal property=1.0

Children of military parents living off base=0.1

Children living in low-rent housing=0.1

Children of federal civilian employees not living on federal property=.05

To determine the basic support payment, they multiple the total number of students in each category by the weighted adjustment.  For example, if there are 2000 students in a school who have military parents living on base, you would multiply 2000 times 1. Thus the school will receive $2000 for those students.  They would do this for each category.  The Federal Impact aid is good; however, it is still not enough money for the burden the school is taking.  Just think about it, the most the government will give for one child is $1.25.  Books cost a lot more than $1.25.  They can come up with more funds from somewhere.  But who can complain about getting free aid.

==Conclusion==
There are different sources where schools can receive funds from.  The situation is still hard for schools.  Most funding is not total funding.  They could possibly give out more money, but for some odd reason they do not allocate the maximum amount of funds.  The state provides the majority of the funds for the schools.  Some of those funds come from grants and voter approved bonds.  The federal government also has a small contribution to the national school system.  They provide a few grants and federal impact aid.  Unfortunately, we still need more money for school.  Don't we wish money grew on trees.

{{question-answer|question=What are the advantages and disadvantages of the various sources of school funding?
|answer=There are a few advantages and disadvantages to the funding that some schools receive.  One of the funding sources are grants.  Grants are allocated through the federal and state government.  One advantage of the grant is that it is easily accessible.  There is a multitude of grant money ready to be given out.  People just have to search for it.  In addition, the money does not have to be paid back.  However, the disadvantage of the grant is that there is no way the government will give out all of the money that they set aside for grants.  They hardly give away 10% of the total grant funds.  The next source is voter approved bond issues.  The good part about this resource is that it provides the school with infrastructure funds. Some schools are in dire need of being repaired and this source of funding is extremely helpful.  It is unfortunate to say that it only benefits the wealthy land.  If a school is based near a poor neighbor, it has a less likelihood of receiving those funds.  In all reality, those are the schools that probably needs those funds the most.  The last source mentioned was the federal impact aid.  The advantage of this funding is that the government pays the schools for the increase in the student body.  The increase in the student body causes for an increase in the resources for those students.  When looking at the equations on how they distribute the money, the results are lopsided.  In essence, the schools are receiving, at maximum, $1.25 per student.  This is not even enough to buy that student the books they need for all of their classes. In conclusion, there are benefits and drawbacks to most sources of funding.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the standards movement?}}

==The Need for Reform==

===Changing Global Conditions===
Traditionally, federal and state governments delegated their authority over public education to local school districts that ultimately placed it in the hands of text book publishers and teachers (Wixson et. al. 70). However, after the Publication of ''A Nation at Risk'' in 1983 the concern for public education came into the national spotlight. This document warned that our previous leadership in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation was being surpassed by international competitors and that “knowledge, learning information, and skilled intelligence are the new raw materials of international commerce …” It also further suggested that the federal government should exert more control over education. This pushed business leaders, politicians, and educators alike into motion for educational reform. We are now forced not only to live up to our own national standards but we must also now live up to world standards set by competing countries. Electronic media, international trade agreements, and the increasing capability of third world countries to produce goods have forced the United States to rethink and redefine education (Rhoads et. al, 1).

===Equality in Education===
Equality in the educational arena has also been another major force in the push for change. Traditionally school funding was provided largely from local property taxes, thus students living in economically disadvantaged localities had substantially fewer resources and ultimately an inadequate education as evidenced by what had been called the “achievement gap”. The National Assessment of Educational Progress noted a substantial gap between minority and white students in the 1970’s, only to resurge in the 1990’s. After years of legal battles during the 70’s and 80’s the responsibility of funding began to rely more heavily on the state (McClure 3-4).

==The Standards Movement==
Throughout the course of the 1980s, several reform efforts were implemented and as pointed out by Massell, imposed requirements with out specifying what exactly the content should consist of and proved to “‘lack the substantive grist necessary for meaningful school-based change’” (cited in Wixson et. al., 71). Also, with such a large buffet of curricula being served to American children these new policies, each individually designed for different sets of standards and objectives only added to the lack of coherence in our educational system. As a way to address these issues a more coherent and systematic policy began to emerge in the 1990’s. In an attempt to remedy the basic skills orientation that had plagued American schools for decades the new focus was on the ability to reason, problem solve, apply knowledge and increase competency in written and oral communication skills (Wixson et. al, 71-72). The new systematic reform effort saw teaching as the most direct route to changes in student learning, it was a means to provide top-down support for bottom-up instructional improvement in schools across the nation. To achieve this end the Consortium for Policy Research in Education recommended that this type of reform must include three integral components: (a) establishing challenging academic standards; (b)aligning policies such as testing, professional development and accountability; and (c) restructuring the governance system to delegate overtly to schools the responsibility for developing instructional approaches to meet the standards that the state will hold them accountable for  (Wixson et. al., 71). This was the beginning of an effort by our Federal Goverment to align policy with results by implementing standards and annual assessments and then holding individual schools accountable for the results. NCEST or The National Council on Education Standards and Testing stated that, &quot;'high national standards tied to assessments can create high expectations for all students and help to better target resources'&quot; (cited in Wixson, et. al., 73). 

Today the continuing Standards Movement still is a ways off, in 1996 Tommy Thompson, the Governor of Wisconsin, said that, &quot;We might get national standards eventually. But the only way it's going to happen is bottom up, through coalitions of states “ (Frontline).  Most school districts in the country today subscribe to a state standard which is a step in the right direction. Although some criticize the  corporate America is having too much of an influence on curriculum development (Frontline). Refreshing upon the changes happening lately speaking at a convention October 2001, Lou Gerstner said, &quot;Let's not forget where things stood when we convened the 1996 Education Summit. It was a bad time for public education reform, bordering on fatalistic. And the debate over standards -- standards as the centerpiece of public school reform -- was being conducted with the decorum of a street fight.&quot;  So education reform is taking a definite step in the right direction. Louis Gerstner, Chairman of IBM said it best, &quot;The work of putting standards in place was difficult and often painful,victory isn't 45 or 50 well-crafted documents that spell out what a high school diploma ought to stand for. The goal here -- our No. 1 national priority according to the American people -- is delivering radically improved student performance” (Frontline).

===Goals 2000: Educate America Act===
The result was The Goals 2000: Educate America Act of 1994 which “gave federal grants to state departments to develop state curriculum standards” and became the “basic building blocks” of the systematic reform (McClure 4). At the same time the Federal Government was also funding the private development of national standards, the idea was that both state and federal standards could be forged together and that once this was established all other areas of education could be redirected accordingly (Wixson et.al., 74). Simultaneously, the reauthorization of The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was signed, which required states to develop and implement standards for all children in order to continue receiving Tile I funds. The Goals 2000 also established a new federal agency, The National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC). This agency was designated to certify national content, performance, and opportunity-to-learn standards (Wixson, et.al. 75). The Federal Governemnt was moving toward a set of national standards by having NESIC approve or certify individual state standards and simultaneously funding the private development of standards, hoping to align them.   

===No Consensus===
The effort to develop acceptable national standards served to be more challenging than anyone had anticipated. Educational experts and professionals alike had differing opinions about what the content standards should be and how they should be addressed. Such controversial disciplines as History and English Language Arts served to be the biggest barrier to consensus. Lynne Cheney charged that the national standards presented “‘the United States and its white, male-dominated power structure as an oppressive society that victimizes minorities and women’” (Diegmueller, cited in Rhoads, et.al., 6). Another controversial subject was English Language Arts, where again experts could not agree about what the standards should be and how the subject matter of reading, writing, speaking, and literature should be addressed. Other barriers included differing beliefs about the very nature and purpose of education. Some believed standards would be explicitly stated and reflected the belief that “essential skills and knowledge could be objectively identified, transmitted directly through teaching, and discretely tested”. Others believed that it was not so cut and dry, that essential skills and knowledge must be obtained through a more contextual and constructive environment and progress would be difficult to adequately assess through standardized tests (Wixson, et. al.). Never the less the failure of these efforts resulted in a demise of the national standards movement and refocused the movement on standards being set by individual states. Also with this decline came the dissolution of NESIC replaced in 1998 by ACHIEVE, a nongovernmental agency designed to guide states on the creation and implementation of standards and assessments (Wixson, et. al. 78).

==No Child Left Behind==
In 2002 president George Bush signed into law the most controversial and possibly the most detrimental bill thus far in the standards movement, No Child Left Behind (NCLB). It is another reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and requires states to develop minimum standards, give annual assessments and also demonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). AYP is based off of initial proficiency as determined by standardized assessments specifically in math and language arts and is expected to increase every year until 100% of students are proficient (Gunning, 10). In the Article ''How to Fix No Child Left Behind'' we are told that schools must do this or face a loss of federal funds which account for 9 % of dollars spent in education. Also NCLB takes the Federal government “where it has never gone before: telling the states how to measure school success, specifying interventions for failure, mandating qualifications for teachers and even telling the nation how to teach reading” (Wallis and Steptoe, 2-3). 

==Results==
===High Stakes Tests===
This has brought us into the current state of education, which by most reviews is not any better than where we started. The attempt was to redirect our schools from the basic skills orientation towards a more cognitive and constructive based curriculum, secure a quality education for all students, and bring us up to par on an international scale. However, with the implementation of NCLB many educators have found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle which forces them to abandon creativity and higher order thinking in order to better prepare students for their annual assessment. One of the key aspects of NCLB and the standards movement was to align content and assessment, and a major bi-product of this movement is high stakes tests. High stakes test are exactly that, a test that determines some sort of outcome such as  a school receiving needed funding or determining graduation eligibility. Annual Assessments or high-stakes tests in theory seem like a great idea. One would think that it would give educators and schools some incentive to raise student achievement in order to meet AYP and receive federal funds. However, in reality this is not the case. Schools all across the nation are participating in what may be called dumbing down the test. According to the article ''How to Fix No Child Left Behind'' an analysis conducted by the non-profit Thomas B. Fordham Foundation found that the quality of education standards which are detailed by grade and subject declined in 30 different states between 2000 and 2006 (Wallis and Steptoe, 6). So instead of raising the standards the states maneuver around this by simply lowering their standards to make it appear as if they are improving. 

===Back to Basics===
The standards movement was also an attempt to get away from the basic skills curriculum, however, with only minimum standards being required and so much emphasis on the test the quality of American education is again being reduced, this time to drill like memorization skills. The teacher, whose job security lies virtually in whether or not their students meet AYP, tend to focus rather heavily on the test, former Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota says, “High-stakes testing is channeling teaching to the kind of rote memorization drill that isn’t education” (Jehelen 4). Indeed this is not education. It has been said that memorization or to recall facts is the lowest level of thinking (Bloom, cited in Berube, 1). In addition to the fact that teachers place a heavy emphasis on teaching the test, NCLB only mandates that students be tested on math and reading, which again narrows the curriculum. According to the article ''How to Fix No Child Left Behind'' we learn that in a study conducted in over 300 hundred school districts, 71% of local administrators admitted that they had cut short other areas in order to place more focus on math and reading and essentially the test. 

===No Equality===
The movement was also supposed to secure equal standards and opportunities for all children including minorities, economically disadvantaged students, and even struggling and disabled students. In the early 90's NCEST reported that the intent of national standards was to raise the ceiling for students who are above average and to lift the floor for those who experience the least success (Wixson et. al., 73). However, this too like most of the other aims of the standards movement has served to be a major disappointment. Vella Trader an elementary school teacher from Battle Creek, Michigan said that she had a student who was struggling and had attempted to enroll the child in Reading Recovery, however, the child was denied. The rationale given by the school was that only those students who are close to passing the state test would be helped. It was better to have a few students fail miserably than many fail by a small margin (rethinkingschools.org 2007). Another example of a similar practice is occurring in Philadelphia, P.A., where students from each grade level who are nither at the bottom or the top of their class are being singled out for intensive review. These students aren't in desperate need of help, but their passing test scores will put the school over the top for AYP. The underachieving students who may also be making progress are not recognized under NCLB because it does not show on the annual assessment.   
(Wallis and Steptoe, 1, ''How to Fix No Child Left Behind''). Instead of focusing energy and resources on those students who need it the most, it is the students who will impact the test results who recieve the extra help. NCLB does not seem to be enhancing equality in education at all, it actaully seems to be having the opposite effect. Our focus in education is shifting from learning to passing the test.

==Conclusion== 
{{Rquote|right|Certainly there are few areas of American life as important to our society, to our people, and to our families as our schools and colleges|Ronald Reagan}}          

In the past 40 years we have come full circle as we have tried to redefine and change the way in which we teach children in order to keep up with the changing demands of the global village. We not only lag behind our counterparts in academic ability but we are lagging behind in what Wallis and Steptoe call “21st century skills”. They say we are aiming too low, competency in math and reading are the meager minimum and that scientific and technical skills are also absolutely necessary but insufficient in the U.S. (2 ''How to Bring Our Schools Out of the 20th century''). We must solve the problems with in our educational system or the U.S. is bound to be “left behind” in the global economy because we are shaping a whole generation of children who don’t have the necessary skills to compete. Education is the foundation of our nation’s prosperity and it should be first on the agenda of every politician and American Citizen.

{{question-answer|question=In what ways would you change our current educational practices in order to better prepare our future leaders to keep up with the changing face of the globe?  
|answer=There are many changes that need to be made in our educational system. First we must establish a national set of standards with out such an emphasis on assessment. We need to focus on the skills that children will use in the real world such as problem solving, the ability to reason, independent thinking and hands on experience with the most recent technology. We need to implement serious change in order to help fix the damage already done. In addition to focusing on math and reading I would also expand on the content standards to include science, technological and global skills. These could include learning at least two foreign languages and being familiar and sensitive to other cultures. I would also expose children to the highest quality technology available and engage them in problem solving using these technologies. I would also change the role of assessment in our country. It seems as if there is so much emphasis now on the tests we are getting away from what is really important, which is the quality of the education we are providing. I would not be concerned about who is wrong or right about what should be taught. I would be concerned with learning. If national assessments were absolutely necessary I would expand them to include other examples of progress such as portfolios and my assessments would be more holistic. I would also give teachers a big raise. Teachers go to college not for fun, but to have a rewarding career, job security, and most importantly to get paid. Education is just like any other business where incentive makes you work harder. It really is too bad that our government chooses to spend billions of dollars on the so called “war on terror” when it is needed so bad internally to fix education and healthcare. What will happen when we are unable to make the grade internationally and our standard of living goes down and with that the financial ability to defend ourselves? Then we will really be vulnerable. &amp;mdash;Sandy Cavey
----
The first thing that I want to address is that although as a society we maybe behind on our current educational practices we must remember that children need to be children.  I am all for educational and technological advances but not to the degree that we stop nurturing our children.  In some aspects of education, we have moved to quickly that we have failed to recognize that all children have a different learning style and labeled as having a disability because their style was not recognized. In order for children to keep up, the parents need to be aware of the changes so they can support and fight for the best educational curriculum and practices.

One of the changes that I would make is making preschool available to every child no matter where they lived. Whether the child comes from a wealthy, middle-class, or low-income family, they can start preschool.  Children not exposed to basic preschool practices are viewed disabled.  A child not exposed to these practices by a certain age will not have a hard time for the rest of their lives. Children soak up information like a sponge especially if presented to them in a fun and interesting way.  The second thing is to stop teaching students to memorize test. If you want to test students on prior knowledge, that is fine.  I think that there should be an essay or “what do you think” type questions on these standardized test to show if students have strong critical thinking skills. The last thing, (and there are many) is the real-time remediation.  Before any child leaves a grade, they should make sure that they understand what they learned and understand their mistakes.  If a child or adult does not understand why they made a mistake, they will repeat it.  If we want to see a change in our educational curriculum, we need support from parents, money, and for our teachers to make sure that all students are finishing at the same level.  I think that these could just be the beginning steps before we advance to the next level for a global curriculum. &amp;mdash;A. Lancaster}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Can schools integrate vocational and academic learning?}}

Basic skills, Thinking skills, and Personal qualities are the, “foundations,” deemed necessary for America’s youth to possess in order to be successful upon graduation from high school.  “Look beyond your discipline and your classroom to the other courses your students take, to your community, and to the lives of your students outside school.  Help your students connect what they learn in class to the world outside (Moore, 2003).” These foundations as identified in the Secretary’s Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) report, and the five workplace competencies, together have to be developed on a daily basis in the classroom by integrating vocational and academic learning,

There are Five Competencies found in the SCANS Report:
# Resources: Identifies, organizes, plans, and allocates resources. Examples would include time, money, material and facilities, and human resources.
# Interpersonal: Works with others. Examples would include participating as a member of a team, teaching others new skills, serving clients/customers, exercising leadership, negotiating, and working with diversity.
# Information: Acquires and uses information. Examples would include acquiring and evaluating information, organizing and maintaining information, interpreting and communicating information, and using computers to process information.
# Systems: Understands complex inter-relationships. Examples would include understanding systems, monitoring and correcting performance, improving or designing systems.
# Technology: Works with a variety of technologies. Examples would include selecting technology, appling technology to a task, and maintaining and troubleshooting equipment.

The use of alternative assessments is a way for classroom teachers to link students’ academic needs/skills with real world experiences that are required to enter the workforce.

==Basic Skills==
Basic skills are defined as reading, writing, listening, speaking, and performing arithmetic/mathematical operations (SCANS report, 1992).  Most curricula are designed to incorporate these basic skills in daily lessons.  The challenge is for teachers to educate the students to take these basic skills and apply them to their real world experiences.  This can be accomplished through hands on lessons and alternative assessments.  Educators are almost forced to use traditional assessments and are unable to think and teach outside of the box, in order to prepare students for state examinations.  Traditional assessments require students to regurgitate information that is memorized, as opposed to alternative assessments that allow the students to prove their knowledge using hands on methods.  Integrating vocational education can only complete these basic skills.  “The stock market game,” is an assessment that can be used in all subjects.  Each course is able to make changes necessary for it to be relevant to its subject matter.  History teachers are able to use the stock market game to show the affects of the great depression.  A government teacher is able to show how policies and elections can affect how people respond to change.  Students would be required to research stocks and give written reports explaining their results.  Presentations are then prepared so that individuals are able to show successful and unsuccessful portfolios.

==Thinking Skills==
The scan’s report refers to thinking skills as the ability to think creatively, make decisions, solve problems, visualize, knows how to learn and reasons.  The need for effective problem solving and higher level thinking skills is essential inside and outside the classroom.   Fortner (2006) suggests that providing alternative assessments taps into higher level thinking and problem solving skills, invokes real-world applications, uses tasks that represent meaningful instructional activities and encourages students to continue learning beyond the scope of the assignment (include reference).  “Sell my mobile,” is an assessment that will allow students to develop thinking skills while incorporating other foundation skills.  Each student will have a snowmobile that they are required to sell in order to raise money for a down payment for a car.  They are given a pre-determined monthly salary that will be factored in their decision making.  Students are required to create flyers for advertisement that will be used to sell their snow mobile.  Research will be required to determine the cost of snowmobiles, current car prices, insurance and interest rates.  Calculating monthly expenses will determine the type of car the student will be able to afford. Decisions on the selling price and what is affordable will have to be made in order for the student to be successful on this assessment.   

==Personal Qualities==
The display of responsibility, self-esteem, sociability, self-management, integrity and honesty define personal qualities (SCANS,1992).  In helping students develop personal quality, it is vital that teachers model good moral character.  Focusing on such things as citizenship, responsibilities, and self-management can aid in developing these qualities.  In today’s workforce employers seek individuals that are able to complete tasks with minimal supervision.    Integrity and honesty are as important in the workplace as they are in the classroom.  A student that “borrows,” his neighbors’ answers on a test only learns at an early age how to cheat and learns to use others trust in him against them.  Managers would rather focus their attention on increasing profits and customer service instead of focusing on the cashier whose register seems to come up short often.  Personal qualities are usually taking for granted, especially in a society where customer service is a thing of the past having minimal person to person contact.  Creating a job list and assigning students tasks to complete in the classroom is a good way to teach responsibility and self-management.  Creating a task that requires the work of multiple students creates the opportunity to develop sociability.  Ensuring the task is complete to the teachers’ specifications creates integrity and honesty, while giving praise for a job well done builds self esteem.  According to Vaughan (2007), it is the responsibility of the teacher to develop the whole child.

==Conclusion==
The standard curriculum is an excellent place to teach skills that will last a lifetime (SCANS) and help our students to become productive, well-adjusted members of society.  SCANS skills are not only appropriate for workforce development, but they are also key factors for academic success in K-12 classrooms (Moore 2003).  “Educators have to instill in students the perspective on results that the SCANS skills demand.  If you do not, you will be failing your students and your community as they try to adjust to the next century.  You, more than anyone, are responsible for helping our children develop the skills they need.”  As quoted by the Secretary of labor in his 1992 SCANS report, it is believed that students are graduating from high school into a world they are not adequately prepared for.  It is essential and necessary to integrate vocational and academic learning.  Through this we are able to develop the, “foundation,” as identified by the SCANS report.

{{question-answer|question=When trying to integrate vocational skills and academic learning, how would you use a combination of traditional assessments and alternative assessments to develop your students?
|answer=In today’s fast pace society, it is essential that students are fully equipped to enter the work force upon graduation. While the optimal choice would be for students to enter into a college program immediately after high school, the fact still remains that the foundation for professional success should be developed prior to completing high school. Most curricula are not designed to integrate vocational skills in the classroom. It has become the responsibility of teachers to incorporate these lifelong skills in their daily lessons. One such way is through the use of alternative assignments and assessments. Alternative assessments and assignments are the gateway to higher level thinking. Combining the foundation skills set forth in the SCANS report with alternative assessments and assignments ensures that the need for vocational skills are met.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How do we plan lessons, and why is it important?}}

Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them and without one; it will be difficult to write lesson plans.  Using a (curriculum) guide, teachers create effective lesson plans that are based on the state’s goals and objectives (what is intended that students learn) (Kizlik, 2007).  Research indicates that all students benefit from and appreciate well-structured lessons.  Lesson plans are written by teachers to help them structure the learning for themselves and for students (Kizlik, 2007).  The lesson plan ensures that instruction is presented in a clear and logical sequence and tells everyone that a teacher is organized.  Having clearly stated objectives and creative strategies in lesson plans can almost guarantee that students will not become bored since weak lesson plans can contribute to chaotic classroom environments. Planning lessons is a fundamental skill all teachers must develop and hone, although implementation of this skill does take some time. (Kizlik, 2007).  It is therefore important that new teachers ask for help when they are having difficulty writing their plans.  Furthermore, planning lessons are important because it focuses on the objectives and goals that you want to meet in your classroom.  What concept or objective does a teacher need to focus on?  What strategy should a teacher use in implementing the goal or concept?  Lesson plans are important because it helps teachers decide what they need to accomplish in their classroom and how much time to allow for instruction.  

Imagine, being hired as a new teacher, walking into your classroom for the first time with no guidance from the administration and no guide for your teaching curriculum. How intimidating! What do you teach, how do you teach it? This is not a nightmare. This is happening in many schools even today. This leads us to a very important tool for every new teacher, the curriculum guide. With the use of the curriculum guide you will be led down the path of your entire year. This guide will direct you to what your students will learn. This guide will help you build your lesson plans. Why do we need lesson plans? Why are they important? The following paragraphs will lay out basic tools for producing effective lesson plans and explain why these plans are so important to teacher and student success.

==What is a Lesson?==
In a classroom, a lesson focuses on the teaching and learning activities to be carried out during a specific period of time. A lesson plan is a logical arrangement of concepts/ideas or skills to be covered during the teaching and learning process. 

Initially when a new teacher is hired they should receive a curriculum guide from the school administrator. This guide lays out the state standards. These standards are the base points from which lesson plans begin. They are also the goals you want to reach in your teaching. If your school does not have a curriculum guide seek out a fellow teacher as a mentor. It needs to be someone who is very willing to share their experience.  Then follow the steps below starting with your state learning standards as your objectives.

Andrew Johnson, an assistant professor of Mankato State University in Minnesota specializes in teacher education and effectiveness. He has designed an outline for lesson planning. He has taken the infamous Madeline Hunter model and simplified it into five steps:
  
1. '''The objective''': this is the standard from the curriculum guide, what you want the students to learn, keep them clear and simple. These can be used to build tests from.

2. '''The introduction''': this links the new information to what the students already know, this should also include something to arouse student interest and curiosity, something to motivate learning. The more interesting the introduction, the more interested the students.

3. '''The input''': easily lay out in outline form what exactly is to be taught. Step by step instructions that correspond to the objectives. This section can include prompts to remind oneself of visual aids to be used. This should also include questions that will test the students' comprehension.&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

4.'''The activity''': this step involves action with the input. This is what the students are going to do with the new information, how they will apply what they have learned. Bloom's taxonomy divides verbs into six categories to develop activities on different levels

5. '''Closure and review''' (optional): this is used to reflect on the objectives that should have been learned and may also be a lead into the next lesson.

The review can be looked at two ways. It can be an optional review for the students of the information they received, or it can be used as the teacher’s review of the lesson. An effective teacher must take the time to review the lesson and take note of any changes, additions or adjustments that need to be made.These five simple steps explain how to build a lesson plan.
 
==Why Do We Need Lesson Plans?==
Effective lesson plans lead teachers through what they need to teach and inform students of what they are responsible for learning. If the lesson plan is effective, it will lay out the objectives of what is to be learned, the input of how it will be learned and the activity that will reinforce the learning. It is important that the activity corresponds with the objective so that it will help the students retain the information.  Lessons need to make the students active learners. Teachers that go home at the end of the day exhausted are doing too much of the work and the students are not doing enough.

When a teacher takes the time to build an effective lesson plan, it allows for purposeful instruction.  The teacher knows the goals and how to reach them. Through building lesson plans the teacher explores the curriculum and becomes well informed. When the teacher is well informed they are confident and comfortable about their instruction.  

When the teacher has a plan it allows the students to spend time learning rather than wondering what they are going to learn. With an effective lesson plan, the teacher has planned activities that will reinforce the lesson. This keeps the students engaged and interested. Without well planned lessons, the students lose focus and interest. When the students lose interest, the classroom becomes chaotic. Nothing gets accomplished with chaos. An effective lesson plan helps with classroom management. When students are involved in learning, they don’t have time to misbehave. It is important to integrate technology into today’s classes. The students are interested in technology therefore they are interested in learning lessons through technology.

With all this, the important thing for all new teachers to remember is to take time to build effective lesson plans. The objectives are simply stated so the teacher knows what is to be taught and the students know what they are responsible for learning. The activities need to correspond with the objectives to make active learners retain information. With effective lesson plans both teachers and students know where they are going and what steps are going to take them there. This always makes for a successful trip.

==Technologically Integrated Lesson Plans==
One of the newest challenges facing teachers today, is not simply designing a lesson plan, but designing a lesson plan that effectively incorporates new technological standards into an already well-established curriculum.  Many novice teachers are finding that they are not only new to the education field, but they are also somewhat pioneers in a rapidly evolving field.   Researchers at the Project on the Next Generation of Teachers have found that the lack of support surrounding fledgling educators has led to a &quot;revolving door&quot; of new teachers who find that they were not nearly as satisfied with their chosen craft as they once believed they would be.  So where can these new teachers turn for guidance? The researchers believe that the answer lies in reinforcing the support system on a local and individual school level which will require a great deal of reform.  It is not a time for teachers to be resting on their proverbial laurals, but rather learning and devising new strategies that will ensure a successful future for educaters and students alike.

You can only grow if you have some direction. Thus, if you dare to teach, you must never cease to learn. Teaching, growing and learning are continuous, lifelong processes….As your lesson plans grow, you grow, and your students will grow with you.”&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

{{question-answer|question=How do effective lesson plans build successful teachers and students?
|answer=Effective lessons plans help to build successful teacher and students in several different ways.  First an effective lesson plan can help to build a successful teacher by giving them a fun and creative way to adequately teach the students.  By having effective lesson plans the teacher can also build their confidence.  Second effective lesson plans can build successful students because if you have a teacher who is confident in their lesson plan and it is interactive and engaging the students will retain more information and in the end gain more from an effective lesson plan than an ineffective lesson plan.  Using effective lesson plans will make the students want to learn more and be more connected with the subject and lesson.  Overall, I believe that effect lesson plans can build successful students and teachers by building their confidence and gaining their interest.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What constitutes an effective instructional method?}}
{{Rquote|right|The mediocre teacher tells.  The good teacher explains.  The superior teacher demonstrates.  The great teacher inspires.|William Arthur Ward }}

How do you feel when you are being taught material that you don't understand or should have knowledge of?  You might feel unprepared, stupid, confused, scared, or anxious.  Every student has felt this way at one moment.  How can teachers help their students avoid these feelings?  In order to ensure a child's success, teachers must construct an effective instructional method.  Discovering students’ learning styles, using technology, placing students in small groups, creating a conducive learning environment, and establishing a positive teacher/student bond are examples of various ways that constitute an effective instructional method.

==Discover Your Students' Learning Styles==
It is essential for teachers to instruct according to their students’ learning styles.  It is difficult to discover what works for different students. When the professor or teacher of a classroom choose a particular teaching style and it mismatches with the way the students learn it can cause serious downfalls. The first and most obvious downfall is that the student will lose interest quickly and become bored and inattentive. When a student is bored then they do not pay attention which is most likely to result in poor test grades. When students receive bad test grades it discourages them from even trying. When a student feels bad about him/herself then they might become disruptive in class. This will hurt the teacher and the students around. Other students will become distracted, and the teachers might get upset and feel hopeless if test scores decline.  Teachers might even feel so discouraged that they will wonder if they are making a difference and if they chose the right profession to be in. The simple point here is students need to be taught in a mannor that they are comfortable with. Just like anyone else when you are comfortable you tend to loosen up and be more willing to participate and retain information. When it comes to students it can be broken down into 2 categories. The first is the extraverted group. This group learns simply by explaining to other people. These students test their knowledge by explaining it to others. If they can explain it and teach it to someone else then they know for sure that they have the material strongly planted in their head. These students enjoy working in groups. Some recommendations are the thinking out loud paired problem solving method and the nominal group method. The other category is those students who are introverted. These students are what you know as students who see the “big picture.” They like to create frameworks in their minds and connect all the chunks of knowledge and relate it to each other. Recommendations for these students would be to do flow charts, compare and contrast tables, and concept maps.   [http://www.ncsu.edu/felder-public/Learning_Styles.html]  

To determine a visual learner, observe if they focus on you, rarely speak in class, pay close attention to details, or have problems with oral directions.  Auditory learners are very talkative, good at memorizing, and could possibly be the class clown.  To establish your kinesthetic learners, see if they have difficulty remaining stationary, may have ADD/ADHD, or like to touch things.  

The best and most effective teaching method is to use all three styles.  Charts, diagrams, worksheets, video clips, and illustrations should be used for visual learners.   Auditory learners will need to explain what they heard, encourage them to read their material aloud, and allow group sessions so they can discuss the material with fellow students.  Create an interactive moment for the kinesthetic learners.  For instance, have some of your students work out problems on the board or create an environmental activity that requires hands-on application.  [http://www.educ.uvic.ca/epls/faculty/rowles/301.htm]  

==Use Technology==
Some teachers do not use technology as fluently as they should.  They express that it takes up too much of their time or that they don’t know how to effectively use it.  Whatever the reason, technology MUST be used in the classroom.  Technology “increases motivation, prepares students for the future, helps with complex tasks, and allows collaboration amongst peers.”  Allow your students to create powerpoint presentations, use kidspiration, and show them video clips from unitedstreaming.  Get your students out of the ‘traditional’ classroom.  Let them interact and enjoy learning.  An elementary teacher said, “I see more confidence in the kids here. . . I think it's not just computers, it's a multitude of things, but they can do things on the computers that most of their parents can't and that's very empowering and exciting for them. It's 'I can sit down and make this machine pretty much do what I want to,' and there's something about that that gives them an extra little boost of, 'Wow, I'm a pretty special person'.”  

Of course there are challenges with integrating technology into classrooms- not enough computers, insufficient technical assistance, inadequate computers.  Do not let those challenges inhibit your usage.  Do as much as possible to ensure that students are being exposed to technology.

'''Study Tech: Common Sense or Scientologist Mumbo Jumbo'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In July 1997, the Los Angeles Unified School District considered an application by public school teacher Linda Smith to establish a new charter school. When questioned, Smith admitted that she and her two partners were Scientologists, and that the plans for their school included some unusual educational materials called &quot;Study Technology.&quot;&quot; Upon first glance, these materials seem fairly harmless.  &quot;Study Tech&quot; as members of the religious organization The Church of Scientology call them, consists of a series of books based on the teachings of science fiction writer turned religion founder, L. Ron Hubbard.  The books, &lt;i&gt;Basic Study Manual, Study Skills for Life,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Learning How to Learn&lt;/i&gt; cover the same material, but for different grade levels.  There are three main principles in Study Tech.  These principals are &quot;Mass&quot;, &quot;Gradients&quot; and &quot;Misunderstoods&quot;.  In laymans terms, &quot;Mass&quot; refers to the idea that to learn something, you must be able to physically be in contact with it.  If you want to learn about an apple, go take a look at an apple tree.  &quot;Gradients&quot; refers to the idea that you must learn things by breaking them down into small manageable steps.  Scientologists often use the idea of &quot;Gradients&quot; to defend against critics who say that their teachings are unreasonable.  The advanced Scientologist would simply say that the critic was &quot;off-Gradient&quot; and would need to become familiar with the less advanced teachings of Scientology before the stuff about attacking aliens and volcanos filled with explosives will make sense.  Finally, &quot;Misunderstoods&quot; refers to the technique of learning any unknown words while studying.  This one seems to be the most common-sense, but when you realize that Scientologists believe that &quot;Misunderstoods&quot; are truly the only reason that people stop studying or get confused, it seems a little overdrawn.&lt;br&gt;
So is &quot;Study Tech&quot; a reliable source of education materials?  On the surface it seems like a harmless renaming of old standbys, but when you look closer, you can see the religious overtones are hard to ignore.  For more information, visit [http://www.studytech.org/].
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Place Students In Small Groups==
Every classroom has introverts and extroverts.  Some students like to socialize, while others prefer to keep to themselves.  There are cliques and usually friends want to pair together.  This can be a problem and they will not be focused in getting the work done.  Most of the conversation will be unrelated matter.  The teacher must make the groups; don’t allow students to make them. Assign students with people they don’t know and wouldn’t normally pair with.  You may either switch group members or have the same group members the entire school year.  

Place emphasis on working as a group.  Often, students will be in groups, but it will be an individual activity.  One student will be writing their own answers, another quiet and reserved, and the other dominating and doing all the work.  This is not group work.  To resolve this issue use cooperative learning, a type of learning that requires group members to work as a team.  Each member is held accountable and must help each other to understand the material.  The members must think about the issues, discuss and then work them out together.  Below are some examples of cooperative learning activities. [http://edtech.kennesaw.edu/intech/cooperativelearning.htm] 

==Creating a Conducive Learning Environment==
{{Rquote|right|We think too much about effective methods of teaching and not enough about effective methods of learning.|John Carolus S. J.}}

When you go in a classroom, you normally see 5-7 straight columns of desks, a couple of posters, borders along the chalkboard, and the teacher’s desk.  This is the dreary, conventional classroom.  Get your students out of that setting and in to something fun and remarkable.  One way to start is by changing the desk arrangements.  Depending on the room size, create a semi-circle or arrange the desks diagonally.  Another idea is to create 4 small rows on each side of the room, create a walkway in the middle, and have the children face each other from the other side of the rooms.  Try it!  If you are concerned that there will be too much chaos, warn them of the consequences, but don’t be afraid to give it a try.

Allow your students to get involved.  It is their learning environment as well.  Let them give you ideas.  Use bright colors, plants (fake/real), and a classroom pet(s).  According to one website, “Good visual display can improve recall and attention by up to 80%” and “music can be used to improve recall as well as create the chosen learning environment.” Of course too many things can be a distraction, so know the limit.   Attempt different ideas to see how it works, and if it doesn’t try another way.  	

==Forming a Positive Teacher/Student Bond==
{{Rquote|right|A teacher's purpose is not to create students in his own image, but to develop students who can create their own image.|Author Unknown}}

It can be complicated when forming a bond with students- where to draw the line with leniency, amiability, and physical contact.  Our youth need teachers that are patient, passionate about their profession, and willing to assist the student.  Let your students know these things by showing with actions.  If you notice that a student isn’t doing that well in the subject material, take the initiative to help.  Some students are shy and afraid to get help.  Suppose, you observe a student that is having a hard time outside of school, offer your assistance and advice.  Show your students that you care about their education and their lives.

There will always be moments when teachers must discipline students.  Do not chastise and berate your students.  Discipline them gently, yet firmly.  Also, try to access the problem after class and not during.  It can cause a disruption to your class, but also embarrass your student.  No one likes to be embarrassed.  Treat your students how you wanted to be treated when you were a student.

{{question-answer|question=Based on the provided information on the various learning styles, which fits you best and why?
|answer=Based on the information provided in the article on the various learning styles; I believe that visual learning best describes my learning style. I feel that visual learning allows me to “mentally picture” the information that is being presented as well as physically view the facts. In the past I have attempted to use all three types of learning styles to determine the one that suited me best. The auditory style failed for me because listening to a lot of information at once decreases my focus, and in return I fail to retain the information. Only the kinesthetic style of learning proved to be the most effective approach other than visual. I believe that the most effective way to reach students of different learning styles is for instructors to incorporate strategies for each of the three types of learning styles in every lesson. For visual learners, teachers should use diagrams and images that will help the student retain the lesson being presented. Auditory learners should have listening exercises that reinforce the information that has been presented. Lastly, kinesthetic learners should have a “hands-on” activity that will help them remember what is taught. When all of these channels are covered then teachers will have a more effective classroom learning experience for all of the students. &amp;mdash;Christle Fallen

I recommend that our public school systems today implement programs that motivate students to want to read.  I think that a major problem with reading is that children don’t find it interesting because they are not exposed to books on subjects that they find interesting.  I think that public schools should allow students to go the library, school or community, and pick out books with the help of librarians that they find interesting.  Teachers should try and work with the students to develop their interest in reading.  Teachers could send a letter home to parents asking them to help their child read the books that they bring home.  I also think that students could get help with the teacher one on one before or after school working on their specific problems.  I think teachers should implement a rewards system for students who do read to encourage students with positive motivation.  In order for students to get more practice with reading, teachers could also set up an in classroom library for students to pick out books if they finish their work early, or even allow students to take them home if their family is underprivileged and can’t afford books.  Public schools themselves could have a reading specialist to help students who are falling behind work on their reading skills right away, not when they are in fourth or fifth grade.  All of these programs would help students learn to read and want to learn to read at a younger age.  These programs encourage reading with positive reinforcement and help students who are struggling with reading get extra help. &amp;mdash;Meredith Lee}}

{{Rquote|right|Education is a process by which the individual is elevated into the species. And it is the task of the curriculum to make that accumulated wisdom economically and systematically available.|William Torrey Harris}}

In this article I am going to present factors that influence curriculum design. I believe that a good teacher will have a well designed curriculum. The teacher must always have an open mind and remember that all students are different and therefore they learn differently. The teacher should meet each child’s needs. It is in the teacher’s role that all curriculum development is focused. Not only does the teacher participate in developing new teaching-learning procedures but it is the teacher who is the principal consumer of innovations in the field of education (Koopman). Teachers all have different methods of getting the information across to the student but they must be smart in the way they go about helping their students reach their learning goals. Effective teachers do not treat all students the same. The teacher’s individual characteristics affect the way the curriculum is presented to the students. Some other factors that influence curriculum design are application of technology, student’s cultural background and socioeconomic status, social forces, and also classroom management. Individual teachers need to make decisions regarding curricular design at the classroom level given the unique characteristics of their students (Marzano). The term curriculum has been used for perhaps less than one hundred years. Every generation has been faced with problems of curriculum: (1) What content shall be included? (2) What will be envisioned as the function of the curriculum? (3) How will it be organized? (4) Where or when will it be introduced or stressed? (5) By what means will it be implemented? (6) What materials, sources of materials, and experiences will be acceptable? (7) What forces will be allowed to dominate? (Cook &amp; Doll) Curriculum is also affected by historical precedents, which are more influential in some communities than others; by prevailing philosophical beliefs, the nature of the greatly expanding disciplines, the impact of social, political, and economic influences; by research in human growth and learning; and by the individual learner himself (Cook &amp; Doll).

==Teacher Characteristics==
Let's begin by defining &quot;curriculum&quot;.  I define classroom curriculum design as the sequencing and pacing of content along with the experiences students have with that content (Marzano). An effective teacher and curriculum planner must understand some central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline he or she teaches and can also create learning experiences that make these aspects of subject matter meaningful for students. The teacher must understand how children learn and develop and they should be able to support their intellectual, social, and personal development. A wise teacher uses a variety of instructional strategies to encourage all diverse students’ development of problem solving, critical thinking, and performance skills. A positive thinking teacher will understand the importance of motivation and will pass their positive attitude onto the student’s in the classroom. Being a positive role model for students is so important. A teacher really must be a dynamic person who is always evaluating the effects of his or her choices and actions on others (students, parents, and other professionals in the learning community).

==Technology==
Technology has come a long way since the days of hornbooks, quill pens, and creaky wooden desks (can you even call those things “technology”?) (Fredericks). Some teachers are fearful of their classroom computers simply because computers are a relatively new tool for classroom teachers. Technology is broad and expansive and it can help with curriculum design. Technology is simply just another tool for teachers. The best question a teacher could ask is “What tools will help me help my students?” It is all dependent upon the teacher if they choose to use technology as an instructional aid or not.

==Student Background, Status, and Social Forces==
All children come from different backgrounds and there is an increasing number of student’s that are from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Our multicultural society is a key factor that is taken into consideration for curriculum design. Some factors of diversity include religion, race, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and also children with different kinds of disabilities. Curricular planners work to build an education that suits our multicultural society and that will help every child from every different background live, work, and go on to lead successful lives in our melting pot of a society. The role of schools in society and the purpose of the curriculum have been major, closely related, issues since schools were first established. Society’s expectations for its schools and schools’ response to society are both reflected in the school curriculum. Curriculum reflects a complex society, a society in which there is never perfect agreement on the characteristics of that society Orlosky &amp; Smith). Some see the primary purpose of the curriculum is the acquisition of cognitive knowledge. Some others would consider it as a program for helping pupils develop humane and rational qualities. Curriculum is organized according to grade and age levels.

==Classroom Management==
Classroom management is about achieving order so productive learning can occur. The ultimate goal of classroom management is to promote learning. If learning is accomplished then the teacher is getting his or her curriculum across to the students. Effective teachers give students opportunities to make their own decisions. Good classrooms are not teacher-dependent environments but rather independent student learning arenas. Excellent instructional leaders provide students with multiple opportunities to make choices and accept consequences of those choices (Fredericks). Teachers who empower students in making decisions are facilitating independent and responsible learners. Establishing Routines for students provides them with a sense of responsibility and allows them to make decisions that are theirs rather than the teacher’s.

==Conclusion==
All educational personnel envision an ideal school. What is the aim of formal education? To prepare for complete living, many would say. The teacher would more than likely state that his or her objectives were to help the student learn or understand from day to day. In order to do this he or she will need instructional objectives that state what the student is expected to learn. Objectives are useful to the teacher as he or she tries to help the student understand what is to be learned. Without objectives there is no sense of direction for curriculum planning and design.

{{question-answer|question=Name at least three factors that influence curriculum design and explain how they affect the curriculum design.
|answer=There are many factors that influence curriculum design. Three of these main factors include technology, a multicultural society, and classroom management. 

Technology is sometimes fearful for teachers, but it should simply be viewed as another tool to help teachers. It has many positive qualities that can really affect the curriculum. For example, it can help accelerate the pace of the curriculum. Also, technology certainly helps supplement it with materials that cannot be accessed just from paper textbooks and lecture. 

A multicultural society also influences curriculum design. It helps the curriculum reflect a complex society. Factors of diversity include religion, race, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and also children with different kinds of disabilities. Diversity has been a major issue in schools since the beginning. 

Classroom management is another factor that influences curriculum design. It is about achieving order in the classroom so productive learning can occur. The ultimate goal of classroom management is to promote learning. Accomplished learning means the teacher is getting the curriculum across to the students, which is his or her ultimate goal in their career. 
Although there are many other factors that influence curriculum design, these three factors are very important to that design. Without these factors, who knows what the curriculum would be like? &amp;mdash;Jaime Park}}

{{Rquote|right|The way schools care about children is reflected in the way schools care about the children's families. If educators view children simply as students, they are likely to see the family as separate from the school. That is, the family is expected to do its job and leave the education of children to the schools. If educators view students as children, they are likely to see both the family and the community as partners with the school in children's education and development.|Joyce L. Epstein}}

Schools, teachers, parents and communities all need to work together for a child to be successful with their education. Parents are the foundation for a child’s success because all of their basic skills for learning are learned at home. When children are of school bearing age it is the responsibility of the teachers to teach them the standards of learning, but the learning does not stop there. Parents should be involved in a child’s education just as much as the teachers are. If parents need help with their children the community should provided after school programs and other activities to keep the children active. Schools, teachers, parents and the community all need each others support to in order for the system to work as a whole.

==School Relationships==
{{Rquote|right|Our school's philosophy is that you never can communicate too much,&quot; Kathleen Cave told Education World. &quot;We send home grade-level newsletters of upcoming events. We publish a monthly school-wide calendar. A principal's newsletter and a PTA newsletter also go out every month.|Quote found in article written by Linda Starr}}

Teachers are responsible for maintaining a professional environment where students are comfortable. Their main responsibilities are to plan and execute lessons to their classroom while considering all individual needs. Within the teacher’s weekly lesson plans they should administer way of testing the students and keep record of the progress of each student individually. By keeping record and being observant of each student the teachers should know when to contact and talk to the parents to let them know that the child may need some extra assistance. Teachers should not wait until they notice that a child is struggling, teachers need to build a relationship with the parent so that they feel comfortable with approaching them with any questions they may have. Communication is said to be a key factor with maintaining a relationship between the parent and the teacher (Starr). Communication will help each student individually to satisfy each of their needs.

Communication should be used for positive reinforcement also. When a student has done well on an assignment or there has been improvement with a child’s grade the teacher should contact home to touch base with the parents. Some sort of communication should be set up between the teacher and parent whether it is email or by phone (Starr). Parents are there to pick up where the teacher has left off; they are there to strengthen their child’s education, and continue to reinforce their values while at home (Jordan). With no source of communication a parent will not know where and how to help their child. If the teachers follow up with all their responsibilities there should be no unanswered questions.

==Parent Relationships==
{{Rquote|right|Numerous studies show that, regardless of the economic, ethnic, or cultural background of the family, parent involvement in a child’s education is a major factor in determining the child’s success in school. Meaningful parent involvement also contributes to other positive outcomes, such as better school attendance, improved homework completion rates, decreased violence and substance abuse, and higher graduation rates.|PTA.org}}

Parents must work together with school and communities to insure the education of their children. Parents play a big part in preparing their children to enter school grounds. Parents are student’s first teachers; they attempt to teach them right from wrong and how to communicate. A parent’s “involvement” with a student’s education is a very board and general statement. Parents are needed for homework help, parent-teacher conferences, and support for other activities that student may be involved in (Cotton). Parents need to be involved in their child’s life as a whole, not just when it is convenient for them. There are very simple ways for a parent to become involved with their child’s education. Most schools have a PTA, which is the National Parent Teacher Association. The PTA is an organization for teachers and other parents to communicate and decide on what opportunities and activities are best for students, while also providing simple skills for parents on how to get involved with their child’s education (PTA). The PTA makes a parent teacher relationship very easy to maintain. When parents feel the need to approach a teacher with a concern or a question they should approach them with an optimistic manner (Starr). Parents need to take into consideration that the teacher has other students too, not just their child. Parents should keep a positive attitude about their child’s education to create and maintain and successful parent/teacher relationship. These relationships between parents and teacher will set a foundation to the relationship that both will have with the community.

==Community Relationships==
{{Rquote|right|The ability to think straight, some knowledge of the past, some vision of the future, some urge to fit that service into the well-being of the community--these are the most vital things that education must try to produce.|Virginia Crocheron Gildersleeve (1877-1965)}}

The community plays an important role in a family’s involvement in schools. Communities should provide support for students, parents and teachers. Communities consist of a group of people that are different ages, ethnicities, educational backgrounds and income that share a common interest to better their environment. Partnerships between the school, parents, and community “can improve school programs and school climate, provide family services and support, increase parents' skills and leadership, connect families with others in the school and in the community, and help teachers with their work (Epstein).”  Communities consist of many places where children can go for after school activities. A community is a place where students can experience actual life experiences. Parents depend on communities to provide extra curricular activities where a student can play sports or join clubs. Most of these activities are run by volunteers or employed workers of the community center. After school tutoring can also be found at some communities centers, all ways to better improve a student education. A mixture of programs creates opportunities for students to better their education, and learn about themselves and better their self-esteem (Jordan).

Communities also can provide programs and workshops for parents to learn and understand skills so that they know how to approach their children with school work, while also attempting to build the relationship between them. Some states are going as far as providing extra money if the relationship between communities and schools/parents are attempted to be built (Epstien). The opportunities are available; people need to take advantage of them to see results.

==Conclusion==
It is known that a connection between teachers, parents and the community is needed for a child to be successful with their education. Teachers must work with parents and the both must work with the community to ensure that students are being taken care of. The community must give back to schools and to the parents so that the cycle will continue to work and provide ample outcomes of success with students. Communication between all three is needed for things to be understood and expressed. No communication is creating a disconnection of the relationships that are there to be built and help children succeed in life.

== Create a Clayman ==
'''(under construction)'''

'''This Tutorial was made using Blender version 2.41'''

Upon completing this tutorial, you will have made something like this:

[[Image:Clayman.jpg|300px]]

Completed Clayman Render

== Making The Clayman ==
Upon start, delete the default cube (X-KEY) and switch to front view with NUM1. Now add a mesh plane and under The Edit Buttons Window, Mesh Tools Tab click the subdivide button. Now select the 3 vertices on the left and delete them. (B-KEY for Border Select Tool)

If you can't select the vertices then deselect the Limited Selection to Visible button.

[[Image:LSTV.jpg]] 

Now select/deselect all vertices with A-KEY (we want them selected)In the Modifiers Tab in the Edit Buttons Window, Click ''Add Modifier &gt; Mirror'' You should now see something like this.

[[Image:Mirror Modifier.jpg]]

Now select the 3 right vertices and extrude them on the X axis by movement of 1.0 units by pressing E-KEY (''Extrude &gt; Only Edges''), X-KEY (to constrain it to the X axis) and holding CTRL to constrain it to simple movements. Do this twice.

[[Image:2.0.jpg|150px]]

Now extrude the legs by selecting the 3 bottom-right vertices and extruding them on the Z axis by 1 unit. Do this twice as well.

[[Image:2 Legs.jpg]]

Now extrude the top of the clayman on the Z axis (in units of 1.0) 7 times so that it looks like this.

[[Image:Clayman Body.jpg]]

Now let's make the arms by extruding the 2 boxes that are 3 boxes down from the top. Let's extrude it on the X axis by 1 unit 4 times so that it looks like this.

[[Image:Clay Arms.jpg]]

Now comes the extrusion of the whole body. As you can see, we only have a flat shape of a rough &quot;Block&quot;. so lets move our view around with the NUMPAD arrows and extrude it on the Y axis. Select all vertices with A-KEY. ''Extrude &gt; Region'' on the Y axis until it reaches 2.0 units. After done correctly, it should look like this.

[[Image:Extruded Clayman.jpg]]

With the Clayman successfully extruded, its now time to add some definition to him by adding a subsurface modifier. In the Edit Buttons window, under Modifiers, click ''Add Modifier &gt; Subsurf'' 
and set the Levels bar to 2. It should look somewhat like this.

[[Image:Subsurf Modifier.jpg]]

Now, Select all vertices with A-KEY, and click the Set Smooth button in the Links and Materials tab.
Let's get to shaping the Clayman.Using the Border Select Tool (press B to get the Border Select Tool), grab the according vertices to make a shape like this.

[[Image:vertices.jpg]]

after that's done, select the head vertices and grab them on the Z axis and move them up by 0.2 to make it look like this.

[[Image:Moved up.jpg]]

Now select all vertices with A-KEY, and scale them down (S-KEY) on the Y axis until it reads 0.6000.
And finally, select the underside of the foot (the vertices that make it up) and subdivide it to make ir more flat on the bottom.

== Adding Materials ==

Start by going to the Material Buttons window (F5) and Clicking on Add New, and going down to the collumn of 3 rectangles that have one gray one and two blank white ones. Click on the gray one and in the top-right corner of the pop-up window, you'll see a Hex Code. Click on the current hex code and type in this new hex code to get the right color: 73BCF7. Now hit F6 to go to the Texture buttons window and click on Add New. Change the Texture type to Stucci. Now you'll see a new tab appear. On it, for NoiseSize enter 0.150. Now go back to the Materials Buttons window. On the far right there will be three tabs in one. On the Map To tab, Deselect Col and select Nor. Now your example should look like this.

[[Image:Texture sample.jpg]]

== Inserting Armatures ==

Now lets move on to inserting armatures in our clayman. Lets start by going into object mode (alternate between Object and Edit mode with TAB) and adding an armature. Press ''Space &gt; Add &gt; Armature''. It automatically puts you in Edit mode upon adding the object. Switch to Object mode and grab it along the Y axis by 1.0 units so that it's inside the clayman. Sure, you can't see it now, but turn on X-axis Mirror Edit and X-Ray in the Edit Buttons window. 

[[Image:Buttons window.jpg]]

Now switch back to edit mode, and select the top of the bone. Etrude it on the Z axis by 1.4 units two times so that the tip of the second extrude is right in the center of the two arms. Now extrude it on the X axis by 3.0 units, then grab the tip of it and move it on the Z axis by 0.1700 units. Now extrude it on the X axis by 2.0 units twice. And do the same to the other side. It should look like this. 

[[Image:Extruded bones.jpg]]

Now let's extrude the neck. Extrude the top bone along the Z axis by 1.0 units to make a pretty good size neck. Then extrude it up on one side so that the position reads like so. If you can't get it exact then at least try to get it as closest to the number as you can.

[[Image:Correct Position.jpg]]

Then do the same to the other side so that it looks like 2 antennaes. Now let's extrude the hips and legs. Lets start by extruding the bottom bone by 2.0 units on the X axis and for the Z axis, 
-1.0 units. Then extrude the foot by -2.0 on the Z axis. And last, select a forearm bone (select a whole bone by clicking the middle of it) and in the Edit Buttons window, you'll see a tab called Armature Bones. Deselect the Con button in that tab, and do the same with the other forearm bone. This allows us to be able to move the forearm out, instead of having it locked to another bone.

== Applying The Armature ==

Ok, now we're going to apply the armature to the mesh so that when we move the bones, the mesh moves along with them. Lets start by switching to object mode and selecting the clayman mesh, and under the Modifiers tab, click apply on the Mirror modifier. You may see a pop-up, just click OK. Not only have we just made room in the Modifiers tab, we applied the mirror modifier to the mesh, so now we will have to edit both sides if we want to change something. But worry not, we wont need to change anything from here on. With that new space in the modiifers tab, let's add an Armature modifier. You may see a line that says &quot;OB:&quot; type in the name of the Armature in here (the default name for an armature is &quot;Armature&quot; unless you have made more than one) also, deselect the Envelopes button,for we will not be using envelopes in this tutorial. Here is what you should have.

[[Image:Armature modifier.jpg]]

Now, select the Armature and press CTRL + TAB. If you already have a bone selected, it should be highlighted blue now. We have just switched to Pose Mode. Now, while in Pose Mode, select the clayman mesh (if you cant select it, zoom in closer to get some of the bones out of the way) and press CTRL + TAB on the clayman mesh. We have just entered Weight Paint Mode. This allows us to assign vertices to the bones so that the mesh moves with the bones. Let's start by setting up the weight painting. You should see a new tab called Paint in your Edit Buttons window. Adjust your settings so that they conform to this.

[[Image:Correct settings.jpg]]

Start by selecting the top-right bone of the head and start weight painting the front and back (you'll have to switch your view so that you can see the back to get the painting in there) Weight Paint it according to this.

[[Image:Front and back.jpg]]

Now Weight Paint the Neck. (pictures not shown of back view, but be sure to get the back anyway)

[[Image:WP Neck.jpg]]

Now the Shoulder.

[[Image:WP Shoulder.jpg]]

Now the Forearm.

[[Image:WP Forearm.jpg]]

Now The Hand.

[[Image:WP Hand.jpg]]

And after getting the other side of the body, let's get the upper chest.

[[Image:Upper Chest.jpg]]

Now the middle chest.

[[Image:Middle Chest.jpg]]

Now the lower chest.

[[Image:Lower Chest.jpg]]

Now for the hips.

[[Image:WP Hips.jpg]]

Now the Feet.

[[Image:WP Feet.jpg]]

After doing the other side of the leg, switch back to Object Mode with CTRL + TAB, and select the Armature. You should already be in Pose Mode with the Armature. Now select a bone and grab it to move it. if you have Weight painted correctly, the Clayman mesh should move with the bone. There's two tips to moving the bones around in Pose Mode.

1) In the Edit Buttons window, whether Automatic IK is turned on or not affects how the bones move.

2) Where your view is affects how the bones rotate. (unless you have it constrained to an axis)

If you find that a part of your clayman isn't moving, just switch back to Weight Paint mode for that bone and repaint it.

      <comment>/* Digital signals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Signals can be transmitted as either analogue or digital signals.

===Digital signals===

Digital signals are now being increasingly used. They can take only two values:
*On (1) ___---___
*Off (0)_________

For instance when a CD is &quot;burned&quot;, The information is quite literally burned into it with small holes representing ones and the spaces in between representing zeros (underscores or dashes)

===Advantages of digital signals===
*There is less interference because noise is not recognised and amplified during transmission.
*Multiple independent signals can easily be transferred over the same physical channel without crosstalk due to multiplexing.

====Multiplexing====
In multiplexing, data from multiple signals is split into small sections, optionally compressed, and then sent down a data line. The system cycles though each signal in turn, allowing data from all signals to be transferred over a single data path.

**Description of National Cancer Database (NCDB) and how it can be used to improve quality of cancer care in the U.S.

==Utilization==
*'''Ghent University; 2008''' PMID 18374290 -- &quot;Evidence behind use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy: a systematic review of comparative clinical studies.&quot; (Veldeman L, Lancet Oncol. 2008 Apr;9(4):367-75.)
**Review of IMRT evidence
**Conclusion: Evidence of reduced toxicity; local control and overall survival inconclusive

*'''CCORE, Australia; 2005''' PMID 16080176 -- &quot;The role of radiotherapy in cancer treatment: estimating optimal utilization from a review of evidence-based clinical guidelines.&quot; (Delaney G, Cancer. 2005 Sep 15;104(6):1129-37.)
**Evidence-based estimate of RT ~52% of patients with cancer. Monte Carlo estimates ranged from 51.7 - 53.1%

*'''University of Minnesota; 2002''' (1991-1996) PMID 12187168 -- &quot;Studying radiation therapy using SEER-Medicare-linked data.&quot; (Virnig BA, Med Care. 2002 Aug;40(8 Suppl):IV-49-54.)
**Comparison of SEER and Medicare (MedPAR Part B and Outpatient) data. Cohort of breast, endometrial, lung, prostate, or rectal cancer patients. 
**Outcome: Agreement between SEER and Medicare for lung 88%, prostate 93%, rectal cancer 94%, breast cancer 94%, endometrial cancer 95%
**Conclusion: High level of agreement between SEER and Medicare data, suggesting either source can be used to asses RT-related treatment patterns

==Health Policy==
*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 2009''' [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMhpr0807774 Full paper] -- &quot;Limits on Medicare's Ability to Control Rising Spending on Cancer Drugs&quot; (Bach PB, New England Journal Of Medicine, 2009)

*'''21st Century Oncology; 2008''' PMID 18954812 -- &quot;A changing paradigm in the study and adoption of emerging health care technologies: coverage with evidence development.&quot; (Wallner PE, J Am Coll Radiol. 2008 Nov;5(11):1125-9.)
**Introduction of new technologies without &quot;significant evidence&quot; places an increasing burden on health care delivery system. Review of &quot;coverage with evidence development&quot; reimbursement strategy

==Economic Analysis==
*'''Tufts; 2010''' PMID 20056956 -- &quot;When is cancer care cost-effective? A systematic overview of cost-utility analyses in oncology.&quot; (Greenberg D, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Jan 20;102(2):82-8. Epub 2010 Jan 7.)

*'''MD Anderson; 2008''' PMID 18596196 -- &quot;Economic evaluations of medical care interventions for cancer patients: how, why, and what does it mean?&quot; (Shih YC, CA Cancer J Clin. 2008 Jul-Aug;58(4):231-44.)
**Overview of economic evaluations

*'''Harvard; 1996''' PMID 8690653 -- &quot;Economic analyses in health care: an introduction to the methodology with an emphasis on radiation therapy.&quot; (Hayman J, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jul 1;35(4):827-41.) 
*Intervention (&quot;NEW&quot;) is always compared to another intervention strategy, including &quot;no treatment&quot; strategy (&quot;STANDARD&quot;)
*&lt;u&gt;Cost Minimization&lt;/u&gt;
**Assumes that intervention benefit is comparable; it can thus be eliminated from analysis
**Only cost of NEW intervention is compared to the cost of STANDARD intervention
**Unit = dollars
*&lt;u&gt;Cost Effectiveness&lt;/u&gt;
**Cost of intervention is related to its impact on a clinically relevant endpoint (&quot;effectiveness&quot;)
**Years of life saved (survival) is most commonly used endpoint
**Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is the incremental cost divided by the incremental benefit of NEW intervention over STANDARD intervention
**Unit = dollars per year-life-saved
**Commonly accepted &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; threshold is $50,000 - $100,000 per year life saved
*&lt;u&gt;Cost Utility&lt;/u&gt;
**The endpoint (eg survival) is modified by quality of life measures (&quot;utility&quot;) due to:
***Survival is insensitive to treatment-related side-effects (eg xerostomia), which may make survival not as valuable to a patient
***Survival is insensitive to palliative benefits of treatment (eg relief of dyspnea in NSCLC)
***Survival is insensitive to prolongation of disease-free period (eg longer life without painful bone mets)
**Utility is generally 0-1 (0 represents death, 1 represents perfect health)
**Effectiveness (survival benefit) is then multiplied by utility to get Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)
**Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is the incremental cost divided by the incremental QALY benefit of NEW intervention over STANDARD intervention
**Unit = dollars per QALY
**Commonly accepted &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; threshold is $50,000 - $100,000 per QALY
*&lt;u&gt;Cost Benefit&lt;/u&gt;
**The benefit of intervention (improved survival, less toxicity, longer DFS) is converted to dollars
**Cost of intervention is in dollars
**The cost-benefit of NEW and STANDARD treatments is calculated as benefit (dollars) minus cost (dollars)
**The incremental cost-benefit is the difference between NEW and STANDARD, and is beneficial if it is &gt;0
**There is a lot of controversy about assigning dollar value to benefits such as lower toxicity

==RT Cost Estimates==
*'''Lyon; 2009''' PMID 19493690 -- &quot;[The cost of respiration-gated radiotherapy in the framework of a clinical research programme &quot;STIC&quot;] - [Article in French]&quot; (Remonnay R, Cancer Radiother. 2009 Jun 1. [Epub ahead of print])
**Prospective nonrandomized cost study. 365 patients breast or lung cancer, RT +/- respiratory gating. 
**Outcome: Cost lung no gating euro 1256 vs. gating 1807; breast 996 vs. 1510. Overcosts due to extra working time of staff, and extra use of equipment
**Conclusion: Medical reimbursement largely underestimate costs related to innovation

*'''Calgary, Canada; 2008''' PMID 18237802 -- &quot;The cost of radiation therapy.&quot; (Ploquin NP, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Feb;86(2):217-23. Epub 2008 Jan 30.)
**Literature review. 11 publications
**Conclusion: Costs for RT seem to be converging

*'''Michigan 2000''' PMID 10802374 -- &quot;A comparison of two methods for estimating the technical costs of external beam radiation therapy.&quot; (Hayman JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 May 1;47(2):461-7.)
**Comparison of using Medicare data (converting Medicare charges into costs via Medicare Cost-to-Charge Ratios, CCR) vs. direct procedure-specific cost estimates from cost-accounting systems (CAS)
**CCR vs CAS: Palliative simple $1,285 vs. $1,195 (+8%); palliative complex $2,345 vs. $1,769 (+33%); curative breast $6,757 vs. $4,850 (+39%); curative prostate $9,453 vs. $7,498 (+26%)
**Conclusion: for complex treatments (most of EBRT), technical cost estimates much higher using Medicare CCR vs. internal CAS. This may impact cost-effectiveness analysis

==Breast==
*'''Harvard''' 
**'''2009''' PMID 18963542 -- &quot;Partial-breast irradiation versus whole-breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis&quot; (Sher DJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jun 1;74(2):440-6. Epub 2008 Oct 27.)
***Markov model. ICER estimate for PBI vs WBRT for ER+ postmenopausal women with early stage BCA. External beam PBI (EB-PBI) and Mamosite PBI (MS-PBI) compared
***ICER for WBRT compared with EB-PBI $630,000/QALY, but MS-PBI much worse than both
***Conclusion: EB-PBI most cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions
**'''2008''' PMID 17967514 -- &quot;Partial breast irradiation versus whole breast radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer: a decision analysis.&quot; (Sher DJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Feb 1;70(2):469-76. Epub 2007 Oct 29.)
***Markov model to compare quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for APBI vs WBRT in ER+ early stage BCA over 15 years
***Outcome: QALE for 40-year old 12.6 years, for 55-year old 12.1 years. QALE highly sensitive to patient preferences
***Conclusion: For most utility values, APBI preferred treatment modality

***Payer costs (2003 Medicare) and patient costs estimated for 1) WBRT-Boost 60/30, 2) WBRT 50/25, 3) WBRT-AC 42.5/16, 4) WBRT-IMRT 60/30, 5) APBI-MammoSite, 6) APBI-HDR, 7) APBI-3DCRT 38.5/10 BID, 8) APBI-IMRT 38.5/10 BID
***Least costly: WBRT using External Beam (APBI-3DCRT)
**'''2005''' PMID 15752884 -- &quot;Cost-effectiveness of radiation therapy following conservative surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.&quot; (Suh WW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Mar 15;61(4):1054-61.)
***Markov model, 55-yeard old woman, DCIS, BCS. 12-year rates: invasive 18% vs. 8%, noninvasive 16% vs. 9% (NSABP B-17 data)
***RT incemental cost: overall $3300 (2002 Medicare schedule), initial $8700, due to higher LR salvage costs.
***Incremental cost-effectiveness rate (ICER): $36,700 per QALY
***Conclusion: should not withold RT because of cost-effectiveness
**'''2000''' PMID 10637242 -- &quot;Cost-effectiveness of adding an electron-beam boost to tangential radiation therapy in patients with negative margins after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer.&quot; (Hayman JA, J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jan;18(2):287-95.)
***Markov model. Early stage BCA, BCS with SM-. Addition of E-boost to tangential fields. Data from Lyon trial (reduction of LR by 2% at 10 years, no OS impact)
***Cost $2,008; 0.0065 QALY, ICER &gt;$300,000
***Conclusion: Cost-effectiveness for E-boost well above commonly cited threshold of $50,000
**'''1999''' PMID 10378968 -- &quot;Is the use of radiation therapy after mastectomy cost-effective?&quot; (Hayman JA, Semin Radiat Oncol. 1999 Jul;9(3):287-91.)
***Review

***Markov model, 60-year old women, BCS +/- RT
***Addition of RT: cost increase $9,800 per patient; no change in life expectancy; increase in 0.35 QALY/patient = ICER $28,000/QALY
***Conclusion: RT after BCS is cost-effective compared to other accepted medical interventions

=Cisco Router Commands and their Usages=

===User Mode Commands===
These commands can only be entered from user mode.
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| '''Command''' 
| '''Syntax''' 
| '''Description'''
|-
| '''SHOW'''
| show ?
| This is used to view the available commands set to this layer, use this to learn and navigate the Router/Switch.
|-
| '''OSPF'''
| show ip ospf nei
| This is used from the basic user prompt to view neighbor details for WAN connection. To view details, use the &quot;det&quot; after the original command. This is a very helpful trouble shooting command for user level access.
|}

===Privileged Mode Commands===
These commands can only be entered from privileged mode.  To enter privileged mode, use the '''enable''' command.  
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| '''Command''' 
| '''Syntax''' 
| '''Descrition'''
|-
| '''enable''' 
| enable
| Switches to privileged mode.  If the enable password has been set, you will be prompted to enter it.
|- 
| '''disable''' 
| disable
| changes to user mode
|- 
| '''configure terminal''' 
| conf[igure] t[erminal]
| switches to config mode, this will allow you to make critical changes to the Router/Switch
|- 
| '''terminal editing''' 
| terminal editing 
| enabled special unix-style editing commands
|-
| '''show'''
| show ?
| This is used to help the enabled user see the available commands on that specific layer. You may use this on each layer and after any command to help view the next part of syntax.
|-
| '''show'''
| sh?
| This will show options of what is available to you that has &quot;sho&quot; for the beginning of a command, in this case it will have &quot;show&quot; as it's only option. Try using other letters or beginnings to see more variety such as: &quot;s?&quot; or &quot;a?&quot; These will give you a larger list.
|-
| '''cdp'''
| show cdp nei det
| this will show all used connections to your ports and whom they are connected to. This is very helpful when drawing out a system diagram.
|}

===Config Commands===
These commands can only be entered from config mode.  To enter config mode, use the &quot;conf t&quot; command.
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| '''Command''' 
| '''Syntax''' 
| '''Descrition'''
|- 
| '''Enable'''
| enable secret Justin
| This will set a Password to get to enable mode so others cannot make changes with out proper access. In this case we are making the password Justin (case sensitive).
|-
| '''config-register''' 
| config-register 0xnnnn 
| This command modifies the boot settings on the router.  
Example settings are:
*0x2100 - ROM Monitor
*0x2101 - ROM Boot
*0x2102 - Boot from NVRAM (default)
*0x2142 - Boot from NVRAM but ignore startup-config file
|-
| '''hostname''' 
| hostname NAME 
| changes the router name to NAME
|-
| '''router rip''' 
| router rip 
| enables the RIP routing protocol and switches to router configuration mode
|- 
| '''int'''
| int s0
| Switches to interface configuration mode (s0 stands for Serial 0 but interfaces naming may vary). It is possible to use other interfaces such as Consoles (local), vty 0 ? (telnet), and much more.. You may also create passwords within those layers for more security using the &quot;password&quot; command at that interfaces layer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article was written by Andrew Lindesay (http://www.lindesay.co.nz) around May 2005.  It first appeared as LaTeX PDF and has been transcribed into this Wiki.  You use the information contained in this document at your own risk.  Please contact the author if you feel there may have been an error in the conversion to Wiki markup.

== Abstract ==

From WebObjects 5.2, it has been possible to derive a build product from a WebObjects application project that can be deployed into a J2EE servlet container. This article shows how it is possible to 
deploy a WebObjects 5.2 application into a Tomcat environment and achieve a very similar topology to the ”native” WebObjects deploy.

== Introduction ==

This document was originally written assuming a Tomcat 5 deployment, but after some difficulties with web services and AXIS, I have modified this document to also cater for a Tomcat 3 deployment. This document covers both circumstances. 

== Assumptions ==

This article assumes the following:

* WebObjects 5.2 (likely to work fine with newer versions)
* Java 1.4
* Latest Tomcat release of version 5 (5.5.12 at the time of writing) or 3 (3.3.2 at the time of writing)
* Some sort of UNIX deployment.
* The reader has some conception of the concepts behind servlet technology.
* The reader is familiar with a standard WebObjects deployment topology which will be referred to as ''wotaskd'' deployment.

For the purposes of this document, it is assumed that Tomcat has been installed at a directory on the local disc called &lt;tt&gt;$TOMCATDIR&lt;/tt&gt;.  It is also assumed that you will have another directory with the files required to configure and run an instance called &lt;tt&gt;$INSTDIR&lt;/tt&gt;.  It is assumed also that you will have a directory called &lt;tt&gt;$JKDIR&lt;/tt&gt; with the Tomcat apache adaptor in it.  In this article, some configuration files require the paths to be shown and these are tabulated below.

&lt;center&gt;
{|
| &lt;tt&gt;$TOMCATDIR&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;/opt/tomcat&lt;/tt&gt;
|- 
| &lt;tt&gt;$INSTDIR&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;/opt/fooapp&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;$JKDIR&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;/opt/modjk&lt;/tt&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In reality, these directories could be located anywhere.

=== Objective ===

The objective of this article is to show that a WebObjects application can be deployed into a servlet container and keep some of the desirable attributes of a WebObjects deployment topology.  Some of these traits are itemised below.

* Clustering over a number of hardware nodes to prevent system downtime from a single hardware failure incident.
* Clustering over a number of virtual machine ''instances'' on each hardware node to avoid downtime from a single software failure incident.
* Ability to make efficient use of lower cost server hardware rather than encouraging use of large, expensive servers.
* Make maximum use of memory availabile in each virtual machine as cache to minimise database traffic and lower stress on the database server.
* Ability to make sessions &quot;sticky&quot; to a given virtual machine ''instance'', whilst being multiplexed through a single web server front-end adaptor.
* Ability to load-balance requests to instances which are operational.

A standard WebObjects deployment topology is shown in the figure below alongside what is to be achieved with Tomcat.  A typical J2EE deployment may have a different topology from this.

[[Image:wo-tomcat-deploy-topology.gif]]

== Servlet Build Products ==

Creating a servlet build product from a WebObjects application project is covered in some depth by documentation that is supplied by Apple for WebObjects.  This is not going to be repeated here, but here is a brief overview of the process.

* Include the &lt;tt&gt;JavaWOJSPServlet.framework&lt;/tt&gt; framework into your project.
* In the build settings, set the &lt;tt&gt;SERVLET_SINGLE_DIR_DEPLOY&lt;/tt&gt; value to &lt;tt&gt;YES&lt;/tt&gt; to create the most trouble-free form of deployment servlet.
* Edit the &lt;tt&gt;SERVLET_DEPLOY_LICENSE&lt;/tt&gt; to contain your valid deployment license key if you need one for the version of WebObjects you are using.
* Edit the &lt;tt&gt;SERVLET_WEBAPPS_DIR&lt;/tt&gt; to point to &lt;tt&gt;$INSTDIR/webapps/&lt;/tt&gt; or some place where you want the build product to go.

Now when you choose a ''Deployment'' build, you will also get the servlet assembled.  The end result is a directory structure similar to  that shown in the figure below.

== Removing the DOCTYPE from .plist Files ==

Many property-list files (often called plist files) have a document type at the top.  This can refer to files on a MacOS-X machine or to files on Apple servers.  In either case this can cause problems with deployments which are not on MacOS-X servers.  The following script can be run with the argument of the &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF&lt;/tt&gt; folder to remove these.  The WebObjects application runs fine without this information in the plist files.  This script can easily be incorporated one way or another as a step in the build process for your WebObjects project.

&lt;pre&gt;
# [apl 3.may.2006]
# This will remove any DOCTYPE's from the top of plists so that
# they do not attempt to validate the DTD which is either
# extracted from /System or the internet over HTTP.

if [ -z $1 ]; then
  echo &quot;syntax: stripdocype.sh &lt;directory&gt;&quot;
  exit 1
fi

for PLISTFILE in `find $1 -name *.plist`
do
  sed \
    '/&lt;!DOCTYPE [^&gt;]*&gt;/s/.*//' \
    $PLISTFILE \
    &gt; /tmp/remove-plist-temp

    cp /tmp/remove-plist-temp $PLISTFILE
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Application Configuration with Tomcat ==

A WebObjects project with servlet support has a file called &lt;tt&gt;web.xml.template&lt;/tt&gt; in it.  By default, this is located in &lt;tt&gt;/Resources/Servlet Resources/WEB-INF&lt;/tt&gt; in your project.  The &lt;tt&gt;web.xml.template&lt;/tt&gt; file is used as a template for creating &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; which is also known as the &lt;tt&gt;servlet deployment descriptor&lt;/tt&gt;.  This deployment descriptor is used as the means of communicating settings to the application as well as the servlet container in which the application runs.  This section covers some common changes to that file as well as a discussion around a means of general configuration of the application when it is running inside a servlet container.

=== Data Source for Model Database Configuration ===

Some WebObjects engineers use the &lt;tt&gt;setConnectionDictionary(...)&lt;/tt&gt; method on a model to set the JDBC database connection parameters for the model.  However, the servlet container has it's own &lt;tt&gt;data source&lt;/tt&gt; mechanism for supplying database information which will override any connection dictionary information which is set into the model.  If you don't want this to happen, and you want your &lt;tt&gt;setConnectionDictionary(...)&lt;/tt&gt; to take effect, comment out the &lt;tt&gt;resource-ref&lt;/tt&gt; item with the title &lt;tt&gt;jdbc/DefaultDataSource&lt;/tt&gt; in the &lt;tt&gt;web.xml.template&lt;/tt&gt; file.

=== Serving WebServerResources ===

To stop the web server resources (images, CSS files and other static data) from being served out of the java environment, you need to configure the &lt;tt&gt;context-param&lt;/tt&gt; with the name &lt;tt&gt;WOAppMode&lt;/tt&gt; to be &lt;tt&gt;Deployment&lt;/tt&gt; in the &lt;tt&gt;web.xml.template&lt;/tt&gt; file.

=== Application Specific Configuration ===

This area of configuration covers items such as the following ficticious examples;

# Email address of person to contact when system fails.
# Frequency of polling some resource.
# Optional connection information for databases.
# GST rate for New Zealand.

In other words, these are application-specific configuration values.  One way to configure your application specific parameters in a servlet container is to load your config into &lt;tt&gt;env-entry&lt;/tt&gt;-s in your &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file.  Here is such an example of one such entry;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;env-entry&gt;
&lt;env-entry-name&gt;foo/nz.co.foo.FooAppMailFrom&lt;/env-entry-name&gt;
&lt;env-entry-value&gt;bar@foo.co.nz&lt;/env-entry-value&gt;
&lt;env-entry-type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/env-entry-type&gt;
&lt;/env-entry&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can retrieve these value inside the application with some code as shown below.  See the LEConfig class from LEWOStuff, the WebObjects framework from Lindesay Electric for an example.  LEWOStuff also comes with a tool to help load standard java properties files into the servlet deployment descriptor.

&lt;pre&gt;
import javax.naming.*;

// ...later in the same class...

Object valueO = null;
		
try
{
  InitialContext context = new InitialContext();
  valueO = context.lookup(&quot;java:comp/env/foo/nz.co.foo.FooAppMailFrom&quot;);
}
catch(javax.naming.NamingException ne)
{ /* handle gracefully */ }
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is probably easiest to apply these settings in some automated fashion to the &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file as part of a further automated build or deploy process.

=== Application Binary ===

Put your application servlet build product at &lt;tt&gt;$INSTDIR&lt;/tt&gt; such that the following path exists.

&lt;pre&gt;
$INSTDIR/webapps/FooApp/WEB-INF
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Tomcat Server Configuration Files ===

You need to create a tomcat configuration file for each of the instances that you would like to have.  The pattern is followed here of having an instance number proceeded by the lower case letter &quot;i&quot;.  Put the first server configuration file at the following location.

&lt;pre&gt;
$INSTDIR/server_i1.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is an example of how this file might look.  There is no coverage of the individual settings here as the reader is expected to review the tomcat documentation to discover the specific meanings of these settings.

==== Tomcat 5 ====

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Server port=&quot;7071&quot; shutdown=&quot;SHUTDOWN&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Service name=&quot;Catalina&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Connector port=&quot;8081&quot; maxHttpHeaderSize=&quot;8192&quot;
               maxThreads=&quot;150&quot; minSpareThreads=&quot;25&quot; maxSpareThreads=&quot;75&quot;
               enableLookups=&quot;false&quot; acceptCount=&quot;100&quot;
               connectionTimeout=&quot;20000&quot; disableUploadTimeout=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;Connector port=&quot;9091&quot; enableLookups=&quot;false&quot; protocol=&quot;AJP/1.3&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;Engine name=&quot;i1&quot; defaultHost=&quot;appserver1.foo.co.nz&quot; jvmRoute=&quot;i1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Host name=&quot;appserver1.foo.co.nz&quot;
        appBase=&quot;/home/fooapp/webapps&quot;
        unpackWARs=&quot;true&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;false&quot;
        xmlValidation=&quot;false&quot; xmlNamespaceAware=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Context cookies=&quot;false&quot; docBase=&quot;FooApp&quot;
          path=&quot;FooApp&quot; reloadable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
          &lt;Manager distributable=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/Context&gt;
      &lt;/Host&gt;
    &lt;/Engine&gt;         

  &lt;/Service&gt;
&lt;/Server&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Tomcat 3 ====

&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;

  &lt;Server&gt;
    &lt;ContextManager workDir=&quot;work&quot;&gt;

      &lt;LoaderInterceptor11  useApplicationLoader=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;AutoDeploy source=&quot;modules&quot; target=&quot;modules&quot; redeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;AutoWebApp dir=&quot;modules&quot; host=&quot;DEFAULT&quot; trusted=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;AutoWebApp dir=&quot;/home/fooapp/webapps&quot; trusted=&quot;true&quot; reloadable=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;SimpleMapper1 /&gt;

      &lt;SessionExpirer checkInterval=&quot;60&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;SessionIdGenerator randomClass=&quot;java.security.SecureRandom&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;WebXmlReader validate=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;ErrorHandler showDebugInfo=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;Jdk12Interceptor /&gt;
      &lt;LoadOnStartupInterceptor /&gt;
      &lt;Servlet22Interceptor /&gt;

      &lt;SessionId cookiesFirst=&quot;false&quot; noCookies=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;SimpleSessionStore maxActiveSessions=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;Http10Connector  port=&quot;8081&quot; secure=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;Ajp13Connector port=&quot;9091&quot; tomcatAuthentication=&quot;false&quot; shutdownEnable=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/ContextManager&gt;
  &lt;/Server&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Assuming that there will be three instances in this example deploy, this entire file should be replicated and modified twice for the other two instances.  For the other instances' server configuration files, change the &quot;i1&quot; (Tomcat 5 only) by modifying the numerical component and change the port numbers by making the last digit the instance number.  For example, the ports &lt;tt&gt;7071&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;8081&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;9091&lt;/tt&gt; are used here.  For &quot;i2&quot;, use &lt;tt&gt;7072&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;8082&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;9092&lt;/tt&gt;.

You should have three files now present called &lt;tt&gt;server_i1.xml&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;server_i2.xml&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;server_i3.xml&lt;/tt&gt; in the directory &lt;tt&gt;$INSTDIR&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Startup An Instance ===

To startup an instance, issue a command as follows.  You should issue this command for each of the server configuration files.  The &lt;tt&gt;$JAVA_HOME&lt;/tt&gt; shell environment variable should have been setup correctly before launching an instance.

==== Tomcat 5 ====

&lt;pre&gt;
$TOMCATDIR/bin/startup.sh -config $INSTDIR/server_i1.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Tomcat 3 ====

&lt;pre&gt;
$TOMCATDIR/bin/startup -config $INSTDIR/server_i1.xml -home $TOMCATDIR
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Tomcat 3 Environment Variables ====

To pass java environment variables to your application, set the &lt;tt&gt;TOMCAT_OPTS&lt;/tt&gt; shell environment variable before starting up the Tomcat 3 environment.  An example of this would be as follows;

&lt;pre&gt;
TOMCAT_OPTS=-Dabc=xyz
export TOMCAT_OPTS
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Check Availability ===

You can now see if your instance is up using the following URL.

&lt;pre&gt;
http://appserver1.foo.co.nz:8081/FooApp/WebObjects/FooApp.woa
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that both the AJP (This is the protocol between the apache adaptor and the individual Tomcat instances.) and the regular HTTP engines are accessing the same running application.  This means that a test straight onto the application via HTTP is actually testing the application that is being accessed via AJP.  This behaviour provides an opportunity to be able to monitor specific instances of Tomcat over direct HTTP.

Check each of your instances.

=== Problems ===

Under Tomcat 5, check the log file at &lt;tt&gt;$TOMCATHOME/logs/catalina.out&lt;/tt&gt; if you are unable to access your instance.

=== Shutdown An Instance ===

To shutdown an instance, issue a command as follows.

==== Tomcat 5 ====

&lt;pre&gt;
$TOMCATDIR/bin/shutdown.sh -config $INSTDIR/server_i1.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to use the UNIX &lt;tt&gt;telnet&lt;/tt&gt; command to connect to the port described in the server configuration file's &lt;tt&gt;Server&lt;/tt&gt; tag and type the word supplied in the &lt;tt&gt;shutdown&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to take out the Tomcat instance. 

==== Tomcat 3 ====

&lt;pre&gt;
TOMCATDIR/bin/shutdown -ajp13 -port 9091
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Apache Adaptor Setup ==

A final deployment usually involves apache feeding inbound requests to instances and handling situations where an instance has gone down and balancing load over the instances that are currently running.  This job is undertaken by &lt;tt&gt;mod_jk&lt;/tt&gt; which is a module for apache written by the Tomcat group.  This module communicates with the tomcat instances using a protocol called &lt;tt&gt;AJP&lt;/tt&gt;.  This protocol carries all the information required to check instances are operational as well as relaying requests to the instances.  It is assumed that the configuration as well as binaries for the &lt;tt&gt;mod_jk&lt;/tt&gt; apache module will be located at &lt;tt&gt;$JKDIR&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Compiling and Installing ===

Instructions for downloading and installing &lt;tt&gt;mod_jk&lt;/tt&gt; can be obtained from the Tomcat website.  The &lt;tt&gt;mod_jk.so&lt;/tt&gt; binary should be located at the following path.

&lt;pre&gt;
$JKDIR/mod_jk.so
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add a line to your system's apache httpd configuration file like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Include /opt/modjk/apache.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Edit this file to look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
LoadModule jk_module /opt/modjk/mod_jk.so
AddModule mod_jk.c

Again, the details of the exact settings will not be covered in this article, but this should provide a simple guide to setting up this file to provide for a multi-instance deploy under Tomcat.

=== Restart Apache ===

Now restart apache with the following command:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apachectl restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Test Application ===

Now you can test your application using a URL such as this one.

&lt;pre&gt;
http://www.foo.co.nz/FooApp/WebObjects/FooApp.woa
&lt;/pre&gt;

All three instances that you have setup should take some of the inbound requests.

=== Choosing the Right Instance ===

&lt;tt&gt;mod_jk&lt;/tt&gt; ensures that requests that have started a session will be directed to the correct instance where the session originated.  This behaviour is known as {\it sticky sessions}.  It does not appear to be possible to nominate the instance from the servlet container in another way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Genealogical Mailing lists first began with Roots-L in the 1990's. The list provides a wonderful, relaxed way to connect with possible cousins sharing the same surnames, locality, and other special interest groups pertaining to Genealogy and Family History work. The list is archived and searchable at http://lists.rootsweb.com/ If you prefer, you can subscribe to the email list that you are interested in the digest mode (one email with all of the posted emails for the day) or list mode (where you get an email for each email posted).

This great resource is available to all at no charge to subscribe or to search the archives. Either way works well and is worth your time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Momentum is the tendency for objects at rest to stay at rest, and for objects in motion to stay in motion.  

The greater the mass of an object, the greater its resistance to changes in motion.  Also, intuitively, the greater the velocity of an object, the greater the momentum it possesses.  Therefore, the momentum of an object can be quantified mathematically as p=mv, or as mass x velocity.  

The greatest usefulness of the concept of momentum lies in the fact that the total momentum of a system of objects is always conserved, i.e., in isolation the total momentum always stays the same.  This knowledge allows the solution of many problems in physics with great elegance.  For example, in rocket propulsion; the mass of propellant a rocket carried multiplied by the exhaust velocity of the engine, will be equal to the final forward velocity of the empty rocket multiplied by its empty mass.  Without understanding the principle of conservation,  finding the final velocity of the rocket would be very puzzling; but applying the simple equation mv = m’v’,  and rearranging to v’=mv/m’, finding the velocity becomes a very simple calculation.

The principle of conservation of momentum applies to all states of matter, i.e., solids, liquids, gases, and plasma (and subatomic particles), and with all forms of interaction through all forces, such as gravity, magnetism, direct contact, electrostatic force, etc. etc., so the scope and range of application of this principle is vast.  It is easily one of the most important concepts to understand in solving problems involving motion.

The concept of momentum can also be applied to rotating objects, in which case the momentum possessed by such rotating objects is called 'angular momentum'.  Angular momentum is also conserved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''WARNING!'''''  '''This plugin overrides a lot of fundamental OsiriX rendering routines. Many bugs are to be expected if this plugin  is installed while doing anything other than creating mosaics of 8-bit images.'''

This plugin will make OsiriX tile images internally to increase the speed of texture uploads to the video card. This plugin has been tested using 8-bit black-on-white EM images. Some work has gone into making this plugin work with other images types. Your milage may vary. The faster texture upload speed may make this plugin useful for viewing very large images. Report bugs to  [mailto:spalte@gmail.com| Joël Spaltenstein].

= Tools for the construction of EM image mosaics by manual registration =
== Using the Align plugin==
Open two image viewers. One will be the tile being added to the mosaic, the other is the mosaic being constructed. It may be useful to have a small white 8-bit tiff with a single pixel set to 0x00 (in order to define the dynamic range of the image) to use as the first image of the mosaic. Define the viewers as as the ''tile'' and '' mosaic'' by using the '''Make Align Tile''' and '''Make Align Mosaic''' menu items. Now drag the file icon in the ''tile'' 's menu-bar to the ''mosaic'', exactly as if making an image fusion. The tile should appear over the image in the ''mosaic'' window. In order to position the image correctly you will move control points on the images. Select the number of control points you wish to use with the appropriate menu items. Drag the control points in the ''tile'' to define their position. Drag the control points in the ''mosaic'' to define where the control points should map to. Once the alignment is satisfactory, make sure the ''mosaic'' viewer is the active window, and use the '''Merge Images''' menu item to paste the ''tile'' onto the ''mosaic''. To save the mosaic, export it to a tiff, making sure of course that ''Set to original image size'' is selected in the OsiriX export preferences.
== Make Align Background ==
When creating a new mosaic, you may wish to take into account a mosaic created from EM images of a nearby slice. In order to do this, open up a viewer onto the said mosaic, '''Make Align Background''' and drag the newly created ''background'' onto the ''mosaic''. In order to save memory, the ''mosaic'' viewer copies the image data from the background, making it safe to close the ''background'' viewer without the background disappearing from the ''mosaic''. Of course this also means that no live link is kept between the ''mosaic'' and the ''background''. The background can be positioned by selecting the ''Pan'' tool and panning while pressing the ''command'' (open-apple) key.

==Tips==
Define three new CLUTs before using the plugin. One that goes from white to mostly Red and Blue, another that goes from white to mostly Red and Green, and yet another that goes from white to mostly Green and Blue. By using these newly created CLUTs, it will be very easy to see it the alignment of the new tile is good. For example, if the Red and Blue CLUT is used for the ''mosaic'' and the Green and Blue CLUT is used for the ''tile'', the intersection of the images will appear as a sharp blue image.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Locking_pliers.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Locking pliers are a type of lever.]]
A lever is an object that is used with a pivot point, or 'fulcrum', to multiply the force applied to another object. Levers are often long and skinny and made of rigid material. Levers are one of the six simple machines. 

== Who invented it? ==
[[Image:Ipuy_shaduf.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Scene of gardener using a Shadoof around 1200BC]]
Levers occur in nature. In fact, your arm and your jaw are both examples of levers. It is impossible to say who invented the first mechanical lever. Human beings have used mechanical levers since the stone age. 

The earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by Archimedes. ''&quot;Give me the place to stand, and I shall move the earth.&quot;'' is a remark of Archimedes who was the first to mathematically describe how levers multiply force.

In [[Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Egyptians|ancient Egypt]], builders used the lever to move and uplift obelisks weighting more than 100 tons. A shadoof is type of lever that was used in Egypt. It is a pole with a weight on one end. It is used to lift water from a well or river for irrigation. It was in common use by 2000 BC. It is still used in many areas of Africa and Asia to draw water.

== What does it do? ==
[[Image:Crowbar_1_(PSF).png|200px|right|thumb|A lever applies a lot of force over a short distance.]]
A lever enables people to do work using less force. A lever usually is used to move or lift objects. Sometimes it is used to push against objects, but not actually move them. Levers can be used to exert a large force over a small distance at one end by exerting only a small force over a greater distance at the other.  

== How does it get power? ==
[[Image:LeverPrincleple.svg|left|thumb|150px|The parts of a lever.]]
Its power comes from outside forces acting on it. The force applied to one end of the lever is transferred to the other end on the lever. The real power of levers comes from a mechanical advantage. The lever allows less effort to be expended when moving an object, but there's a trade-off. The object will move a shorter distance than the person or thing exerting the force. For example, a crowbar can be used to pry up a board because it applies a lot of force over a short distance when the person using the crowbar uses much less force over a much greater distance. 

== How does it work? ==
The lever has two important parts. The lever itself and the fulcrum. The placement of the fulcrum determines how far the levered object will move, and how much force is required to move it.

If a weight was resting on a lever a person could lift the weight by pressing on the lever on the other side. The farther away from the fulcrum that person pressed, the less force that person would need to apply. In order to lift the weight the same distance, the force would have to be applied over a longer distance.  In science, we call how much effort it takes to move something a certain distance &quot;work.&quot;  With a lever, you always do the same amount of work no matter how long your lever is.  But if you are moving the lever further, then you don't have to push as hard to do the same amount of work.

== How dangerous is it? ==
Levers can be dangerous because they multiply force. But everyone uses levers all the time without ever thinking they are dangerous. Every time you open a door, you are using a lever. Most levers we use are safe. But throughout human history, levers have also been used as weapons. Some examples of weapons that are levers are nunchucks, catapults, and atlatls.

== How does it vary? ==
There are actually three types of levers!  They are called first-class levers, second-class levers, and third-class levers.

[[Image:SeesawWithKids_wb.png|border|right|120px]]A see-saw is an example of a first-class lever.   A first-class lever the fulcrum is located between the force pushing down- the input force-(on a see-saw that would be the person going down) and the output force (the person going up).

A wheel barrow is an example of a second-class lever. In a second class lever, the resistance is located between the effort and the fulcrum. The input force would be the handles, where you need to pull up in order to lift the weight in the barrow. The fulcrum located on the axle of the front wheel. 

[[Image:Baseball_bat.svg|border|right|80px]]A baseball bat is an example of a third-class lever. In a third class lever the effort is between the fulcrum and the resistance. In the case of a baseball bat, you exert effort by swinging the bat at the handle. The heavier part of the bat is the resistance. In this case, the force at the end of the bat is actually reduced, but the speed is increased. The end of the bat moves faster than the grip where the force is applied, giving it greater momentum, causing it to strike the ball harder.

== How has it changed the world? ==
The lever has changed the way we work immensely. It has helped us to do more work with fewer resources. It played an important role in developing agriculture. It also played a crucial role in building shelters and other types of buildings. In fact, levers are so useful and common, that they have played a role in every other technological advancement.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
Levers are one of the six simple machines. They did not require any prior invention. The very first machine ever invented by a human being may very well have been a lever.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chisel_wood_24mm.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A chisel is a type of wedge.]]
A wedge is a triangular shaped tool that is thicker on one end (the blunt end) and thinner on the other end (the edge.) A slice of pie is the shape of a wedge. Wedges are one of the six simple machines. It can be used to separate two objects, split an object, lift an object, or hold an object in place. 

== Who invented it? ==
[[Image:Canto tallado 2-Guelmim-Es Semara.jpg|thumb|left|180px|An Oldowan stone scraper.]]The origin of the wedge is unknown, because it has been in use from as early as the stone age. The first wedge was probably used as a knife or scraper and was probably just a broken piece of a stone. Stones that fit easily in your hand and are sharp enough to cut meat, grass and bark are not hard to find. You can find pieces of stone that can be used as a knife just lying on the ground in some places. 

The wedge is one of the very first inventions of humans. The wedge is one of the six simple machines and may have been the first or second developed (along with the [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Lever|Lever]]. When early humans made scrapers, axes and knives from stone, they were making a wedge. The earliest known wedges made by people were made 2.6 million years ago. Simple stone tools like these are called &quot;Oldowan&quot; tools by archaeologists.  

In ancient Egyptian quarries, bronze wedges were used to break away blocks of stone used in construction. Wooden wedges, that swelled after being saturated with water, were also used. Some indigenous peoples of the Americas used antler wedges for splitting and working wood to make canoes, dwellings and other objects. 

[[Image:Wedge-diagram.svg‎|thumb|right|104px|Cross-section of a splitting wedge. A downward force produces forces perpendicular to its inclined surfaces as shown by the arrows.]]

== How does it get power? ==
Its power comes from outside forces acting on it. A wedge converts a force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular (at a right angle) to its inclined surfaces. A short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster, but it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle.

== How dangerous is it? ==
Because a wedge is thin on the edge, it is sharp. There are many wedges you have to be careful with, like knives and scissors.

== How does it vary? ==
Some wedges are used to separate. Common examples of this type of wedge include knives, axes, nails, scissors, and plows (British English: ''ploughs'').  Others are used to lift things or adjust the distance between them. A long tapered piece of wood called a shim is used in carpentry to make fine adjustments. Still other wedges are used to hold things in place. A doorstop is an example of this kind of wedge.

[[Image:Farmer_plowing_in_Fahrenwalde,_Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,_Germany.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A farmer plowing a field. The blade of the plow is a wedge that digs a furrow into the earth.]] 
== How has it changed the world? ==
The wedge might be the most important invention in human history. Without wedges, we would not have been able to cut wood, hunt animals, or make clothing. A particular kind of wedge called the plow allowed human beings to farm the land.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==

The only thing that people had to know was how to chip rock to make it sharp. Now we usually use metal for most wedges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:BOLT_SCREW_UBT_198.JPG|300px|thumb|right|A screw and a bolt.]]Screws are one of the six simple machines. They have a corkscrew-shaped ridge, known as a thread, wrapped around a cylinder. The head is specially shaped to allow a screwdriver or wrench to grip the screw when driving it in.

The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together &amp;mdash; such as wood &amp;mdash; and to position objects.  Often screws have a head on one end of the screw that allows it to be turned.  The head is usually larger than the body of the screw.  The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank. 

Bolts are a type of screw that usually is designed to work with a nut or another threaded fastener. 

== Who invented it? ==
Historians do not know who invented the screw. Although it seems to have been invented only in the last few thousand years. The screw was first used as part of the screw pump of Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Nineveh in the 7th century BC.

[[File:Archimedes-screw_one-screw-threads_with-ball_3D-view_animated_small.gif|thumb|200px|left|An Archimedes screw can lift water as it is rotated.]]Around 250 BC, the Greek inventor Archimedes made a screw pump. Archimedes' machine had a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. The blade was turned by hand. This type of machine is called the Archimedes screw. It is still used today for pumping liquids and other materials like coal and grain. By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in devices such as oil and wine presses. 

The metal screw did not become a common fastener until machines for mass production were developed at the end of the 18th century. In the 1770s, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden invented a machine that made metal screws. Handheld screwdrivers first appeared around 1800. These developments caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. 

Throughout the 19th century, the most common types of screw heads were round with simple slots that were turned using screwdrivers and square and hexagonal heads that were turned with wrenches. In the early 1930s, the Phillips-head screw was invented by Henry F. Phillips. This screw has a cross shaped recess in the head for the driver tool.

[[File:WinePress-Germany(Rheinland-Pfalz).JPG|thumb|150px|right|A wine press is used to squeeze the juice out of grapes.]]

== What does it do? ==
Screws do one basic thing. They convert a force that goes around and around into a force that goes up and down. This force can be used to push against an object. 

Machines that use screws to push against other objects are called ''presses''.  A press is used to make cider or wine by squashing fruit to extract the juice from it.  Printing presses were also used to make books. 

The up and down force generated by a screw can also be used to hold things together. Screws can thread into a metal nut and the up and down force holds the two together. One big advantage of screws used as fasteners is that they can be removed and reinserted many times without loosing their effectiveness. They have greater holding power than nails and can be easily disassembled and reused. 

Screws can also be used to lift things.  A device called an augur is used for lifting or pumping water or another liquid.  As the screw turn in the water, the water is lifted.  This is also how a concrete mixer (truck) unloads its load of concrete.

== How does it get power? ==
A screw is powered by the movement of the screw driver. It converts this rotational force (called torque) into up and down force. A screw's power depends on how close together the threads are and how far away from the center of the screw force is applied. You can get more power by making the threads closer together. If the threads are close together, then with each turn of the screw it travels a shorter distance but exerts more force. With tighter threads you have to turn the screw more times before it is tight. You can also get more power by using an object that allows you to apply force farther from the center of the screw. This is why it's easier to turn a screw or bolt with a long wrench than a shorter one. But there is a downside to using a longer wrench. With a longer wrench, you have to move the wrench farther in order to turn the screw the same distance. 

== How dangerous is it? ==
Screws are not usually dangerous, but some screws have a point that could scratch or puncture you. They also multiply force, so if you got your hand stuck in a press it could crush your hand.
[[File:Doublebass_scroll.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The tuning peg of a double bass uses a worm gear which is a kind of screw.]]
== How does it vary? ==
Certain screws may have different shapes, sizes, etc. to suit different needs. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as an internal thread, often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. Most screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread. Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to anticlockwise forces (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. Threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.

== How has it changed the world? ==
Inventions like the automobile would not be possible without the screw.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
The screw is like a ramp or inclined plane wrapped around a pole so the ramp had to be invented first. Although some screws have been made from wood, screws made from metal are much more useful because they can be more precise. Smelters to purify ore and forges to work metal were needed to make screws that were effective fasteners. In order to mass produce screws, a special lathe had to be developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Toilet_370x580.jpg|right|thumb|185px|A flush toilet]]
== Who invented it? ==
Flush toilets were first used in parts of India and Pakistan about 2,700 years ago. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system. Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and
Santorini in Greece. There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization,
toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company. Toilets are usually connected to a septic tank, or to a sewer.

In 1775 Alexander Cummings invented the S-trap, which is still used today, that used standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. His design had a sliding valve in the bowl outlet above the trap.

The flush toilet is sometimes called a water closet (&quot;WC&quot;).

== How does it get power? ==
A toilet works because of gravity. When a flush lever is pulled, a plug will open, allowing water to flow out to fill the basin. When the basin is full enough, gravity causes the liquid to flow out through a bend in the pipe, called an S trap.

== How does it work? ==
A flush toilet disposes of our waste products by using water to send them through a drainpipe to another location. It is sometimes called a water closet, or WC.

The picture below shows a typical toilet. The '''toilet bowl''' usually has a ring-shaped seat on top, which is covered by the '''lid''' when not in use.

The '''handle'/button, is pressed to flush the toilet.
The water used for flushing is stored in the '''tank''' (also called a '''cistern''')

[[File:Toilet-full-parts.png|thumb|250px|Main parts of a toilet]]

The tank contains some important parts. The next picture shows the parts of a typical tank.
The '''inlet valve''' controls the water supply coming into the tank. It lets water in when the tank is empty, and stops water coming in when the tank is full.

The &quot;'float ball&quot;' rises  as the tank fills with water. As it rises, the '''float rod''' attached to it presses against the '''inlet valve'''. When the tank is full, the rod is pressing against the inlet valve hard enough to turn the water off. This stops the tank from overflowing.

[[File:Toilet-cistern-01.png|thumb|300px|Parts of a typical toilet cistern]]

When you press the handle, a lever inside the tank pulls the '''piston''' up, forcing some water through the '''siphon'''. This provides suction in the siphon, and the rest of the water follows, emptying the tank.

[[File:Toilet-cistern-02.png|thumb|245px|A toilet cistern emptying]]

The tank empties quite quickly, and the float ball floats to the bottom. That means the float rod is no longer pressing against the valve, so water begins to flow into the tank, filling it up again.

[[File:Toilet-cistern-03.png|thumb|250px|A toilet cistern empty]]

The water which left the tank goes through a short pipe to the toilet bowl. It sloshes around the rim, down the sides of the bowl, and out through the drainpipe, cleaning the bowl and carrying the waste with it.

[[File:Toilet-bowl.png|thumb|250px|Arrows showing the way water flows from the cistern, through the toilet bowl, and out.]]

Some of the clean water coming behind remains at the bottom of the toilet bowl. That's because modern toilets have an 'S' bend which remains filled with water between flushing. The water in the 'S' bend stops bad odours escaping from the drainpipe. During flushing the 'S' bend also provides siphon action which helps speed up the flushing process.

However, since this type of toilet does not generally handle waste on site, separate waste treatment systems must be built.

== How dangerous is it? ==
The danger from a toilet isn't immediately obvious like that from a hot stove, but people have known for a long time that flushing a toilet can produce very small droplets of water known as aerosols.  These aerosols can contain bacteria and viruses that are in the toilet.  Because the aerosols float through the air and land on surfaces that people might later touch, there is a risk of becoming infected.  This has been believed to be a major cause for outbreak of atypical pneumonia within several high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong that are close to each other.

== What does it do? ==
The flush cleans the bowl of the toilet, and under the rim where it is difficult to clean. It carries waste matter to a drain, which then takes it to a treatment plant or septic tank.

== How does it vary? ==
Toilets come in many different types. There are chemical toilets, which use chemicals to neutralize the waste instead of water. There are composting toilets, which are better for the environment because they turn the waste into natural compost. There are even incinerating toilets, which burn the waste.

Some toilets have extra fixtures such as grab-bars for wheelchair users. Some toilets have a water jet built into them like a bidet. Some have heated seats, and lids that open and close automatically. And some will even check your blood pressure and temperature.

Different toilets use different amounts of water per flush. Older models use 13 or even 19 liters per flush while newer models use 6 liters (1.6 gallons) per flush. Today, some well-designed 6 liter toilets flush better than lesser toilets that use 2-3 times more water per flush. The design of the surfaces that control the flow of water make a big difference!

== How has it changed the world? ==
The toilet has made homes, towns and cities cleaner places to live in.  Because water cleans the toilets very well, highly contagious diseases cannot spread as easily as in the past, where very often thousands of people died at the same time, and to keep epidemics under control, cities and villages weren't allowed to grow beyond a certain population.  WC helps public health of today to keep higher standards than in the past.  That allows us today to live in much bigger cities than in the past, not being afraid of getting sick. Big cities were a requirement to start the industrial revolution in the 1800s.  We see that although WC seems to be an invention of minor importance, its impact to our modern world was much greater.  The toilet has also created a whole new profession like plumber and his associated industry.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
To have a flush toilet in your house, first of all one has to have fresh and clean water supply. A better organization of the cities was needed for that.
The lever and the siphon also had to be invented before the flush toilet could have come into being.

[[Image:Mercedes_V6_DTM_Rennmotor_1996.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An automobile engine. This engine is a V6, which means it has six cylinders and a &quot;V&quot; shaped block.]]
A '''car engine''' uses '''internal combustion engine''' which is a mechanical device which burns a fuel to produce power rotation which moves a vehicle.

== Who invented it? ==

Nicolaus Otto was the first person to successfully build the 4-stroke type of engine that would later become an car engine in 1876. In 1885 Karl Benz used an engine similar to Otto's engine to make a three-wheeled automobile move. In the same year, Benz began producing and selling automobiles.

The first commercial two-stroke engine involving in-cylinder compression is attributed to Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881 

== How does it get power? ==
The internal combustion engine gets its power from the '''heat generated from the burning of liquid fuels mixed with air (''vaporized'')'''. 

These are mostly '' 'fossil fuels' '' like gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that are mined from the ground, and are becoming harder to find and extract,   but some recent technologies use synthetic or renewable fuels such as hydrogen, which can be produced by electrolysis using renewable energy sources.

== What does it do? ==
It is a mechanical device that converts chemical energy (the fuel) to heat energy, and then to mechanical energy. Reciprocating (back and forth) motion is converted to rotary (spinning) motion, and transmitted through a clutch, gear box etc. to move the wheels of the car.

== How does it work? ==
[[File:4StrokeEngine Ortho 3D Small.gif|thumb|left|225px|Four-stroke cycle (or Otto cycle)&lt;br&gt;1. Intake&lt;br&gt;2. Compression&lt;br&gt;3. Power&lt;br&gt;4. Exhaust]]
An engine is properly called a motor because it makes things move! Engine really means ingenious devices, but we use the term because the process of burning a fuel and delivering power usually requires much more than a simple motor spinning an axle. (clever things like gears, levers and cables to get the power to where it is really needed). 

A motor burns a mixture of fuel and air in one or more metal tubes called cylinders.  The hot, expanding gas from the combustion drives a piston downwards, causing a crankshaft to rotate, and spin a flywheel, absorbs energy from the burned fuel and keeps things rotating until the next cycle.  The power from the rotating crankshaft and flywheel is what ultimately drives the wheels.

There are lots of different types of motor, but only two common sorts: the cheap, noisy and rather limited 2-stroke usually only found on small motorcycles and garden machines, and the more sophisticated Otto or 4-stroke used for cars, trucks and buses, which  motor (pictured here) has a fun mnemonic, starting with the piston at the 'top' (but note: this is  not always actually at the top, but - as in the picture left - that is how most folks call the end of the cylinder with the spark-plug or igniter which is also furthest from the '' 'bottom-end' ''  or crankshaft): 
* '''SUCK (1)''' in a mixture of air and fuel vapor (actually called ''induction stroke'' as the piston starts at the 'top' of the cylinder near the spark plug or igniter and goes down to the 'bottom' near the crankshaft)
* '''SQUEEZE (2)''' the mixture (a ''compression stroke'' as the piston goes 'up' towards the spark plug or igniter)
* '''BANG! (3)''' the spark plug or igniter sets fire to the compressed fuel and air (a ''power stroke'' to force the piston 'down' towards the crankshaft) - When the piston is furthest from the crankshaft, it is said to be at '' 'top-dead-center' '' - the actual spark usually occurs when the flywheel inertia has moved the crankshaft  a few degrees further, so the piston has actually already started its 'decent' before it gets a push from the expanding hot burning gasses!  
* '''BLOW (4)''' out the exhausted (burned) gasses form the burnt fuel (''the exhaust stroke'' - the piston returns to the 'top' of the cylinder ready to suck-in some fresh fuel and restart the cycle.
===Two Stroke Motor===
[[File:2-Stroke Engine ani.gif|thumb|left|2-stroke motor]]
[[File:Trabant601deLuxe.jpg|thumb|right|A Trabant 601 De Luxe Limousine.]]  
These were used in only a few small cars in the mid 20th century, notably the mass-produced East German Trabant, but also more famous makers of 'super-compacts' or 'ultra-lights' such as  DKW, Saab, Wartburg, Suzuki and Subaru produced small numbers of 2-stroke vehicles. 

A special mixture of fuel and lubricating oil is needed, because the fuel-and-air mixture is drawn in through the crankcase, with the end of the combustion stroke and the beginning of the compression stroke happening at the same time so that it performs the intake and exhaust functions together!

Although they have a better power-to-weight ratio than 4-strokes, they are more prone to wear and very polluting. Many industrial machines or ship engines use large 2-stroke diesel motors.

===Gasoline  and diesel===
The speed of gasoline (or petrol) engines is easier to control and usually lighter than an equivalent diesel, which work best at constant speed and really needs a turbo-charger to compensate for the diesel inertia.

Gasoline is a 'light' fuel, highly combustible and ignited with an electrical spark-plug. Diesel (sometimes called 'vaporising oil) is a thicker 'heavy' fuel which is much less inflammable, and is fired by very high compression within the cylinder. The diesel is 'injected' by a tube fitted about where a gasoline engine has its spark-plug. Diesel fuel is apt to become solid at low temperatures, and often has an 'anti-wax-agent' to prevent this. 

The diesel engine may require heating before it will work. This is usually done with an electrical heater, but some tractors motors designed for cold climates in the mid 20th century could use either fuel, and had to be started using petrol, then when hot, the driver could choose to use either expensive gasoline or cheap 'tractor vaporizing oil' which was in some European countries was subsidised and stained to detect its use in 'unauthorized' vehicles.

== How dangerous is it? ==
'''¡ VERY !''' Engines use inflammable liquid fuel that can leak, they produce heat which can ignite spilt fuel,  they are heavy and massive, so they stay hot long after they stop,  they produce power,  and have lots of moving parts which can crush fingers or catch clothing to trap and injure the unwary, so the main motor (called the '' 'prime mover' '') has to be turned off long before you can work on an engine.  Remember there are  other motors that are around to power such as cooling fans  that may be designed to work for some period of time  after the ''prime mover'' engine ignition is switched off).

'''Never open the hood or touch an engine unless you are certain it has properly cooled off''' -probably for at least an hour after stopping.

Always check that everything in the engine bay is cool and  is not leaking fuel or oil - plus make sure that any other motors have also actually stopped running before inserting anything under the hood (including particularly unprotected  fingers, loose long hair or dangling clothing).

== How does it vary? ==
[[File:Volkswagen motor cut 1945.JPG|thumb|left|A VW Beetle engine]]
Internal combustion engines vary in the number of cylinders they have, and the size and positioning of those cylinders.  For example, an Inline-4 has four cylinders in a line, and a V-6 has three pairs of cylinders in a &quot;V&quot; shape illustrated above.

Some Volkswagen designs  used an unusual four-stroke air cooled engine, with two cylinders either side ('' 'horizontally opposed, four-cylinder motor' '') which was originally designed for light aircraft. Illustrated here is one such, a Volkswagen Beetle motor of 1131 cubic centimetres (69 Cubic inches) total capacity, 25 PS (DIN) horsepower from 1945. It has been cut to show a  better view of the interior. The orange colour is the cut surfaces and the green colour  is the fuel-air  inlet  from the carburettor (mixer) which is in the middle, because it has to feed either side. The  exhaust, cooling fan, and electrical generator or  alternator is not shown. The oil filter and cooler is at the top left.


Automotive (vehicle) internal combustion engines  may be either 2-stroke or 4-stroke engines, and can use spark-ignition (SI) for 'volatile' gasoline or liquid petroleum gas (LPG) fuels and/or compression ignited (CI) diesel engines (as mentioned).

== How has it changed the world? ==
Very dramatically. Before the automobile, there was only horse-power for personal transport at around 10 - 15 km/h (less than 10 mph or roughly twice walking speed) and steam powered public transport managed about two or three times that speed. The internal combustion engine has made personal transportation very much faster, up to about 100 km/h (60mph) on ordinary roads. Unfortunately both gasoline and diesel are what ar called 'fossil fuels' because they are made by natural forces over many millions of years, and our rate of consumption means they may not last forever. Scientists have tried many other 'synthetic fuels' but with only limited success. So the car is also responsible, indirectly, for the way we in the western world now  live, with separate residential, industrial and commercial areas, which means most people need a car for work, shopping and social activities.  

Unfortunately massive car use has led to an increase in world pollution - the so-called '' 'greenhouse-gasses' '' which are thought to be warming the world and changing the weather. The polar ice caps seem to be melting, so the sea might rise, flooding coastal areas, and storms may become more violent because the air-flow is temperature sensitive.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
The ideas of converting reciprocatory (back and forth) motion of the to rotary (spinning) motion was known since ancient times, and used in lathes to make round posts and spindles.

The idea of using external heat to make steam was known to the ancient Greeks, but steam engines as we know them only emerged from reciprocating steam pumps developed since the 17th century. Later, in the 18th century more sophisticated steam engines had cranks and flywheels to produce rotary motion and speed control using governors. In the early 19th century steam locomotives were developed, and with them some of the accessories such as cabin heaters (to say nothing of steering mechanisms and brakes).

The big breakthrough was finding ways of burning the fuel inside the piston (internal combustion engine), rather than making high-pressure  steam or gas and then pumping that into the engine cylinders as occurs in steam and pneumatic motors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
{{wikijunior article stub}}

The wing is the part of airplane that enables it to rise into the air.

== Who invented it? ==
Many people tried to invent a wing that would let people fly. Even the famous inventor, Leonardo da Vinci drew up plans for different ways of flying with wings like a bird. The first wing that let a person fly was in ancient China in the year 559. It was really just a large kite. In 877, long before Marco Polo and other explorers brought back information about Chinese kites to Europe, an Arab inventor in Spain named Abbas Ibn Firnas made the first hang glider, and tested it himself.

Sir George Cayley and later Otto Lilienthal created working gliders that allowed people to fly as long ago as the 1800s. The Wright Brothers were famous for the airplane that they first demonstrated in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but their airplane's wings worked in the same way as Otto Lilienthal's glider wings from 1891.

== How does it get power? ==

The only power that a wing needs is to be moved forward through the air. In a glider the wing is either pushed to get it started, or it is brought somewhere high up and dropped, like a hang glider pilot starting from the top of a cliff. In a powered airplane, the engines either push or pull the wings through the air.

The shape and positioning of a wing is very important. Most wings are curved, which makes the air going over them go faster than the air going under them.  Because the air above the wing moves faster, it is more spread out than the air below the wing. Air presses on everything around it, even though you can't feel it. When there is more air it pushes more on the things around it. The fast-moving, spread-out air over the top of the wing lets the air on the bottom of the wing push the wing up, creating lift.

Another way to think of it is that the wing of an airplane is usually tilted so that the front is higher than the back. The air that follows the upper and lower surfaces of the wing is directed downward by the wing's shape and tilt.  This creates an opposing upward lifting force on the wing itself.  It is the lift from the wings that carries a plane through the air.

== How dangerous is it? ==
Airplane wings are not dangerous. Airplanes themselves have a good safety record when they are well maintained and handled. Wings are as dangerous as any fast moving object can be and so depends also on the material it is made. First planes were made of very flimsy material because of weight and wings strength evolved accordingly to the speed requirements, the faster the plane the stronger the material must be.

== What does it do? ==
[[Image:Royal.brunei.b767-300er.v8-rbl.arp.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A commercial airplane landing. The flaps on the trailing edge of the wing are fully extended in landing position.]] A wing is a part of airplane that lifts it up. There are mainly four forces acting on airplane while in air. Wings provide the force to the airplane that takes it up against the force of gravity due to earth. An airplane wing is specially designed so that air that passes around it actually helps lift up the plane. It is also streamlined in shape so that the plane can move at maximum speed.

The  horizontal 'front' or 'leading edge' splits the air so that the airstream over the top of the wing has to travel further than the airstream beneath the wing. When the two streams meet again at the 'trailing edge' the upper airstream has been stretched and the lower airstream has been compressed. The wing tries to equalize the air pressure above and below by moving up, but of course it can not move upwards without also lifting the airplane! 

[[File:Aircraft flaps.svg|thumb|left|Flaps (green) are used to increase the wing area and to increase the lift. Spoilers(red) increase the turbulence to cause 'drag', flaps and spoilers maximize drag and minimize lift while landing. Flaps can also increase lift during take-off, while the airplane  speed is increasing]]The reason an airplane is so called is because each wing provides two flat surfaces or planes which are joined by a thick, almost semicircular leading edge, and which  meet at the sharp trailing edge. Because they split the air wings are properly called Aero-planes or (mostly in the USA) airplanes. Helicopter blades and propellers also technically possess 'airplanes' but today for most people who are not aviation specialists or 'aerodynamicists' the term simply means the complete 'fixed wing aircraft'

Wing shape can be modified to increase or decrease lift using flaps and ailerons

== How does it vary? ==
All airplane wings contain flaps to increase lift and drag.  Some airplane wings, especially those of larger jets, have spoilers that will further slow down the airplane.  This is important in landing, where one must land at the slowest speed possible without stalling and then stop the airplane's movement as quickly as possible.

In larger airplanes the wings often have the engines fixed onto them.

== How has it changed the world? ==
An airplane wing is one of the most fundamental things that allow a plane to fly.  Without it, a plane does not fly and it has brought planes all over the world.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
The first plane had to be invented before any experimentation with the wing could occur. The earliest wings were simply light framed wooden planks, with no such inbuilt drag or lift functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who invented it? ==
Hard disks were first invented in the 1950s and were initially called fixed disks or 'Winchesters' (the name of a popular IBM offering introduced in 1972.)
The first magnetic hard disc for storage was the IBM 305 RAMAC which appeared in 1956. RAMAC (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control) quickly became the industry standard.
For years hard drives were confined to mainframes and servers.

== How does it get power? ==
The hard disk gets its power from one of the variable electrical output leads of the SMPS (switch mode power supply) of the computer.

== How does it work? ==

First take a close look at the hard drive image [http://www.primelec.com/the_electronic_library/computer_accessories/technology here]. This will give you a great idea of how each part is working together inside a hard drive.

Imagine a bunch of bar magnets all in a row, with the ends sticking towards you. Imagine that the first one has the north side sticking up, then the next 2 have south sticking up, and then 5 have north sticking up again. If you place a bunch of magnets together like this, you can start creating a code. A code created out of only north and south signals. In fact, computers are based on a very simple code based on only 0s and 1s called binary. North and South can be translated into 0 and 1 very easily.  

A hard disk turns this line of magnets into a disk. Imagine spinning the long line of magnets like a thread around, like rolling up a piece of paper. To read the hard disk, all you have to do is spin the disk, and place another very small detection magnet close to it. The detection magnet is called a magneto-resistive read sensor.  From the pattern of north and south, you can translate the code from &quot;North and South&quot; into everything on a computer.

The hard disk is also able to flip the magnets any time, so it can turn a magnet from &quot;north&quot; into &quot;south&quot; very easily. This allows it to not only read the disk, but write to it. Basically, it can change the &quot;code&quot; of north-south any time the computer wants it to.

When computers do this, they spin the disk very fast. They can read the code millions of times a second. Much work has been done to help make the disk spin faster and faster.

== How dangerous is it? ==

Not very dangerous unless you open one up while attached to a power supply. A big mistake!

== What does it do? ==
It is a mass storage device which can be used to store operating systems and a number of pieces of software. It is one of the main components of Desktop and Laptop computers. One hard disk  can be partitioned to create a number of different virtual disks. Each such virtual disk can store (and work) a different operating system. The newer hard disks are much smaller than the original ones, but can store much much more than their ancestors. Not forgetting about their speeds. The newer hard disks can fetch data (stored in them) at the wink of an eye.... sometimes even faster.

== How does it vary? ==
Not that many hard drives vary, except for the amount of data that they hold. There are different types of hard drives, like external hard drives and internal hard drives. Some types of hard drives are explained below.

==== Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) ====
These types of drives are also known as ''Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)'' and ''Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE)'' drives. These hard drives are very slow.

==== Serial ATA (SATA) ====
SATA drives are more efficient, and use less power than PATA drives. They are also faster than the PATA drives.

==== Solid State Drives (SSD) ====
These hard disks, unlike the other types, don't consist of moving components. The other hard drives explained above comprise of a spinning magnetic disk that performs the function of storing data , but SSDs use semi-conductors for this purpose. Since there are no moving components, these hard disks are much faster than the other drives.

== How has it changed the world? ==

Hard drives enable computers and other electronic devices such as MP3 players to store massive amounts of information for use later. 

Hard drives have allowed computer programmers to build enormously complex programs and store them for use on computers. Complex programs such as the one you are using to read this would not have been available prior to the introduction of hard drives. 

Before hard drives were used in computers, popular storage mediums included cardboard cards, paper tape (with holes punched in it), magnetic tape, and magnetic tape formed into disks called floppy disks. 

As computer programs have increased in size, hard drives have had to also increase in size to store the data.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
*The computer
*Magnetic data storage

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who invented it? ==
[[Image:Sony_ericsson_K700i.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A mobile phone. Some mobile phones are small enough to fit in the palm of our hand and also include text messaging and web browsing.]]The invention of the mobile phone, or cellphone as it is often called, is credited to Dr. Martin Cooper at Motorola.  He made the first successful call over the system on April 3 of 1973.

== How does it get power? ==
All portable cellphones use an electrical battery.  

The batteries are usually rechargeable, so they can be used over and over again with recharging.  To recharge the battery, the cellphone is plugged into a charger that connects to either a car battery or an electrical wall socket.  Charging stores electrical energy onto the battery, which is then slowly used up by the cell phone after it has been unplugged.

Most cellphones typically use a 3.6 volt battery.  The battery will usually last 2-3 days before it needs to be recharged depending on how much the phone is used.

== How does it work? == 
The cellphone is a combination of a telephone and a radio.  Like a telephone, you can listen and talk to someone on the other end, and like a radio, you can do it wirelessly over the air.  The signals that come into and go out of a cellphone are like the ones TV and radio are received on, just formatted differently.

Signals are sent back and forth between the cellphone and a base station.  The base station is  a device that is usually a mile or two away from where the cellphone is being used and has an antenna that is high up on a tower.  Since radio signals can bounce around and go through walls and windows, you don't have to be within sight of the base station in order to communicate with it.  Once the signals arrive at the base station, they are converted into regular telephone signals and sent over the public telephone network to whomever you are calling, or sent back out from another base station if you are calling another cellphone.

The reason why it is called a cellphone is that it operates inside a &quot;cell&quot;.  A cell is a geographic region in which a base station is located.  If you are located in that cell, your cellphone communicates to the base station inside that cell.  If you move into a different cell, you are transferred seamlessly to a different base station inside the other cell.  By keeping the cells small and having many base stations located every couple of miles, more users can talk at the same time from different places.

[[Image:Telstra_Mobile_Phone_Tower.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A transmission tower for mobile phones.]]Also since there are many cells, one is located close to where you are using the phone, so the phone does not have to transmit with too much power.  Less power means the phone can be made smaller and use less battery.  Think of it as if you were at a party in a large room with a lot of people talking.  If you were talking to a person just 3 feet way, you don't have to shout for them to hear you.  Meanwhile, someone at the other end of the room could be talking to someone else near them and not interfere with what you are saying.

== How dangerous is it? ==
When properly used a cellphone is not dangerous at all.  A cellphone uses microwave frequency to communicate over the air to a base station.  To do so, it transmits about 1 Watt of power from its antenna.  You can compare that with the amount of power a single Christmas light bulb consumes.

Since talking on a mobile phone is distracting, it can be dangerous to use one while driving. Several studies have shown that drivers have more accidents while using cellphones, even when using &quot;hands-free&quot; systems. Many countries and some U.S. states have passed laws to restrict use of mobile phones while driving.

Many gas stations have signs warning people not to use mobile phones while pumping gas. There is a small chance that a broken cellphone can cause a spark that can ignite gas vapors. Although this is very unlikely, it's best to be safe than sorry, and not use electronic equipment such as mobile phones where explosive gas may be present.

== What does it do? ==
A mobile phone allows you to use telephone service from almost anywhere.  Most telephones are what is called &quot;land line&quot; or &quot;fixed line&quot; meaning they are physically tied to the land by a wire that plugs into a jack that goes to the phone company.  A portable or cordless phone allows you to talk wirelessly but the receiver is still connected to the same land line.  The cordless phone can only work within 100 - 200 feet of your receiver that is connected to the land line.

A mobile phone allows you more range and allows you to communicate much further from virtually anywhere in the city, country, or world.  You have the ability to make a telephone call or receive one wherever you happen to be with your mobile phone.

== How does it vary? ==
Mobile phones or cellphones come in many different configurations.  Most are about the size of a candy bar, have a display and a keypad.  Some configurations come with a flip that opens up to show the display and the keypad, thereby keeping it protected.

Cellphones are available both big and small, simple and complex.  Some just make simple phone calls, others have tiny cameras, MP3 players, digital organizers built into them.  Some of the newer models, can even allow you to use the internet over them, browse various services such as news, movie listings, or chat using instant messaging services.

New models are always being introduced.  New fashions, new technology, more features, cheaper cost, better performance, keep the market place filled with plenty of choices.

== How has it changed the world? ==
The mobile phone has radically changed the world since its introduction in 1973.  With each year more and more people are owning one.  Most families typically have two or three.

The ability to easily communicate to anyone, anywhere, is a powerful concept.  This was true when the telegraph was first invented, and then taken to a new level with the advent of the telephone.  The mobile phone is just the next extension of that technology.

Ease of communication, leads to more efficient communication, and thus to an efficient use of time and resources.  More efficient communication leads to better collaboration, better ideas, better use of time, more peace of mind. It provides an important lifeline in times of emergency.

But aside from practical applications, it also provides benefits socially and is fun.  It allows communications with friends and family regardless of location.  Whether you're calling to say something important, or just to chat about nothing at all.

Many mobile phones now have cameras built into them, allowing you to take a photo anywhere at any time, some people buy mobile phones just for the camera and don't even use it to phone or text people!

Plenty of important events and controversies have happened because people could organise things quicker with mobile phones. In Britain, a series of strikes by cargo lorry drivers over rising fuel prices was supposedly organised by one man and a mobile phone. Mobile phones with cameras and video are increasingly being used to capture important events when television crews are not available.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
Since the mobile phone is a combination of a telephone and a radio, these two devices are the building blocks upon which the mobile phone was developed. In addition, tiny computers (microprocessors) are needed to control the radio and its connection to the nearest base station.

The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876.

The radio was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896.

The microprocessor was invented by Gary Boone in 1971.

Marconi's patents for radio were revoked later, and Nikola Tesla's were re-instated for his invention of radio at a much earlier date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who invented it? ==
George Heilmeier

== How does it get power? ==
Electricity is used to power an LCD display.  It is used to provide power for '''backlighting''' and to control the configuration of the display itself.

== How does it work? ==
'''LCD''' stands for '''L'''iquid '''C'''rystal '''D'''isplay.  As the name suggests, it is a display that is made using '''liquid crystals'''.  Liquid crystals are used to control the passage of light through the display screen.  Where light is allowed through, the screen appears bright and where light is blocked the screen appears dark.

The liquid crystals in their natural state are in a '''twisted''' but predictable form.  They are positioned between a pair of '''polarizing''' filters in the display.  Polarizing filters can be thought of as a grill that only allows light waves in one orientation to pass through.  The two polarizing filters in an LCD display are aligned so their grills are in the same direction.  Light passing through the first filter is polarised.  As the polarized light passes along the liquid crystals it is directed by the crystals and emerges parallel to the second set of polarizing filters.  Because the light waves are parallel to the polarizing filter, they are allowed through.

When a voltage is applied to the liquid crystals, they '''untwist''' slightly, changing the orientation of the polarized light so that it no longer emerges parallel to the second polarizing filter.  This causes the light to be blocked by the filter, so that the screen at that point appears dark.

LCD displays consist of separately controlled sections of liquid crystals.  These can number from just a few (as in a watch) to many thousands or millions (as in a computer display or television).

== How dangerous is it? ==
Zero Percent

== What does it do? ==
It shows information including images and motion pictures.

We have LCD Televisions, Laptop displays is an LCD.

== How does it vary? ==
Some displays rely on natural (or '''ambient''') light to provide the illumination for the screen, and usually have a reflective surface at the back of the display to reflect any natural light entering the display back through the display to its surface.

Other types of displays have '''backlighting''', which is where there is an electrical light source behind the display that illuminates the display where light is permitted through.

The original LCDs only had two different 'colours', one dark and one light, with only two intensities (on and off).  The colours were usually black and light grey (the colour produced by ambient light moving through the display).  More recently, LCDs with variable intensities have been produced, where the voltage applied to each liquid crystal can be controlled so that the amount of untwisting is varied and so the amount of light allowed through is varied.

Colour LCDs have also been developed (such as those used in colour televisions).  These consist of millions of dots (or '''pixels'''), each of which has several coloured sections which can individually be turned on at varying intensities.  Because the pixel sections are so small and so close together, our vision interprets this combination of colours as a single shade.  The display is therefore able to represent millions of possible colours.

== How has it changed the world? ==
LCD uses very low power compared to its alternatives. Thus its helps to save power and provide good picture quality

DVD stands for &quot;'''D'''igital '''V'''ersatile '''D'''isc&quot;. A DVD is used to hold information that can be read by a computer using a laser. DVDs are used mainly for movies, television programs and computer programs like games. DVDs are the same shape and size as a compact discs but they store much more information in a different way.

== Who invented it? ==

The DVD was invented by a group of companies including most of the world's largest makers of home video equipment including Toshiba, Philips, Sony and Matsushita Electric.

== How does it get power? ==
A DVD player is powered by electricity. DVD players can either be powered by mains electricity or batteries.

== How does it work? ==

DVDs are of the same shape and thickness as CDs, and they are made using some of the same materials and manufacturing methods. Like a CD, the data on a DVD is held in the form of small pits and bumps on the disc. A DVD is made up of several layers of plastic that is 1.2 mm thick. Each layer is made by injection moulding plastic. This forms a disc that has tiny bumps (often called pits) arranged as a single very long spiral track of data. These bumps are where all the data is stored.  The bumps and pits on a DVD are coded information.

Each writeable layer of a DVD has a spiral track of data. On single-layer DVDs, the track always circles from the inside of the disc to the outside. That the spiral track starts at the center means that a single-layer DVD can be smaller than 12 centimeters if desired.

== How dangerous is it? ==

The DVD is not dangerous by itself unless it is broken. Then the pieces are very sharp and could cut your fingers - or your feet if you step on them. 

== What does it do? ==

It stores digital information that can be used by a DVD player or computer.

== How does it vary? ==
The first DVDs had a ''single layer'' and could store around 4.5 Gigabytes of data. Later on scientists found a way to make more layers so it could store even more data. These multi-layered DVDs are called ''dual layer'' DVDs which can store around 8.5 Gigabytes of data. Nowadays there are two more types of DVDs which are called Blu-ray and HD-DVD that can store even more. The single layer Blu-ray disc can store 25 Gigabytes of data while the dual layer Blu-ray disc's can store 50 Gigabytes of data. The HD-DVDs can store around 15 Gigabytes of data per layer. The HD-DVDs are no longer available.

== How has it changed the world? ==
The DVD has modernized the current generations of video playing devices into the digital age.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
The DVD was seen as the next step from the video cassette. There are many inventions involved to make a DVD possible. First of all, the computer had to be invented. You'll realize this when you try to understand how DVD works. On a DVD disk there is coded in a binary form all the information one needs to record a picture.

[[Image:Indian filter coffee in Dabarah.jpg|right|thumb|South Indian filter coffee served in a traditional tumbler and dabarah / davarah]]

'''Madras filter coffee''' requires the use of specific fresh-roasted [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee beans]] and [[Cookbook:Chicory|chicory roots]] which are not always available outside [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. An alternative is to use a brand of Indian instant coffee that has chicory in it, and is available in some Indian stores and supermarkets. Nestle Bru instant coffee has 30% chicory added and in general has a near enough taste to authentic Madras filter coffee.

Indian coffee is generally not black coffee and is made using milk instead of water.

==Procedure==
To make one cup of coffee:
# Heat a small quantity (¼) cup of water until it boils.
# Put ½ to 2 teaspoon (depending on how strong you want to have the coffee) of instant coffee in it.
# Stir the solution and ensure that there are no lumps of coffee.
# Boil ¾ cup of milk and bring to boil.
# Add the coffee mixture to the milk and add sugar as per your preference.
# While the coffee is still boiling hot, pour it into a mug or, preferably, a stainless steel tumbler. While pouring the coffee, slowly raise the saucepan until the coffee falls into the mug/tumbler from a height of about 1 to 1½ ft. This will cause the coffee to froth (like espresso).
# You can dip a teaspoon in the coffee and lightly spread a few drops of it over the froth in the mug.
# Serve piping hot.

NOTE: filter coffee in India is actually made in a closed steel container called a coffee filter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thanks for building this!  I bet you've probably thought of this already, but just in case, I think it would be really helpful if you put screenshots up at every step.  We could even be fancy and show off wxhaskell's multiplatformedness by putting versions for different OSes.  In any case,  a good place to put the shots would be the  [[commons:|commons]].  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:15, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks for the suggestion. I've just made an account on commons, so the screenshots will be up soon enough :) I only have wxHaskell set up on a Windows OS. I might try it on Linux, but I'm a total Linux noob, so that can take a while ;) In case you or other people want to make screenshots of other OSes, I'll add the OS in the filename :)
: I try to explain only the basics of wxHaskell developing, with a strong focus on using the documentation and the samples. At the FP class at university, we only got [http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/pubs.html#wxhaskell Daan's paper] with a minimum amount of explanation and hardly anyone knew how to read the docs. I'm trying to improve on this by showing how I use the docs when looking for stuff.--[[User:Tchakkazulu|Tchakkazulu]] 22:58, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

:: On a completely random note, when you feel somewhat comfortable with wxHaskell, you might consider having a look at [http://autoforms.sourceforge.net autoforms].  Can you imagine... no more boring work creating GUIs... only write the interesting bits, and let autoforms derive the easy ones. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

There, screenshots added. Someone more mediawiki-savvy than I might want to fix some display things. --[[User:Tchakkazulu|Tchakkazulu]] 00:40, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

I'm almost done with what I had planned for this module; a small part about event filters and it's finished. Maybe I'll add some exercises involving events and attributes, because that's a really important part of GUIs, interactivity and such. I wasn't able to sneak in mutable variables, as much as I wanted to. A separate chapter for them seems a bit overdone.
I know there are a lot of subjects of wxHaskell not covered here, such as instances of &lt;tt&gt;Paint&lt;/tt&gt; and all fun stuff to do with that, creating custom controls and attributes, menubars/toolbars/context-menus and option dialogs, but I have to do more of those first before I can explain it and write decent, good-looking code about it.
Twas fun :) --[[User:Tchakkazulu|Tchakkazulu]] 23:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

:Woo! Hope you stick around and find more stuff to work on in the book.  I suppose we could envision an advanced graphics article (going all the way up to FRP?).  Or, if that's outside the scope of the book, we could even do something like that on HaskellWiki.

: Speaking of which, something you might consider doing is adding something to your user page saying that your Haskell stuff can be used under the HaskellWiki's simple permissive license.  Not neccesary of course, but this allows them to use our stuff, just like we use their stuff.  Then again, this weakens the GFDL terms, which you might not like so much... 

: In any case, thanks again! I'm really glad we have an actual GUI page now, and not just a stub, partly because it's useful in itself, and partly because graphical interfaces are an easy way to show people that Haskell is a &quot;real world&quot; language, not just a bunch of academic nonsense :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

==Screenshots license==

Commons should not be used for uploading these screenshots. Fair use is not allowed over there, and they depict winXP screens which is copyrighted by Microsoft. Blah... they will probably be auto-removed from commons very soon so I'll upload them here to wb. After checking if that's possible.

I think I'm supposed to use [[Template:Screenshot]] as a license. Any more trapdoors? --[[User:Tchakkazulu|Tchakkazulu]] 23:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

:How frustrating!  I guess the best bet would be to take the screenshots under Linux.  It would be nice to use commons in case we ever decide to translate the wikibook, or something.  Oh well... I guess moving the xp ones to wikibooks will have to do for now  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:43, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

== General Overview ==

'''''The Forbidden Forest''''' is a patch of untamed forest that grows on the grounds of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]]. It is home to many magical creatures, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorns]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|centaurs]], and is more or less in the charge of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], Keeper of the Keys and Grounds. Hagrid's hut is located on the very edge of the Forest. The Forest has received its name because it is forbidden to all students, except in special circumstances.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear of the Forbidden Forest at the Arrival Feast on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] first day at Hogwarts; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] tells the First Years that the forest on the grounds is off limits, and goes on to say that he feels he must remind some of the older students of that fact as well. As he says this last, he seems to be looking at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]].

The Forbidden Forest is not as forbidden as the name implies; quite often students are taken to the very edge and even within it as part of their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] studies, starting in their third year. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 15|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] serve a detention in the Forest supervised by Hagrid. Presumably, the prohibition is to prevent students from going unaccompanied into the Forest, although that is never explicitly stated.

== Analysis ==

In order to have Care of Magical Creatures classes, there must be magical creatures; part of the Forbidden Forest's function is to provide a near-by habitat. Because they were studied in Care of Magical Creatures, it is known that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bowtruckle|Bowtruckles]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriffs]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] live there; also encountered are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantulae]]. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] briefly roamed there some twenty years ago, and apparently the rumours of his presence remain.

The Forest is an uncharted and wild place where the unexpected happens. This can be gauged by Ron's unwillingness to go into the Forest in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 15|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]; he believes there are werewolves in there and additionally, suffering arachnophobia, fears meeting spiders.

The Forest also provides concealment. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]'s flying car limps off into the Forest after crashing into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], an arena is constructed for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Tri-Wizard Tournament's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|first challenge]]. This arena, which must be large enough for the entire school plus four dragons, is constructed around a corner of the Forbidden Forest so it will not be visible from Hogwarts. Additionally, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Hagrid keeps his half-brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]] hidden there. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] believes Hermione's outrageous claim that Dumbledore has a secret weapon, and seems to be willing to accept at face value that it is hidden in the Forest. She forces Hermione and Harry to accompany her into the Forest to find it&amp;mdash;an act she later regrets. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|the final book]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] use the Forest as a place of concealment while planning the next assault on Hogwarts.

Pad Thai sauce is commonly used in a Thai dish that shares the same name. This is a simplified version that is versatile enough to use in many other dishes.

==Ingredients==

* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] vegetable oil (preferably peanut oil)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] tamarind or pineapple juice
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] soy sauce
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60ml) sugar
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60ml) Thai fish sauce
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] cornstarch
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] sambal oelek chili paste
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] ground Thai tea leaves

-------------------------------


== Definition ==
'''Marketing''' is the science of meeting the needs of a customer by providing valuable products to customers by utilizing the expertise of the organization, at same time, to achieve organizational goals.  According to The American Marketing Association [http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/DefinitionofMarketing.aspx]:

Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

With this definition, it is important to realize that the customer can be an individual user, a company, or several people who contribute to the purchasing decision.  The product can be a hard good, a service, or even an idea – anything that would provide some value to the person who provides an exchange.  An exchange is most often thought of as money, but could also be a donation of time or effort, or even a specific action.  A producer is often a company, but could be an individual or non-profit organization.

Classical marketing is often described in terms of the four “P’s, which are:

* '''Product''' – what goods or services are offered to customers
* '''Promotion''' – how the producer communicates the value of its products
* '''Price''' – the value of the exchange between the customer and producer
* '''Placement''' – how the product is delivered to the customer.

A complete analysis of these categories is often called the '''Marketing Mix'''.  More detail on these categories can be found in the later entry on the Marketing Plan.

Marketing has both inbound and outbound activities.  Inbound activities largely center on discovering the needs and wants of the potential customers.  The collective group of all potential customers is called a market.  Categorizing these needs into groups is called segmentation.  Organizing markets into segments allows a producer to more logically decide how to best provide value to that group of potential customers.  The analysis of market segment needs; analysis of existing sales and profitability; the descriptions, design and introduction of new products; and the analysis of competitor offerings are also inbound activities that are important but not often seen by the public.

Outbound activities include all aspects of informing the market that a product is available, delivering that product, and encouraging the purchase decision.  These activities include advertising, promotion, supply chain, sales support, product training, and customer support.

To the public, the most common interaction with marketing is where it touches the discipline of sales in the form of advertising.   This interaction leads to a common misconception that marketing is only this aspect of promotion.  Instead, it is useful in understanding that:


&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;'''Marketing is a data driven science.'''&lt;/div&gt;


The good marketer will develop the data necessary to define the customer’s needs, develop a good product based on the available resources, deliver the product in an effective manner to the consumer at a price that reflects the customer value and the profit desired by the producer.

== Marketing Models ==


When the producer is a commercial entity and the end user makes the purchasing decision, the model used to describe this transaction is often called a Business to Consumer (B2C) model.  When the producer is a commercial entity and a second commercial entity makes the purchasing decision but provides the product to their customer, then the model is often called a Business to Business (B2B) model.  The difference in these models affects how the marketer constructs his marketing analysis and marketing mix.

== Aspects of Marketing ==


Marketing has many aspects or sub-disciplines within the broad discipline of marketing.  They include:


•	Advertising.

•	Branding.

•	Copywriting.

•	Customer relationship management (CRM).

Marketing functions in all of these areas.  A marketer can do many of these functions within an organization or specialize in one or more.

==The Market==
{{Wikipedia|Customer}}


&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''prospective customers for a given product, service, or idea''&lt;/div&gt;


The market consists of all prospective customers for a given product, service, or idea.  Customers can be purchasers who intend to resell the product or end users who intend to use or consume the product.  The market can be categorized into separate groups called segments.  When a producer appeals to a market or market segment, the producer must take into account the distinction between the end user or consumer and the purchaser or decision maker(s).  This is especially true in B2B models.  The market may be individuals or organizations who are able to purchase the organization’s product.  Each entity in the delivery chain will have different needs, so a complete market needs analysis must include all potential segments and all entities within each segment.


==The Product==
{{Wikipedia|Product (business)}}
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''all goods, services, and ideas that are sold or traded''&lt;/div&gt;



Products that can be marketed include all goods, services, and ideas that are sold or traded. Products can be either ''tangible'', as in the case of physical goods, or ''intangibles'', such as those associated with service benefits or ideas (intellectual property), or any combination of the three.  The ''producer'' is the entity that offers the product to the market.  The producer can be the manufacturer, the wholesaler, the retailer, the service provider, or a combination of these.  For services, it is sometimes easier to use the term ''provider'' instead of producer.

===''Goods''===

Goods are a '''physical product''' capable of being delivered to a purchaser and involves the transfer of ownership from seller to customer.

===''Services''===

A service is a non-material action resulting in a measurable change of state for the purchaser caused by the provider.

===''Ideas (Intellectual Property)''===

Intellectual Property is any '''creation of the intellect that has commercial value''', but is sold or traded only as an idea, and not a resulting service or good. This includes copyrighted property such as literary or artistic works, and ideational property, such as patents, appellations of origin, business methods, and industrial processes.

==Product Pricing==
{{Wikipedia|Supply and Demand}}
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''price is set at a level which indicates the perceived value agreement between producer and purchaser''&lt;/div&gt;



Once an organization has its product to sell, it must then determine the appropriate price to sell it at.  The ''price'' is set by balancing many factors including supply-and-demand, cost, desired profit, competition, perceived value, and market behavior.  Ultimately, the final price is determined by what the market is willing to exchange for the product.  Pricing theory can be quite complex because so many factors influence what the purchaser decides is a fair value.

It also should be noted that, in addition to monetary exchange, price can be the exchange of goods or services as in a barter agreement, or an exchange of specific behavior, such as a vote in a political campaign.

==Product Promotion==
{{Wikipedia|Promotion (marketing)}}
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''informing the market about a product, product line, brand, or company and encouraging a purchase decision''&lt;/div&gt;



Once an organization has learned the market needs, produced or procured a product, and priced it, it then needs to promote the product by letting the market know that it exists, and how it can be purchased.



''Promotion'' involves providing information about a product, product line, brand, or company.  There are many ways to promote including:

* Advertising
* Personal selling
* Sales discounts
* Public Relations/Publicity
* Sampling
* Word of mouth, including electronic endorsements
* Product placement

==Product Distribution==
{{Wikipedia|Distribution (business)}}
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''delivery of the product to the purchaser''&lt;/div&gt;



Once an organization has produced or procured, priced, and promoted a product, it then needs to deliver that product to the purchaser.  Some distribution examples:

* Direct sale to the customer from the producer
* Wholesale distribution where the producer sells in large quantities only to an intermediary, not the end user
* Retail sales where a retailer will buy large quantities, but sell smaller quantities to individual customers
* Value added resale (VARs) where an organization purchases a product from a producer and, in turn, resells it to a consumer after adding additional products, services, or expertise.

&lt;/div&gt;


==The Organization's Marketing Strategy &amp; Six Duties==




&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''focus on developing relationships with customers''&lt;/div&gt;



The overall marketing strategy of an organization should focus on developing relationships with customers to understand their needs, and to develop goods, services, and ideas to meet those needs.

#'''Information Gathering''': research potential customers, their needs, and spending habits in order to understand what sort of product, service, or idea they wish to buy.
#'''Evaluation of Organization Capabilities''': decide what your organization can produce relatively well, and what your organization is not capable of producing based on the organization's specific strengths and weaknesses.
#'''Identify Market Opportunities''': research the current market for a product idea, and look for an opportunity; such as no competition or strong demand.
#'''Set Objectives of Marketing Strategy''': decide what results need to be achieved in order to reach the organization's goals; such as a specific increase in sales, or net profits.
#'''Formulate an Action Plan''': List the specific steps the organization needs to take in order to implement the marketing plan, and assign the responsibilities to specific staff members.
#'''Monitor &amp; Evaluate''': Study the marketing plan regularly, at least once per quarter, to track performance against the set objectives.

==Evaluating Market Opportunities==


&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''new products, new customers, and increasing sales to current customers''&lt;/div&gt;

===''Broad Techniques''===

#Niche Strategy: Find a niche of customers under-served by current offerings.
#Growth Strategy: Increase revenue from existing market niches and deliver better offerings to new target markets.
#Defensive Strategy: Maintain leadership position by developing brand loyalty, mass distribution.
#Offensive Strategy: Adopt a policy of destroyer pricing to preempt the entry of new firms or drive away the existing competitors.

===''Specific Techniques''===

#Market Penetration: Increase sales of an organization's current products in the current market through a more aggressive marketing campaign.
#Market Development: Increase sales by selling current products in new markets, possibly to satisfy new consumer needs or to identify new market segments.
#Product Development: Offer new and improved products to the current market.
#Diversification: Move into multiple lines of revenue generation.

==The Marketing Plan==

The Marketing Plan combines - for a given period (one year for example) and a given range of products and services - all aspects of an organizations' marketing efforts into one coherent plan. It tries to blend these efforts in a synergistic fashion for maximum results.  Marketing plans will vary from organization to organization but all have the core components listed here.

==Executive Summary==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''outlines the key elements of the marketing plan''&lt;/div&gt;


The [[w:Executive Summary|Executive Summary]] outlines the key elements of the marketing plan, with a specific focus on '''product''', '''pricing''', '''promotion''', and '''placement'''.  Other elements that may be discussed are: '''people''' (staff), '''process''' (of providing a service), '''physical evidence''' (make  service more tangible to potential customer), and '''philosophy''' (whereby the product reflects the philosophy of the organization).

An example of the executive summary is as follows:

'Forum For International Trade Training (FITT) 2006 international marketing plan of the year.'


&quot;The eastern seaboard of the United States has witnessed significant growth in the security industry since the tragedy of September 11, 2001.  Reaction by both government and citizens alike, has left little doubt that the United States is determined to enhance security and in doing so, provide its nation with greater protection and peace of mind.  In response to the World-Trade Center bombing government, citizens, and institutions have purchased a significant number of security related products and services.  Now, 5 years later, people are beginning to recognize the inherent need for security products that can help predict and ultimately prevent potential threats to their citizens.  It is with this in mind that the general public of the United States, and more specifically those on the eastern seaboard, have come to realize the need for greater public surveillance.  In response to this cry for help, March Networks is in an ideal position to propose the installation of public security cameras for multi-purpose use.  

March Networks is to be credited for its eastern seaboard market penetration as it pertains to security in the areas of banking and public transportation.  In recognition of these significant achievements, it is highly recommended that March Networks continue to take advantage of its dominant and respected position by expanding the use of recognized products in two new, but complimentary market areas.  Preliminary analysis suggests that the public property and traffic management sector and the taxi industry are ideally suited for current product application and market expansion.

With vandalism and the cost of vandalism reparation on the rise, there exists a clear market for security products aimed at enhancing public safety while at the same time curbing the ever increasing associated public expense.  Having selected Boston as the test market area, preliminary research suggests the municipal government would achieve significant benefits and financial gains by installing March Networks security cameras to monitor public parking.  Reduced vandalism, lower maintenance and repair costs, improved traffic flow and enhanced public safety are the benefits that will materialize from this bold, yet innovative application of technology to an everyday part of life.

A second area that can gain from the application of this type of technology pertains to the taxi industry.  In the United States, driving a taxi is considered the 10th most dangerous job, yet it is one that will continue for the foreseeable future.  Hence a viable and sustainable market area that is longing for improvements that would enhance the safety of both taxi drivers and patrons alike.   Combining the security offered by March Networks cameras with an interactive, touch-panel advertising medium, is the differentiator March Networks requires to overcome its competitors and continue the successful expansion of security technology in the general public market.  

This marketing plan proposes the application of March Networks security technology in two new public safety domains.  Utilizing the Boston area as a test bed, this plan takes advantage of previously established credentials and marketing successes, while at the same time, identifies an opportunity to apply proven technology in a new and innovative manner that is paramount to the well being of every day citizens.&quot;

==Situation Analysis (SWOT)==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''examines the all aspects that may impact sales''&lt;/div&gt;


{{wikipedia|SWOT analysis}}

The situation analysis examines all the aspects that may impact sales of a specific company.  The strengths and weaknesses should be focused upon the brand and its attributes, not the market conditions.  SWOT is an acronym for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

*Strengths &amp; Weaknesses: Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the brand in the current marketplace.
*Opportunities &amp; Threats: Identify potential opportunities and threats that exist outside the organization that may impact the brands sales potential.  Focus on market trends, consumer confidence, and technology advances.
*Competitors: Analyzes what competitors are doing in the marketplace.


It should be noted that the SWOT analysis is a tool used to help direct the thoughts of the individual or group drafting the marketing plan and it should not be included in the body of your report as it lacks professionalism.  If you feel pressured to include your SWOT with your marketing plan include it in an appendix.

==Goals==

Provide continuous, reliable and current up-to date information to the Army Reserve personnel (Soldiers, Civilians, Contractors and Family Members)on the development of tools, task force initiatives, training opportunities, best practices, lesson learned, communication products, trends and ongoing initiatives in the safety realm.


==Action Plan==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''specific actions that need to be taken to reach the goal''&lt;/div&gt;


The action plan lists the specific actions that need to be taken to reach the goal of the marketing plan, and also lists which department or person in the organization is responsible for carrying out the action.


==Marketing Mix==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''how the target market is reached through a specific blend of the P's''&lt;/div&gt;


The marketing mix or 4 P's describes how the target market is reached through a specific blend of attributes listed above: '''product''', '''pricing''', '''promotion''', '''placement''', '''people''' (staff), '''process''' (of providing a service), '''physical evidence''' (make  service more tangible to potential customer), and '''philosophy''' (whereby the product reflects the philosophy of the organization).  For each of the &quot;P's&quot; be sure and describe how altering that specific component helps the organization to encourage customers to buy the product being sold.


===Product===

The Product strategy is complex. It not only includes the development of the correct product attributes to meet the needs of the target market, but must focus on the benefits (perceived or real) the customer anticipates the product will provide.


===Promotion===

Promotion is communication between the &quot;seller&quot; (producer, wholesaler, retailer, service provider, etc) and relevant stakeholders (usually referred to in terms of the Target Market/s).  Promotion or Marketing Communication utilises tools such as Advertising, Sales Promotion, Direct Marketing, Personal Selling, Marketing Public Relations and Publicity.

===Price=== 

Pricing objectives directly affect an organizations pricing policy:
*Profit oriented objectives-attain a specific profit level, or as much profit as possible
*Sales oriented objectives-target a predetermined unit sales level or market share
*Status quo objectives-seek to maintain current price levels, peg them to an index, or match them to a competitor


===Placement===

Placement or place refers to the distribution channels that a company will use in order to take its product to the final customer (or consumer).


==Budget==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''total resource allocation available''&lt;/div&gt;



Specify the total resource allocation available for the marketing plan, and the potential return on this investment.

budgeting is most important of the marketing for direct and indirect customer

==Marketing Research==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''the role and importance of marketing research''&lt;/div&gt;


1. Examine the role and importance of marketing research within a firm's overall marketing mix.

2. Outline and discuss the stages within the marketing research planning process.

==Segmentation==

The primary objective of segmentation is to identify customers with similar attributes, and to find which [[w:Market segment|segment]]s of customers that are attractive from a profit perspective. Understanding the market segmentation allows marketers to create a more effective and efficient '''marketing mix'''.

===Generic Markets (Large Segments)===

A generic market is comprised of groups of customers who have a '''general''' need, but have '''many offerings''' to choose from to meet that need.  For example: transportation is a generic market that can be met by many offerings: car, bus, train, subway, taxi, etc.

===Product Markets (Small Segments)===

A product market is comprised of groups of customers who have a '''very specific''' need, with '''fewer offerings''' to choose from.  For example: The Luxury Car market fulfils a specific need and has only a few options to choose from: Bentley, Aston Martin, Ferrari, etc.  Product market segments are similar '''within''' the specific segment (ex. [[w:Luxury Car|Luxury Car]]s), and are different '''across''' segments (ex. Luxury, Mid-size, Economy); and each segment has very specific characteristics, which, when reflected in the product, can return higher profits to the organization.

Markets can be segmented by defining the goals of the customers in that market subset.  For example, in the transportation market(The Generic Market), a group of customers who's goals of transportation are to be able to travel in their own vehicle, feel comfortable/safe/fast relative to other transport options, and be able to show other people how &quot;nice&quot; their own vehicle is: this subset can be said to have goals which define them as a Luxury Car '''segment'''.

=== Segmentation Variables===

The factors which are be used to segment a market are the segmentation variables. Common variables include demographic, geographic, psychographics and behavioural considerations.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Demographic''' || Quantifiable population characteristics, such as age, gender, income, education, family situation.  || e.g University Educated, 20-25 year old, Males
|-
| '''Geographic''' || The physical location or region. || e.g Living in New York City
|-
| '''Psychographics''' ||  Lifestyle, social or personality characteristics. || e.g Self assured, confident
|-
| '''Behavioural''' || The needs and wants of the customer in relation to the product, including expectations and attitudes. || e.g Social Activity
|}
 
==Targeting==

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''identification of market segments and tailoring the marketing mix to meet segment needs''&lt;/div&gt;

Target marketing is the identification of attractive market segments and tailoring the marketing mix to match the needs of target customers.  This contrasts with mass marketing, whereby the marketing mix is vaguely aimed at all customers.  A specific target market is a [[w:homogeneous|homogeneous]] group of customers to whom an organization wishes to appeal; it must be large enough to be profitable, and its members must have sufficient disposable income to spend on the goods, services, or ideas.

===Segment Dimensions===

The dimensions of a segment also indicate the potential profitability and attractiveness of the segment.

The Segment Dimensions impact on '''marketing mix''' decisions, a knowledge of the the needs and wants, and how potential customers within a segment define value, allows for considered development of the product, its distribution, advertising and pricing.

*Demographics = Affects consumer needs
*Geographic Location = Affects size of market
*Behavior and Consumption Patterns = Affects ''product'' and ''promotion'' variables
*Urgency of Satisfaction = Affects ''Place'' and ''Price'' variables

==Positioning==


&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''what position does your product hold in the minds of your current and potential customers?''&lt;/div&gt;


Positioning is the concept of defining what role the brand will play in enhancing customers' lives and then highlighting specific brand attributes to best match consumer needs.  

*Ways to position:
**Understand how customers perceive key dimensions of your brand, both tangible and intangible, relative to competitors' brands.
***Price, Taste, Design and look of product are tangible benefits. Whereas feelings such as trust and confidence are intangible benefits products can have.
**Understand which needs your target audience wishes to satisfy with your brand.
**Position or reposition your brand to meet various target markets' needs, and manipulate the [[w:Marketing mix|Four P's]] accordingly.

==Segmentation in the Digital Economy==
Positioning is not what you do to a product , It's what you do to the mind of the consumer.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;''Information used to define segments of homogeneous consumers''&lt;/div&gt;


Information is collected, aggregated, and used to define segments of homogeneous consumers.  In providing targeted offerings to these consumers, several segmentation techniques are valuable:

*[[w:Database|Database]] Management:Use third party database information to segment target markets according to a variety of meaningful [[w:Variables|variables]].
*Anonymous Personalization:Segmenting a market based on anonymous consumer information .
*Permission Based marketing:Consumers provide meaningful information that is then used by the firm to supply targeted offerings to the consumer.

==Consumer Market==

Refers to a target audience where the end customers are the purchasers and users of the goods and services.

==Industrial Market==

Refers to a market where other businesses ([[w:B2B|B2B]]), not end consumers, are the purchasers of the goods and services.

Consumer behaviour is the study of when, why, how, and where people do or do not buy a product. It blends elements from psychology, sociology, social anthropology and economics. It attempts to understand the buyer decision making process, both individually and in groups. It studies characteristics of individual consumers such as demographics and behavioural variables in an attempt to understand people's wants. It also tries to assess influences on the consumer from groups such as family, friends, reference groups, and society in general.

Customer behaviour study is based on consumer buying behaviour, with the customer playing the three distinct roles of user, payer and buyer. Relationship marketing is an influential asset for customer behaviour analysis as it has a keen interest in the re-discovery of the true meaning of marketing through the re-affirmation of the importance of the customer or buyer. A greater importance is also placed on consumer retention, customer relationship management, personalisation, customisation and one-to-one marketing. Social functions can be categorized into social choice and welfare functions.

Each method for vote counting is assumed as social function but if Arrow’s possibility theorem is used for a social function, social welfare function is achieved. Some specifications of the social functions are decisiveness, neutrality, anonymity, monotonicity, unanimity, homogeneity and weak and strong Pareto optimality. No social choice function meets these requirements in an ordinal scale simultaneously. The most important characteristic of a social function is identification of the interactive effect of alternatives and creating a logical relation with the ranks. Marketing provides services in order to satisfy customers. With that in mind, the productive system is considered from its beginning at the production level, to the end of the cycle, the consumer (Kioumarsi et al., 2009).

==The Purchase Decision Process for Consumer Markets==

===Psychological variables===

Variables related to process such as motivation, perception, learning, attitude, personality, and lifestyle.

===Social influences===

Influences such as family, social class, reference groups, and culture.

===Purchase situation===

Situation-dependent variables such as purchase reason, time, and surroundings.

===Needs motivation===

A theory that explains why consumers make decisions to satisfy their salient needs.

====Needs====

The basic, motivating forces that shape decision making.

====Wants====

Wants are the learned needs that extend beyond the basic needs.

===Economic needs===

The types of product features consumers desire.

*Value
*Convenience
*Efficiency in operation
*Dependability in use
*Improvement in earnings

===Search for information===

Both internal and external searches.

===Problem solving===

The amount of effort exerted in information gathering and problem solving.  The type of problem solving depends on several variables:

*Extensive problem solving: more effort is expended to decide how to satisfy a need.  This type is used for infrequently purchased, expensive, high-risk, or new goods or services.
*Routine problem solving: Low-involvement, inexpensive, limited risk purchase requiring minimal effort.  Used when the consumer has considerable experience in how to meet the need.

===Purchase product===

The actual purchase transaction.

===Post purchase evaluation===

Cognitive dissonance occurs as consumers seek out positive reinforcement to reaffirm their purchase decision and to minimize negative uncertainty that can cause dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction is most often referred to as &quot;[[w:Buyer's remorse|buyers remorse]]&quot;.

==Adoption process for new products==

Occurs when a consumer's previous buying experiences are not relevant to the current problem he or she would like to solve.

*Awareness: consumer is aware of, but lacks details of, the brand
*Interest: consumer gathers information about the brand
*Evaluation: consumer imagines trying the brand and anticipates the benefit from its use
*Trial: consumer tries the brand
*Decision: consumer adopts the brand for future use or rejects it
*Confirmation: consumer will seek information to support his or her decision and to reduce tension (cognitive dissonance)

==Consumer behavior for industrial markets==

Characterized by buyers who:

*Less emotional than consumer buyer markets
*Look for specific product attributes, such as economy in cost and use, productivity, and quality
*Want to partner with businesses that are reliable, fair, consistent, speedy, and cooperative
*Are generally spending a larger amount of money.  thus, the process tends to be more complex and lengthy
* Is more task oriented and rational than consumer product buyer.
* Has firm motives of Quality, price and delivery against emotional motives in the other cases.

==Introduction==

In business and engineering, new product development (NPD) is the term used to describe the complete process of bringing a new product or service to market. There are two parallel paths involved in the NPD process : one involves the idea generation, product design, and detail engineering ; the other involves market research and marketing analysis. Companies typically see new product development as the first stage in generating and commercializing new products within the overall strategic process of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_life-cycle_theory product life cycle] management used to maintain or grow their market share.

==Types of new products==
There are several general categories of new products. Some are new to the market (ex. DVD players into the home movie market), some are new to the company (ex. Game consoles for Sony), some are completely novel and create totally new markets (ex. the airline industry). When viewed against a different criteria, some new product concepts are merely minor modifications of existing products while some are completely innovative to the company. These different characterizations are displayed in the following diagram.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:center;width:150px;margin-left:5.5em;text-align:center&quot;&gt;[[Image:TypesOfNewProducts.svg|500px|Product Newness based on Company and Market]]&lt;br&gt;''Types of new products''&lt;/div&gt;

==The process==
There are several stages in the new product development process...not always followed in order:
#'''Idea Generation''' (The &quot;fuzzy front end&quot; of the NPD process, see below)
#*ideas for new products can be obtained from customers (employing user innovation), the company's R&amp;D department, competitors, focus groups, employees, salespeople, corporate spys, trade shows, or through a policy of Open Innovation
#*formal idea generating techniques include attribute listing, forced relationships, brainstorming, morphological analysis, problem analysis
#'''Idea Screening'''
#*the object is to eliminate unsound concepts prior to devoting resources to them.
#*the screeners must ask at least three questions:
#**will the customer in the target market benefit from the product?
#**is it technically feasible to manufacture the product?
#**will the product be profitable when manufactured and delivered to the customer at the target price?
#'''Concept Development and Testing'''
#*develop the marketing and engineering details
#**who is the target market and who is the decision maker in the purchasing process?
#**what product features must the product incorporate?
#**what benefits will the product provide?
#**how will consumers react to the product?
#**how will the product be produced most cost effectively?
#**prove feasibility through virtual computer aided rendering, and rapid prototyping 
#**what will it cost to produce it?
#*[[concept testing|test]] the concept by asking a sample of prospective customers what they think of the idea
#'''Business Analysis'''
#*estimate likely selling price based upon competition and customer feedback
#*estimate sales volume based upon size of market
#*estimate profitability and break even point
#'''Beta Testing and Market Testing'''
#*produce a physical prototype or mock-up
#*test the product in typical usage situations
#*conduct focus group customer interviews or introduce at trade show
#*make adjustments where necessary
#*produce an initial run of the product and sell it in a test market area to determine customer acceptance
#'''Technical Implementation'''
#*New program initiation
#*Resource estimation
#*Requirement publication
#*Engineering operations planning
#*Department scheduling
#*Supplier collaboration
#*Resource plan publication
#*Program review and monitoring 
#*Contingencies - what-if planning
#'''Commercialization''' (often considered post-NPD)
#*launch the product
#*produce and place advertising and other promotions
#*fill the distribution (business) pipeline with product
#*critical path analysis is most useful at this stage

==Recap==

These steps may be iterated as needed. Some steps may be eliminated. To reduce the time that the NPD process takes, many companies are completing several steps at the same time (referred to as '''concurrent engineering''' or '''time to market'''). Most industry leaders see new product development as a ''proactive'' process where resources are allocated to identify market changes and seize upon new product opportunities before they occur (in contrast to a ''reactive strategy'' in which nothing is done until problems occur or the competitor introduces an innovation). Many industry leaders see new product development as an ongoing process (referred to as ''continuous development'') in which the entire organization is always looking for opportunities.

For the more innovative products indicated on the diagram above, great amounts of uncertainty and change may exist, which makes it difficult or impossible to plan the complete project before starting it. In this case, a more flexible approach may be advisable.

Because the NPD process typically requires both engineering and marketing expertise, cross-functional teams are a common way of organizing projects. The team is responsible for all aspects of the project, from initial idea generation to final commercialization, and they usually report to senior management (often to a vice president or Program Manager). In those industries where products are technically complex, development research is typically expensive, and product life cycles are relatively short, strategic alliances among several organizations helps to spread the costs, provide access to a wider skill sets, and speeds the overall process.

==Introduction==

Market research is the process of systematic gathering, recording, and analyzing of data about customers, competitors, and the market. Market research can help create a business plan, launch a new product or service, optimize existing products and services, guide expansion into new markets, and more. It can be used to determine which portion of the population will be most likely to purchase a product or service, based on variables like age, gender, location, and income level. The research can inform what characteristics your target market has.  With market research, companies can learn more about current and potential customers, often through satisfaction tracking programs.

The purpose of market research is to help companies make better business decisions and gain advantages against the competition. Market research represents the voice of the consumer in a company.

A list of questions that can be answered through market research:

*What is happening in the market? What are the trends? Who are the competitors?
*How do consumers talk about the products in the market?
*Which consumer needs are important? Are the needs being met by current products?

A simple example of what market research can do for a business is the following. At the Chevrolet division of General Motors, they brought several disciplines together in a cross-functional team to develop a concept for a completely new Corvette. This team enabled the marketers to come up with an alternative concept, one that balanced 4 attributes: comfort and convenience, quality, styling, and performance. This was considered radical because comfort and convenience were not traditional Corvette values. However, market research demonstrated that consumers supported the alternative concept. As a result, the new Corvette was a huge success in the market. {{citation needed}}

==Define the problem==

Identify the research objectives and how the research results will be implemented.  This is the most important step and often requires input from several departments (ex.: R&amp;D, production, Finance, Operations).

We have to differentiate between what is called &quot;Management Decision problem&quot; (MDP) and &quot;Marketing Research Problem&quot; (MRP). As a researched, you have to listen to the managements' stories about the problem. You have to transfer these stories into an issue that is worth researching for that will help the management take their decisions. To a researched, MDP are the symptoms of a problem, where MRP is the core of the problem.

==Analyze the situation==

Determine what specific decisions need to be made.  Identify what information is needed to support the decision making process, how this information will be gathered and at what cost.

==Get problem specific data==

First gather information from secondary data (Information published already) sources.  Next, gather primary data (Information gathered through research) specific to the problem at hand. There are several methods of collecting data.

==Analyze and interpret the data==

Analyze the data using statistical market research tools.  Assess the validity of the results (how well the data measures what it is supposed to measure).

Arrange for a debriefing session with the client (marketeer) where ideas on how to implement the findings from market research can be brain-stormed.

==Introduction==

Marketing ethics is the area of applied ethics which deals with the moral principles behind the operation and regulation of marketing.

==General guidelines==
*Marketing managers must accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions
*Managers should refrain from knowingly doing harm, adhere to all relevant laws and regulations, and accurately represent themselves, their firms, and their brands
*Managers must make every effort to verify that their choices and actions serve the best interests of all related customers, organizations, and societies.  Specifically they should:
**Adhere to basic ethical guidelines stated above
**Engage in honest and fair practices with clients, employees, and partners
**Offer goods and services that are safe and fit for use
**Refrain from advertising falsely and misleading consumers
**Maintain market research integrity by adhering to market research guidelines 
**Respect consumers privacy rights and ensure confidentiality of information
**Adhere to standards and guidelines of international marketing associations and to the legal requirements of governing bodies

==Social responsibility==
A marketing manager's social responsibility includes developing marketing programs and increasing the awareness and acceptability of social ideas and practices.  An often associated concept is not-for-profit marketing, which champions a cause for the betterment of individuals and society rather than for financial profits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blind Baseball is a poker game where several cards are dealt to players but they are kept face down and put in a stack in front of the player.  The number of cards can vary depending on the number of players but seven cards each is common. 

Play starts to the left of the dealer with the player turning over his first card.  This is now obviously the best hand and the player may bet.  Each successive player in turn then exposes cards until he beats the best hand or runs out of cards and is therefore out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Follow the queen is a variation of seven card stud.  The queen is a wild card at all times.  When a queen is dealt as an up card, the very next card is the second wild card.  If another queen comes up, the second wild card changes to the next card.  If no queen comes up or a queen is the last up card, then there is no second wild card.

A variation is to charge an fixed ante to be paid by a player when he is dealt an up wild card.

      <text xml:space="preserve">High Chicago is a variation of seven card stud.  It is a split pot game where the best poker hand takes half the pot and the highest spade in the hole (i.e. a down card) takes half the pot.

Low Chicago is the same except the low spade card in the hole is the winner.  The ace of spades can be high or low so it is always the best hole card.

*First benefit of chemotherapy in addition to RT was established by CALGB 8433 published in 1990 (Dillman)
*Overall, there appears to be a modest survival benefit with induction chemo followed by RT, in patients with good performance status and no weight loss. 
*There is a significantly higher proportion of long term survivors and improved distal failure-free survival, but essentially no impact on local recurrence 


*'''CALGB 30105''' -- Induction and concurrent carboplatin/paclitaxel vs. carboplatin/gemcitabine, RT 74 Gy
**Randomized Phase II. ''Closed prematurely after Arm 2 had high Grade 4-5 pulmonary toxicity.'' 69 patients. Stage IIIA-B NSCLC. Arm 1) Induction carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 followed by concurrent RT 74 Gy + carboplatin AUC 2 + paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 vs. Arm 2) carboplatin AUC 5 + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2
**'''2008''' PMID 18487565 -- &quot;Randomized phase II trial of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and dose-escalated thoracic conformal radiotherapy (74 Gy) in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: CALGB 30105.&quot; (Socinski MA, J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 20;26(15):2457-63.)
***Outcome: median OS carbo/taxol 2.0 years vs. carbo/gem 1.0 year; 1-year OS 67% vs. 50%
***Toxicity: grade 4-5 pulmonary toxicity 5% vs. 16% (8% death)
***Conclusion: Carboplatin/paclitaxel arm will be compared with standard RT in Phase III trial

*'''Big Lung Trial, 2005''' (UK) (1995-2001) PMID 16094738  &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomised comparison of radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer: Results from the Big Lung Trial.&quot; Fairlamb D et al. Radiother Oncol. 2005;75(2):134-40.
**288 pts. Randomized to radical RT alone or sequential chemotherapy + radical RT. No surgery. Enrolled any pt eligible to receive radical RT (not limited by stage, ~70% III/IV). 3 cycles of chemotherapy q3week. Did not control for details of treatment. Chemotherapy was cisplatin-based, one of 4 types chosen by doctor. Could be given neoadjuvantly or adjuvantly (chosen by doctor, 60% induction, 40% concurrent). RT dose was most commonly 50-55 Gy in 20 fx (2.5-2.75 Gy/fx). 
**Median OS: 13 vs. 13.2 months. OS 50% at 1 yr, 30% at 2 yr. No difference in OS or PFS between arms

*'''Seoul, 2002''' (Korea) PMID 12040280 -- &quot;A phase III randomized trial of combined chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Kim TY, Am J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jun;25(3):238-43.)
**Randomized. 89/101 patients unresectable IIIA/IIIB NSCLC. RT 60-65 Gy in 1.8-2Gy/fx +/- induction chemo (PEV - cisplatin, etoposide, vinblastine)
**Median OS: Combined 13.8 months vs. RT alone 8.5 months (NS); nonsquamous histology 14 vs. 3.6 months (SS); stage IIIB 11.1 months vs. 7.2 months (SS). &quot;Low risk&quot; (squamous, IIIA) long survival 18.3 vs. 20.8 months (NS)
**Conclusion: should use prognostic factors (histology, stage) to decide who gets chemo

*'''MIC-1''' (UK) (1988-96) 
**446 patients. Inoperable NSCLC (inoperable IIIA/non-bulky IIIB). Randomized to RT +/- MIC chemotherapy (mitomycin, ifosfamide, cisplatin).

**458 pts. Stage II medically inoperable (6%) or unresectable IIIA and IIIB (94%).  Randomized to 1) Standard RT (60 Gy), 2) induction cisplatin/vinblastine x2 months followed by standard RT (as in CALGB), or 3) hyperfractionated RT 69.6 Gy in 1.2 Gy BID. KPS &gt;=70, weight loss &lt;5%
**'''1995'''  PMID 7707407 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 88-08 and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 4588: preliminary results of a phase III trial in regionally advanced, unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; Sause WT et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Feb 1;87(3):198-205.
***Conclusion: chemo/RT arm superior to other 2 arms. Median survival 13.8 months, 60% 1-yr OS vs 11.4m/46% and 12.3m/51%. Confirmed findings from CALGB/Dillman.
**'''2002''' Final results PMID 10669675 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/lofref.fcgi?PrId=3051&amp;uid=10669675&amp;db=pubmed&amp;url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10669675 Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Final results of phase III trial in regionally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and Southwest Oncology Group.&quot; Sause W et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In guts players pay an ante and receive two cards.  Then players must all declare at the count of three whether they intend to contest the pot (e.g. you drop a chip on the table in front of you if you're in).  If you lose, you pay the amount in the pot.  Flushes and straights do not count.

In three card guts, flushs and straights do count. A variation is to have a one card draw after declaration.

A variation for declaration is to have players declare in order around the table.

'''Runner beans''' are the edible bean pod of the plant ''Phaseolus multiflorus''. The bean is most highly valued in England, where it is often grown in gardens and allotments, partly for the beauty of its orange-red flowers. 

The beans should be harvested fairly young, and cooked as fresh as possible.

To cook, slice the beans diagonally and plunge into boiling water for about five minutes. Toss in butter to serve. At their best, runner beans have a crispness and a slighly earthy flavour. Beans that have been left too long on the plant can become unpleasantly stringy.

==Standard RT==
*'''RTOG 94-04''' (1994-1998) PMID 11955727 -- &quot;A phase III comparison of radiation therapy with or without recombinant beta-interferon for poor-risk patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RTOG 93-04).&quot; (Bradley JD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Apr 1;52(5):1173-9.)
**Randomized. 123 patients, poor status (KPS 50-70, or weight loss &gt;5%). RT 60/30 +/- Betaseron (recombinant human interferon beta). Median F/U 4 years
**Median OS: 9.5 months vs. 10.3 months (NS), 1-year OS: 44% vs. 42% (NS)
**Toxicity: only 76% completed Betaseron arm due, primarily noncompliance for toxicity. Grade 3/4 toxicity (lung, esophagus) worse in betaseron arm (SS), including 1 death
**Conclusion: Failed; same outcome, much worse toxicity with beta interferon

*'''Australia, 1999''' 1989-1995 PMID 10577698 -- &quot;A randomised phase III study of accelerated or standard fraction radiotherapy with or without concurrent carboplatin in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer: final report of an Australian multi-centre trial.&quot; (Ball D, Radiother Oncol. 1999 Aug;52(2):129-36.)
**Phase III. 204 with inoperable NSCLC randomized to 1) 60/30 in 6 weeks (R6), 2) 60/30 in 3 weeks (R3), 3) R6 + concurrent carboplatin, or 4) R3 + concurrent carboplatin
**No difference in OS among groups.
**Toxicity: hematologic greater with chemo, esophageal greater with ART (R3)
**Critique PMID 11258343: underpowered for 2x2 design. ART hazard ratio 0.86 (0.56, 1.30), which is consistent with CHART trial results (0.78, SS). Recommend not sacrificing dose intensification at expense of concurrent chemotherapy

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of the Catholic Church==
Several approaches to describing the history of the Catholic Church after Christ's Ascension may be used. Three different methods are currently in use in this page. The first is to organize it by the succession of each Roman Pontiff. The second way is to organize it by what was taking place within the Church at large. The third is to organize it by date.

====Biographies of the Roman Pontiffs/Categorization by Pontificate====
* Saint Peter
* Linus&lt;ref&gt;A large number of the early pontiffs were canonized Saints, and will be properly labeled in future editions of this book&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anacletus 
* Clement I
* Evaristus
* Alexander I
* Sixtus I
* Telesphorus
* Hyginus
* Pius I
* Anicletus &lt;ref&gt;This is the correct spelling, and this pope's name was slightly different than the name of Anacletus&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soter
: Soter became Pope about the year 167, and was pope for about eight years. It appears that he was particularly known for his generosity, but this book currently has no information regarding any alms or kindness he bestowed. He either died or was martyred about the year 175.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia says a less likely source (Harnack) says he was pope from 166 to 174.&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03144c.htm]

* Symmachus
: He was the son of Fortunatus and a native of Sardinia. He was elected to the papacy on November 22, 498 at the Lateran Basilica. On the day of his consecration, a faction went to Santa Maria Maggiore and elected Archpresbyter Laurentius as an antipope.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14377a.htm]

* Donus &lt;ref&gt;His name can also be written Domnus.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05133a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
: Donus became Pope on November 2, 676. While he was Pope he had the atrium in front of St. Peter's Basilica paved and St. Euphemia's on the Appian Way restored. He also had another church repaired which was either St. Paul's Outside the Walls or a church on the route to it. He died on April 11, 678 after a pontificate of one year, five months, and ten days.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05133a.htm]
* Saint Agatho
: He was born in the late 500's and became Pope in 678. During his papacy he restored St. Wilfred to his see. He also had an ecumenical council held in Constantinople in 680 to suppress the Monothelite heresy, but died before he was able to sign the decrees of the council. He died in Rome in 681 and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica on January 10, 681. It appears he was responsible for a significant number of miracles and was sometimes called &quot;Thaumaturgus&quot; (Wonderworker), but this book currently has no information regarding what miracles he performed or which miracles were attributed to him.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01204c.htm]

**''Pope-elect Stephen II''
* Stephen II&lt;ref&gt;another Stephen was elected before him but died before episcopal consecration, so he is not classified as a pontiff for the purposes of this book (which is why he is italicized and indented.) Numbering in this book is calculated as though he was not a pontiff. Old references (and maybe even some new ones) might include him as a pontiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Lando was the son of Taino and a native of the Sabina. It appears he became pope in either July or August of 913. He apparently granted a privilege of some variety to a church in Sabina. He died in either February or March of 914. He had a pontificate of slightly more than six months.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08784a.htm]

: He was born about 1042 with the name Otho&lt;ref&gt;or Otto or Odo&lt;/ref&gt; of Lagery in Châtillon-sur-Marne in Champagne. He studied in Reims, and was promoted to the office of an archdeacon and canon while residing there. He went to Cluny about 1070 and joined the monastery there, and was later advanced to the position of prior. Saint Hugh sent him to Rome to assist Pope Gregory VII, and became Cardinal Bishop of Ostia in 1078. He was assigned to be the legate to Germany and France from 1082 to 1085. When he returned to Rome in 1085, Victor III had been elected to the papacy. After Pope Victor III died, Otho was elected to the papacy on March 12, 1088, and took the name Urban II. During the course of his papacy the possession of Rome frequently changed hands between him and the antipope Guibert of Ravenna. In November of 1095 he convened a council in Clermont, at which the First Crusade was proclaimed and Philip of France was excommunicated on account of adultery. Urban regained possession of the Castel Sant'Angelo in 1098, and convened a council in Bari to attempt a reconciliation with Eastern bishops by addressing the matter of the ''filioque'' clause. He died on July 29, 1099, was buried in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica, and was beatified on _______ by Pope Leo XIII. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15210a.htm]

* Leo XIII
: Leo XIII was born with the name Gioacchino Vincenzo Raffaele Luigi Pecci on March 2, 1810 in Carpineto to Count Lodovico Pecci and Anna ProsperiBuzi. Gioacchino entered the Collegio Romano in 1824, and received his doctorate in 1832. He was promoted to the rank of domestic prelate in January of 1837 by Gregory XVI. He was ordained on December 31, 1837 by Cardinal Odeschalchi at the chapel of Saint Stanislaus on the Quirinal. Pope Gregory XVI assigned him to Benevento, where he worked diligently to annihilate the brigands and smugglers infesting the region. Pope Gregory XVI then assigned him to Perugia, where Gioacchino started a savings bank specifically to assist farmers and small businesses in obtaining low interest rates. In January of 1843 Gioacchino was promoted to the position of nuncio to Brussels, and was consecrated titular bishop of Damiata on February 19, 1843 by Cardinal Lambruschini. Pope Gregory XVI appointed Gioacchino to the See of Perugia when it became vacant, but permitted him to retain the title of Archbishop. He was created a cardinal on December 19, 1853 by Pope Pius IX. He was appointed to be the Camerlengo in August of 1877, and was elected to the papacy on February 20, 1878, taking the name Leo XIII. He wrote the encyclical ''Rerum Novarum'', dated May 18, 1891.

====Organization by Era====
&lt;ref&gt;Most of this section of Organization by Era was composed by memory rather than through verification, is mostly unverified, some facts may be incorrect, may not completely or properly conform to the neutral point of view policy, and may contain original research or untrue comparisons. The Section on the Popes and the Chronological order of events are mostly verified and NPOV, however.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Ascension of the Lord, the Apostolic Age was begun, which ended with the death of the last Apostle, Saint John the Evangelist.

This was followed by the Age of Martyrs.
: After the death of Nero, persecutions of Christians were intermittent, and varied in rigor. This period was ended with the Edict of Milan, which was promulgated by the Emperor Constantine in 313. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04295c.htm]
This was followed by the Dawn of the Early Heresies.
: Soon after the Christians were no longer threatened with civil punishment on account of the Faith, heretical sects arose which frequently had a twofold aim: to both advance a particular doctrine and to also gain control of the Church through the aid of civil leaders sympathetic to their cause. Some of the principal heretical sects at this time were the Arians, the Nestorians, the Gnostics, and the Monophysites. An unusual reversal of the state of affairs occurred during the reign of Julian the Apostate, who attempted to restore paganism and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, of which both attempts failed.
This was roughly at the same time as the Conversion of Europe to Christianity. 
: While large portions of the Roman Empire were coming under the control of heretical sects, large portions of Europe were also converting from paganism to Christianity, particularly Ireland, France, and Germany. Eventually Europe became, in a sense, a Christian continent in which most of the inhabitants were either Catholic or belonged to a heretical or schismatic sect. 
This was followed by the Middle Ages and the Crusades.
: Hostility between nations, the possession of properties, and the quest for additional revenues and incomes frequently gave rise to clashes between the Church and rulers of nations and other principalities, particularly regarding the appointment of bishops. When the Muslims succeeded in their conquest of the Holy Land, Blessed Pope Urban II declared a crusade to regain the Holy Land in 1095, and subsequent crusades were declared when necessary. Toward the end of the Middle Ages the Bubonic Plague ravaged Europe, in which many pious clergy cared for the sick and also contracted the disease, while many of the less pious clergy fled and returned after the plague had subsided.
This was followed by the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Counter-Reformation.
: Besides the bubonic plague, several factors also contributed heavily to the progression of the era: the &quot;Avignon Captivity&quot; and the &quot;Great Schism,&quot; the conflicting interests of the Catholic Church and national governments (especially regarding revenues, property ownership, and the appointment of bishops), the conflicts between European nations (particularly the &quot;Hundred Year's War&quot; between France and England), the immoral lives of many of the clergy and many members of the upper classes, and the reintroduction of pagan culture. The French cardinal _________ was elected to the papacy on ___________ and took the name ______________, but Rome was the scene of much self-destruction by the local Italians. The French king __________ extended the invitation to Pope _________ to come to peaceful Avignon and take residence for a while, and the Popes did not want to leave Avignon and return to Rome for over one hundred years. When Pope _________ finally submitted to the entreaties and rebukes of Saint Catherine of Siena (?) and Saint Gertrude (?), it was only a few yers before he was disgustd with the situation in Rome and wanted to return to Avignon, which was only prevented on account of his death. His successor, the Roman (?) cardinal _____________ was elected on _________ and took the name ___________, but the cardinals soon disliked him and elected the French cardinal __________ as an antipope, who took the name ________________. An attempt to solve this division of the Church was later made to persuade the successors to both simultaneously resign and permit the cardinals to elect a new pope, but this only resulted in three &quot;popes.&quot; Eventually this situation was ended at a conclave (?) when the Roman pope and third &quot;pope&quot; (Pisan?) simultaneously resigned, the cardinals eleced Cardinal ______________ to the papacy (who took the name _________), and the majority (or was it all?) of the European nations transferred their allegiance to the new pope.
: Saint Peter's Basilica was in the process of construction, and Pope ______________ announced that an indulgence (plenary or partial?, also, did one have to follow the usual conditions to obtain it: pray for the pope, confession, communion, no attachment to sin?) could be gained when a person contributed (how much?) to its construction. The pope appointed the Dominicans to handle the collection of the funds, which was greatly resented by the Augustinians. One of the Augustinians, Martin Luther, voiced his distaste of the situation differently than most and began condemning the indulgences themselves, and his superior ____________ was delighted and encouraged Martin Luther to continue his denunciation of the indulgences. The Dominicans in turn invoked higher authority, and when Luther's superior found that the papal authorities were determined to censure Luther if he continued, he privately advised Luther to cease the accusations. Luther, however, enjoyed the publicity and respect he received,&lt;ref&gt;History of England, Volume 4?, written by Lingard?,this was done from memory, not with the text in front of the contributor, so some facts may be inaccurate&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to enter into complete rebellion instead. Flocks of commoners hastened to his side, and looted monasteries and churches to enrich themselves. A great number of princes declared their support of Luther, and hastily seized ecclesiastical properties for themselves.
: King Henry VII of England's son Arthur had married Catherine of Aragon (daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand), but Arthur died during his father's reign, so Arthur's brother Henry married Catherine (now his brother's widow). This Henry ascended to the throne as King Henry VIII of England. Some time after his ascension to the throne, he published a rebuttal of Luther's doctrines, and received the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; from Pope ____________. At one point, Henry had a sinful relationship with Mary Boleyn, but did not publicise it. When he later wished to have a relationship with Mary Boleyn's sister Anne Boleyn, Anne Boleyn firmly said she would only do so if she was his queen. Henry VIII decided to try to get an annulment, and approached the matter by confiding to Cardinal Wolsey (the English Chancellor) that he was being tormented by scruples regarding the validity of his marriage to Catherine. Wolsey was delighted to hear this and proposed that the king marry the French princess ______________. Henry was not pleased and told Wolsey he wanted to marry Anne Boleyn. Wolsey wished to object to Henry's marriage to a mere local noblelady rather than a marriage that would strengthen the bond between England and its most powerful ally at the time, but seeing the heightening anger of Henry, Wolsey acquiesced to his monarch's wishes. A delegation was sent to Pope ________ which related that Henry was concerned about his marriage to Catherine and asked about getting a n annulment. The pope's responded that he trusted Henry's judgement on the issue and told him to follow the normal local procedures to investigate whether the marriage was valid and issue an annulment if necessary, but the pope also asked Henry to wait until Charles V (Catherine's nephew) was defeated by the Italian and papal forces significantly enough in order that Charles V would not take revenge on the pope because of the annulment. After Charles V was no longer a threat, the process in England was started to investigate the validity of the marriage to Catherine, but soon was stalled by the lack of impediments in the marriage to Catherine and the existence of an impediment in the proposed marriage to Anne Boleyn. Another delegation was sent to the pope to request special permission to remove the impediment to the proposed marriage to Anne Boleyn, which the pope granted (?). The English bishops, however, were faced with a problem: to the best of their knowledge the marriage to Catherine was perfectly valid, but they knew Henry wished to get the annulment so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. Rather than attempt to declare a false annulment for which the bishops would be morally responsible, an attempt was made to deceive the pope into declaring an annulment through the pope's ignorance of the situation. (correct?) The pope, however, was growing suspicious of the matter and seriously began to doubt the honesty of Henry's statements regarding Anne Boleyn's exemplary virtue and piety. After being bombarded with a distasteful number of requests for the annulment,&lt;ref&gt;History of England, Volume 4?, written by Lingard?,this was done from memory, not with the text in front of the contributor, so some facts may be inaccurate&lt;/ref&gt; Pope __________ determined that the marriage to Catherine was valid. Cranmer proposed to Henry VIII that he free himself from the moral jurisdiction by taking control of the Church of England, which Henry promptly did. After Henry's death and his son Edward's death, Queen Mary I of England attempted to restore Catholicism to England, but when she was ready to die, King Philip II of Spain (who was married to Queen Mary) did want the monarchy to pass to Mary of the Scots (who was married to the King of France), as it could be a powerful alliance against Spain. Mary selected Anne Boleyn's daughter Elisabeth to be her successor, and Elizabeth promised Mary to keep England Catholic. Upon Mary's death and Elisabeth's coronation, Elisabeth promptly disregarded her promise and, by the end of her life, had completely undone the work of Mary and firmly entrenched England in Anglicanism.
: An interest in pagan culture and a laxness in restraining immorality both arose during this era. The philosophies and writings of pagan authors were reintroduced, which were soon followed by the narratives of pagan deities and myths, the paintings and sculptures of pagan deities, and the required study of mythology. As for immorality, many of the clergy had mistresses, carnivals were reintroduced, and nudity and impurity were glorified in the works of the most skilled artists of the era. The Council of Trent was convened in ________ and addressed many of the problems wrought by heresy and the immoral conduct of the clergy. 
This was followed by the Enlightenment.
: The reintroduction of philosophies and writings by pagan writers, which were not suppressed or greatly opposed in the work of the Counter-Reformation, may have sown the seeds of alternative ideals and alternative morality which greatly or completely excluded the Creator in philosophical reasoning processes. Self-made philosophers abounded, and were highly endorsed by those who were comforted by the new norms of morality these philosophers set. These philosophers frequently clashed with the Catholic Church, and many times resorted to violence, particularly in the case of the French Revolution.
This was followed by the Industrial Revolution.
: Inventors were constantly discovering and designing faster and more efficient ways of performing common tasks which were frequently laborious, and were inventing new products to promote a better and higher standard of living. This era, which was so full of promise for the betterment of the whole human race, was instead beset by the poverty of many. A primary factor of this widespread poverty was the greed of business owners who, while living luxuriously themselves, paid their laborers wages which could scarcely support the laborers and their families. The seeds sown by the carnivals and amusements (which had not been greatly opposed in the work of the Conter-Reformation as a whole) may have contributed to a second factor of this widespread poverty: the frivolity of many members of the lower classes who squandered their wages with amusements, alcohol, tobacco products, and other pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;Maybe this is not really a significant factor or, even if it is, it does not need mentioning here. Then again, maybe it does.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States a movement among workers called the Knights of Labor was begun to unite laborers together to require business owners to pay higher wages. Regarding this, Pope Leo XIII wrote the encyclical ''Rerum Novarum'' which required the laborers to respect the property of their employers and to work well, while also requiring employers to pay decent wages that would support the laborers and their families. Pope Leo XIII's encyclical was mostly ignored, and additional self-made philosophers such as Karl Marx arose to offer alternatives. These philosophers were also highly endorsed by those who felt comfortable with the alternative ideals and the alternative morals presented by them. Some philosophers presented that man was nothing but a brute beast, that there was no life after death and no punishment after death for those who did evil, that there was no God, that man should follow his desires and indulge in his passions, and that women were inferior to men unless they become like men. Other philosophers taught that laborers should unite to overthrow the upper classes, and, soon after, they also taught that the government should take possession of the property of the upper classes and control the means of production and wealth itself. The methods proposed by these philosophers usually resulted in one of two things when they were observed: either the strong oppressed the weak, or the weak united and invoked the government, which first seized the property and possessions of the strong, then oppressed the weak without fear of opposition.
: Also in this era was the Reunification of Italy, which mostly took away the temporal power of the papacy and placed Italy and the Pope on bad terms with one another.
This was followed by the Modern Age:
: The ideas of the self-made philosophers of the Industrial Age were heavily implemented in this era, and reaped their bountiful harvest. World War I vanquished the strongest and hurled monarchs from their thrones, and in World War II the &quot;strong&quot; first slaughtered the weak by the millions, the weak then vanquished the strong, and in the end much of Asia and Europe came to be governed by governments that oppressed the weak without any fear of opposition. Self-made philosophers abounded and new ideas were introduced: the government, its wellbeing, and its safety were the basis of morality; the government could determine when citizens were no longer useful and exterminate them when they were no longer necessary or considered useful; the government could determine when life started, define who was and was not a person, and exterminate anyone who they did not consider a &quot;real&quot; person; chastity and purity were unnecessary and regular indulgence of the passions was encouraged; people should not be held responsible for their actions; and may other ideas which, although the general idea was not new, were presented in a different manner than in former eras.
: Also in this era Pope Pius XI signed the Lateran Treaty with Italy, which allotted Vatican City to the popes with an annuity in recompense for the papal states. Pius XI then had the relative freedom to write encyclicals against the errors held by surrounding nations such as Germany, Russia, Spain, and even Italy itself. This sovereignty also assisted his successor Pope Pius XII in his protection of Jews from the Nazis during World War II.
: In 1962 Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council, which was originally convened to freshen the doctrine of the Church. In the course of the Council, Pope John XXIII died and was succeeded by Pope Paul VI, who wrote the encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' while the Council was still in progress. This encyclical was greatly disliked by many of the bishops, who often voiced their opposition to it publicly. When the Council was finished in 1965, the bishops returned to their dioceses and implemented whatever they wished to implement. Soon churches were being razed and rebuilt to modern architectural tastes, liturgical abuses were widespread, divorce and adultery became common among Catholics, and millions left the Faith. The seeds sown by mythology and the impurity and nudity in the works of the skilled artists of the Renaissance (which were not greatly opposed in the work of the Counter-Reformation) may have born the following bountiful fruit: impurity and unchaste behavior became relatively normal among Catholics, and paganism and superstition once again became common among educated persons.
: Beginning with Pope Paul VI, the popes began to visit countries on a regular basis. Pope John Paul II visited many countries during his pontificate, and even learned languages so that he would be able to speak to the people in their native tongue. Pope Benedict XVI followed a similar itinerary during the beginning years of his pontificate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Attributes of the Catholic Church==
The four attributes of the Catholic Church are: it is One, Holy, Catholic (universal), and Apostolic.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P29.HTM]

==The Trinity and the two natures of Jesus==
There is One God in three Divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This doctrine is also called the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. The Second Person of the Holy Trinity (the Son) assumed a human nature by being born of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was free from all stain of original sin.

==The Life of Christ==
* Presentation in the Temple
* Baptism by Saint John the Baptist
* Miracle at Cana
* Sermon on the Mount
* Choosing the Twelve Apostles
* The Transfiguration
* The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem
* The Last Supper
* The Agony in the Garden
* Christ's Passion

For our redemption He was crucified on Calvary, died, and was buried in a tomb. On Easter Sunday He rose from the dead.

* Appearance to Mary Magdalene
* Appearance to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus

He ascended into heaven on Ascension Thursday, forty days after the Resurrection.

==Marian Doctrines==
The doctrine of Mary being conceived without original sin is the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, a dogma of the Faith. Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven, also a dogma of the Faith. She has also been proclaimed as the &quot;Theotokos&quot;,or, &quot;God-Bearer&quot; by the Council of Ephesus(?).

==The Catechism of the Catholic Church==
The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains much of the Church's teaching. This is available on the [http://www.vatican.va Vatican's website]. 

==The Creeds==
Two Creeds are used on a frequent basis in the Catholic Church: the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. The Athanasian Creed is also used.

==Suffering in God's Plan==
For Roman Catholics, suffering is meant to bring them closer to God, to merit graces for others, and to give the opportunity to practice charity.

==Sources of Truth==
The Catholic Church uses two sources for its teaching: Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture. Sacred Tradition could be described as the understanding of what Christ wanted for the Church as He communicated it to the Apostles being handed down through the centuries. Sacred Scripture is various writings of different authors at different times that the Catholic Church determined were inspired by the Holy Spirit. Sacred Scripture gives stability to the unchanging truths communicated through Sacred Tradition, and Sacred Tradition prevents a legalistic interpretation of Sacred Scripture.

The various writings of Sacred Scripture were compiled into one volume in the 4th Century AD. This volume of collective works is often called the Bible. A complete Catholic Bible contains the following books: Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Deuteronomy; Joshua; Judges; Ruth; 1 and 2 Samuel; 1 and 2 Kings; 1 and 2 Chronicles; Ezra; Nehemiah; Tobit; Judith; Esther; 1 and 2 Maccabees; Job; Psalms; Proverbs; Ecclesiastes; The Song of Songs; The Wisdom of Solomon; Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Isaiah; Jeremiah; Lamentations; Baruch; Ezekiel; Daniel; Hosea; Joel; Amos; Obadiah; Jonah; Micah; Nahum; Habakkuk; Zephaniah; Haggai; Zachariah; Malachi; Gospel of Matthew; Gospel of Mark; Gospel of Luke; Gospel of John; Acts of the Apostles; Romans; 1 and 2 Corinthians; Galatians; Ephesians; Philippians; Colossians; 1 and 2 Thessalonians; 1 and 2 Timothy; Titus; Philemon; Hebrews; James; 1 and 2 Peter; 1, 2 and 3 John; Jude; and Revelation (Apocalypse).

==The Angels==
The Angels are pure spirits created by God who, unlike humans, have no physical bodies. There are two ways of classifying angels: by the ''choir'' to which an angel belongs by nature, and by whether or not the angel remained faithful to God.

It is taught that there are nine ''choirs'' of angels: Seraphim , Cherubim, Virtues, Dominations, Powers, Principalities, Thrones, Archangels, and Angels (might not be in correct order). The term ''angel'' broadly refers to any creature possessing an angelic nature, but specifically refers to the ninth choir.

The second manner of classifying distinguishes between the ''good'' angels and the ''bad'' angels, also called devils. It appears that all angelic beings were tested at a certain point, and that some chose to follow God and others rejected Him. It is speculated by many theologians (in a good sense of the term) that the event was probably as follows:
: God showed the angels that the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity would become man. They were told that they must adore Him in His human nature, and that they would be expected to serve Him and any creatures He created that possessed a human nature. One of the Seraphim announced that he would not do it. One of the Archangels countered him with &quot;Who is like unto God?&quot; All the members of the nine choirs of angels irrevocably and with full knowledge made a determination as to whether or not they would serve God. A battle was then fought in heaven and the devils were driven out. When humans were created, the devils began to try to persuade them also to choose not to serve God, which they continue to do until this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The Roman Pontiff, as the successor of Saint Peter the Apostle, is the supreme pastor over the Catholic Church. Bishops, as the successors of the Apostles, share in the authority of the Roman Pontiff when they are united to him. Priests and deacons are appointed to assist each bishop in the administering of the care of the faithful. Certain Rites of the Catholic Church may be organized in a different manner.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM]

==The Pontiff==
The succession of pontiffs has continued from St. Peter to Benedict XVI who is considered the 265th pontiff [http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/19/pope.tuesday/index.html]. (Footnote: some calculations by other scholars differ, as one pontiff died before his coronation and another held the office at three separate times.) To protect the purity of the Truth handed onward from the Apostles, the Pontiff is infallible in matters of Faith and Morals in virtue of his office.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM] (Footnote: Pope Vigilius may be an example of this power at work.) The Pontiff is popularly referred to as the Pope (who should not be confused with the Coptic ''Pope'' or the Eastern Orthodox ''Pope'' of Alexandria.). The pontiff is also known by several other titles (but no longer Patriarch of the West).

The pontiff often writes documents for the instruction and management of the Church. Some of these documents are: Apostolic Constitutions, Apostolic Exhortations, Apostolic Letters (some of which are given Motu Proprio), and Encyclicals.

==The Cardinals==
The Cardinals are chosen by the pontiff to be the electors of the succeeding pontiff upon the death or resignation of the pontiff. The choosing of cardinals is sometimes called the giving of red hats--referring to the official garb of cardinals. The cardinals are assigned to one of three categories: the episcopal order, the presbyteral order, and the diaconal order. This means that either there can be Cardinal Bishops, Cardinal Priests, or Cardinal Laymen. In theory then it is possible for a laymen or even a laywoman to be elevated to the cardinalate, but most often it is the practice of the Holy See to only elevate Priests or Bishops to the cardinalate. The pontiff may also choose to designate a cardinal ''in pectore'', in which it is publicly announced that an appointment has been made, but the name is not revealed, and the person is not notified until a later date. This is frequently used in the case of appointments of clergy from countries where the Church is persecuted. Although cardinals are frequently appointed to metropolitan sees and Magisterial offices, the designation as a cardinal does not give any other significant hierarchial faculties other than the electoral function. All cardinals who are not diocesan bishops are required to reside in Rome.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P19.HTM] Upon the death or resignation of the pontiff, the cardinals assemble in a conclave to elect the next pope. 

At the time of this book's publication, the Apostolic Constitution ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html Universi Dominici Gregis]'', written by Pope John Paul II, governed the process of electing a new Pontiff upon the vacancy of the Holy See. Any subsequent Pontiff may revoke, amend, or replace these rules at any time he chooses.

==The Bishops==
Bishops are usually the head of a ''see'', a regional area called a diocese, which may vary greatly in size. In the case of certain papal delegates and officials, an appointment may be made to a &quot;Titular See.&quot; The common mistake is made that Bishops are almost like a local Ponitff. Bishops in union with Rome do not enjoy their own personal infallibility because it is not the duty of the Pontiff to be in union with the Universal Bishops, it is the duty of the Universal Bishops to be in union with the Pontiff. This is because the episcopate, of the College of Bishops, is dependent on the existence of the Throne of Peter.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM]

==Priests==
Bishops ordain priests through the Sacrament of Holy Orders. Two categories of priests exist: diocesan and religious. A man may not be ordained a priest unless he is at least twenty-six years old, and there has been an interval of at least six months between his ordination to the diaconate and his ordination to the priesthood.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Q.HTM]

===Diocesan Priests===
Diocesan priests are usually assigned to one or more parishes to administer the majority of the sacraments to the faithful. Occasionally, the bishop may determine to assign a priest to assist in another diocesan task such as the administration of tribunals, the spiritual direction of an organization, or the formation or education of seminarians. Diocesan priests are directly responsible to their bishop, and take vows of chastity and obedience.

===Religious Priests===
Religious priests usually live in a communal atmosphere, such as in a monastery. They may, however, be assigned to a parish or another diocesan task with the approval of the local bishop (also called the &quot;ordinary&quot;). Religious priests are primarily subject to the authority of a superior of the order. They may also be subject to the authority of the bishop in whose diocese they are residing and, in the case with some orders, to the bishop who has given the order permission to be founded in and administrated from his diocese.

==Deacons==
Deacons were first appointed by the Apostles to assist in the care of the temporal needs of the faithful. Currently, they may also partake in other duties, especially in the Liturgy of the Mass, the administering of Baptism, and the instruction of the faithful. There are two categories of deacons: transitional and permanent.

===Transitional Deacons===
Transitional deacons are candidates for the priesthood who have been ordained deacons and administer in this capacity until they are ordained to the priesthood. A man may not be ordained as a transitional deacon unless he has attained the age of twenty-three. Ordination may not take place until after the fifth year of theological and philosophical studies has been completed.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Q.HTM]

===Permanent Deacons===
Permanent deacons may be either married or unmarried men who have devoted themselves to the work of the Church. An unmarried man must be at least twenty-five years old to be ordained. A permanent deacon must be at least thirty-five years old, must have the consent of his wife,[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Q.HTM] and may not marry again if his wife dies.

==Other Rites of the Catholic Church==
Other Rites may be organized in a different manner. There are twenty-one Eastern Rites. One of these is the Maronite Rite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming}}
__TOC__

C is an extremely efficient minimalist language that unfortunately some particularities can become weaknesses to the less attentive programmer. Some of these can be offset by the use of another language in parallel for added flexibility and power, like the combination of Emacs-LISP and C used for Emacs or come at the cost of speed and increased complexity, by using special constructs that will guarantee function, security and performance.

Below are several of these particularities of ANSI C (that sometimes also form the foundations of its strengths), some minor and some major:

; Lack of differentiation between arrays and pointers : The very first C (around 1973) did not have arrays at all; modern implementations are contiguous areas in memory accessed with pointer arithmetic (note: a declared array cannot be assigned to like a pointer), which served as an escape from the previous need to declare arrays with a constant size. This ability, however, can cause problems with careless use.

; Arrays do not track their length : A consequence of the above. This means that the length must be tracked manually. Unless a function is passed an array of a fixed size, there is no way for it to discover the length of the array it was given: So the function must be given the length, perhaps in a separate variable or struct, or else hope that whoever allocated the array made it the right length. Because of this, most implementations do not provide automatic bounds checking, and manual bounds checking is error-prone.

It is extremely easy for a C (or C++) programmer to write code that does not always correctly check the array bounds of every array in the program every time something is added to any array, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability bug.
Buffer overflow bugs are the most common security vulnerability in software.
Almost every other language provides automatic bounds checking, and so they are nearly immune to such bugs.

; Variable Length Arrays : A VLA ‒ variable length array ‒ can only be used for function parameters and auto variables. VLAs cannot be allocated on the heap{{fact}} or used inside a structure (except as the last item in the structure). It's not possible to define a structure that corresponds to the standard [[Forth]] dictionary definition (which has 2 variable-length parts), except as an undifferentiated array of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.

; Arbitrary-size built-in 2D or 3D arrays not widely supported : This has been solved with C99 variable-length arrays, although many C compilers still do not support VLAs. Without VLAs, there is no way for a function to accept the built-in 2D or 3D arrays of arbitrary size. In particular, it's impossible to define a function that accepts &lt;code&gt; int a[5][4][3]; &lt;/code&gt; on one call, and later accepts &lt;code&gt; int b[10][10][10]; &lt;/code&gt; in a later call. Instead of using the built-in 2D or 3D array data type, C programmers use some other data type to hold (mathematical) 2D or 3D arrays of arbitrary size (multi-dimensional arrays) -- see [[C Programming/Common practices#Dynamic multidimensional arrays]] for details.

; No formal String data type : Strings are character arrays (lacking any abstraction) and inherit all their constraints (structs can provide an abstraction, to an extent).

; Weak type safety : C is not very type-safe. The memory management functions operate on untyped pointers, there is no built-in run-time type enforcement, and the type system can be circumvented with pointers and casts. Additionally, typedef does not create a new type but only an alias, thus it serves solely for code legibility. However, it's possible to use single-member structs to enforce type safety.

; No garbage collection :  As a low-level language designed for minimum overhead, C features only manual memory management, which can allow simple memory leaks to go on unchecked.

; Local variables are uninitialized upon declaration : Local (but not global) variables must be initialized manually; before this, they contain whatever was already in memory at the time. This is not terribly unusual, but the C standard does not forbid access to uninitialized variables(which is).
&lt;!-- ; Tedious memory allocation : VLA - Variable Length Arrays are restricted in their use, VLS - Variable Length Structures do not exist at all. C89 requires all instances of a structure to be the same size; C99 allows various instances of a structure to have different sizes when they contain one &quot;flexible array member&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://c-faq.com/struct/structhack.html comp.lang.c FAQ list: Question 2.6]: &quot;C99 introduces the concept of a flexible array member, which allows the size of an array to be omitted if it is the last member in a structure, thus providing a well-defined solution.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

; Unwieldy function pointer syntax : Function pointers take the form of &lt;code&gt;    [return type] [name]([arg1 type])([arg2 type])&lt;/code&gt;, making them somewhat difficult to use. Typedefs can alleviate this burdensome syntax. For example, &lt;code&gt;typedef int fn(int i);&lt;/code&gt;. See [[C Programming/Pointers and arrays#Pointers to Functions]] for more details.

; No reflection : It is not possible for a C program -- at runtime -- to evaluate a string as if it were a source C code statement.

; Nested functions not standard: However, many C compilers do support nested functions, including GNU C.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;A GNU Manual&quot;: &quot;Extensions to the C Language: Nested Functions&quot;
[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Nested-Functions.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

; No formal exception handling : Some standard functions return special values that must be manually handled. For example, &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt; returns null upon failure. For example, one must store the return value of &lt;code&gt;getchar()&lt;/code&gt; in an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (not, as one might expect, in a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;) in order to reliably detect the end-of-file -- see [[C Programming/File IO#EOF pitfall | EOF pitfall]]. Too many programs don't include error handling. Such programs seem to work fine most of the time, but and crash or otherwise malfunction when exceptional cases occur. POSIX systems often use &lt;code&gt;signal()&lt;/code&gt; to handle some kinds of exceptions. (See ''{where can I read more about signal()?}'' for details). Some programs use &lt;code&gt;setjmp()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;longjmp()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; to manually handle some kinds of exceptions. (See [[C Programming/Control#One last thing: goto]] and [[C Programming/Coroutines]] for details).

; No anonymous function definitions

      <comment>/* The Liturgy of the Hours */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sacrifice of the Mass is divided into two parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. Priests and certain members of religious congregations are required to pray the Liturgy of the Hours.

==The Liturgical Calendar==
The Liturgical Year begins with the Season of Advent, followed by the Season of Christmas, followed by a period of Ordinary Time, followed by the Season of Lent, followed by the Easter Season, followed by another period of Ordinary Time which continues until the next Season of Advent. Select days of the year also commemorate specific Saints and the lives of Jesus and Mary.

==Vessels and Vestments of the Mass and other Ceremonies==
The vestments used in the Mass are the amice (optional), alb, cincture, stole, and chasuble. The vessels used in the Mass are the primarily the paten and chalice. Other textile items also used are the purificator, chalice veil, corporal, and burse (optional). The cope and humeral veil are used in Eucharistic processions and Benediction. A deacon wears a dalmatic, rather than a chasuble. Acolytes either wear cassocks and surplices (or sometimes capes/humerales?), or they wear albs. Lectors, cantors, and choristers may occasionally wear vestments similar to those worn by acolytes. Important sanctuary furniture includes the tabernacle, altar(s), lectern, and ambo (optional). Other furniture in the church includes the baptismal font, sanctuary lamp, holy water fonts (optional[http://trinityalpena.com/RecentSermons/HolyWater/tabid/7605/Default.aspx]), and pews.

==The Order of the Mass==
The Mass is begun with the Sign of the Cross and followed by the Penitential Rite. The Penitential Rite may have several different forms. It may be the Rite of Sprinkling, it may be the ''Confiteor'' (''I Confess to Almighty God'') followed by the ''Kyrie'' (''Lord, have mercy''), it may be the ''Kyrie'' combined with tropes (in this case, these tropes are usually statements about the different aspects of God), or it may be the simple ''Kyrie''. For a few select days of the Liturgical Year (such as Ash Wednesday) a special rite proper to that day is substituted. The ''Gloria'' (''Glory to God in the Highest'') is recited Sunday Masses outside the Advent and Lenten Seasons,on solemnities, and on feasts. The Opening Prayer follows the Gloria (if the Gloria is omitted, it follows the Penitential Rite).

An excerpt from the Bible is read. During a weekday mass there are two readings and a psalm.  The first reading is always from the Old Testament, except during the season of Easter, when it is from the Acts of the Apostles, and the second is from one of the Gospels.  On Sundays and feastdays there are three readings.  The first is always from the Old Testament, with the previous exception, and the second is from one of the New Testament epistles, with the third being the Gospel.  The first reading is followed by a responsorial psalm (or a portion of it; the Responsorial Psalm may also be from a book of the Bible other than the Psalms), which is followed by the second reading (if there is one). On select days (such as Easter and Corpus Christi) there is a sequence. Then there is the Gospel Acclamation, followed by an excerpt from one of the four Gospels. A homily may follow this.

On solemnities and Sundays the Nicene Creed is prayed (for Masses with children the Apostles' Creed may be substituted). The General Intercessions conclude the Liturgy of the Word.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the Offertory. This is followed by the ''Prayer over the Gifts'', the Preface to the Eucharistic Prayer, and the ''Sanctus'' (''Holy, Holy''). The priest may select from one of nine Eucharistic Prayers. Eucharistic Prayer I (also called the Roman Canon) is particularly suited to days when this Eucharistic Prayer has a special form (Christmas and Christmas Octave, Holy Thursday, Epiphany, Easter Vigil and Easter Octave, the Ascension, and Pentecost. Eucharistic Prayer II is particularly suitable for weekday Masses. Eucharistic Prayer III is particularly suitable for Sunday and holydays. Eucharistic Prayer IV recounts the history of salvation in greater detail and has a preface specifically assigned to it, and is suitable for days that are not assigned a preface. &lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, #322&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two reconciliatory Eucharistic Prayers, and three for Masses with children.

The ''Our Father'' is prayed, which, after several other prayers, may be followed by the optional Sign of Peace &lt;ref&gt;The Sacramentary, page 563&lt;/ref&gt;. The ''Agnus Dei'' (''Lamb of God'') is prayed or sung. The first two stanzas (?) may be repeated as many times as necessary until the ministers of the Eucharist are prepared, but the concluding stanza (?) always ends with ''grant us peace''. The priest prays two inaudible prayers&lt;ref&gt;The Sacramentary, page 563&lt;/ref&gt; and, after the ''&quot;This is the Lamb&quot;'' and a prayer based on the statement of a centurion, the Eucharist is consumed by the priest and, in most cases, the faithful present who are in the state of grace and have prepared themselves by the prescribed fast.

The ''Prayer after Communion'', followed by the Final Blessing, concludes the Mass.

==The Liturgy of the Hours==
The Liturgy of the Hours, also known as the Divine Office, is prayed several times during the course of a day. The key parts of the Liturgy of the Hours are the Invitatory, Morning Prayer, Daytime Prayer, Evening Prayer, Night Prayer, and the Office of Readings.  Clerics in the Roman Catholic Church are required by Canon Law to pray the major Hours of the Office, Morning and Evening Prayer; the daytime hours and the Office of Readings are optional.  Generally, only monastic communities pray the full office every day.

===Invitatory===
The Invitatory begins the prayer of every day. It is composed of the verse &quot;Lord, open my lips&quot; with the response &quot;And my mouth will proclaim your praise,&quot; followed by a psalm (usually Psalm 95, but it can be substituted with Psalm 100, 67, or 24). It is combined to the period of prayer which follows it, which may be either Morning Prayer or the Office of Readings.

===Morning Prayer===
Morning prayer is composed of the following: a hymn (unless Morning Prayer both follows and is combined with the Office of Readings, in which case the hymn proper to Morning Prayer is moved to the beginning of the Office of Readings),a psalm, an Old Testament canticle, a second psalm, a Biblical excerpt which serves as a reading, a responsory, the Canticle of Zechariah, a collection of intercessions, the Our Father, a concluding prayer, and the dismissal.
LENT:Fasting , Absting etc. 
===Daytime Prayer===
Daytime prayer is composed of the following: a hymn, three psalms, a Biblical excerpt which serves as a reading, a responsory, a concluding prayer, and a final acclamation. Daytime Prayer can be a single period or three separate periods termed Midmorning, Midday, and Midafternoon.

===Evening Prayer===
Evening prayer is composed of the following: a hymn, two psalms, a New Testament canticle, a Biblical excerpt which serves as a reading, a responsory, the Canticle of Mary, a collection of intercessions, the Our Father, a concluding prayer, and the dismissal.

===Night Prayer===
Night Prayer is composed of: an introduction, an examination of conscience, a penitential rite or prayer, a hymn or poem, one or two psalms, a Biblical excerpt which serves as a reading, a responsory, the Canticle of Simeon, a concluding prayer, and a Marian prayer.

===The Office of Readings===
The Office of Readings is frequently combined with another period of prayer. It is composed of a hymn (it uses its own prescribed hymn if not combined to another period other than the invitatory, but it uses the hymn of the other period at its beginning if it is followed by and combined with another period), three psalms, a verse with a response, a Biblical reading, a responsory, a reading from one of the Church writers, a second responsory, the ''Te Deum'' (only recited on Sundays, solemnities, and feasts; maybe not during Lent and Advent?), a concluding prayer, and a final acclamation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Catholic Church teaches that, after the sin of Adam, each person who comes into the world inherits Original sin (correct?). Original sin is washed away in baptism. (?)  Christ atoned for the sins of all, however man's cooperation is required in order to accept Christ's free gift of grace.  Faith--which necessarily includes good thoughts, words, and actions--constitutes acceptance of this sanctifying grace. When a person performs an evil thought, word, or action, he commits a sin. Sin is classified into two categories: venial and mortal. A person who commits a venial sin weakens his soul, but has not rejected Christ's offer of sanctifying grace.  Mortal sin constitutes a rejection of Christ's offer of grace and thus causes the individual to loose sanctifying grace until it is regained after reconcililing with God (normatively achieved through the making of a good confession). If a person dies in the state of mortal sin, he has failed to accept Christ's offer of salvation, and therefore has chosen eternal damnation in Hell over eternal life in Heaven with God. If a person dies who is in the state of grace but is not perfectly pure, he undergoes purification in Purgatory before entering Heaven.  A person may remove the impurity resulting from sin in several ways. One of these ways is to gain an indulgence. 

==Indulgences==
An indulgence may be gained by the recitation of certain prayers or the performance of certain acts. Indulgences are categorized as plenary and partial. Plenary indulgences completely remove the punishment due to sin. Certain conditions must be met to gain a plenary indulgence. A partial indulgence removes some of the punishment due to sin. Indulgences are administered by the Apostolic Penitentiary [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/index.htm]. The Enchiridion is the current book of indulgences. The Fourth edition (first published in 1999) can be found on the Vatican's website in the Latin language.[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_doc_20020826_enchiridion-indulgentiarum_lt.html] A book called the Raccolta once served this purpose.
  
A summary of the moral requirements of Catholics is contained in the Gospel of Mark:
:''And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all. And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel: the Lord your God is one God. And you shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength. This is the first commandment. And the second is like to it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these'' (see [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=21402&amp;pageno=34 Mark 12:28-31]).
Aspects of this calling are highlighted and defined in the Ten Commandments and in other commandments, laws, and principles.

==The Ten Commandments==
In quotations of the Ten Commandments, the Catholic Church uses the division in Deuteronomy rather than Exodus. In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, topics similar to the commandment are explained.

===The First Commandment===
Idolatry, love of possessions and persons over God, superstition, witchcraft, atheism, apostacy, and agnosticism are forbidden. The faithful and clergy may only worship God and Him alone; they may honor those of His servants who have set an heroic example of fidelity to God.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7B.HTM]

===The Second Commandment===
Cursing, swearing, profanity, obscene speech, rash oaths, blasphemy, and improper use of God's name or the names of the saints are forbidden.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7H.HTM]

===The Third Commandment===
A day of rest is to be observed on Sunday.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7M.HTM]

===The Fourth Commandment===
Obedience and respect to lawful authority is required, except in the case where one would be required to commit a sin.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7R.HTM]

===The Fifth Commandment===
Murder, suicide, abortion, contraception, euthanasia, and intentional physical injury of oneself or another is prohibited. Unjust wars are also forbidden, and the few cases when a war is undertaken for a just cause are explained.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7Y.HTM]

The Catholic Church teaches that life begins from conception and exists until natural death. Pope Paul VI wrote the encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' on the matter.

===The Sixth Commandment===
Adultery, fornication, pre-marital sex, and homosexual intercourse are forbidden. (This is not to be misunderstood as homosexual feelings are seen as sinful, but only the act of a sexual exchange between those of the same sex is condemned. Persons with homosexual attractions are called to lead a chaste life just as any non-married heterosexual Catholic Christian and all Catohlics are urged to look upon those who bear this cross with sympathy and compassion.)[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P83.HTM][http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html]

===The Seventh Commandment===
Theft, vandalism, and damage to the property of another are prohibited. Employers are required to pay just wages.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P89.HTM]

===The Eighth Commandment===
False witness, perjury, detraction, calumny, slander, boasting, bragging, lies, and gossip are forbidden.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8H.HTM]

===The Ninth Commandment===
Lust, impure thoughts, and impure desires are forbidden; purity and modesty are required.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8P.HTM]

===The Tenth Commandment===
Envy is forbidden.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8T.HTM]

==The Six Precepts of the Church==
* Catholics are required to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation
* Catholics are required to confess their sins at least once a year in the Sacarament of Reconciliation
* Reception of communion at least once during the Easter Season is required.
* Holy Days of Obligation must be kept holy.
* Observation of the fast and abstinence laws is required.
* The faithful are obligated to provide for the temporal needs of the Church.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P75.HTM]

==Seven Corporal Works of Mercy==
The seven corporal works of mercy are: give food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, visit the imprisoned, visit the sick, and bury the dead.

==Seven Spiritual Works of Mercy==
The seven spiritual works of mercy are: ...Counsel the doubtful, admonish the ignorant,... forgive all injuries, and pray for the living and the dead.

==Virtues==
Certain good qualities that should be practiced by Catholics are often classified as virtues.

===Theological Virtues===
There are three Theological virtues: Faith, Hope, and Charity. These qualities apply directly to a person's relationship with God.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P66.HTM]

===Cardinal Virtues===
There are Four Cardinal Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude. These are qualities that are naturally necessary for any moral life.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P65.HTM]

      <comment>Adding seven to the supposedly four types of Celtic music, making eleven, plus two ommitted  classes of jigs, and distinction between listening pieces, set dances and group dances.+Reference</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditional Celtic music is played in various forms and can be classified variously as follows:

==Classification by context ==
* Set dances (dance solo) can be jig or reel. (Table dance:Footed on a tabletop).
* Group dances
* Listening pieces

==Classification by musical structure ==

*Reels: Tend to be played very fast and usually consist of continuous eighth notes written in 4/4 time
*Jigs: Much slower than reels, jigs usually have eighth notes in 6/8 time with accents falling on first and fourth beats.
**Doubkle jigs
**Slip jigs
*Hornpipe: Similar to reels but more slowly,  They are usually written in 4/4 and often played without accents
*Waltzes: Played in a &quot;waltz pace&quot;; Written in 3/4 time and use triplet rhythmn.
* Strathspeys: Dotted rhythms; usually associated with Scottish playing, Cape Breton and Boston fiddle. Utilizes the &quot;Scottish snap&quot;. Browns of Kincardie; Cummingses of Freuchie.
* Polkas
* Quadrilles
* Hornpipes: Derived form pipcorn (stockhorn) Chaucer mentions in Romaunt of the Rose, 1260. 3/2, originally, now 4/4
* Airs
* Marches
* Laments
&lt;ref.Robin WIlliamson|Eng Welsh Scot &amp; Irish Fiddle Tunes|oak Publ|197&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharp keys are favored but some tunes are in C/Aminor or Fmajor. D, G and A are quite popular, in that order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) is claimed as the father of sociology by renowned american sociologist &quot;Talcott Parsons&quot;. His contributions make it clear why he deserves the title.

== Biographical Sketch ==

Emile Durkheim was born into the traditional Jewish family in the village of Epinal in the Vosges near Strasbourg, France. He lost faith in God at an early age and turned towards the secular view of religion. The disastrous Franco-Prussian war of 1870 made a major impression on Durkheim, which can be seen in his fascination with the study of group solidarity. He went to attend Ecole Normale Superior at Paris whose impact can be seen in his scientific and mathematical bent in research. His works revolve around two themes, &quot;Domination of collectivism over individualism&quot; and &quot;Application of scientific methods to study social phenomenon&quot;.

== Intellectual Influence ==

Durkheim was influenced by many scholars from french, english and german traditions. Montesquieu's spirit of laws influenced him to study the changes in society in terms of other factors like Law. Which led him to create a distinction of societies based on repressive law and restitutive law. Other Major influences being Rousseau, Condorcet, Emile Boutrox, Wilhelm Wundt, Ferdinand Tonnies, Fustel de coulenges, Charles Renouvier, Georg Simmel and August Comte. He had a running intellectual fued with his colleague Gabriel Tarde. This fued also contributed to his intellectual thinking defending his positivistic approach from socio-psychological approach of Tarde. 

== Contributions ==

Durkheim began by publishing articles, first on the German academic life. In 1893 came his first monumental work on the ''The Social Division of Labor''. He published his second major study ''The Rules of Sociological Method'' in 1895 and completed his trilogy in 1897 with ''Suicide''. His final book was entitled, ''Totemism: The Elementary Forms of Religious Life'' in 1912. 

He created a distinct identity to sociology as a discipline with his concept of distinct social reality which can be understood and explained in terms of social facts. He made sociology a study of social facts thus effectively creating a clear scope for the subject culling it out of What was earlier studied by psychology and philosophy.

His second book &quot;The Rules of sociological Method&quot;, he clearly states the methods that are to be followed by a sociologist while studying the society. In this book he discusses three methods of carrying out research in a positive science like sociology. These methods are observation, experimentation and generalization. This book formed the framework which was later demonstrated by durkheim in letter and spirit through in studies. His Study of suicide reaffirms his belief that causal relationship can be established between social phenomenon. Next study of Religion demonstrates the utility of functional explanation in sociology. 

In his third book,''Le Suicide'' He had used considerable statistical ingenuity  to reject the early theories for giving extra social factors such as climate, heredity, mental alienation as causes of suicide, and established a causal relationship between suicide and lack of cohesion. To support his own findings he used the empirical data collected from many societies and cultures. Durkheim identified three basic types of suicide: ''Egoistic suicide, Altruistic suicide,and Anomic suicide'' based on the empirical evidences and added ''Fatalistic Suicide'' based on historical evidence. This work stands as a landmark in the sociological tradition as the first work which successfully combines theory with empirical evidence.

In his last major book,''Totemism: The Elementary Forms of Religious Life(''1912), he gave the description and detailed analysis of simplistic form religion, Totemism as practiced by Aboriginal Australian tribes. He derived general theory of religion from the study of the simplest and most primitive of religious institutions like totemism. He began by refuting the existing theories of '''Animism''' by ''Tylor'' and '''naturism''' by ''Max Mueller'' on the grounds of them promoting religion as an illusion with reliance on spirit and supernatural forces. Religion according to Durkheim is very much real, permanent and transcendent. The essence of religion according to him is divided into ''Sacred'' and ''Profane''. Durkheim defines religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things,that is to say things set apart and forbidden-beliefs and practices that unite in one simple moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: ''See also:'' [[How To Build An Excellent Wikibook Teaching Any Language]]

This is a plan for propadeutic (preparatory) lessons teaching the student the Korean script and its pronunciation (including letter combinations). The goal is to introduce letters one by one so as not to overwhelm the student. In order to raise his confidence and provide feelings of success, words used for illustration and exercises shall mostly be understandable without any knowledge of Korean: Korean words that come from English, Korean words that other languages adopted, common transliterations of English personal names and names of countries or places whose name is not very different in Korean. 

The student is assumed to have no previous knowledge of Korean. Each lesson will teach a few letters and then give some words from this list in order to practise reading. Upon successfully recognising all the letters of a word, he should be able to recognise the word itself. For example, &quot;가나&quot; is recognizable because it's so similar to the English words &quot;Ghana&quot;. &quot;독일&quot; is not recognizable because the English word is &quot;Germany&quot; and doesn't resemble the Korean transliteration.

A list of recognizable Korean words has already been created below.  Feel free to add more recognizable words to the list in order to help find a suitable order of letters and to provide material for more exercises.

'''History of the Clarinet'''

Clarinets have been around for quite a long time, although not in their present form. The history of the clarinet goes as far back as the late 1600's, when an instrument known as a [http://www.answers.com/chalumeau Chalumeau] was in occasional use in orchestras. The chalumeau is commonly considered to be a forerunner of our modern clarinet, although it bore little resemblance to the ones we play today.


The chalumeau was a cane pipe measuring about 20cm (about 9 inches) long. It had seven holes, including a thumb hole, and a range of not much more than an octave. The name chalumeau suggests a French origin for this little instrument. But it was Johann Denner, a leading German woodwind maker, who was credited with improving it, and in doing so inventing the early clarinet. Sometime around 1700, Denner added two keys to the chalumeau, expanding its range by giving it an upper register. He also may have given it a separate mouthpiece and reed. 

The history of the clarinet continued to develop as two-keyed clarinets underwent a variety of improvements and were introduced to France and England. By about 1750, the clarinet body had taken the basic shape we see today, but the keywork continued to evolve. In about 1780, five keys were being used. And by 1820 or 1830, clarinets were commonly in use that had 12 or 13 keys. By 1850 or so Boehm system keywork had been introduced. This system, based on the keywork then being used on the flute, managed to eliminated some very difficult fingerings. It is the system most commonly used today although Albert fingering systems are also still in use, primarily in Europe. In North America, it is rare to see a clarinet that does not use Boehm keywork. 

In the mid to late 1700's, composers had begun writing musical pieces that included, or were specifically written for, clarinets. The instrument became much more prominent in the 1800's, and large volumes of music were written for it in the early 1900's. 

We will likely see continued minor changes, although it will probably happen very slowly, over decades. Today, there are minor variations in different models. Manufacturers use slightly different bore diameters and shapes, and occasionally additional keys. Most modern clarinets have 17 or 18 keys. --[[User:Vince314|Vince314]] 03:59, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

{{cheese}}

'''Reblochon''' is a French cheese from Savoie. Reblochon is produced in the valleys of Thônes and Val d'Arly. Reblochon is made from cow's milk. The cheese is a soft paste with a washed crust. Its crust is yellow saffron, covered with fine white foam, which shows it has been matured in a fresh cellar. It is best consumed between May and September after a maturation of between six and eight weeks. It is also excellent from March to December. Reblochon has a hazelnut taste. It is a vital ingredient of tartiflette, a Savoyard gratin with potatoes, cream and pork.

Reblochon cheese was first made in the XIIIth Century, in Savoie, in the Thônes valley. In that time, farmers rented meadows (alpages) from a landowner, and gave a portion of the milk produced as rent. When the rent payment was to be determined, the farmers milked the cows incompletely in order to reduce the apparent production, and thus their rent. Once the landowner had gone, the farmers would then conduct a second milking, which yielded a milk rich in fat. This milk was then preserved by turning it into cheese. The name Reblochon comes from patois, reblocher, which means to milk again.</text>

Linux (Ubuntu 8.10 with MySQL 4.1 installed extra), GENtle v. 1.9.3
# please update the software so that it can cope with MySQL 5, MySQL is already very outdated and hard to install on current Linux systems
# When using the PCR tool, adding primers (that have been loaded from the database first) causes a program crash, so the PCR-tool option is unfortunately not usable...

This is the output on the console:

# The BLAST-page still hangs...
[[User:Bernd|Bernd]] ([[User talk:Bernd|talk]]) 12:51, 20 January 2009 (UTC)


Using GENtle on WinXP Pro. Attempting to BLAST anything results in immediate shutdown of the software. No prompting for save or anyhting... Any suggestions? Patches?
:Fixed in CVS, will go live with the next version. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] 14:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

Under Mac OSx 10.4.8 (PPC platform), when starting GENtle the program hangs while displaying the introductory splash screen.
:I can not reproduce this bug on my G4 PowerBook (PPC, 10.4.8). It also runs well on PPC iMac 10.3.9. Was GENtle installed under the same user name you're using? It could potentially be a write access conflict. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] 14:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

Under OpenSuSE 10.2 x86 the CVS version GENtle builds and works fine. One problem: when blasting a sequence GENtle hangs. Probably a threading issue?
This is also the case on OpenSuSE 10.2 x86_64.
Follow-up: I tested the latest CVS version (17 Feb 2009) on openSUSE 11.0 and openSUSE 11.1, both x86 and x86_64. Still, when BLASTing anything, GENtle hangs. I used wxWidgets-2.8.9.1 to build.
I can send you additional data if you like.

== Delete or move this section ==

This sort of discussion of general website creation etc. does not belong in a book about genealogy.  Put it in some book about HTML and hosting and whatever, and link to it from here.  Not only does it not belong here, but lots of this information is quite ''wrong'' and/or out of date.  How many people are actually going to hand-code family websites these days?!  A discussion of the various CMSs around that are suitable for genealogical research would be useful, but not this!  Sorry if I'm harsh, but I'd love to see this book grow into something that one could recommend to the hordes of 60-something grandmothers who are wanting to 'do their family history'.  :-)

== What the above user said ==

But a little less harshly.  I would rename the book as &quot;Minimalist Web Development.&quot;  IMHO, minimalism will never go out of style.  I used write web pages that proudly displayed the &quot;Built With Notepad&quot; logo.  The right to do that is one of very few things I actually miss about being an ex-Windows user.  Also, the digital divide is real, even here in America, so a sneakernet-based method of managing a website is an extremely powerful toolkit to be sharing in the public domain.  Perhaps some of my own ideas from http://tribes.tribe.net/netizen would be appropriate for inclusion in such a tome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, welcome to wikibooks!

I saw your comments on the &quot;Votes for Deletion&quot; discussion about your new zealand economics book. I think that the discussion has ended, and we are not going to delete this material. If you would like to continue working on it, there is a good discussion of the wikiformatting on [[Help:Contents|The Help pages, HERE]] that you can look at. Our formatting is generally much easier then HTML or other types of markup languages that are used (although there is potential to get very complicated, if you want!)

If you would like to continue working on this book (and we all hope that you do), let me know and I will be glad to help you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:50, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

We need to be careful here not to infringe on the copyright to the rules which, I believe, is now held by Hasbro.  
Also as a textbook, there should probably also be a section on educational uses for Diplomacy.  -- [[User:Jvv62|Jvv62]] 20:23, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''set''' is a grouping of values, and are generally denoted with upper-case letters. For instance, let's say that A is the set of all first names that start with the letter 'A'. From this definition, we can see that &quot;Andrew&quot; is a member of set A, but &quot;Michael&quot; is not.

== Sets ==
=== Common Sets ===

Here are some of the common sets:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;: The Natural Numbers
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;: The Integers
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;: The Rational Numbers
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;: The Real Numbers
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;: The Complex Numbers

The '''Natural Numbers''' are the set of non-negative and non-zero integers &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}.&lt;/math&gt; The '''Integers''' are all the natural numbers, their negative counterparts and zero &lt;math&gt;\{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rational numbers are all the numbers that can be formed as a fraction of two integers with a non-zero denominator. The Real numbers include the rational numbers, and also includes all the numbers that cannot be formed as a ratio of two integers. The Complex numbers are all the numbers that involve the imaginary number, i. Notice that C can contain numbers that are imaginary (no real part), real (no imaginary part) and complex (real and imaginary parts).

== Set Notation ==

Frequently, it is required that we define a set by a specific mathematical relationship. For instance, we can say that we want to define the set of all the even integers. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the set notation for integers, we can say:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in \mathbb{Z}: x \mbox{ mod } 2 = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

In English, this statement says &quot;All x in set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; such that x modulo 2 equals zero&quot;. Or, if we are not familiar with the modulo operation, it is perfectly acceptable to use plain English when defining our set:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z}: x \mbox{ is even}\}&lt;/math&gt;

The colon (:) here is read as &quot;such that&quot;. This notation will come up a lot in the rest of this book, so it is important for the reader to familiarize themselves with this.

&lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; denotes that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an element of A.

== Set Operations ==

A subset S of a set A is a set such that &lt;math&gt;s \in S \to s \in A&lt;/math&gt;. This is denoted as &lt;math&gt;S \subset A&lt;/math&gt;.

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{s: s \in A \and s \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The union of two sets A and B is the set &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \{s: s \in A \or s \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;S \subset A&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;A-S=\{ s: s \in A \and s \notin S \} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Cartesian Product ==

A cartesian product between two sets shows the domains of two or more variables. For instance, if we have the variables x and y, and the sets A and B, we can use the cartesian product to show the domains of x and y in terms of A and B:

:&lt;math&gt;A \times B = \{(x, y): x \in A, y \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Compositions ==

Compositions are operations on a set that act on numbers of the set, and return a value that is in that same set, that is if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set, a composition is a function &lt;math&gt;*:A\times A\to A&lt;/math&gt;
 
:For instance, addition between two integers produces an integer result. Therefore addition is a composition in the integers. Whereas division of integers is an example of an operation that is ''not'' a composition, since &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; is not an integer.

If we have a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we say that a composition acts on &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt; and produces a result in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This is also known as '''closure'''.

=== Associativity ===

A composition Δ is said to be associative if:

:&lt;math&gt;(A \Delta B) \Delta C = A \Delta (B \Delta C)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the addition operation is an associative operation over the integers, Z:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + 2) + 3 = 6 = 1 + (2 + 3)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice however, that subtraction is not associative:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 - 2) - 3 = -4,\qquad 1 - (2 - 3) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Commutativity ===

A composition Δ is said to be commutative if:

:&lt;math&gt;A \Delta B = B \Delta A&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, multiplication is commutative because:

:&lt;math&gt; 2 \times 3 = 6 = 3 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that division is not commutative:

:&lt;math&gt; 2 \div 3 = \frac{2}{3}, \qquad 3 \div 2 = \frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Neutral Element ==

A '''Neutral Element''' (or ''Identity'') is an item in E such that a composition in E &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; E into E returns the other operand. For instance, say that we have a composition Δ, a neutral element &lt;math&gt;e \in E&lt;/math&gt;, and a non-neutral element &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;. If Δ is commutative, we have the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt; e \Delta x = x \Delta e = x&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, in addition, the neutral element is 0, because 1 + 0 = 1. Also notice that in multiplication, 1 is the neutral element, because 1 &amp;times; 2 = 2.

Each composition may have only one neutral element, if it has any at all. To prove this fact, let's assume a composition Δ with two neutral elements, e and f: 

:&lt;math&gt;e \Delta f = e&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f \Delta e = f&lt;/math&gt;

But since e and f are commutative under Δ by definition, we know that e = f.

== Ordered Pairs ==

{{SideBox|Most readers should recognize the ordered coordinate pairs from the cartesian coordinate graphing system as an ordered pair of values, (x,y).}}

Ordered pairs are artificial constructions where we set two values into a specific order. More formally, we can define an ordered pair as the set&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(a,b)=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's say that we have two ordered pairs, A and B, comprised of values &lt;math&gt;a_1,  a_2,  b_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;A = (a_1, a_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = (b_1, b_2)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if

:&lt;math&gt; a_1 = b_1  \mbox{ and }  a_2 = b_2&lt;/math&gt;

== Functions ==
   
A function is essentially a mapping that connects two values, x and y. We use the following notation to show that our function f is a relationship between x and y:   
   
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \in f&lt;/math&gt;   
   
Notice that x and y form an ordered pair: If we reverse the order of x and y, the relationship will be different (or non-existent). We say that the set of possible values for x is the '''domain''', D, of the function, and the set of possible y values is the '''Range''', R.    
   
In other words, using some of the terms we have discussed already, we say that our function f maps from &quot;D &amp;times; R into R&quot;.

=== Inverses ===

If f is a function in D &amp;times; R, to R, then f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the '''inverse''' of f if it is in R &amp;times; D to D, and the following relationship holds:

:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \in f, \qquad (y, x) \in f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Exercise==

*Of the four arithmetic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are associative? commutative?
*Using the definition of the ordered pair as a model, give a formal definition for an ordered ''n-tuple'': &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\ldots a_n )&lt;/math&gt;

== Answer ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! operation !! associative !! commutative
|-
| Addition || yes || yes
|-
| Multiplication || yes || yes
|-
| Subtraction || No || No 
|-
| Division || No || No

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[Image:Telugu.png|thumb|left]]
Telugu is written using modern Telugu script which was evolved from Vijaya script of Vijayanagara days;similar to the Kannada script. Just like the Latin alphabet, the Telugu script has letters representing vowels and consonants. In addition, unlike the Latin alphabet, there are letters representing combinations of vowels and consonants! For example, to represent 'PA' using Telugu script we have to combine the consonant ప్ (P) with the vowel అ (A) to form ప (PA). This type of letters are simply called as  gunintalu or vowel-consonants.
The Tamil script has 16(+2/+3) vowels, 39 consonants and  624 vowel-consonants (16 vowels x 39 consonants = 624 vowel-consonants). In addition, there is a special letter called arasunna (ఁ) which is classified as neither a consonant nor a vowel. Hence, the complete script is comprised of 625 letters!
Though many of them may not be in use. In accordance with pronunciation, written form may differ from spoken form.
In Telugu, vowels are called as Achchulu which means soul-letters, consonants are called as Hallulu which means body-letters and vowel-consonants are called as Gunintalu which means body &amp; soul letters. Do you have any idea of why vowels are called as souls? It is because they give life (sound) to the soundless bodies - consonants!
The Telugu script looks very different from the letters you are reading now. For example the word Telugu written in the Telugu script is in the image on the left.

==How many people speak this language?==
Aproximately 74 million people speak Telugu as their native language. It is the third most widely spoken language in India after [[Wikijunior:Languages|Hindi]] and [[Wikijunior:Languages|Bengali]].

==Where is this language spoken?==
Telugu is a language primarily spoken in South India. It belongs to Dravidian group of languages. Including non native speakers, there are nearly 90 million people speaking Telugu in Andhra Pradesh alone. But they are also present in the USA, the UK, Malaysia, Fiji islands, Mauritius, and South Africa where people that speak Telugu have traveled to.

==What is the history of this language?==
Telugu is one of the oldest languages in the world, the old form of Telugu dates back to 1000 BC.  Early inscriptions were found in the 6th century AD. But proper literary work started five centuries later in the 11th century. Sanskrit, the oldest language of India, has had an enormous impact on Telugu in modern times and many of its words have seeped into Telugu. Telugu was given the highest position by Srikrishna Devaraya, a king of the Vijayanagar empire. During his reign Telugu was highly revered and was also the language of the state.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Nannayabhattarakudu, is the first poet in Telugu and called &quot;Aadi Kavi&quot; meaning the first poet. He translated Mahabharata, the great epic from Sanskrit to Telugu in 1020 AD.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
తెలుగు
వెలుగు-light
బ౦తి-Ball
ఆవు-Cow
అమ్మ-Mother

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
This is a famous poem by Vemana.

''Uppu karpurambu,okka polikanundu,
 chooda chooda ruchula,jaada veriah,
 purushulandu punya purushulu veriah,
 Viswa dhabi rama vinura vema.''

 Meaning:

    &quot;The look of Salt and camphor are same.They can be differntiated only by taste.In the same manner,There will be a difference in men and great men though they look same.O Lord of Universe rama,listen to the of Vema.&quot;

== Preface to the First Edition ==

One of the many challenges facing the countries in the Asia-Pacific today is pre-paring their societies and governments for globalization and the information and communication revolution. Policy-makers, business executives, NGO activists, aca-demics, and ordinary citizens are increasingly concerned with the need to make their societies competitive in the emergent information economy. 

The e-ASEAN Task Force and the UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) share the belief that with enabling information and com-munication technologies (ICTs), countries can face the challenge of the information age. With ICTs they can leap forth to higher levels of social, economic and political development. We hope that in making this leap, policy and decision-makers, plan-ners, researchers, development practitioners, opinion-makers, and others will find this series of e-primers on the information economy, society, and polity useful. 

The e-primers aim to provide readers with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends, and issues associated with the information age. The primers are written in simple, easy-to-understand language. They provide ex-amples, case studies, lessons learned, and best practices that will help planners and decision makers in addressing pertinent issues and crafting policies and strat-egies appropriate for the information economy. 

The present series of e-primers includes the following titles: 

*[[The Information Age]]
*Nets, Webs and the Information Infrastructure 
*e-Commerce and e-Business 
*Legal and Regulatory Issues for the Information Economy 
*e-Government,
*ICT and Education 
*Genes, Technology and Policy: An Introduction to Biotechnology 

These e-primers are also available online at http://www.eprimers.org and http://www.apdip.net. 

The primers are brought to you by UNDP- APDIP, which seeks to create an ICT enabling environment through advocacy and policy reform in the Asia-Pacific re-gion, and the e-ASEAN Task Force, an ICT for development initiative of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We welcome your views on new topics and issues on which the e-primers may be useful. 

Finally, we thank all who have been involved with this series of e-primers-writers, researchers, peer reviewers and the production team.

== Introduction from the author ==

As the Internet’s sphere of influence as a communications network widens to include commercial and other exchanges, legal authorities have become more interested in asserting authority over it and the activities of those who use it. The legal questions arising from the increasingly complex world of the Internet has raised questions about the role and the rule of law in this new domain. These concerns range from the nature of self-identity to national sovereignty. 

This primer aims to help developing nations define and determine their requirements for shaping appropriate e-commerce legislation, as well as corresponding regulatory and institutional frameworks that balance such complex issues as competition, privacy, consumer protection, equal access/opportunity and intellectual property. 

The primer also discusses the implications for developing countries in the Asia Pacific of failure to or delay in putting in place the appropriate legal/policy and regulatory infrastructure necessary for them to participate in the information economy.

== The Rule of Law and the Internet ==

As technology grows by leaps and bounds, the laws have to be made more responsive to changing times. The lack of a legal framework, in many jurisdictions, to address problems of validity of electronic transactions is a significant barrier to the growth of e-commerce. For one thing, while there are laws on contracts and other business transactions, these require written, signed, or so-called “first” documents. In e-commerce transactions, however, electronic data or documents or digitally signed contracts make up the whole transaction. 

To address this conundrum, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has drafted a model law on e-commerce that can serve as a guide for governments when they draft their own e-commerce laws. 

==What principles underpin the UNCITRAL Model Law?== 
The UNCITRAL Model Law operates on the following principles: 

;Equivalence: Electronic communications shall be the functional equivalent of paper-based documents. Given proper standards, electronic documents can be treated and given the same value as paper documents. 
;Autonomy of contracts: Contracts may be in the form of electronic documents. However, this should not result in a change in the substantive terms and conditions of a transaction. 
;Voluntary use of the electronic communication: Parties may choose to enter into an electronic transaction or not at all. It is not mandatory. 
;Solemnity of the contract and the primacy of statutory requirements respecting formalities of contracts: The requirements for a contract to be valid and enforceable, such as notarization, remain the same. 
;Application to form rather than substance: The law should be applicable to the form rather than the substantive terms of the contract. Whatever statutory elements are required to be present must still be present, e.g., consent freely given, an object, cause or consideration. 
;Primacy of consumer protection laws: Consumer protection laws may take precedence over the provisions of the Model Law.

==What kind of protection does the Model Law seek to provide? ==

The Model Law hopes to provide adequate legal protection for those who wish to engage in e-commerce. It ensures that electronic transactions are legally recognized and that a course of action, if necessary, is available and may be taken to enforce transactions entered into electronically.

__TOC__
It has been said that: “For several years, some of the most difficult legal issues on the Internet have involved one of the medium’s greatest assets: its lack of boundaries. Although the free-flowing, borderless nature of cyberspace has revolutionized communication and commerce, it has also led to many lawsuits. And, as if resolving those lawsuits weren’t difficult enough, it’s often just as tough to determine where they should take place.”{{lriiecite|1}}

==When is there conflict of laws? ==
A resident of Manila who decides to file a malpractice suit against a Manila-based doctor who had done her an injury may do so in a Manila court. The Manila courts have jurisdiction over the doctor. But if the injured person later on moves to Hanoi, and decides to file the case there, the doctor in Manila will surely object-and validly-that no Hanoi court can have personal jurisdiction over him. That’s an easy case. 

Consider a Web site selling pornographic materials set up in Hong Kong, hosted in the Caribbean, with a Web master residing in the Netherlands and owners who are British nationals, and broadcast throughout the world? If a complaint for pornography were to be filed, whom do you sue and where do you sue them? 

For our third case, suppose A, in Hanoi, enters into a contract for the delivery of heavy machinery with B, in Yangon. If B fails to deliver the goods, where does A file the case? If A files the case for breach of contract in a Hanoi court, how does the Hanoi court acquire jurisdiction over B? 

These examples show that jurisdiction is not straightforward in the Internet. 

==How can jurisdiction be asserted or acquired? ==
In the United States, there are ways by which courts are able to acquire jurisdiction over Web-based activities: 

#Gotcha. Where the court obtains jurisdiction over an out-of-State defendant, provided that when he visits the State, that person is served with a summons and a complaint (documents that give the person notice of the lawsuit). This was applied to the case of the Russian programmer sued by the publishers of e-book (Adobe). While attending a convention in Nevada, he was served with a notice and was subsequently arrested.
#Causing an injury within the State. An Internet business can also be subject to jurisdiction for purposefully causing an injury in another state. This principle derives from a series of cases where courts of another State acquired jurisdiction over non-residents who entered the State, caused an accident and left. If someone uses the Internet to cause an injury in one State, the person causing the damage may be hauled into court in the State where the injury occurred. In cases where the connection between the activity and the injury is not clear, courts also look for evidence that the activity was “purposefully directed” at the resident of the forum State or that the person causing the injury had contacts with the State.{{lriiecite|2}}
#Minimum contacts. A business or person with sufficient contacts with a particular State can be hauled to court even if he/she does not live or has a business in that State. Usually, the basis is the regularity of solicitation of business, derivation of substantial income from goods or services sold in that other State, or engaging in some other persistent course of conduct there. For example, passive Internet sites, which merely advertise but do not really offer to sell goods or services, may be said not to have achieved the required minimum contacts for courts to acquire jurisdiction over them. But with Web sites that actively offer to sell and then subsequently take orders from that State, it can be said that the minimum contacts have been satisfied for purposes of acquiring jurisdiction.
#Effects. When one’s conduct in cyberspace though emanating from another State creates or results in an injury in another, courts in the latter State can acquire jurisdiction over the offender. To illustrate: A case was filed by the DVD Copy Control Association against the creator of DeCCS{{lriiecite|3}}, a software that decrypts the copy-protection system in Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs) to allow ordinary CD-ROM drives to play or read DVDs. An issue in the case was whether the courts of California had jurisdiction over the person, who was a student in Indiana when the suit was filed and who later on moved to Texas. The court said that the California courts had jurisdiction, citing a 17-year-old US Supreme Court case involving defamation, because the California movie and computing industry was affected by the “effects” of the defendant’s conduct in Indiana. This decision signals an expansion of personal jurisdiction in cyberspace. If other courts chart their course by California standards, any Web publisher could be hauled to court wherever its site has an effect. The attorney general of Minnesota has issued this statement of caution: “Warning to all Internet Users and Providers: Persons outside of Minnesota who transmit information via the Internet knowing that information will be disseminated in Minnesota are subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota courts for violations of State criminal and civil laws.”

==Why is it necessary to establish laws governing jurisdiction? ==
Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is important to establish which law governs a contract formed, perfected, or conducted online. Without an express choice of governing law, complex and difficult issues can arise. For the time being, it may be prudent for businessmen to determine which existing law and regulations apply and ensure that they are well versed in the local laws of the areas where they wish to set up their Web presence. This is to avoid unexpected liabilities that may arise as well as possible un-enforceability of contracts into which they enter. Better still, when they conduct transactions online, parties must first agree on the legal regimes under which they may operate, so that when a dispute arises, the questions of jurisdiction-what law and what courts-would have already been settled.

== Legal Recognition of Electronic Documents and Electronic Signatures ==

In an APEC seminar on electronic commerce in early 1998{{lriiecite|4}}, the uncertain policy environment, among other things, was cited by those from the Asia-Pacific region as a major inhibitor to the growth of electronic commerce. Of particular concern was the uncertainty resulting from the fact that laws are rooted in the paper world, requiring writing, manual signatures, and the creation and retention of original documents using paper. 

Take the case of Philippine rules on formation and perfection of contracts. The Philippine Civil Code, enacted in 1950, says that a contract is a meeting of the minds between two persons whereby one person binds him/herself to the other to give something or to render some service. What happens then if one person programs a computer to make successive bids for himself, say on E-bay? As the bids for a particular item goes higher and as his or the Web site’s computer makes bids for him, as programmed, will the successive bids be binding on him, when he had did not commit what in law is referred to as contemporaneous interventions at that time? Would there be a valid meeting of the minds in this case? Assuming that the contract between E-bay and the person is valid, will it be enforceable? 

Another problem is the provision called Statute of Frauds, which was adopted from United States rule. The Statute requires that certain contracts, such as an agreement for the sale of goods at a price of no less than five hundred pesos (or about $10.00), or, inter alia, an agreement for the leasing for more than one year or the sale of real property, be made in writing. Unwritten contracts, though valid, cannot be enforced in courts. The Rules of Court also require paper-based documents and not electronic ones. 

Clearly there is a need for a change in the legal framework that would not only allow the recognition of electronic documents and/or signatures, but also provide an assurance that the courts will allow these into evidence in cases of disputes. 

==What Asian countries have enacted e-commerce rules/laws? ==
In East Asia, Hongkong has enacted the Electronic Transactions Ordinance (effec-tive April 7, 2000; enacted January 7, 2000.), which covers electronic and digital signatures and electronic records. This act is generally applicable to all communications. Japan’s Law Concerning Electronic Signatures and Certification Authorities (effective April 1, 2001; enacted May 24, 2000.) is about digital signatures and is generally applicable to all communications. South Korea’s Basic Law on Electronic Commerce also covers digital signatures and is generally applicable to all communications. 

In Southeast Asia, Malaysia has its Digital Signature Bill of 1997, which became effective on October 1, 1998. Singapore’s Electronic Transactions Act of 1998 (enacted June 29, 1998) covers digital and electronic signatures as well as electronic records, and is generally applicable to all communications. Similarly, Thailand’s Electronic Commerce Law (which passed second and third readings in October 2000) covers electronic signatures and is generally applicable to all communications. In the Philippines the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 (enacted June 14, 2000) encompasses electronic signatures, electronic transactions, and crimes related to e-commerce. The Electronic Transactions Order of Brunei (enacted November 2000) covers electronic contracts, as well as digital and electronic signatures. 

India’s Information Technology Act of 2000 (Presidential Assent June 9, 2000; passed by both Houses of the Indian Parliament May 17, 2000; implemented in October 2000) covers digital signatures and electronic records, and is generally applicable to all communications. 

==What are the different legislative approaches toward electronic authentication?== 
It is not easy to classify the existing legislation with respect to electronic authentication because of the many differences that exist. It is possible, however, to sketch the main approaches at a national and international level. Three approaches can be identified: (1) the digital signature approach; (2) the two-prong approach; and (3) the minimalist approach.{{lriiecite|5}}

===What is the digital signature approach? ===

The digital signature approach is characterized by its focus on the digital signature technique. Legislation under this category is truly digital signature legislation because it regulates (on the basis of) digital signatures. Legislation under this approach is concerned solely with the (evidentiary) status of the digital signature. The approach has three variants:

#Technical variant. The technical variant amounts to setting the digital signature technique as a technical standard by means of a legal instrument. The technical variant does not deal with legal consequences, although such consequences may implicitly follow from the use of digital signatures in accordance with the law concerned.
#Legal variant. The legal variant of the digital signature approach is found in legislation that specifically regulates digital signatures in order to provide this technique with a legal status similar to that of the hand-written signature. The general purpose of these laws is to provide legal security for the use of digital signatures. Often legislation of this kind also includes the implementation and regulation of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
#Organizational variant. The organizational variant of the digital signature approach neither sets the digital signature as a technical standard nor provides for explicit legal recognition of the digital signature. Instead, it addresses the organisation of Certification Authorities (CAs) and the use of digital certificates in connection with digital signature applications. The aim is to promote trust and reliability in electronic transactions by ensuring that CAs are reliable and secure.{{lriiecite|6}}

===What is the two-prong approach? ===

The second approach is called two-prong because of its hybrid way of dealing with electronic authentication. In this approach, legislators aim to make their legislation more time-resistant by addressing certain technological requirements and by leaving room for new technological developments. With this approach, legislation sets requirements for electronic authentication methods that will receive a certain minimum legal status (the minimum prong) and assigns greater legal effect to certain electronic-authentication techniques (the maximum prong). The technologies given this higher legal status are referred to as secure electronic signatures.{{lriiecite|7}}

===What is the minimalist approach? ===

The minimalist approach does not address specific techniques and therefore intends to be technology-neutral. Legislation relates to the functions that signatures may have to fulfil in trade, and the different levels of reliability with respect to the purposes the signatures are used for. Because the main focus of this approach is on the relevant functions of signatures and the ways in which these functions may be translated into technological applications, it is also called the functionalist approach. Within the minimalist approach, the focus on functions of signatures (and writings) can be more or less explicit.{{lriiecite|8}}

===Which is the better approach? ===

The market is constantly changing and we do not know what lies ahead with respect to technological and e-commerce developments. Thus, it might be unwise to issue detailed regulations and to determine specific business models, such as the PKI model, since their viability cannot be ascertained. 

Viewed in this light, the digital signature approach is seriously flawed. Although the legislators and regulators subscribing to this approach may do so for all the right reasons (legal certainty, trustworthiness with respect to legal matters), we do not recommend the approach as such. 

The same is true, but to a lesser extent, of the two-prong approach, which attempts to skirt the uncertainties by presenting an opening for new technologies aside from setting criteria for certain advanced electronic signatures which at present cover digital signatures. The approach is understandable in the sense that there seems to be a strong inclination to look for clear and trustworthy solutions, while at the same time there is a need to leave room for new solutions. Still, within the two-prong approach legislation often deals with issues and situations (e.g., CAs, liability, qualities that focus mainly on certain techniques) that have not yet been determined. 

Finally, both the digital signature approach and the two-prong approach are in many instances focused too narrowly on signatures as such and not on formal requirements as a whole. 

The minimalist approach taken in the UNCITRAL Model Law offers the most sensible solution to legislators wanting to tackle the problem of formal requirements in their legislation. Under this approach, legal requirements of form are generally dealt with in their entirety. Moreover, the minimalist approach allows for different functions which techniques have to fulfil under national legal systems, while creating room for new techniques and adventitious developments. Recent legislative initiatives recognise the advantages of the minimalist approach and have explicitly taken the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce as an example.{{lriiecite|9}}

In the information economy, the possession and safeguarding of ideas are of paramount importance. Ideas themselves are commodities in the information economy. Ideas also provide their owners the competitive edge in the information age. There-ore, it is necessary that a legal regime for the protection of ideas be put in place. The lack of such a legal system will not only stunt growth but also hinder prosperity in the information economy. 

==How is information used in the Internet? ==
Today, the Internet works basically by transmitting data and information between and among networks. Often, the data and information transmitted are compiled and collected by network administrators to establish a profile of the users. This profile will then be used to tailor-fit products and services for the customers, as well as predict their buying and spending patterns. There are also cases when the data collected are sold to or shared with other companies. These are often large corporations dependent on a revenue stream that consists, at least in part, of personal consumer data. Nearly every modern company in the world today uses personal information, at some level. However, some companies depend on this revenue stream more than others. Among the most well known companies that depend almost entirely on personal information are DoubleClick, which distributes online banner ads, and credit reporting companies such as Equifax and Experian.{{lriiecite|10}}

It is also important to remember that trade in personal information was widespread long before the rise of the Internet. One of the first companies to discover the value of personal information was the Polk Company, founded in 1870. Polk’s first product was a directory of Michigan-based businesses, organized by railroad station. The idea was to make it easier for consumers who lived near one railroad station to shop near another. In the 20th century, Polk became the country’s leading purchaser of motor vehicle registration records. Polk used the records to contact car owners on behalf of the automotive industry in the event of a safety recall and made profits by combining the make and model of car with census information, and then selling this information to marketers who used it to determine lifestyle, income, and the likelihood of purchasing any given product.

==Is information a property right? ==
Individuals instinctively regard personal information as their individual property and any use thereof without their knowledge and consent as equivalent to “identity theft.” Thus, one school of thought proposes that data or information, specifically personal information, be accorded a corresponding property right and protection so that its use may be granted appropriate monetary value. 

This is fundamentally different from the legal architecture currently in place. At present, privacy is protected by a set of liability rules. A person who invades another’s privacy can be sued. If DoubleClick tracks consumers by installing cookies in their computer storage devices, and if enough consumers feel that their collective privacy has been violated, then DoubleClick may be involved in a class action lawsuit. A property regime, on the other hand, gives control and power to the individual holding the property right, and requires negotiation before transference. In a property regime, the rights holder negotiates a price; in a liability regime, a court does.{{lriiecite|12}} 

A property regime, though contentious, has become more and more appealing given the rampant misuse of personal information in the Web. Treating data as a property right and giving it adequate protection may help solve the problem of abuse. However, it may yet become a source of problems in the future.

==What is a trade secret? ==
A trade secret is any formula, pattern, physical device, idea, process, compilation of information or other information that: 

*Provides the owner of the information with a competitive advantage in the marketplace; and 
*Is treated in a way that can reasonably be expected to prevent the public or competitors from learning about it, except through improper acquisition or theft. 

In the physical world, trade secrets and ideas are revealed, copied by or sold to business rivals, leaving owners with a diminished competitive advantage. The same is true, and probably easier to do, in the Internet. 

===How are trade secrets compromised? ===

Trade secrets can be compromised either through outright theft of the information, or violation of a confidentiality agreement. The former constitutes industrial espionage, which may involve either the old “spy” paradigm or the newer paradigm of the computer hacker. In violations of confidentiality agreements, the obligation of confidentiality that has been breached may be an implied obligation, as with a company employee who is expected not to act against the interests of the company, or an explicit, contractual obligation signed between two companies.{{lriiecite|13}}

===Are there ways of protecting trade secrets? ===

To emphasize the need for confidentiality, and to ensure proof of the existence of such an obligation, it has become customary in most high tech companies to require employees to sign a confidentiality agreement. 

A trade secret owner can enforce rights against someone who steals confidential information by asking a court to issue an order (called an injunction) preventing further disclosure. It can also collect damages for any economic injury suffered as a result of the trade secret’s improper acquisition and use. 

An example of a trade secret violation suit involved Wal-Mart and Amazon.com. In October 1998, Wal-Mart filed suit in Arkansas against Amazon.com “to bring an immediate stop to what appears to be a wholesale raiding of its proprietary and highly confidential information systems by Amazon.com and others through the use of former Wal-Mart associates.” In dismissing the suit, the court said it should have been filed in Washington State, where Amazon is based. 

In January 1999, Wal-Mart again sued Amazon.com and its protégé, Drugstore.com, but this time in a Washington state court. The lawsuit alleged that Amazon hired away 15 key Wal-Mart technology executives for their knowledge of its computerized retailing systems. Amazon’s chief information officer had served as vice president of information systems at Wal-Mart prior to being hired by Amazon in August 1997. In March 1999, Amazon filed a countersuit against Wal-Mart based “in part on unfair competition and intentional interference,” setting up a complex legal Web of lawsuits. The cases were not resolved by the courts as the parties reached a settlement agreement in April 1999.{{lriiecite|14}}

===How is ownership of a trade secret proven? ===

To prevail in a trade secret infringement suit, a trade secret owner must show that the information alleged to be confidential really is a trade secret. Again, a confidentiality agreement is usually the best way to do this. In addition, the trade secret owner must show that the information was either improperly acquired by the defendant (if the defendant is accused of making commercial use of the secret) or improperly disclosed-or is likely to be so-by the defendant (if the defendant is accused of leaking the information). 

===What if the secret is discovered within legal means? ===

However, people who discover the secret independently-that is, without using illegal means or violating agreements or state laws-cannot be stopped from using information protected under trade secret law. For example, it is not a violation of trade secret law to analyze (or “reverse engineer”) any lawfully obtained product and determine its trade secret. 

Some software companies have intentionally revealed their trade secrets to reveal whatever flaws are in them and for other people to offer solutions to these flaws. For example, Netscape published its source code after Netscape discovered that the program had security flaws that could be exploited by hackers or crackers. Netscape developers hoped that by revealing and posting the source code, other software developers can scrutinize it, find out the glitch, and provide patches that Netscape users can then download for free.

==What are business method patents? ==
Business method patents are part of a family of patents known as utility patents that protect inventions, chemical formulas, and other discoveries. A business method is classified as a process because it is not a physical object like a mechanical invention or chemical composition.{{lriiecite|15 }}

In July 1998, a federal court ruled that patent laws were intended to protect any method, whether or not it required the aid of a computer, so long as it produced a “useful, concrete and tangible result.”{{lriiecite|16}}

Some examples of business method patents are: 

*Amazon.com’s famous “1-click” patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411) issued September 28, 1999, is directed to a system and method for placing an order to purchase an item via the Internet. The patent is essentially directed to a methodology whereby information associated with a user is pre-stored by a Web site, and the user may thereafter order items from it with only one click of the mouse on a link associated with the item. 
*Priceline “Reverse Auction” Patent (U.S. No. 5,794,207), for a “method and apparatus for a cryptographically assisted commercial network system designed to facilitate buyer-driven conditional purchase offers.” In October 1999, priceline.com sued Microsoft, accusing Microsoft’s Hotel Price Matcher of infringing its U.S. Patent No. 5,794,207 for reverse auctioning. 
*DoubleClick Banner Ad Patent (U.S. No. 5,948,061), for a “method of delivery, targeting, and measuring advertising over networks.” In November 1999, DoubleClick filed a suit against L90 Inc. in the Eastern District of Virginia for its method of delivering advertising on the Internet. 
*Open Market Electronic Shopping Cart Patent (U.S. No. 5,715,314) for a “network sales system.” 

Business method patents can be used effectively against a major competitor. For example, in December 1999 Amazon.com successfully stopped BarnesandNoble.com from using a one-click shopping system and forced it to adopt a more complicated ordering system.

==What are the requirements for acquiring a patent? ==
The US courts have since mandated that the Patent Office grant patents on business methods that satisfy the three-pronged test for patentability. That is, the invention must be: 

#Useful. A business need only demonstrate that its method or software provides some concrete tangible result. For example, the Amazon 1-Click patent provides a tangible result-an expedited purchase. 
#New. The method or software must be novel. This means it must have an aspect that is different in some way from all previous knowledge and inventions. 
#Non-obvious. The method or software must be non-obvious, meaning that someone who has ordinary skill in the specific technology cannot easily think of it. For example: An economist devised a method of avoiding taxes by using a credit card to borrow money from a 40l(k) fund. The method did not exist previously and differed substantially from previous methods of avoiding taxes. Since the method was new and was not obvious to accountants or tax experts, the economist acquired a patent for it (U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,803).

==What is the impact of the Internet on intellectual property? ==
The borderless character of the Internet, particularly electronic commerce, raises questions regarding the continued applicability of traditional legal systems in the enforcement of intellectual property laws. As discussed previously, traditional legal systems are based on notions of sovereignty and territoriality. In contrast, the Internet largely ignores distinctions based on territorial borders. Thus, the Internet has been described as “the world’s biggest copy machine.” 

Given the capabilities and characteristics of digital network technologies, electronic commerce can have a tremendous impact on the system of copyright and related rights, and the scope of copyright and related rights in turn can have an effect on how electronic commerce will evolve. If legal rules are not set and applied appropriately, digital technology has the potential to undermine the basic tenets of copyright and related rights. In the Internet, one can make an unlimited number of copies of programs, music, art, books and movies virtually instantaneously, and without a perceptible degradation of quality. In fact, there is practically no difference between the original and the copy. And the copies can be transmitted to locations around the world in a matter of minutes. The result could be a disruption of traditional markets for these works. 

==How vulnerable is digital work to copyright infringement? ==
The digitalization of copyrighted works has made them more vulnerable to piracy. Because they hardly cost anything, downloading and pirating just about any available software, electronic books, or music from the convenience of one’s home computer is often irresistible. 

This is cause for concern because e-commerce often involves the sale and licensing of intellectual property, and its full potential will not be realized if intellectual property products are not effectively safeguarded. Content providers and other owners of intellectual property rights will not put their interests at risk unless appropriate regimes-at the international and national levels-are in place to guarantee the terms and conditions under which their works are made available. 

The music and movie industry has initiated copyright infringement actions against the use of mp3, a compression technology, which compresses music so it may not be as bulky to download. Aside from its successful action against Napster, a recent decision barred a site (2600.com) from distributing software to de-scramble DVD codes. In the latter case, a suit was filed against 2600.com centering on the site’s practice of posting software that de-scrambles the code meant to prevent DVDs from being copied and linking to more than 500 other sites worldwide that make similar software available. The judge ruled against 2600.com, saying that “the plaintiffs have been gravely injured because the use of the program threatens to reduce the studio’s revenue from the sale and rental of DVDs and thwarts new, potentially lucrative initiatives for the distribution of motion pictures in digital form, such as video-on-demand via the Internet.”{{lriiecite|17}}

In May 2002, Audiogalaxy.com, a Napster-like clone that has facilitated and encouraged the unauthorized trading of millions of copyrighted songs, was taken to court by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Music Publishers Association, Inc. (NMPA) for wholesale copyright infringement.{{lriiecite|18}} Less than a month after the lawsuit, Audiogalaxy.com settled and agreed to a “filter-in” system that requires the consent of the songwriter, publisher and/or recording company before a song can be shared over the Internet.{{lriiecite|19}} 

The music and movie industry have since brought lawsuits against several other similar companies, including Kazaa BV, Grokster Ltd. and Streamcast Networks Inc.

==What is “copyleft”? ==
'''Copyleft''' is “a copyright notice that permits unrestricted redistribution and modification, provided that all copies and derivatives retain the same permissions.”{{lriiecite|20}} Copyleft is a method for making a program “free software”. Free software allows the user to run, copy, distribute, study, change or improve the software. Accordingly, it gives the user the freedom to: (1) run the program for any purpose; (2) study how the program works and makes it conform to the user’s needs; (3) redistribute copies to other users; and (4) improve the program and release such improvements to the public.{{lriiecite|21}}

==What is “GPL”? ==
GPL stands for General Public License. While licenses for most software prohibit sharing and program alteration, a GPL software gives the user the freedom to share and change it. Under a GPL, the user is free to receive or request the source code, change the program or use such program, or portions of it, into an improved or altogether new free software. A GPL software, however, is subject to the condition that the enjoyment of the right to share and change is passed on to subsequent recipients {{lriiecite|22}} or users.

==What are the key issues in intellectual property rights protection in the Internet? ==
The most fundamental issue is the determination of the scope of protection in the digital environment-that is, how rights are defined, and what exceptions and limitations are permitted. Other important issues include how rights are enforced and administered in this environment; who in the chain of dissemination of infringing material can be held legally responsible for the infringement; and questions of jurisdiction and applicable law. 

==Are there international initiatives to protect intellectual property in the Internet? What Internet-specific treaties are in place? ==
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), through its 179 member States, has assumed responsibility for the formulation of a legal and policy framework at the international level to encourage the creation and protection of intellectual property. Its ultimate goal is to achieve an appropriate balance in the law, providing strong and effective rights, but within reasonable limits and with fair exceptions. Since trade in copyrighted works, performances and phonograms has become a major element of global electronic commerce, rights-holders should be legally secured in their ability to sell and license their property over the Internet subject to appropriate limitations and exceptions to safeguard public interest uses. 

WIPO administers {{lriiecite|23}} international treaties dealing with different aspects of intellectual property protection. 

Under the Berne Convention, the most important international copyright convention, copyright protection covers all “literary and artistic works.” This term encompasses diverse forms of creativity, such as writings, both fiction and non-fiction, including scientific and technical texts and computer programs; databases that are original due to the selection or arrangement of their contents; musical works; audiovisual works; works of fine art, including drawings and paintings; and photographs. Related rights protect the contributions of others who add value to the presentation of literary and artistic works to the public, namely, performing artists, such as actors, dancers, singers and musicians; the producers of phonograms, including CDs; and broadcasting organizations. 

Likewise, in 1996 WIPO concluded two treaties: the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT). Commonly referred to as the “Internet treaties”, these seek to address the issues of the definition and scope of rights in the digital environment, and some of the challenges of online enforcement and licensing. The WCT and the WPPT also clarify the extent of rightsholders’ control when works, performances and phonograms are made available to the public for downloading or access on the Internet. This type of transmission differs from broadcasting, in that the material is not selected and delivered by an active transmitter like a broadcaster to a group of passive recipients. Rather, it is transmitted interactively, that is, on demand from the individual users, at a time and place of their choosing. The treaties require that an exclusive right be granted to control such acts of “making available”, while leaving it to individual countries to decide how to classify this right under national law. 

The treaties came into effect in March and May 2002, respectively. The provisions of both treaties were adopted by consensus by more than 100 countries, and thus represent broad international agreement regarding the appropriate approach to copyright in the digital environment. They are useful today as a guide and as a model for national legislation. In order for the treaties to be truly effective in cyberspace, they must become widely adopted in countries around the world. WIPO is therefore devoting substantial resources to promoting the treaties and to offering advice to governments on their implementation and ratification.

==Why is there a need for such initiatives? ==
Issues of enforcement and licensing are not new, but they take on added dimensions and urgency when works are exploited on digital networks. In order for legal protection to become meaningful, rights-holders must be able to detect and stop the dissemination of unauthorized digital copies, which is accomplished at levels of speed, accuracy, volume and distance that in the past were unimaginable. In addition, for electronic commerce to develop to its full potential, workable systems of online licensing in which consumers can have confidence must evolve.

      <comment>/* When and how can disputes over domain names arise? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{LRIIE}}

==What are domain names? ==
Domain names provide the address of companies in the Internet and are equivalent to the business address in the physical world. As more and more companies use the Internet, the number of disputes arising from the use of domain names is increasing as well. 

Domain names are divided into hierarchies. The top-level of the hierarchy appears after the last dot (.) in a domain name. In “microsoft.com”, the top level domain name is .com, the most common top-level domain name, indicating that the domain name is owned by a commercial enterprise. Other common top-level domain names are .org (for non-profit organizations), .net (for network and Internet related organizations), .edu (for four-year colleges and universities), and .gov (for government entities). 

Aside from these generic domain names, each country has a unique top-level domain name. For instance, .ca indicates a domain in Canada, and .ie indicates an Irish domain. 

==When and how can disputes over domain names arise?== 
The disputes that arise over domain names involve “second level” domain names, which refer to the name directly to the left of the top-level domain name in an Internet address. For instance, in the address “www.microsoft.com”, the second level domain name is Microsoft. 

Two identical second level domain names cannot coexist under the same top level domain. For example, even though both the Delta Faucet Company and Delta Airlines would like the “delta.com” domain name, only one Delta company can have delta.com. Unfortunately for the Delta Faucet Company, that Delta company is Delta Airlines. Therefore, Delta Faucet Company must use deltafaucet.com. 

Some well publicized examples of domain name disputes are: 

*mcdonalds.com - This domain name was taken by an author from Wired magazine who was writing a story on the value of domain names. In his article, the author requested that people contact him at ronald@mcdonalds.com with suggestions on what to do with the domain name. In exchange for returning the domain name to McDonalds, the author convinced the company to make a charitable contribution. 
*micros0ft.com - The company, Zero Micro Software, obtained a registration for micros0ft.com (with a zero in place of the second ‘o’), but the registration was suspended after Microsoft filed a protest. 
*mtv.com - The MTV domain name was originally taken by MTV video jockey, Adam Curry. MTV at first showed little interest in the domain name or the Internet. But when Adam Curry left MTV, the company wanted to control the domain name. After a federal court action was taken, the dispute was settled out of court. 
*taiwan.com - The mainland China news organization Xinhua was allowed to register the domain name taiwan.com, to the disgust of the government of Taiwan.

==Who controls the registration of domain names? How are disputes resolved? ==
Prior to December 1999, a company called Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) was almost solely responsible for the registration of second level domain names for the most popular top-level domains, including .com, .net, and .org. NSI dictated the policy on domain name registration and had a great deal of control over how domain names were registered, and how disputes would be resolved. To avoid having to arbitrate in disputes, NSI adopted a first-come, first-served arrangement. Under this scheme, NSI would not question an applicant’s right to have a particular domain name. If the domain name was available, the applicant was given the name. 

This policy has now been replaced with the Uniform Domain Names Disputes Resolution Policy created by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and used by all accredited registrars. Under this new policy, a trademark owner can initiate a relatively inexpensive administrative procedure to challenge the existing domain name. In order to prevail, the trademark owner must show that: 

#the trademark owner owns a trademark (either registered or unregistered) that is the same or confusingly similar to the registered second level domain name; 
#the party that registered the domain name has no legitimate right or interest in the domain name; and 
#the domain name was registered and used in bad faith. 

Those disputing the grant of a domain name can go to the courts for this purpose. In the United States, the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in November of 1999 made it easier for individuals and companies to take over domain names that are confusingly similar to their names or valid trademarks. However, they must establish that the domain name holder acted in bad faith. 

One portion of this Act is related to famous individuals. This portion allows individuals to file a civil action against anyone who registers their name as a second level domain name for the purpose of selling the domain name for a profit. Take the case of the domain name juliaroberts.com. An individual who intended to sell it later to actress Julia Roberts registered the name. Citing bad faith on the part of the registrant, the court ruled that the domain name be transferred to its rightful owner.

==Is there an international organization that can arbitrate disputes? ==
WIPO has set up an Arbitration and Mediation Center, described by its Web site as “internationally recognized as the leading institution in the area of resolving Internet domain name disputes”. Since December 1999, the Center has administered proceedings in the generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) .com, .org, .net. 

Following ICANN’s decision of 16 November 2000 to admit seven new gTLDs, WIPO has been working with the operators of the new gTLDs to develop domain name dispute resolution mechanisms for their domains. The Center has also been designated to provide dispute resolution services for these domains. 

In addition, the Center administers dispute procedures in a number of country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs), such as .ph for Philippines or .th for Thailand.

Advances in information technology and data management offer the promise of a new and prosperous cyberspace-based economy. New communications and information systems allow organizations to gather, share and transmit growing quantities of information with unprecedented speed and efficiency. But this technology also poses a serious threat to privacy. Private individuals and organizations now have the access, means, methods and tools to encroach into the privacy of another-and in a manner that is not so obtrusive. 

==What is information privacy? ==
Of utmost importance is information privacy, “individual’s claim to control the terms under which personal information-information identifiable to the individual-is acquired, disclosed and used.”{{lriiecite|23}} 

Disclosural privacy is similarly defined as “the individual’s ability to choose for him/ herself the time, circumstance, and extent to which his/her attitudes, beliefs, behavior and opinion are to be shared with or withheld from others.”{{lriiecite|24}}

==Why protect privacy? ==
The right to privacy is fundamental to any democratic society. The slightest apprehension on the part of a person using the Internet about who will see his personal information and how it will be used would by itself mean that he has lost a basic freedom. Moreover, the more others know about the details of a person’s life, the greater their opportunity to influence, interfere with, or judge the choices the person makes. 

Having knowledge and control of how personal information is provided, transmitted and used is the key to protecting privacy 

==Is there such a thing as protecting privacy too much? ==
Foremost among the arguments used against the adoption of a stringent information disclosure regime is that it would ultimately hinder commerce. To require an individual’s prior consent before personal data can be elicited may actually hamper the growth of commerce that is largely based on a “better information equals better markets” theory. If the markets can profile their consumers accurately, a better match between interested buyers and sellers can be made. 

Another argument is the need for truthfulness. The ethical or legal duties of disclosure inherent in a relationship command an openness that information privacy prevents.{{lriiecite|25}} 

===What challenge does the protection of privacy pose? How can proper use of information be assured? ===

Finding a balance between the legitimate need to collect information and the need to protect privacy has become a major challenge. The following OECD guidelines may be considered as fundamental requirements for the proper use or processing of information online: 

*Information Privacy Principle. Personal information should be acquired, disclosed, and used only in ways that respect an individual’s privacy. 
*Information Integrity Principle. Personal information should not be improperly altered or destroyed. 
*Information Quality Principle. Information should be accurate, timely, complete and relevant for the purpose for which it is provided or used. 
*Collection Limitation Principle. Personal data should be obtained by lawful and fair means, and where appropriate, with the knowledge and consent of the data object. 
*Purpose Specification Principle. The purposes of data at the time of its collection should be specified. 
*Security Safeguards Principle. Personal data should be protected by reasonable safeguards against risks like loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data. 
*Openness Principle. There should be a policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data. 
*Accountability Principle. A data controller has the responsibility to comply with measures based on the foregoing principles.

==Are there other existing guidelines for data protection? ==
The European Union has issued Directive 95/46/EC, which establishes a regulatory framework to guarantee free movement of personal data, while giving individual EU countries room to maneuver with respect to how to implement the Directive. Free movement of data is particularly important for all services with a large customer base and dependent on processing personal data, such as distance selling and financial services. In practice, banks and insurance companies process large quantities of personal data, inter alia, on such highly sensitive issues as credit ratings and credit-worthiness. If each Member State had its own set of rules on data protection (for example on how data subjects could verify the information held on them), cross-border provision of services, notably over the information superhighways, would be virtually impossible and this extremely valuable new market opportunity would be lost.

The Directive also aims to narrow divergences between national data protection laws to the extent necessary to remove obstacles to the free movement of personal data within the EU. As a result, any person whose data are processed in the Community will be afforded an equivalent level of protection of his rights, in particular his right to privacy, irrespective of the Member State where the processing is carried out.{{lriiecite|26}} 

==How can consumers be protected in electronic commerce transactions? ==
In December 1999, the OECD issued the Guidelines for Consumer Protection in the Context of Electronic Commerce to help ensure protection for consumers when shopping online and thereby encourage: 

*fair business, advertising and marketing practices; 
*clear information about the identity of an online business, the goods or services it offers and the terms and conditions of any transaction; 
*a transparent process for the confirmation of transactions; 
*secure payment mechanisms; 
*fair, timely and affordable dispute resolution and redress; privacy protection; and consumer and business education.{{lriiecite|27}} 

:'''Box 1.OECD Guidelines on Consumer Protection '''
{{TextBox|
A. TRANSPARENT AND EFFECTIVE PROTECTION 

:Consumers who participate in electronic commerce should be afforded transparent and effective consumer protection that is not less than the level of protection afforded in other forms of commerce. 

B. FAIR BUSINESS, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PRACTICES 

:Businesses engaged in electronic commerce should pay due regard to the interests of consumers and act in accordance with fair business, advertising and marketing practices. 

C. ONLINE DISCLOSURES 

:I. INFORMATION ABOUT THE BUSINESS 

:Businesses engaged in electronic commerce with consumers should provide accurate, clear and easily accessible information about themselves sufficient to allow, at a minimum: 

:II. INFORMATION ABOUTTHE GOODS OR SERVICES 

:Businesses engaged in electronic commerce with consumers should provide accurate and easily accessible information describing the goods or services offered; sufficient to enable consum-ers to make an informed decision about whether to enter into the transaction and in a manner that makes it possible for consumers to maintain an adequate record of such information. 

:III. INFORMATION ABOUTTHE TRANSACTION 

:Businesses engaged in electronic commerce should provide sufficient information about the terms, conditions and costs associated with a transaction to enable consumers to make an informed decision about whether to enter into the transaction. 

:IV. CONFIRMATION PROCESS 

:To avoid ambiguity concerning the consumer’s intent to make a purchase, the consumer should be able, before concluding the purchase, to identify precisely the goods or services he or she wishes to purchase; identify and correct any errors or modify the order; express an informed and deliberate consent to the purchase; and retain a complete and accurate record of the transaction. 

:V.PAYMENT 

:Consumers should be provided with easy-to-use, secure payment mechanisms and information on the level of security such mechanisms afford. 

Dispute resolution and redress 
:Consumers should be provided meaningful access to fair and timely alternative dispute resolution and redress without undue cost or burden. 

Privacy 
:Business-to-consumer electronic commerce should be conducted in accordance with the recognized privacy principles set out in the OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flow of Personal Data (1980), and taking into account the OECD Ministerial Declaration on the Protection of Privacy on Global Networks (1998), to provide appropriate and effective protection for consumers. 

Education and awareness 
:Governments, business and consumer representatives should work together to educate consumers about electronic commerce, to foster informed decision-making by consumers participating in electronic commerce, and to increase business and consumer awareness of the consumer protection framework that applies to their online activities. }}

==How will the OECD guidelines be used? ==
The OECD Guidelines are designed to be a technology-neutral tool to help governments, business and consumer representatives by providing practical guidance to help build and maintain consumer confidence in electronic commerce. The Guidelines address the principal aspects of business-to-consumer electronic commerce and reflect existing legal protections available to consumers in more traditional forms of commerce. They stress the importance of transparency and information disclosure and the need for cooperation among governments, businesses and consumers at the national and international levels. 

The Guidelines are intended to provide a set of principles to help: 

*Governments - as they review, and (if necessary) adapt, formulate and implement consumer policies and initiatives for electronic commerce. 
*Businesses, consumer groups and self-regulatory bodies - by providing guidance on the core characteristics of consumer protection that should be considered in the development and implementation of self-regulatory schemes. 
*Individual businesses and consumers - by outlining the basic information disclosures and fair business practices they should provide and expect online.

==What about jurisdiction and consumer redress? ==
The OECD Guidelines discuss at length the issues related to jurisdiction, applicable law and access to redress. Because of the broad and horizontal nature of these issues, questions about how they might best be addressed within the context of electronic commerce are not unique to consumer protection. However, the Internet’s potential to increase the number of direct business-to-consumer cross-border transactions makes it important that consumer interests be fully taken into account. 

The language on jurisdiction and applicable law within the Guidelines reflects the complexity and the current lack of international consensus on these issues. The Guidelines recognize that all business-to-consumer cross-border transactions are subject to the existing framework on jurisdiction and applicable law, but that electronic commerce poses certain challenges to that framework. The Guidelines call for further work in addressing these issues and ensuring that consumer interests are given appropriate consideration as the jurisdictional framework for electronic commerce evolves. 

The Guidelines also focus particular attention on the importance of providing consumers with access to fair, timely and inexpensive means for redress, and encourage the development of effective alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms. Taking legal action to resolve a consumer dispute is generally an expensive, difficult and time-consuming process for everyone involved. These are problems that could be amplified in the event of cross-border disputes. As in other forms of commerce, the development and promotion of ADR can help to avoid more formal and costly legal options. Responding to consumer complaints quickly, easily and fairly, and establishing affordable and effective online dispute resolution mechanisms can go a long way toward building consumer confidence and trust. 

==Should the government be involved in consumer protection and privacy? What role can the private sector play? ==
In the end, the issue of consumer protection and privacy is a concern of both the government and the private sector. Government must ensure that there are adequate laws that offer protection to consumers; the private sector must implement meaningful, user-friendly, self-regulatory privacy regimes. Until users are confident that their communications and data are safe from interception and unauthorized use, they are unlikely to routinely use of the Internet for commerce. Only with consumer trust can we make e-commerce work.

==Is crime possible in the Internet? ==
The Internet has the potential to be one of humankind’s greatest achievements. Telecommunications, banking systems, public utilities, and emergency systems rely on the network. But there are those who use it to inflict harm on others. In the short life of the Internet, we have already seen a wide array of criminal conduct. Although it is often difficult to determine the motives of these digital outlaws, the result of their conduct threatens the promise of the Internet by reducing public confidence and consumer trust in the whole system.{{lriiecite|28}} 

The threat of growing criminal conduct in the Internet is such that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has taken the unprecedented step of making the fight against cybercrime and cyber terrorism the bureau’s No. 3 priority, behind counterterrorism and counterintelligence. In addition, the FBI has changed its hiring practices to focus on recruiting a new type of agent that can bring a bedrock of experience from the world of IT.{{lriiecite|29}}

==What are computer crimes or cybercrimes? ==
“Computer crime” or cybercrime refers to a misdeed involving the use of a computer. Cybercrimes can be divided into three major categories: cybercrimes against persons, property and government. 

Cybercrimes against persons include transmission of child pornography, harassment with the use of a computer such as e-mail, and cyber stalking. 

Cybercrimes against property include unauthorized computer trespassing through cyberspace, computer vandalism, transmission of harmful programs, and unauthorized possession of computerized information. Hacking and cracking are among the gravest of this type of cybercrimes known to date. The creation and dissemination of harmful computer programs or viruses to computer systems is another kind of cybercrime against property. Software piracy is also a distinct kind of cybercrime against property. 

A distinct example of cybercrimes against government is cyber terrorism, in which cyberspace is used by individuals and groups to threaten governments and to terrorize the citizens of a country. This crime may take the form of individuals “cracking” into a government or military-maintained Web site.{{lriiecite|30}}

==What are examples of common misdemeanors on the Internet? ==

#Mail bombing involves the sending of messages to a target recipient repeatedly. The mailboxes of the recipients are then flooded with junk mail. 
#Spamming is often used as a tool for trade or promotion. It targets multiple recipients and floods selected mailboxes with messages. 
#List linking involves enrolling a target in dozens-sometimes hundreds-of e-mail listings. 
#Spoofing is faking the e-mail sender’s identity and tricking the target recipient into believing that the e-mail originated from the supposed mail sender. 
#Linking/Framing involves displaying one’s site content on another’s Web page without permission. 
#Denial of Service (DoS) is an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. 
#Cracking is the act of gaining unauthorized access to a system and subsequently destroying or causing damage thereto. 

In cyber stalking the “victim” is repeatedly flooded with messages of a threatening nature.

==What is the reach of cybercrimes? ==
Crimes in cyberspace do not respect geographical boundaries or national jurisdictions. If left unchecked or unpunished, cybercrimes will adversely affect the growth of e-commerce. In addition, there is the rapid migration of real-world crimes such as child pornography, fraud, forgery, falsification, intellectual property theft, theft of information and money, as well as grave threats, to the virtual world. 

==What legal policies should be in place for the prevention, apprehension and prosecution of cybercrimes? ==
Legal provisions on theft or stealing need to be reviewed. In many jurisdictions, or in the real world, stealing or theft refers to taking a thing or depriving the victim of ownership thereof. What happens when a person accesses without authorization another person’s file and then proceeds to copy it? In this case, it may be argued that theft did not occur because the thing was simply copied, not taken. Making things even less clear is a case in the US where it was held that the law pertaining to inter-State transportation of stolen property refers only to corporeal things and does not apply to intangible property.{{lriiecite|31}}

The US Department of Justice has classified the challenges to international as well as State prosecution of cybercrimes into three categories: 

#Technological challenges - While it is possible to trace an electronic trail, the task has become very difficult because of the skill and technology that allow near-absolute anonymity for the cyber-culprit. 
#Legal challenges - Laws and other legal tools to combat crime lag behind the rapid changes afforded by technology. 
#Resource challenges - These refer to the problem of lack of sufficient experts, or the lack of an adequate budget for new technologies as well as for the training of personnel.

==What is being done to prevent and/or prosecute cybercrimes? ==
The United States Congress passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 USC 1030); 18 USC 2701 which punishes unlawful access to stored communications; 18 USC 2702 which prohibits divulging to any person the contents of a communication while in electronic storage; and 18 USC 2703 which allows government disclosure of the contents of electronic communications but only upon valid order of a court pursuant to a warrant. 

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the US Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act. This is a comprehensive legislation aimed specifically at countering the threat of terrorism, including cyber terrorism. The new law gives sweeping powers to both domestic law enforcement agencies of the US Government and US international intelligence agencies to help thwart terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act expands all four traditional tools of surveillance-wiretaps, search warrants, pen/ trap orders and subpoenas-to make it easier for US law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. For instance, the US government may now spy on Web surfing of Americans by merely telling a judge that the spying could lead to information that is “relevant” to an ongoing criminal investigation. 

The Patriot Act likewise made two changes on how much information the government may obtain about users from their ISPs. First, Section 212 of the law allows ISPs to voluntarily hand over all “non-content” information to law enforcement with no need for any court order or subpoena. Second, Sections 210 and 211 expand the records that the government may seek with a simple subpoena to include records of session times and durations, temporarily assigned network addresses, means and sources of payments, including credit card or bank account numbers.{{lriiecite|32}}

==Are there intergovernmental efforts at combating cybercrimes? ==
The 41-nation Council of Europe has approved a Convention on Cybercrime. The treaty provides for the coordinated criminalization of the following: 

#Offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems, such as illegal access, illegal interception, data or system interference, and illegal devices; 
#Computer-related offenses like computer-related forgery and computer-related fraud; 
#Content-related offenses like child pornography; and 
#Copyright-related offenses. 

The Treaty also urges its members to enter into cooperative efforts, through mutual assistance, extradition agreements and other measures, in order to combat cybercrime. The call for international cooperation is important given the fact that cybercrimes do not respect State, sovereign or national borders. 

Similarly, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has endorsed the following action items to combat the growing threat of cybercrime: 

*immediate enactment of substantive, procedural and mutual assistance laws relating to cyber security; 
*making cybercrime laws as comprehensive as those proposed in the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention; 
*assistance between and among the economies in developing threat and vulnerability assessment capabilities; 
*security and technical guidelines that can be used by governments and corporations in their fight against cybercrime; and 
* outreach programs to economies and consumers regarding cyber security and cyber ethics. 

The member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to create an ASEAN Network Security Coordination Center that will help combat cybercrimes and cyber terrorism. Computer emergency response teams (CERTs) will also be established in each ASEAN country to serve as early warning systems against viruses. The ASEAN nations will likewise focus on strengthening their respective ICT infrastructure to attract more investors.

==Are there anti-cybercrime efforts in developing countries? ==
In the Philippines, the E-commerce Act also penalizes hacking or cracking, as well as the introduction of viruses. 

Malaysia’s Computer Crimes Act of 1997 penalizes unauthorized access to computer material, unauthorized access with intent to commit an offense, unauthorized modification of the contents of a computer, and wrongful communication. 

The Computer Misuse Act of Singapore criminalizes unauthorized access to computer material, access with intent to commit or facilitate an offense, unauthorized modification of computer material, unauthorized use or interception of computer service, unauthorized obstruction of use of computers, and unauthorized disclosure of access code. 

In India, the Information Technology Act of 2000 prohibits tampering with computer source documents and hacking. 

==What lies ahead in the fight against cybercrimes? ==
It is thought that the best tool against cyber attacks and cybercrimes is still prevention. Available to many corporate users are a host of technologies that prevent, if not minimize, the occurrence of these attacks. Some of these are firewalls, encryption technologies, and public key infrastructure systems. 

Aside from legislation, adequate resources must be provided to law enforcement agencies so that they can acquire the tools, equipment, and know-how necessary for the successful defense of network systems from cyber attacks. Laws to combat cybercrimes are useless if law enforcement agencies do not have the education and training necessary to even operate a computer. Judges, too, must be trained. 

In addition, consultation, coordination and cooperation between and among governments and the private sector are important, in order to harmonize as completely as possible measures, practices, and procedures that will be utilized in combating this problem. Harmonization of laws at the international, regional and national levels is necessary to meet the challenges of a worldwide technology and its accompanying problems. 

==Who should be involved in preventing cybercrimes? ==
Security and privacy are not the responsibility of governments alone. There is a need for the private sector to implement user-friendly, self-regulatory policies. 

Governments will have to work with industry and other cybercrime advocates to develop appropriate solutions to cybercrime concerns that may not be addressed adequately by the private sector. 

An overarching task is to increase awareness at every level of society-in government, in the private sector, in civil society, and even among individuals-of the need for, and the goals of, security, privacy and cybercrime prevention and control. Also needed is awareness of the crimes that are committed in cyberspace and the possible measures against them. Finally, and perhaps most important, it is vital that we develop a social consensus about the proper and ethical use of computers and information systems.

==How are governments approaching content regulation? ==
Many governments around the world have sought to address the problems posed by materials on the Internet that are illegal under their offline laws, and those considered harmful to or unsuitable for minors. The nature of material of principal concern has varied substantially, from political speeches, to material promoting or inciting to racial hatred, to pornographic material. 

Government policies concerning censorship of the Internet may be grouped into four categories: 

#Government policy to encourage Internet industry self-regulation and end-user voluntary use of filtering/blocking technologies. This approach is taken in the United Kingdom, Canada, and many Western European countries. It also appears to be the current approach in New Zealand where applicability of offline classification/censorship laws to Internet content seems less than clear. In these countries, laws of general application apply to illegal Internet content such as child pornography and incitement to racial hatred. It is not illegal to make content “unsuitable for minors” available on the Internet, nor is access to the same controlled by a restricted access system. Some governments encourage the voluntary use and ongoing development of technologies that enable Internet users to control their own, and their children’s, access to content on the Internet. 
#Criminal law penalties (fines or jail terms) applicable to content providers who make content “unsuitable for minors” available online. This approach is taken in some Australian State jurisdictions and has been attempted in the USA. In these countries, in addition, laws of general application apply to content that is illegal for reasons other than its unsuitability for children, such as child pornography. 
#Government-mandated blocking of access to content deemed unsuitable for adults. This approach is taken in Australian Commonwealth law (although it has not been enforced in this manner to date) and in China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, among others. Some countries require Internet access providers to block material while others allow only restricted access to the Internet through a government-controlled access point. 
#Government prohibition of public access to the Internet. A number of countries, like China, either prohibit general public access to the Internet, or require Internet users to be registered/licensed by a government authority before permitting them restricted access.

==Do developed countries regulate Internet content? ==
Yes. The Internet censorship regime in Australia consists of legislation at both Commonwealth and State/Territory Government levels. The Commonwealth regime is a complaints-based system and applies to content hosts, including ISPs, but not to content creators/providers. Content hosts are required to delete Australian hosted content from their server (Web, Usenet, FTP, etc.) that is deemed “objectionable” or “unsuitable for minors” on receipt of a take-down notice from the government regulator. The law does not require ISPs to block access to content hosted outside Australia. Instead, the ABA notifies filtering/blocking software providers of content hosted outside Australia to be added to their blacklists. Australian Internet users are not required by law to use blocking software. In addition, State and Territory criminal laws apply to content providers/creators. These laws enable prosecution of Internet users who make available material that is deemed “objectionable” or “unsuitable for minors”. The detail of the criminal offence provisions is different in each jurisdiction that has enacted or proposed laws of this nature. 

Recent regulatory activity in France concerning illegal material on the Internet has focused on enforcing French laws prohibiting race hate material. In May 2000, a French judge ruled that USA Yahoo! Inc must make it impossible for French users to access sites auctioning race hate memorabilia. Yahoo! said it is technically impossible for it to block Internet users in France from seeing Nazi-related content on its USA Web site and that its French site complied with France’s laws prohibiting advertising Nazi memorabilia. In November 2001, a US District Court ruled that Yahoo! does not have to comply with the French court’s order concerning access to its USA site. The Court ruled that the USA First Amendment protects content generated in the US by American companies from being regulated by authorities in countries that have more restrictive laws on freedom of expression. 

In the mid-1990s, German ISPs blocked access to some Internet content outside Germany containing material that is illegal under German laws of general application, particularly race hate propaganda and child pornography. In July 2000, it was reported that the German government had ceased trying to bar access to content outside Germany but police would continue to aim to stop illegal “homegrown” material. In 2001 and 2002, German authorities issued take-down notices to a number of Web hosts in the USA which refused to comply. The Ministry for Families, Seniors, Women and Children continues to issue take-down notices to foreign Web hosts under the “Act of the Dissemination of Publications and Other Media Morally Harmful to Youth” in relation to offshore sites that contain material “harmful to youth”. The Ministry claims jurisdiction over Web sites worldwide that contain “pornographic, extreme violence, war-mongering, racist, fascist and/or anti-Semitic content”. The notices require the Web host (as opposed to the Web site owner or content provider) to either remove the material or subject it to an age-verification system based on, for example, credit card checks.

==What are the British and American approaches to Internet censorship?== 
The United Kingdom has not enacted censorship legislation specific to the Internet and appears to have no intention of so doing. In September 1996, a non-government organization named the UK Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) was established by ISP associations to implement proposals for dealing with illegal material on the Internet, with particular reference to child pornography. The IWF was established after the London Metropolitan Police sent a letter to all ISPs on August 9, 1996 requesting them to censor Usenet news groups or else police would find it necessary to prosecute ISPs in relation to illegal material made available via their systems. 

The IWF operates a hotline to enable members of the public to report child pornography or other illegal material on the Internet. When the IWF receives a report, it reviews the material and decides whether it is potentially illegal. It then tries to determine the origin of the material and notifies the UK police or appropriate overseas law enforcement agency. It also notifies UK ISPs that they should take the material down from their servers; if they do not, they risk prosecution. 

In February 2002, the IWF announced it would henceforth also deal with “criminally racist content” and that the Home Office had provided IWF with “an extended guide to the application of the [UK] law to racism on the Internet-’Racially Inflammatory Material on the Internet’”. 

In 1996, the United States government began the push for Internet censorship when it passed into law the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which criminalized the sending of anything “indecent” over the Internet. In June 1996, a Philadelphia court struck down the CDA as unconstitutional as it went against the free speech guarantee. The Court ruled that the Internet is a “free marketplace of ideas” and should not be treated like television. One of the judges wrote, “...the Internet may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation. The Government may not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation. As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion.”{{lriiecite|33}} 

Another failed Internet content regulation legislation is the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), a US federal law passed in December 2000 that ties crucial library funding to the mandated use of blocking programs on Internet terminals used by both adults and minors in public libraries. A federal court decisively rejected the CIPA on the ground that blocking programs cannot effectively screen out only material deemed “harmful to minors”. The court called the software a “blunt instrument”, adding that “the problems faced by manufacturers and vendors of filtering software are legion”.{{lriiecite|34}} 

The 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington and the presumed use of the Internet by terrorists to contact each other and prepare the operation resulted in the imposition of tough security measures and strict regulation of the Internet. A few hours after the attacks, FBI agents visited the head offices of the country’s main ISPs, including Hotmail, AOL and Earthlink, to confiscate details of possible e-mail messages between the terrorists. The monitoring of data on the Internet was legalized on October 24, 2001 with the enactment of the USA Patriot Act. This anti-terrorist measure confirmed the authority already given to the FBI to install the Carnivore program on an ISP’s equipment to monitor the flow of e-mail messages and store records of Web activity by people suspected of having contact with a foreign power. This requires only the permission of a special court.

==Which developing countries regulate Internet content? ==
In September 1996, China reportedly banned access to certain Web sites by using a filtering system to prevent delivery of offending information. The banned sites included Western news outlets, Taiwanese commentary sites, anti-China dissident sites, and sexually explicit sites. A study by the Harvard Law School found that China has the most extensive Internet censorship in the world, regularly denying users access to 19,000 Web sites that the government deems threatening. The study, which tested access from multiple points in China over six months, found that Beijing blocked thousands of the most popular news, political and religious sites, along with selected entertainment and educational destinations. China also does not allow users to connect to major Western religious sites. News media sites are also often blocked. Among the sites users had trouble reaching in the test period were those of National Public Radio, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and Time magazine. 

In Saudi Arabia public access to the Internet has been funnelled through a single government-controlled center since February 1999, when Internet access was first made available. From this center, the government blocks access to Internet content deemed unsuitable for the country’s citizens, such as information considered sensitive for political or religious reasons, pornographic sites, and the like. According to a report in The New York Times on November 19, 2001, over 7,000 sites are added to the blacklist monthly and the control center receives more than 100 requests a day to remove specific sites from the blacklist-many because they have been wrongfully characterized by the US commercial blocking software used. 

The Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) has regulated Internet content as a broadcasting service since July 1996. Under a Class Licence Scheme, Internet Content Providers and ISPs are deemed automatically licensed. Licensees are required to comply with the Class Licence Conditions and the Internet Code of Practice, which includes the definition of “prohibited material”. Briefly, “prohibited material” is that which is deemed “objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national harmony, or is otherwise prohibited by applicable Singapore laws.” The SBA has the power to impose sanctions, including fines, on licensees who contravene the Code of Practice. 

The SBA takes a light-touch approach in regulating services on the Internet. For example, licensees found to be in breach of regulations will be given a chance to rectify the breach before the Authority takes action. Users in Singapore have access to all material available on the Internet, with the exception of a few high impact illegal Web sites, and Internet content is not pre-censored by SBA; nor are ISPs required to monitor the Internet. SBA is concerned primarily with pornography, violence, and incitement of racial or religious hatred. SBA’s purview covers only the provision of material to the public. Private communications, such as email and Internet Relay Chat between two individuals or parties, are not covered.

==Are there countries that do not regulate content? ==
In August 1998, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) called for public discussion on what role-if any-it should have in regulating matters such as online pornography, hate speech, and “Canadian content” on the Web. Subsequently, in May 1999, the CRTC issued a media release titled “CRTC Won’t Regulate the Internet”. It states, among others, that “[a]fter conducting an in-depth review, the CRTC has concluded that the new media on the Internet are achieving the goals of the Broadcasting Act and are vibrant, highly competitive and successful without regulation. The CRTC is concerned that any attempt to regulate Canadian new media might put the industry at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace.” 

Likewise, as of this writing, Denmark has no law making it a criminal offense to make material unsuitable for minors available on the Internet. Nor is there any proposal to create such a law. Discussion regarding protection of minors is unfolding primarily around the issue of filtering at public libraries. 

Similarly, the “new media” (Internet) in Norway is not regulated by law. Instead the efforts are toward informing the public of the developments in the Internet through the Norwegian Board of Film Classification, which every now and then publishes reports concerning technological advancements and their social impact. 

==Is regulating the Net similar to regulating the telephone, radio or TV? ==
No. Government involvement in radio and television is based on the “scarcity” doctrine, which holds that government censorship of content is justified by the government’s role in assigning broadcast frequencies on a scarce spectrum. The Internet, on the other hand, is not a “scarce” resource as anyone can attach a computer to it without the government’s permission. Nor is it a government-licensed common carrier like a phone company. Moreover, the regulations that have been held constitutional for telephone, radio and TV merely seek to shift (“channel”) explicit speech to a time or place where children cannot access it, but not to ban such speech entirely. 

==Is censorship of the Internet the answer? ==
The Internet is the fastest growing and largest tool for mass communication and information distribution in the world. It can be used to distribute large amounts of information anywhere in the world at a minimal cost. The problem is that information may be “good” or “bad.” In the last 10 years, there has been increasing concern about damaging Internet content, including violence and sexual content, bomb-making instructions, terrorist activity, and child pornography. 

What then? Should governments step in to filter information? Or should individuals be allowed to determine for themselves what is harmful? The question is not easily answered as it involves striking a delicate balance between the individual’s freedom of expression and information and a State’s right to prevent what it considers harmful to its subjects. 

Table 2 sums up the two positions on censorship of the Internet. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Censorship !! No Censorship
|-
|Despite the generally prevailing principle of freedom of speech in democratic countries, it is widely accepted that certain types of speech are not given protection as they are deemed to be of insufficient value compared to the harm they cause. Child pornography in the print or broadcast media, for instance, is never tolerated. The Internet should be no exception to these basic standards. Truly offensive material such as hardcore pornography and extreme racial hatred are no different simply because they are published on the World Wide Web as opposed to a book or video.
|Censorship is generally an evil and should be avoided wherever possible. Child pornography is an extreme example and there is already sufficient legislation to deal with those who attempt to produce, distribute or view such material. Other forms of speech may well be truly offensive but the only way a society can deal with them is by being exposed to them and combating them.  Otherwise, these groups will merely go underground.
|-
|Censorship is tailored to the power of the medium. Accordingly, there is a higher level of censorship attached to television, films and video than to newspapers and books. This is due to the recognition that moving pictures and sound are more graphic and powerful than text and photographs or illustrations. There is also normally more regulation of videos than cinema films because the viewer of a video is a captive audience with the power to rewind, view again, and distribute more widely. The Internet, which increasingly uses video and sound, should be attached the same level of power and regulated accordingly.
|The distinction between censorship of the print and broadcast media is becoming increasingly irrelevant. It is quite possible that in 10 years time people will be entirely reliant on the Internet for news and entertainment. The reason why the print media is comparatively unregulated is that medium is the primary means of distributing information in society. For this reason, the Internet must be granted the same protection. When the founding fathers of the US constitution spoke of the freedom of the press, they were concerned about the primary and most powerful organ of the media at that time, the print press. Nowadays they would more likely be concerned with preventing censorship of the broadcast media and the Internet, which are our prime means of distributing information.
|-
|That it is hard to censor the Internet does not mean we should not seek to do so, it is extremely difficult already to prevent the sale of snuff movies or hard core pornography but governments do so because it is deemed to be of societal importance. A more relevant difficulty is the anonymity provided by the Internet, which gives pornographers and criminals the opportunity to abuse the medium. Asian countries have experimented with requiring citizens to provide identification before posting content on to the Internet. Such a system, if universally adopted, could be a relatively simple way of enforcing laws against truly offensive and harmful content.
|Even allowing for the extreme problems surrounding freedom of speech, Internet censorship would be more or less impossible. Governments can attempt to regulate what is produced in their own country but it would be impossible to regulate material from abroad. What is the point in removing all domestic reference to hardcore pornography in the USA when it is possible to access such material from the United Kingdom or Sweden? It is also possible for citizens to produce material and store it in an overseas domain, further complicating the issue. True freedom of speech requires anonymity in some cases to protect the author. The governments that have introduced ID requirements for Internet use also deny many basic rights to their citizens. The Internet allows citizens to criticize their government and distribute news and information without reprisal from the State. Such a system clearly could not survive with ID requirements.
|-
|In many countries there are multiple liabilities for production of slanderous material and material that incites racial hatred. Where the author or publisher cannot be traced or are insolvent the printers can be sued or prosecuted in some circumstances. The relatively small number of ISPs should be made liable if they assist in the provision of dangerous and harmful information such as bomb making instructions, hard core pornography, and the like.
|ISPs are certainly the wrong people to decide what can and cannot be placed on the Internet. There is already far too much control of this new technology by big business without also making them judge and jury of all Internet content. In any case, the sheer bulk of information ISPs allow to be published is such that vetting would be more or less impossible. Were there is liability for allowing such material to be displayed, ISPs would inevitably err on the side of caution to protect their financial interests. This would result in a much more heavily censored Internet.
|-
|The issues at stake in this debate-protection of children, terrorist activity, crime, racial hatred, etc.-are all international problems. If a global solution is required, then it can be achieved by international cooperation and treaties. It is acknowledged that it is justifiable to censor where harm is caused to others by the speech, words or art of an author. All the examples cited above are clearly causing harm to various groups in society. By a combination of the initiatives listed above, it is possible to limit that harm. 
|Many ISPs have shown themselves to be responsible in immediately removing truly offensive content where they have been alerted to it. What is required is self-regulation by the industry recognizing their responsibility to Internet users but not imposing arbitrary and draconian restrictions upon its use. It is already possible for parents to use “Net nanny” browsers that will edit out offensive and inappropriate material for younger users.

==What about self-regulation? ==
Self-regulation is less costly than traditional command-and-control regulation. First, command-and-control rules are unsuited to the rapid changes of technology in the innovation age. Second, with self-regulation authorities need not drastically expand their enforcement mechanisms. From the standpoint of participants in markets, whether industry or consumers, self-regulation might arise as a natural outgrowth of consumer demand. This “bottom-up” process is voluntary and likely to be highly decentralized. 

==How can self-regulation be made effective?== 
Codes of conduct should be adopted to ensure that Internet content and service providers act in accordance with principles of social responsibility. These codes should meet community concerns and operate as an accountability system that guarantees a high level of credibility and quality. For instance, as part of codes of conduct, Internet providers hosting content have an obligation to remove illegal content when they are informed that such content exists. The procedure for giving notice and take-down should be indicated. 

A service provider may include in its contracts with users and content providers terms that allow it to comply with its legal obligations and protect it from liability. It is in the best interest of industry to take on such responsibility since it enhances consumer confidence and is ultimately good for business. 

To be effective, codes of conduct must be the product of and be enforced by self-regulatory agencies. Such agencies must be broadly representative and accessible to all relevant parties. Subject to a process of acquiescence by public authorities, they should enjoy certain legal privileges enhancing their functions. Effective self-regulation requires active consumer and citizen consultation by such agencies. Without user involvement, a self-regulatory mechanism will not accurately reflect user needs, will not be effective in delivering the standards it promotes, and will fail to create confidence.

==Is there a role for government under a regime of self-regulation? ==
Self-regulation cannot function without the support of public authorities. The support can be in the form of simply not interfering with the self-regulatory process, or endorsing or ratifying self-regulatory codes and giving support through enforcement. 

There are clearly limits to what can be achieved by self-regulation. It alone cannot guarantee that child pornographers are caught and punished. However, self-regulatory mechanisms can help ensure that criminals do not use the Internet with impunity. Governments should, through education and public information, raise awareness among users about self-regulatory mechanisms such as the means to filter and block content and to communicate complaints about Internet content through hotlines. 

For governments, the emphasis should be on achieving regulatory efficiency by allowing business to take on as much of the task as possible. After all, business has a strong interest in creating trust across the whole spectrum of users and providers of services. 

But where should the dividing line between business self-regulation and government regulation be drawn? Clearly, governments must ensure that the law is respected in cyberspace, to protect intellectual property and stop criminal abuse, for example. Business accepts the key role of governments in establishing Internet policy and is no less determined that the Internet should not become a free-for-all. In general terms, business urges governments to leave untouched those areas where there is no clear evidence that business conduct will have a negative effect on society or on the fundamental rights of individuals.

==What about empowering the end-users? ==
Filtering technology can empower users by allowing them to select the kinds of content they and their children are exposed to. Used wisely, this technology can help shift control of and responsibility for harmful content from governments, regulatory agencies, and supervisory bodies to individuals. Thus, there is need for an improved architecture for the rating and filtering of Internet content. An independent organization that will provide a basic vocabulary for rating and oversee updates to the system at periodic intervals is needed. 

A good filtering system realizes several important values: end user autonomy, respect for freedom of expression, ideological diversity, transparency, respect for privacy, interoperability and compatibility. Moreover, the system must feature a user-friendly interface that encourages actual use of its features and makes choice a real possibility for the vast majority of end users. Third parties should be encouraged to develop and provide free filters. Industry should promote the availability and use of filtering systems, educating consumers about how to filter and making it easy for parents, teachers, and other concerned adults to choose, install and adapt filters to their set of values. Regulatory requirements for service providers to screen or filter content should be avoided. Government or regulatory agencies may supply filters but should not mandate their use. 

Likewise, there is a need for technical and organizational communication devices to ensure that users can respond to content on the Internet that they find to be of substantial concern. These “hotlines” ensure that, where necessary and appropriate, effective action can be taken to remedy such concerns. The task of evaluating the legality or illegality of specific data is difficult for Internet providers and should, therefore, be integrated into the work of hotlines. In order to function, hotlines need an environment and operational rules that honor their specific task of handling problematic-and perhaps illegal-content. Legislators should formulate minimum require-ments regarding the organizational setup and procedures of hotlines and, in turn, shield them from criminal or civil liability incurred in the proper conduct of their business (“safe harbor”).

==What should be considered when choosing a particular regulatory mechanism? ==
Whatever the approach to content regulation, the important consideration is that regulation must not stifle innovation. It would seem that a hybrid between a government-regulated regime and an industry-regulated regime may be the right combination when dealing with censorship in the information age. 

Because the Internet is global, there is a need for an international network of hotlines governed by a framework agreement containing minimum standards on the handling of content concerns and stipulating mutual notification between hotlines. The hotline in the country where the content is located is asked to evaluate it and to take action. This mechanism results in content providers being acted against only if the material is illegal in the host country. The mechanism also overcomes difficulties in the complex diplomatic procedures necessary for cross-border cooperation of law enforcement authorities. 

In the final analysis, no regulatory mechanism can work independently of an education and awareness campaign. The Internet industry should have a continuous online and offline program to develop general awareness of self-regulatory mechanisms such as filtering systems and hotlines. Schools should provide the necessary skills for children to understand the benefits and limitations of online information and to exercise self-control over problematic Internet content. The Internet is itself a process, an enormous system for change and response, feedback and transformation. Like the Internet, the legal system and regulatory mechanisms around it must incorporate similar practices of learning and changing.{{lriiecite|35}}

=== Description ===
# On '''one''', hop on the balls of both feet, and then bend the knees and descend into a grand plié.  Thighs should not touch calves.  Knees should be extended as far to sides as possible.
# On '''two''' hop lightly on the ball of the left foot, remaining in the plié, and raise the right leg forward.  The right leg should be bent and turned so that the heel of the right foot is in front of the left knee.  The toes of the right foot should be pointed downward.

Repeat on the next beat, exchanging working and supporting legs.

# On '''one''', hop on the balls of both feet, and then bend the knees and descend into a grand plié.  Thighs should not touch calves.  Knees should be extended as far to sides as possible.
# On '''two''', quickly rise out of the plié, hop, and land in 2nd position with feet flat on the ground.

Take care not to jump or land on the heels, as this can cause injury.

|-
! Opening Position
| First position.  Step is performed on the balls of both feet.
|}

=== Description ===
# On the first beat, hop on the balls of both feet, and then bend the knees and descend into a grand plié.  Lean onto one hand.
# On the second beat, kick the leg that is on the same side as the supporting hand into the air, holding it straight above the head.  At the same time, bend the other leg so that the foot approaches the knee of the first leg.  The dancer is inverted on the supporting hand.

This step is usually performed as a solo in a Kozak dance or a Hopak.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Muggles' Guide ==

Welcome to Wikibooks and the Muggles' Guide. If you have any questions, please write to me or some of the other big editors on our talk pages. Always remember to follow the [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter#Project_standards|project standards]] when editing. I noticed you started adding explicit numbering to the questions sections of some pages. I also noticed that you started using the correct pound notation, but I wanted to tell you I went back and fixed your earlier edits. Again, if you have questions, just ask. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

=== thanks ===

Thanks! I figured out the numbering earlier today and was going to fix everything this evening, but you're already on top of things. I have a big printout of the guidelines and formatting tips, but I'm definitely still learning how things are done around here. Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong, since I don't want to make extra work for anyone else to fix my mistakes (or for myself, for that matter)! I think the work you and the other editors have put into this project is absolutely amazing, and I hope I can make a positive contribution. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Kelbel|Kelbel]] ([[User talk:Kelbel|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelbel|contribs]]) 02:48, 30 August, 2006 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;

:There is one thing -- I'm not seeing internal links in your summaries. Not a big deal, they can always be added later... but normally we create a link to a character the first time he is mentioned on a page; we create a link to a magical item the first time it is mentioned on a page; and so forth. If you go into any chapter page in the first two books, and edit the chapter summary, you'll see a bunch of links in there that you can use as models. Note that the sixth book, HBP, also has a lot of links, but they almost all seem to point into Wikipedia rather than pointing here into the Mugles' Guide.

:Oh -- and it looks like you've been steaming ahead on the summaries. Good going, mate! [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 23:43, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

=== Umbridge question ===

I'm sorry, but i have to remove the fourth [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge#Questions|question]] (&quot;Why did Umbridge send Dementors after Harry?&quot;). I don't remember this fact having been mentioned anywhere before, and also the section about her role in book 5 doesn't mention even a hint of it... If the whole thing is an interesting idea of yours that you're particularly fond of, you can reword it as &quot;Could it be possible that DU have sent ...&quot; or something. If it's canon, please provide reference. Thank you. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 20:46, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Korean/RWP/Course navigation panel}}

'''Congratulations on your decision to start learning ''Hangeul'', the Korean script!''' You will see that being able to read Korean will baffle your friends and enrich your life. Also, you will no longer be completely illiterate when travelling to Korea.

Even though Korean may look similar to Chinese or Japanese to the uninitiated, it is actually much easier because the characters are a combination of just 24 letters (''[[w:Hangul#Jamo|jamo]]'') and a few simple variations, rather than thousands of drawings to memorize. So even going at a relaxed pace of 4 letters per lesson, you will have learned everything you need to read Korean after just a few lessons, compared with the years of training required to master the Japanese or Chinese scripts!

==First letters==
First we will learn the Korean letters (''[[w:Hangul#Jamo|jamo]]'') for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

===B===
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅂ (''bieup'')
| image=ㅂ (bieup) stroke order.png
| sound=Voiced bilabial plosive.ogg}}
{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅂ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Voiced bilabial plosive|[b]]] or [[w:Voiceless bilabial plosive|[p]]]
|}

The letter [[wikt:ㅂ|ㅂ (called ''bieup'')]] is pronounced somewhat like [[w:Voiced bilabial plosive|the English ''b'' sound]]. It can also sound like [[w:Voiced bilabial plosive|the English ''p'' sound]] but it is [[w:Aspiration (phonetics)|'''not''' aspirated]]. It is said '''without''' a burst of air.  To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, put a hand or a lit candle in front of your mouth and say &quot;pin&quot; ([pʰɪn]) and then &quot;spin&quot; ([spɪn]). You should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with &quot;pin&quot; that doesn't appear with &quot;spin&quot;.

So, ㅂ sounds like the ''b'' in in the English word &quot;'''b'''in&quot; or like the ''p'' in the English word &quot;s'''p'''in&quot;.

===A===
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅏ (''a'')
| image=ㅏ (a) stroke order.png
| sound=Open front unrounded vowel.ogg}}
{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅏ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|[a]]]
|}

The letter [[wikt:ㅏ|ㅏ (''a'')]] is pronounced somewhere between the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;map&quot; and the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot;.

===Combining letters===
To combine them into a complete Korean character, fit them into an imaginary little square box:

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;|ㅂ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;|ㅏ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px&quot; width=30| 바
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''b''
| ''a''
|
| ''ba''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Voiceless bilabial plosive|[p]]]
| [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|[a]]]
|
| [pa]
|}

===Exercise===
The character 바 is the actual spelling of a Korean word.  Can you guess what it means?  Click &quot;▼&quot; below to see the answer.

| answer = 바 (''ba'') is the Korean word for &quot;bar&quot; (that is, a pub or a saloon).  Easy, isn't it?}}

There is a standard way to represent Korean words in the Latin alphabet (the alphabet used to write English), called the [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization of Korean]].  In that system, 바 is represented as &quot;''ba''&quot;.  When there is a difference between the standard romanization and the usual pronunciation of a Korean word, this course shows the standard romanization of Korean characters and words in italics (like ''ba'' for the standard romanization of 바) and the pronunciation in square brackets (like [pa] for the pronunciation of 바).

===N===
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㄴ (''nieun'')
| image=ㄴ_(nieun)_stroke_order.png
| sound=Alveolar nasal.ogg}}
Now, the next important letter to learn is ㄴ (''nieun''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid; padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot;| ㄴ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Alveolar nasal|[n]]]
|}

The letter [[wikt:ㄴ|ㄴ (''nieun'')]] represents the ''n'' sound.

Notice how the letter ㄴ (''n'') combines with the letter ㅏ (''a'') to make the character 나 (''na''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㄴ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅏ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 나
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Alveolar nasal|[n]]]
| [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|[a]]]
|
| [na]
|}

===Exercise===
Try to read and understand the following word:

{{:Korean/Question-answer
| kor = 바나나
| eng = ''ba-na-na'' (transliteration), &quot;banana&quot; — Look it up here: [[wikt:바나나|바나나]] actually means &quot;banana&quot;!
}}

When you think you know the answer, click &quot;▼&quot; above and to the right to see whether you are right.

==Initial consonant placeholder==
{| style=&quot;float:right; clear: both; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|-
| 
|-
| ㅇ (''ieung'') stroke order
|-
| In initial position, ㅇ (''ieung'') is silent.
|}
Every Korean character represents one syllable, and each starts with a space for a consonant. But some syllables start with a vowel, such as the beginning of the Korean greeting &quot;''annyeong haseyo''&quot;. Those syllables use the placeholder [[wikt:ㅇ|ㅇ (called ''ieung'')]] for the initial consonant. It's easy to remember the placeholder because it has zero pronunciation and is written like the number zero (0):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid; padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot;| ㅇ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| Pronunciation:
| (silent)
|}

To make a syllable that starts with a vowel, write the placeholder ㅇ followed by that vowel:

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅇ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅏ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 아
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| (silent)
| [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|[a]]]
|
| [a]
|}

So, the initial consonant placeholder ㅇ (''ieung'') combines with ㅏ (''a'') to make the word [[wikt:아|아]] (''a'', meaning &quot;ah&quot; or &quot;oh&quot;).

===Exercise===

Try to read the following Korean words:

{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 아바 | hint = the name of a popular band
| eng = ''a-ba'' (transliteration), &quot;Abba&quot; }}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 아바나 | hint = the capital of Cuba
| eng = ''a-ba-na'' (transliteration), &quot;Havana&quot;.  It sounds like the Spanish name for the city: ''La Habana''. }}

When you think you know the answer, click &quot;▼&quot; above and to the right to see whether you are right.

==Syllables with a final consonant==
Some syllables end in a consonant, especially when a word has a cluster of two consonants in the middle: one consonant then forms the end of one syllable and the other forms the beginning of the next syllable. Fitting two consonants and a vowel into a little square box is a little trickier. First write the initial consonant and the vowel next to each other as before, then put the final consonant below them. For example:

{|
|- align=center
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅂ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅏ
| rowspan=2 | =&gt;
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 반
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot; colspan=2 | ㄴ
|
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| colspan=2 | ''b a''&lt;br/&gt;''n''
|
| ''ban''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| colspan=2 | [ [[w:Voiceless bilabial plosive|p]] [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|a]] [[w:Alveolar nasal|n]] ]
|
| [pan]
|}

===Exercise===
Can you read the following?

{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 안나 | hint = It's a name.
| eng = ''an-na'' (transliteration), &quot;Anna&quot; }}

When you think you know the answer, click &quot;▼&quot; above and to the right to see whether you are right.

Did you manage to read that? If so, you will soon be able to read Korean fluently.

==End of lesson 1==

This was in fact the hardest lesson of all, because you didn't have any previous knowledge. The next lessons will build on what you learned here and you will find them easier, also because you will be able to practice reading much more once you know a few more letters. If you don't feel overwhelmed right now, you can already continue with [[Korean/RWP/Lesson 2|the next lesson]], where you will learn a few more letters and many more words. Otherwise, please come back to it later.

= Open Sicilian with Nc6 =
4...Nf6 is a move which starts the conventional Sicilian counter attack.The move attacks the e4 pawn - one of the counter attacking themes apart from the traditional Queen side attack and the break through with d5.This move also practically forces 5.Nc3 since all other moves are inferior.Now after 5. Nc3 black no longer has to face the Maroczy bind positions in which White takes control of the d5 square with c4 , making the equalizing try d5 difficult or some times impossible for black to achieve.

      <comment>/* An Example */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Proof by induction''''' is a method of deductive reasoning that produces a fully rigorous mathematical proof:

*'''Step 1''' Prove that the result is true for a starting value, such as n = 1. This is called the basis case.

*'''Step 2''' Assume that the result is true for some value, k

*'''Step 3''' Prove that if it is true for n = k, it is true for n = k + 1.

*'''Step 4''' Conclude that the proposition is true for all positive integers.

Since we have proved the result for a general value, k, then if we prove it for the next value, k+1, we can logically conclude that it will be true for the next value, and the next, and the next, and so on ad infinitum.

== An Example ==

''Prove that the sequence:'' '''1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2'''

'''Step 1:'''
when n =1: LHS = 1, RHS = (1 × 2) / 2 = 1. Therefore, we have proved the hypothesis for one value...

'''Step 2:''' Now let n=k, and prove this.

Let us use the symbol '''s''' to represent the series ''1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k-2 + k-1 + k''

However, '''s''' also represents ''k + k-1 + k-2 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1'' (which is the same series, but in a different order)

If we add the two series together, we get:

 '''2s''' = ''k+1 + k+1 + k+1 + ... + k+1 + k+1 + k+1''
    = ''k(k+1)''
 '''s'''  = ''k(k+1)/2''

'''Step 3:''' Now let n = k + 1:

 ''1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k'' + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.

However, the part in ''italics'' of the above line, is already known. Thus:

        '''s''' + (k + 1)  = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.
 ''k(k+1)/2'' + (k + 1)  = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.

When we expand the left hand side, we get:
 
 1/2k^2 + 3/2k + 1 = 1/2(k^2 + 3k + 2) 
                   = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2   [Q.E.D]

'''Step 4'''
The left hand side of the equation is equal to the right hand side, so therefore we can conclude that, by the principle of mathematical induction, since it is true for n=1, and since if it is true for n=k then it is true for n=k+1, it is true for any positive integer.

(In an exam, don't say Q.E.D; you have to make a coherent sentence that concludes your mathematical proof).

== Another Example ==

''Prove that the sequence:'' '''Σr^2 = n/6(n+1)(2n+1)'''

'''Step 1:'''&lt;br /&gt;

''Prove true when '''n=1'''''&lt;br /&gt;

:'''1^2=1/6(1+1)(2+1)'''
:'''1=6/6'''&lt;br /&gt;

''LHS = RHS therefore true''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Step 2:'''&lt;br /&gt;

''Assume true when''' n=k'''''&lt;br /&gt;

:'''1+4+9+...+k^2=k/6(k+1)(2k+1)'''&lt;br /&gt;


'''Step 3:'''&lt;br /&gt;

''Prove true when '''n=k+1'''''&lt;br /&gt;

:'''1+4+9+...+k^2+(k+1)^2 = (k+1)/6(k+1+1)(2(k+1)+1)'''&lt;br /&gt;

''We have assumed that '''1+4+9+...+k^2 = k/6(k+1)(2k+1)''' is true. So we can now assume that '''k/6(k+1)(2k+1)+(k+1)^2 = (k+1)/6(k+1+1)(2(k+1)+1)''' will also be true. However this time we need to prove it as well. This bit can get confusing, but all we have to rearrange each side so that we can see they are equal.''&lt;br /&gt;


:'''(k+1)/6(k(2k+1)+6(k+1)) =  (k+1)/6((k+1+1)(2(k+1)+1))'''  (LHS: took out a factor of (k+1)/6)(RHS: nothing)
:'''(k+1)/6(2k^2+7k+6)      =  (k+1)/6((k+2)(2k+3)) '''       (LHS: expanded the brackets)(RHS: simplified the brackets)
:'''(k+1/6((k+2)(2k+3))     =  (k+1)/6((k+2)(2k+3))   '''     (LHS: factorized brackets)(RHS: nothing)&lt;br /&gt;


''RHS = LHS therefore true''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Vernon Dursley''''' is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s uncle (Vernon's wife is Harry's mother's sister). He and his wife [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia Dursley]] reluctantly took Harry in as a baby, while they had their own son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. Vernon feels somewhat threatened by Harry's magical abilities and wishes to &quot;stamp it out of him,&quot; to the extent of refusing to allow him to speak of anything even slightly out of the ordinary.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

The first person we actually meet in the series is Vernon Dursley. We follow Vernon as he kisses his wife goodbye in the morning, and as he drives off to his workplace, Grunnings, where he sells drills and yells at people. On his way to work he sees a cat apparently reading a map, and several small groups of people wearing robes, talking excitedly about something. He happens to overhear one of the groups talking about one &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and this worries him to the point that he nearly calls home. He decides, however, that it would not be '''normal''' to phone his wife over such a small occurrence, and decides to wait until he gets home. There, while watching a news report about strange occurrences happening all around Britain, he casually asks the name of Petunia's sister's child. She confirms that he is named Harry Potter, &quot;a dreadfully common name&quot;. Vernon is still worried, and still not daring to show it, when he goes to sleep that night.

We see Vernon some ten years later, sitting at the breakfast table, and doting on his son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. It is Dudley's birthday, and Vernon cheerfully tells him that there are thirty-seven presents there. Dudley is immediately angered: he had thirty-eight the year before. He calms down when Petunia promises him two more. A phone call interrupts them; Petunia reports that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]] has broken her leg and will be unable to take care of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] while everyone else is at the zoo. Petunia and Vernon discuss what to do with Harry as if he was not present in the room, except that when Harry suggests he could stay at home by himself, Vernon dismisses that idea out of hand. Eventually they decide that Harry will have to go to the zoo with them.

On the way to the zoo, Harry mentions that he had dreamed about a flying motorcycle. Vernon, livid, yells at him that there are no such things as flying motorcycles.

Despite Vernon's attempts to keep Harry in the background, Harry has a good time at the zoo, as vendors naturally assume that Vernon will be buying for all three of the boys he has with him. When the glass in front of the snake vanishes, and Dudley falls into the moat, Vernon apparently blames Harry. Once they get home, Vernon, evidently unable to speak, locks Harry back into his cupboard under the stairs, saying he will have no meals. Harry, left to his own devices, plans to sneak out to the kitchen for some food after the Dursleys are all asleep.

Vernon is extremely pleased that Dudley will be attending Smeltings, his old school. In the face of Vernon's obvious and overweening pride, Harry retreats to hide his amusement at Dudley's uniform. It is the same day the the first of Harry's letters arrives. Vernon is apparently appalled when he realizes who has sent the letter to Harry, and immediately sends both Harry and Dudley out of the kitchen. While Harry and Dudley listen at the door, Vernon and Petunia discuss what they are going to do about this letter, eventually deciding to ignore it. However, now knowing that someone knows Harry is in the cupboard under the stairs, that being where it was addressed to, Vernon decides to move him to Dudley's second bedroom, where all Dudley's broken toys are stored.

This turns out to be a less than useful decision, as the letters keep coming. The next day, Dudley announces a second one, addressed to Harry in &quot;''The Smallest Bedroom''&quot;, and Vernon has to fight both Harry and Dudley for it. The next day, Harry gets up early to reach the door before anyone else, and finds Vernon sleeping across the doorway. Three more letters are delivered onto his chest, and he tears them up before Harry's eyes. Vernon, now getting more frantic, nails up the letterbox.

On Friday, twelve more letters for Harry arrive, stuffed in all the cracks around the door, as they can't be put in the letterbox. Vernon, now very jumpy and humming &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot;, seals up all the cracks that letters had come through.

On Saturday, twenty-four more letters arrive, inside the two dozen eggs delivered through the window by the milkman. Vernon, of course, phones the dairy, demanding to know who was responsible for them being there.

On Sunday, an apparently slightly demented Vernon announces that this is his favorite day of the week, because there is no post. Almost as he speaks, a rumbling noise heralds the delivery of what seems to be about a hundred letters, all addressed to Harry, down the kitchen chimney. Vernon throws Harry bodily out of the kitchen, and pulling tufts out of his mustache, tells everyone that they are going away, and to pack some clothes.

Vernon drives them in apparently random directions all day, often turning 180 degrees and going back on his course, all the while muttering something about &quot;shaking them off&quot;. By the end of the day Dudley is howling, as he had missed five television programs, and Vernon had not stopped for food. Eventually they end up at a gloomy hotel on the outskirts of a large city. In the hotel restaurant the next morning, the clerk approaches them, saying that he's got about a hundred letters for Harry Potter at the desk; Vernon rises to take them, and they set off again.

Today, Vernon seems to be madly looking for some place that they can't be reached, stopping and looking around in the middle of a suspension bridge, deep in the woods, but none of these seems correct somehow. Eventually, as night falls, they stop on a seacoast, and Vernon leaves the car. He returns in a short while saying he has found just the place, and points at a hut precariously perched on a rock out in the ocean. He is also carrying a long, thin package, and says he has provisions and a boat to get out there.

Once in the hut, the provisions prove scanty: a packet of crisps (US: chips) and a banana for each of them. With a storm coming on, Vernon seems quite cheerful, thinking nothing could get through to them now. He and Petunia take the bedroom, leaving Dudley on the broken-down couch in the main room, and Harry with the thinnest blanket on the floor.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] arrives, knocking the door down at the height of the storm, Vernon appears, now carrying the contents of the long thin parcel: a rifle. Hagrid bends the rifle into a pretzel and throws it away, and Vernon retreats, though he does retain enough sense to tell Dudley to to eat anything Hagrid offers him. When Harry admits that he knows nothing about Hagrid's world, the Wizarding world, Hagrid turns angrily on Vernon, who, much abashed, subsides into incoherence. Vernon does try a number of times to prevent Hagrid telling Harry about the Wizarding world, and insists that Harry is not going to Hogwarts, but Hagrid overrides him easily. When Vernon angrily protests that he is not going to pay good money to have some doddering old man teach Harry magic tricks, Hagrid angrily warns him not to insult [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], and by way of emphasis gives Dudley a pig's tail. Panicked by this display of magic, the three Dursleys retreat to the back bedroom.

When Harry returns to Privet Drive, Vernon has apparently chosen to ignore him, and so Harry's life is much quieter. As the day of departure comes closer, Harry asks Uncle Vernon if he could get a ride into London to catch his train. Vernon agrees, saying that they had to go into London anyway to get Dudley's tail removed surgically. When Vernon comments sarcastically about Harry's need for a train, Harry says that he has to catch the train at King's Cross Station at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|platform nine and three quarters]]. Vernon seems surprised by this.

The next day, as they reach King's Cross Station, Vernon is uncharacteristically jolly. He even loads Harry's trunk onto a dolly and pushes it into the station. He points out the big signs for platforms nine and ten, and observes that there doesn't seem to be a platform nine and three quarters. He then wishes Harry a happy term, and leaves, laughing. Harry sees the three Dursleys laughing at him in the car as they drive away.

At Christmas, Harry receives a note acknowledging his earlier message – he had written to say he had made it to school – and enclosing his Christmas gift, a 50p piece (about $1 US). The note is signed by Vernon and Petunia. Harry gives the coin to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], who is amazed at the appearance of this Muggle money.

When Harry returns to London on the Hogwarts Express, Uncle Vernon is extremely brusque in his greeting, to the point of shocking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]. As Vernon leaves, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he'll be having some fun with the Dursleys, as they don't know he isn't allowed to practice magic.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry comes down to breakfast, he reminds Dudley to &quot;use the magic word&quot; when Dudley commands him to pass the bacon. This results in Uncle Vernon becoming enraged, as he has forbidden all mention of magic in the house. Harry is briefly amazed to hear Uncle Vernon say that it is a special day, as it is Harry's birthday. It turns out, however, that Vernon is talking about his guests that evening, the Masons, a couple that he is trying to impress, as they could place the largest order of drills Vernon has ever received. Vernon then leads his family in rehearsing what they will be doing, reminding Harry repeatedly that his role is to be upstairs in his room, pretending he is not there. Harry several times has trouble keeping a straight face, as the plans for the evening seem to him to be ludicrously transparent attempts to curry favor.

As the guests arrive, Harry, as ordered, goes to his room, where he finds a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elf]] jumping on his bed. The elf, who introduces himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], apparently feels he is being very disobedient by coming to see Harry, and must punish himself. The resulting noise bring Vernon upstairs to chide Harry, who has managed to hide Dobby when he heard Vernon approaching. When Dobby drops the Dursleys' dessert in the kitchen, Vernon almost manages to calm down his guests; but very shortly after that an owl arrives with a parchment, which it drops on Mrs. Mason's head. Mrs. Mason, who is morbidly afraid of birds, runs screaming from the house, and Mr. Mason follows, saying he will not be dealing with Grunnings.

Furious, Vernon brings the letter to Harry and tells him to read it out loud. It is a warning from the Ministry that Harry has violated the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]] by performing a Hover Charm. Vernon, now knowing that Harry is not allowed to perform magic at Privet Drive until he comes of age, decides to lock him into his bedroom, adding bars across the window for good measure.

When Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]] break Harry out of his room, Harry almost forgets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], who is locked into her cage. Hedwig's loud hoot at being forgotten wakes up the Dursleys, and Vernon rushes into the room, barely catching Harry's foot as Harry is lifted out of the window by the Weasleys' flying Ford Anglia. Vernon tumbles down into the bushes under the window, and Harry escapes in the car.

At Christmas, the Dursleys send Harry a toothpick as a gift.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Somewhat less afraid of Harry having learned that he is not allowed to practice magic at Privet Drive, Vernon has locked all Harry's school supplies away in the cupboard that was previously Harry's bedroom. Harry has used the lock-picking skills he had learned from Fred and George Weasley to get the materials he needs out of the cupboard, and now does his homework by torch (US: flashlight) under his bedcovers at night.

When Harry's Hogwarts letter arrives with the next years' booklist, it contains a permission slip; signed by a parent or guardian, it would allow Harry to visit Hogsmeade on specified weekends. Harry wonders how he will get Uncle Vernon to sign it.

Vernon, the next morning, announces that he is off to the train station to collect his sister, Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]]. Harry receives strict instructions as to how he is to act: be civil to Marge, no discussion of magic, and Harry is to recall that Marge has been told that he has been placed in St. Brutus' Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. As Vernon is leaving, Harry takes him aside and points out that he's going to have a hard time remembering the stuff he's been told he has to remember. Vernon, thinking about how much damage one small slip could do, pales. Harry suggests that if there was something in it for him, he wold be more careful, and asks if Uncle Vernon would be willing to sign his permission slip. Vernon grudgingly agrees that if Harry manages to stay convincing for the full week of Marge's stay, he will sign the permission slip.

The following week is very hard on Vernon, as Marge insists on not only keeping Harry in view so he can't sneak around behind her back, but in insulting Harry and his parents. Vernon is unusually sensitive to Harry's moods, repeatedly trying to distract Marge off subject so that Harry won't get upset and say something that would reveal that he isn't ''normal''. On the last night of her visit, however, Marge insults Harry's father, and Harry loses control, inadvertently causing Marge to inflate like a balloon. Knowing that he is in trouble, Harry hastily retrieves his school supplies, threatening Vernon with his wand when he tries to stop Harry and get him to deflate Aunt Marge, and leaves, dragging his trunk.

When Harry reaches the Leaky Cauldron, he is intercepted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge]], who tells him that Aunt Marge had been punctured and her memory adjusted. He says that the Dursleys are willing to have him back at Privet Drive over the summer if he stays at Hogwarts over Christmas and Easter.

When Harry returns to London after the school year, he tells Vernon that he has met his godfather. When Vernon says he doesn't have one, Harry says he does, his name is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and he's a convicted murderer who is on the run, but he is very interested in Harry's wellbeing and will expect to hear from him over the summer. Vernon turns quite pale at this news.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

The school nurse has sent instructions home with Dudley that he is to be put on a diet, as he is so fat; Vernon's temper has not been improved by Petunia putting the entire family on a diet, to keep Dudley from feeling singled out.

In mid-August, Vernon receives a letter from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], asking if Harry could go to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with her family, as they have tickets. Vernon is disconcerted by the letter, which has aroused the postman's interest because it is totally covered with stamps, except for a small area where Mrs. Weasley has written Vernon's address. Clearly, this is Different, and therefore Bad. The contents of the letter are equally dismaying, because they leave Vernon with a quandary: if he permits Harry to go, then Harry will be doing something he likes, which is clearly bad; however, Mrs. Weasley has also said that he can stay the rest of the summer with her, which would mean that Harry would be out of Vernon's hair a good fortnight sooner than expected. Sensing this indecision, Harry points out that he should get an answer from Uncle Vernon soon, as he is writing to his godfather, and Sirius will want to know where he is and what he's doing. Reminded of Sirius' existence, Vernon backs down from his indignation and gives Harry permission to go.

The Weasleys had said that they would arrive to collect Harry; Vernon wonders how they will arrive, and whether they will be dressed normally or in those robe things. Vernon himself has dressed in his best business suit, to try and intimidate the Weasleys. The time of their scheduled arrival comes, and goes, with Harry looking anxiously outside to see them arrive, when there is a noise from the fireplace: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] has had the Dursleys' fireplace attached to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] for the day, and he, Fred, George, and Ron have all appeared in the Dursleys' walled-up fireplace. Mr. Weasley blows the wall apart magically to get his family out, coating Vernon and Petunia with white dust. Stunned, Vernon and Petunia say nothing, despite Mr. Weasley's attempts at making conversation, while Fred and George go to retrieve Harry's trunk. As he re-enters the fire, Fred drops a bag of toffees, and though he picks most of them up, one is left behind. With all the other Weasleys gone, Harry is preparing to go when Mr. Weasley stops him. He reminds Vernon that Harry is about to leave for several months, isn't Vernon even going to say goodbye? Grudgingly, Vernon says, &quot;Well, goodbye then.&quot; Mr. Weasley is amazed at this brusqueness, but Harry prepares to enter the fire. He is stopped by a gagging noise: Dudley has found and eaten the toffee left by Fred, and it has expanded his tongue to several feet in length. Outraged, Vernon starts attacking Mr. Weasley. As Harry departs, he sees Mr. Weasley destroying the china figurines that Vernon is throwing at him.

At one point, Hermione mentions that the Dursleys would likely be pleased to hear how well he was doing in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. Harry demurs, saying they would be happier if he had managed to get himself killed.

Vernon meets Harry again at King's Cross Station, and is, as usual, surly and untalkative.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Knowing Voldemort is back, Harry is intensely interested in both the Wizarding and the Muggle news, looking for evidence of his return. He cannot watch the Muggle news without being abused by Uncle Vernon, so in order to at least hear the news, in hopes that he will be able to recognize the effects of Dark Magic, he lies in the garden, hidden from the neighbours by the geraniums, listening through the open windows. While he is listening this way, he hears a noise in the street that he recognizes as the sound of someone [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Diasapparating]], and leaps up, wand at the ready, only to crack his head on the window standing open above him. Vernon, discovering him there, pulls Harry in through the window, and then makes conciliatory noises at the neighbours who have looked around at his bellow of outrage, to try and reassure them that there is nothing wrong. Vernon and Harry then have a low-voiced argument, until Harry goes out, in part to investigate the noise he had heard.

Harry later brings a very ill Dudley, who has just been attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], back home. Harry hopes to escape to his room, but Dudley manages to mention Harry, and Vernon calls Harry back into the kitchen. While Vernon and Petunia Dursley confront him about their now-ill son, Harry receives a letter from the Ministry of Magic expelling him from Hogwarts and saying his wand will shortly be destroyed. Harry decides that his only option is to become a fugitive, but before he can get past Uncle Vernon, another owl letter arrives from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], telling him to stay in his uncle's house, not let Ministry representatives break his wand, and not use magic again; Dumbledore is straightening things out. As he must remain in the house anyway, Harry stays at the kitchen table and tries to explain what happened. He insists that he did not use magic against Dudley, that it was the Dementors. When Uncle Vernon asks what Dementors are, Aunt Petunia answers, &quot;they are the guards of the Wizard prison, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].&quot;

Petunia's revelation shocks everyone, including Petunia, who belatedly covers her mouth with her hands, as if realizing she has just said something horribly obscene. Harry is amazed to find himself sitting in Aunt Petunia's antiseptic kitchen, answering questions about the Wizarding world. Meanwhile, another owl arrives from Arthur, and one from Sirius, briefly telling Harry that the situation is being sorted out. Finally, a second owl from the Ministry of Magic arrives revoking his expulsion and wand destruction. Instead, Harry's fate rests on a hearing scheduled for &quot;9 A.M. on August 12th.&quot;

When Harry says Lord Voldemort has returned, Uncle Vernon, recognizing the danger he and his family are in while they house Harry, demands he leave. However, this is interrupted by one final owl carrying a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]]&amp;mdash;surprisingly for Petunia Dursley. A menacing voice reverberates throughout the kitchen: &quot;REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA!&quot; Petunia quickly overrides her husband, insisting that Harry remain at their house, on the grounds that sending him away at this point would make the neighbours talk, but sending him to bed immediately.

Harry is now once again locked in his room, though we don't know whether this is Vernon's decision or Petunia's. Three days later, Vernon tells Harry that he, Petunia, and Dudley have been invited to a Best Kept Suburban Lawn award, and are leaving Harry alone in the house, locked into his room. Harry listens to them leave. Shortly, the Advance Guard arrives to take him away to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix]]. As he is leaving, Harry wonders what Vernon will think when he discovers there is no Best Kept Suburban Lawn competition.

When Harry returns to London for the summer vacation, he finds Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|&quot;Mad Eye&quot; Moody]] who tell Harry they plan to have a stern talk with his aunt and uncle about how they treat him. The whole group confront Uncle Vernon, intimidating him, despite his initial bluster, into making the necessary concessions for Harry's comfort over the summer, and saying that they will be in touch, either by Harry's owl, or in person.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Although [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] had told Harry he would be arriving only two weeks into the summer vacation to take Harry away to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], Harry had not told the Dursleys about it, partially out of fear that it would not actually be happening. So when Dumbledore arrives, the Dursleys are stunned almost to insensibility. Dumbledore makes himself at home, and sweeps the Dursleys into a couch; then offers everyone mead. The Dursleys refuse to acknowledge the mead, despite the animated glasses getting more and more insistent about being taken, to the point that one of them ends up bouncing off Vernon's head and spilling most of its contents as it does so. Dumbledore and Harry, meanwhile, discuss Harry's inheritance; Sirius, it seems, had left Harry the house at Grimmauld Place and all its contents. This catches Vernon's attention: Harry owns a house in London? When, in order to test whether the house actually did pass to Harry, Dumbledore summons the house-elf [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], Vernon and Petunia are both revolted at finding this dirty thing in the middle of their spotless living room.

After Harry had packed for school and brought his trunk downstairs, Dumbledore addresses the Dursleys again, saying that he had expected that the Dursleys would treat Harry as one of their own children, rather than maltreating him as they had. However, Harry had apparently not been as poorly served by the Dursleys as the child between them. Both Vernon and Petunia look around at this, as if expecting someone other than Dudley to be present. Dumbledore then says that Harry must return to Privet Drive next summer, at least briefly, but that his magical protection in that place would end when he reached his majority. When Vernon points out that Harry will only be turning seventeen, not eighteen, Dumbledore says that in the Wizarding world, seventeen is the age of majority. Vernon says that's stupid.

At this point, Harry and Dumbledore leave Privet Drive. As this book ends before Harry returns for the summer, Vernon plays no further part in it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry, assisted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and Arthur Weasley, has been trying to convince Uncle Vernon to accept the offer of a safe retreat for protection from the chance that Voldemort will attack the house at Privet Drive once Harry's protection there ends. Vernon seems quite happy to speak with Kingsley, who he has seen on television in the company of the Prime Minister, but he still doesn't entirely trust Harry or Arthur. He asks Harry at one point why Kingsley cannot be sent to guard them, and Harry does not have an answer. When we first see Vernon in this book, he has just changed his mind again, saying that he will not leave the house because he expects that Harry would immediately try to transfer title to himself. Harry wearily points out that he already owns a house in London, and that there is nothing that would make him want to stay at Privet Drive anyway.

When the members of the Order of the Phoenix who will be traveling with the Dursleys arrive, Vernon is not particularly reassured. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dedalus Diggle|Dedalus Diggle]] is a very short and bouncy man, whose admission that he doesn't understand all the gadgets in a car is worrying to Vernon, and whose watch, alarmingly, talks, saying that they are late. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hestia Jones|Hestia Jones]], while much less flamboyant, also does not seem to impress Vernon. All the same, the three Dursleys and the two wizards all climb into the Dursleys' car, and the last we see of Vernon is him driving away to safety.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Vernon is a narrow minded and often cruel man.  He despises having Harry under his roof and rarely misses a chance to belittle him.  Vernon is fearful of the magical world and considers Harry's wizarding abilities an abnormality that must be suppressed and concealed.  Vernon loses his temper at any mention of the &quot;M&quot; word.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Vernon's relationships with other characters are very different in nature, though apparently uniformly shallow. Toward Harry, we see that Vernon makes no accommodation to Harry's needs, such as refusing to sign a Hogsmeade permission slip in Harry's third year.  Vernon often restricts his nephew to his room for days at a time.  Vernon is verbally, emotionally, and on occasion, physically abusive to Harry. As Harry matures and becomes more powerful as a wizard, Vernon's feelings towards him shift, becoming less authoritarian and more fearful. By the beginning of the sixth book, Vernon is almost as afraid of Harry as he is of any mature Wizard.

Vernon acts completely differently towards his son, Dudley, showering him with gifts and making nearly infinite allowances for his desires. However, one cannot tell whether Vernon's motivation here is affection towards his son, or simply the need to keep up appearances. Fathers love their sons, so Vernon must show the appearance of loving Dudley. He does seem, however, to be genuinely fond of Dudley.

It is hard to determine Vernon's actual feelings, if any, towards his wife, Petunia, or his sister Marge. It could be that all we see is Vernon acting properly to keep up appearances. However, Vernon again makes great allowances for Marge's foibles and her opinions, wincing as Marge puts the saucer down for her dog, and keeping her liquor glass filled in order to attempt to defuse her diatribe against Harry. Towards Petunia, he has the appearance of the dutiful husband, caring for his wife, but with Petunia herself seeming to discourage intimacy, it is extremely hard to determine what feelings, if any, they have for each other.

== Analysis ==

Clearly, the main driving force behind Vernon Dursley is &quot;what other people think.&quot; From the beginning of the first book, it seems that his world image is based on what other people think of him, and he is at great pains to appear &quot;normal.&quot; Because of this, when things that are not normal happen around Harry, Vernon will often punish Harry inordinately. Events at the zoo in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|the first book]] are clearly out of the ordinary, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 3|the punishment Harry receives]], being locked in his &quot;room&quot; under the stairs for several days, is clearly out of line. (One wonders, in fact, how Vernon and Petunia made Harry's extended absence from school on this occasion seem &quot;normal&quot;. We are led to believe that this form of punishment was not uncommon, so the Dursleys may have explained his frequent absences by claiming that Harry was a sickly child.)

Despite being the head of the household where Harry lives, Vernon is clearly not a father figure for Harry. It could be argued that if he is a father figure for his own son, Dudley, he is not a particularly good one; rather than a source of security, Dudley seems to see Vernon as a source of gifts and toys. We find that Harry has somewhat idealized his deceased parents, which of course makes Vernon even less likely to fulfill the role of parent in Harry's mind; rather, he is an oppressive force to be first avoided, then negotiated with, and finally outright defied, as Harry matures.

Vernon's role, then, would largely be one of highlighting how Harry is maturing, as the series progresses. As Harry develops abilities that Vernon will never have, his self confidence increases, as does his willingness to stand up to Vernon for what he wants and needs. In his interactions with Harry, Vernon is handicapped by needing to appear normal to the neighbours, and Harry, as he develops, is able to use this in his dealings with Vernon and Petunia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">FINGERNAILS

The condition of the nail beds has been associated with no fewer than 24 diseases.
Here are some signs to observe:


Curved down at the tip  = associated with respiratory, heart or liver disease

Curved up  = nutritional deficiency esp Iron (koilonychia)

Ridges
 
--transverse (Beau’s lines) = hyperthyroid, also infectious diseases such scarlet fever or typhus
  
--longitudinal = rheumatoid disease 

White lines (Mee’s lines) = heart disease, Hx of fever, arsenic poisoning




Absence of lighter area at base = hypo-thyroidism or cardiac weakness

Enlarged area at base = hyper-thyroidism

Bluish area = Wilson’s disease

Reddish area = Cardiac failure, hypo-thyroid

Entirely white nail (Terry’s nails) = cirrhosis, hypo-albuminemia

Half &amp; half (Lindsay’s nails) = renal disease


Hemorrhages in nail = subacute bacterial endocarditis, trichinosis 

Pitted and discolored = Psoriasis

Crumbling = Onycholysis = fungal infection

Thickened = Onichogryposis = Thyroid toxicosis

&lt;/div&gt;

Welcome back! This is the second lesson of &quot;Learn to read, write and pronounce Korean&quot;.

In the last lesson, you already learned four letters: ㅂ (''bieup''), ㅏ (''a''), ㄴ (''nieun'') and ㅇ (''ieung''). In this lesson, you will learn four new letters.  Combined with the four you already know, they will open up quite a few Korean words to you.

==The consonant ㅁ (''mieum'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅁ (''mieum'')
| image=ㅁ (mieum) stroke order.png
| sound=bilabial nasal.ogg}}
The first new consonant to learn is ㅁ (''mieum''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅁ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Bilabial nasal|[m]]]
|}

ㅁ (''mieum'') is pronounced just like a regular English ''m''. Be careful not to confuse it with 'ㅇ', which doesn't have corners.

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅁ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅏ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px&quot; width=30| 마
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Bilabial nasal|[m]]]
| [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|[a]]]
|
| [ma]
|}

===Exercise===
Try to read the following Korean words that contain the letter ㅁ (''mieum''). Click &quot;Show&quot; to check your answers, as usual. 

{{:Korean/Question-answer 
| kor = 마나마 | hint = the capital city of Bahrain
| eng = ''ma-na-ma'' (transliteration), &quot;Manama&quot;}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer
| kor = 안남   | hint = the name of Vietnam before it became &quot;Vietnam&quot;
| eng = ''an-nam'' (transliteration), &quot;Annam&quot;}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer
| kor = 암만   | hint = the capital city of Jordan
| eng = ''am-man'' (transliteration), &quot;Amman&quot;}}

==The vowel ㅣ (''i'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅣ (''i'')
| image=ㅣ (i) stroke order.png
| sound=Close front unrounded vowel.ogg}}
The first new vowel to learn is ㅣ (''i''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅣ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Close front unrounded vowel|[i]]]
|}

The vowel ㅣ (''i'') looks much like the English letter ''I'' and is pronounced like the ''i'' in &quot;machine&quot;, so it's easy to remember. It also looks similar to the Korean letter ㅏ (''a''), except that the dash to the right is missing. (Note: all Korean vowels are based on long horizontal or vertical lines, most with short dashes attached to them.)

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅁ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅣ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px&quot; width=30| 미
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Bilabial nasal|[m]]]
| [[w:Close front unrounded vowel|[i]]]
|
| [mi]
|}

===Exercise===
Try to read the following Korean words that contain the letter ㅣ (''i''). Click &quot;Show&quot; to check your answers, as usual.

{{:Korean/Question-answer
| kor = 나미비아 | hint = a country in Africa
| eng = ''na-mi-bi-a'' (transliteration), &quot;Namibia&quot;}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer
| kor = 빈나       | hint = the capital city of Austria
| eng = ''bin-na'' (transliteration), &quot;Vienna&quot;}}

==The consonant ㄹ (''rieul'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㄹ (''rieul'')
| image=ㄹ (rieul) stroke order.png
| sound=Alveolar tap.ogg}}
The next consonant, ㄹ (''rieul''), has two different sounds:

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄹ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''l'' or ''r''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Alveolar tap|[ɾ]]] or [[w:Alveolar lateral approximant|[l]]]
|}

ㄹ (''rieul'') is pronounced like [[w:Alveolar lateral approximant|the ''l'' in '''''l'''et'']] or like the [[w:Alveolar tap|the ''r'' in the Spanish word ''á'''r'''bol'']], and is [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transliterated as ''r'' or ''l'']].

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄹ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅏ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 라
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''r''
| ''a''
|
| ''ra''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Alveolar tap|[ɾ]]]
| [[w:Open front unrounded vowel|[a]]]
|
| [ɾa]
|}

===Exercise===
Each of these words has ㄹ (''rieul'').  Translate each word into English.  Click &quot;Show&quot; to check your answers, as usual. 
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 바바라   | hint = a personal name
| eng = (''ba-ba-la'') Barbara}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 이란     | hint = a country in the Middle East
| eng = (''i-lan'') Iran}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 리마     | hint = the capital of Peru
| eng = (''li-ma'') Lima}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 마닐라   | hint = the capital of the Philippines
| eng = (''ma-nil-la'') Manila}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 말리     | hint = a country in Africa
| eng = (''mal-li'') Mali}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 릴       | hint = a big city in France
| eng = (''lil'') Lille}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 마일     | hint = a distance measurement
| eng = (''ma-il'') mile}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 리비아   | hint = a country on the north coast of Africa
| eng = (''li-bi-a'') Libya}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 알바니아 | hint = a country in the Balkans
| eng = (''al-ba-ni-a'') Albania }}

==The consonant ㄱ (''giyeok'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㄱ (''giyeok'')
| image=ㄱ (giyeok) stroke order.png
| sound=Voiced velar plosive.ogg}}
Finally, the consonant ㄱ (''giyeok'') will unlock lots of words to you: 

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄱ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Voiced velar plosive|[g]]] or [[w:Voiceless velar plosive|[k]]]
|}

ㄱ (''giyeok'') is pronounced like [[w:Voiceless velar plosive|the ''k'' in ''s'''k'''y'' or the ''c'' in ''s'''c'''rape'']].  It is [[w:Aspiration (phonetics)|'''not''' aspirated]], so it does '''not''' sound like the ''c'' in '''''c'''ry'' or ''va'''c'''ation''.  Many English speakers liken it more to the ''g'' sound.  It is [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transliterated as ''g'' or ''k'']]. Be careful not to confuse it with &lt;font size=4&gt;ㄴ&lt;/font&gt; (''nieun''). When ㄱ (''giyeok'') is combined with a vowel such as ㅏ (''a'') or ㅣ (''i''), it changes shape slightly:
{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄱ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅣ
| =&gt;
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 기
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''g''
| ''i''
|
| ''gi''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Voiceless velar plosive|[k]]]
| [[w:Close front unrounded vowel|[i]]]
|
| [ki]
|}

===Exercise===
Translate these words with ㄱ (''giyeok'') into English.  Click &quot;Show&quot; to check your answers, as usual.
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 가나     | hint = a country in West Africa
| eng = (''ga-na'') Ghana}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 리가     | hint = a capital of Latvia
| eng = (''li-ga'') Riga}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 기니     | hint = country in West Africa
| eng = (''gi-ni'') Guinea}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 가이아나 | hint = country in South America
| eng = (''ga-i-a-na'') Guyana}}
{{:Korean/Question-answer | kor = 감비아   | hint = country almost completely enclosed by Senegal
| eng = (''gam-bi-a'') Gambia}}

==End of lesson 2==

Very good! You have now learned 8 Korean letters already and the rest won't be difficult either. Feel free to continue with [[Korean/RWP/Lesson 3|the next lesson]].

== Textures in editor don't turn up the same in game ==

Okay, I've recently had to start using the terminal for compiling my maps, and when I tried q3map2 in the terminal, it produced the map, but it also changed how I set the textures in the editor.  A lot of the textures were offset, or scrunched up.  Is there a command to compile and prevent the textures from moving?

Ankylosaurus means 'fused lizard' in Greek. It is one of largest members of a group of armoured dinosaurs. The most common species of Ankylosaurus was Ankylosaurus magniventris. Magniventris means great-bellied.

==What did it look like?==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
''Ankylosaurus'' was heavily armoured.  Its back was covered in thick plates.  Also, there were two rows of spikes along its back and its tail ended in a big bony club.  These features were used as a defence against bigger dinosaurs like ''Tyrannosaurus''.  Its belly was unprotected, but because ''Ankylosaurus'' had a row of spikes on each side, and was very heavy, it was hard to flip it over.  It weighed 3&amp;ndash;4 tons.  It was 25&amp;ndash;35 feet long and 4 feet tall.

==What did it eat?==
''Ankylosaurus'' was a herbivore. This means it only ate plants.

==When did it live?==
''Ankylosaurus'' lived between 68 to 65.5 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period, and was one of the dinosaurs to survive until the [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/K-T Event|K-T mass extinction]]. 

==Where did it live?==
''Ankylosaurus'' lived in woodland with lots of open spaces and clearings, where lots of plant life could be found. They lived in North America but close relatives lived in Asia.

==How was it discovered?==
''Ankylosaurus'' fossils have been found in the continent of North America. They were named in 1908 by a famous fossil-hunter named Barnum Brown. ''Ankylosaurus'' footprints have been found in Bolivia, South America.

==What do we need to learn?==
*Their skin colour.
*Did they travel alone, or in herds?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The obvious goal of the medical exam is to find, define and explain the patient’s problems.  The standardized convention for recording this exam is referred to as a S.O.A.P. note. This stands for '''SUBJECTIVE''' (history), '''OBJECTIVE''' (physical exam and supporting tests), '''ASSESSMENT''' (diagnosis) and''' PLAN''' (treatment).  When the patient &amp;/or the problem is new, the most valuable information will most likely be provided in the History.  At the very least, the history will allow the clinician to get an idea of what is wrong with the patient. It will also allow the clinician to get an idea of what kind of testing should be performed on the patient to determine the injury/illness and what kind of care that the patient should receive.   

Any problem should be defined with as many adjectives as possible.  Every problem should be defined in terms of site, onset, timing (duration, recurrence, periodicity), character (description, severity), exacerbation or relief, associated symptoms and the results of prior treatment attempts.  [see the''' P-Q-R-S-T''' mnemonic.]  When records are available, it is also important to ask about the status (resolution?) of prior known problems. Each problem should be addressed in terms of its Anatomy, Physiology, Etiology and Function. 
      
Most exams begin with documenting the reason that the patient is there at that time: the Chief Complaint.  From there, the examiner can pursue a directed line of questioning concerning the history of this complaint. This is the '''S''' of SOAP and is recorded as such.  This section should be very thorough.
The '''O''' consists of a directed exam and results of indicated tests.  Objective is what the examiner finds.
The '''A''' is the diagnostic conclusion arrived at from the synthesis of the above information.  Sometimes no precise diagnosis can be determined on the spot. In such cases, the A-portion of the record would be a Differential Diagnosis or a list of diagnoses to Rule Out (R/O).  
In such cases, the''' P'''-portion is the list of steps to better define the problem; likely more tests. If the A is a definitive diagnosis, then the P-portion will be the treatment planned. Explain all treatsment to be done. Remember that the plan might change as time goes on. 

The above are the minimum elements of a proper exam and record.  There are times when a more comprehensive approach is called for; at admission to hospital, for example, or at the intake exam for a new patient.

The additional elements of such a comprehensive exam include a Family History of Disease, a Social History (activities, hobbies, alcohol intake, smoking), a list of any known Allergies, prior Hospitalizations and Surgeries and any current medical problems under treatment.         
Occasionally, a history of childhood illnesses and immunizations may be pertinent as well.  An area often overlooked in such history taking is a Work history or Occupation (this might shed light on the Etiology of the problem as mentioned above).   
When the Chief Complaint is of a physical nature as opposed to a disease, a traumatic injury for example, a brief statement as to the circumstances of the injury may prove very useful for record, statistical or even legal purposes.  The statement might read something like “fractured leg, sustained while a passenger in a  vehicle accident.”  Such statements are especially valuable when the injury was sustained on the job. 

When the Physical Exam is a comprehensive one, the examiner should be schooled to proceed in the same manner every time. Each and every area of the body must be observed and properly tested and the results recorded.  If one always does the same exam, then when recording the results, one only need remember the abnormal findings and can safely record all other areas as WNL (within Normal Limits). One normally begins such an exam at the head and works down the body ending at the feet. Depending on personal preference and training, there are some minor exceptions to this head to toe approach.  For example, the examiner might defer the neurologic exam of reflexes in the arms until he reaches the legs and picks up the reflex hammer.  When recording the physical findings, normal values (WNL) should not be overlooked.  They can sometimes be very helpful later in establishing the timing of the onset of a new problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Iguanodonte.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of an Iguanodon.]]

Iguanodon was once the one of the common dinosaurs. It was also one of the earliest dinosaurs to be discovered and named. Its name means Iguana Tooth in Greek.

==What did it look like?==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
''Iguanodon'' was a big dinosaur. It grew to be thirty feet long, 9,000 pounds (3-4 tons), and had a bulky body. Its neck was long and it had a long tail and a beak. The mouth had teeth in the cheeks toward the back and a sharp beak at the front. ''Iguanodon'' usually walked on four legs, but could stand on two if it wanted to reach high. It had four fingers and a bony cone-shaped spike/thumb, which was used for stabbing things that trying to harm the Iguanodon, on its hands. Its hind feet had three toes with hoof-like nails.

==What did it eat?==
''Iguanodon'' was a plant eater. It ate cyads and conifers as well as early flowering plants. It used its teeth to chew its food, one of the first dinosaurs to do so.

==When did it live?==
''Iguanodon'' lived between 130 and 65 million years ago.

==Where did it live?==
Everywhere! Its habitats were: beaches, plains, forests, mountains, deserts and swamps. It lived in North and South America, Asia, [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]], Australia, Belgium, Spain and England.

==How was it discovered?==
A single ''Iguanodon'' tooth was discovered in 1822, one of the earliest dinosaur discoveries. The dinosaur was named ''Iguanodon'' in 1825 by Dr. Gideon Mantell, because its teeth were similar to the modern day iguana.

==Why does it have a spike on its hand?==

''Iguanodon'' had a large spike on both of their hands, where our thumb would be. Originally, it was thought to go on the ''Iguanodon's'' nose, like a rhino horn. Later it was discovered that the spike actually goes on the hand. But what was it used for? Some say it could have been used to defend against attacking predators. Others say that the spike was used in fights when two rival ''Iguanodon'' met.

==What we need to learn?==

*What the spike was used for
*The colour of skin
*How it was so common and adaptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can enyone tell mee more about how this has to be done:
Cut the umbraco_client folder out of your webfolder and place it in the Default Site folder so it is at the same node (gren) as the website itself. (This seems silly but nevertheless necessary to make umbraco run in XP Pro).

      <comment>/* How are fossils formed? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A fossil is the remains of an animal or plant that was once alive but is now dead. When the remains of an animal or plant become a fossil it is called fossilization. 

==How are fossils formed?==
To show you how dinosaurs became fossils, here is a normal fossilization:
*The dinosaur dies and is washed away in a flood. The body is buried in sediment (mud or sand) and eventually the body is covered.
*The soft parts of the body are destroyed leaving only bones. Minerals from the sediment soak into the bones. Very slowly, minerals start to replace the bone. This turns the bones into stone.
*Over millions of years, parts of the rock on the surface wear away. Eventually, the fossil skeleton comes to the surface and is discovered.

==Where are fossils found?==
Fossils have been found all over the world. Places where many fossils are found are called sometimes called 'fossil hotspots'. Famous ones include:
*Ghost Ranch, La Brea Tar Pits and Morrison Formation in the U.S.A.
*Burgess Shale in Canada.
*Messel Shale in Germany.
*The Gobi Desert in Asia.
*The Isle of Wight and London Clay in the U.K.
*The Jurassic Coast in Dorset, U.K.
*Dinosaur Cove in Australia.

==What are trace fossils==
Trace fossils are fossils that are not of the actual body, trace fossils include:
*Fossilized footprints.
*Fossilized eggshells.
*Fossilized nests.
*Fossilized droppings, these are called coprolites.
*Fossilized skeletons of animals.
*Fossilized plants.

==What should I do if I find a fossil?==
It is unlikely that you will find a fossil but it could happen! If you think you've found a fossil then take it to a local museum or college and they can examine and tell you what it is. If you're really, really lucky it might be a new species of dinosaur. They could name it after you! However you should never go around digging up the ground with spades and shovels. Leave it to the experts! When you are an adult you can do this without experts but make sure you check with the police to make sure digging up dinosaur bone without experts is legal in your state/country

      <text xml:space="preserve">Written By Emry:  
At the bottom of the page is a ToDo item saying that we need to explain what an enum is, and how they relate to integers.  Personally I think that we have already explained sufficiently what they are, and can simply add an explanation of their place along side integers.

For all intents and purposes an enum IS an integer. Given the following:

 &lt;code&gt;enum toys { ball=0, truck, car, doll, horse, giraffe };&lt;/code&gt;

Most compilers will treat 1+1, or 1+truck exactly the same. Either way it will either cast to an int as 2, or (toys) as car.
Try feeding an enum to cout.  

 &lt;code&gt;cout &lt;&lt; truck &lt;&lt; endl;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bending''' notes is, without a doubt, the most important technique in harmonica playing. It adds that special bluesy something to your play, and allows you to play semi-chromatically on a normally diatonic instrument - especially in [[Harmonica/Positions#2nd_position|second position]]. 

However, due to the unique, soulful sound generated by bending, you should learn how to bend notes even if you're playing a chromatic harmonica. On a chromatic harmonica, all holes that have [[Harmonica/Anatomy_of_a_Harmonica#Chromatic_harmonica|windsavers]] can bend in both draw and blow; typically, this means all holes except for the higher octaves (hole 8 to 12), which can only draw bend on hole 8-11, and blow bend on hole 12.

On a diatonic harmonica, hole 1-6 can draw bend, and hole 7-10 can blow bend.

A player can bend the pitch of the higher tuned reed down toward the pitch of the lower tuned reed in any given hole. In other words, on a diatonic harmonica, on holes 1 through 6, the draw notes can be bent, and on holes 7 through 10, the blow notes can be bent. Hole 3 allows for the most dramatic bending: On an C harmonica, it is possible to draw bend hole 3 from a B down to a G#, or anywhere in between. The physics of bending are quite complex, but amount to this: the technique &quot;pinches&quot; the air and thus changes the pressure of the airflow.

How to do a bend:
*'''Draw''': This can be done by lowering the jaw, while raising the back of the tongue, focusing the air flow at the back of the tongue. If you want to, let the tip of the tongue touch the spot where the tenon meets the bottom of the mouth cavity.
*'''Blow''': This is done by lowering the jaw, while raising the front of the tongue slightly, focusing the air flow at just slightly behind the teeth.

Bends are essential for blues and rock harmonica due to the soulful sound they add to the instrument - the famous &quot;wail&quot; of the blues harp typically requires bending. Luckily, this can be done on all kinds of harmonicas; as Stevie Wonder has shown, one can even do it on a chromatic harmonica.

Those that want to be able to use any harmonica as a chromatic instrument, should also learn to '''[[Harmonica/Advanced_techniques#Overbending|overbend]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, 

I noticed you were adding &quot;piped&quot; links to chapters (&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Like this|Like this]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). In the future, keep in mind that it's much easier to just add a foreward slash to the end of the chapter name &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Like this/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It does the same thing, and is easier on the fingers. :)

Trouble With Poems





           

Liz and Ashley were on their way to art class 


when they found out about the Poetry contest at 


school in a month. They were excited, they could 


not wait to get to creative writing class that day. 


“Can you believe it?” Liz said “Someone in our 


school will get to go to New York City for the 


state finals!” “ I know, you know that it 


could be it could be you or me that wins! That would be so 


exciting ” Ashley exclaimed excitedly. 


Finely the bell rang and they were off to creative 


writing class. “Now class, most of you know 


already that we are having a poetry contest” 


Mrs. Landing their writing teacher said, “Now I 


would like you to work on a poem for the 


contest, maybe two poems and then you can 


bring them to me so I can help you where you 


need help.” Now Ashley loved to write she was 


very good at it, but today she was having trouble. 


She couldn’t get the right words in it all she 


could come up with was: Love is ever 


enduring. Love is always their. But what 


comes next? She decided that she would work 


on it at home. Besides this was her first poem. 


Later after school, she talked to Liz about the 


poetry contest “Liz have you ever done a poem 


before?” Ashley asked, 
  

   “Well, yes I have, I did one when I lived in Mississippi it 


was about the river Mississippi! Kind of funny isn’t it. Have 


you ever done one?” 


“I’ve never done one before do you think you could help    


me?” Ashley pleaded, “Today in class I couldn’t get it right.” 


“Well I think I could as long as you do the poem that 


you enter, see you tomarrow” 


“Bye Liz” 


Ashley thought about what Liz had said about Ashley 


doing the work, what did Liz think? That she 


would cheat? Well, better get those things off 


her mind she had to baby sit the next-door 


neighbor’s 2-year-old girl.That evening after she 


ate supper she got out her notebook, she had to 


come up with a better poem “Mom?” Ashley 


called through the house “Can you help me with 


my poetry homework? I can’t come up with  a poem 


for the poetry contest next month”


     “Well how about you look online for help, 


that’s what I did in school and I won!”


“Okay I’ll try that, thanks mom” Ashley said. So 


Ashley looked online for tips on writing poems. 


She found some very interesting facts about 


poems. Then she tried a poem again but it 


wasn’t much better than the first try, but at 


least she finished it. The next day she talked to 


her teacher about it “ Mrs. Landing?” Ashley 


asked hoping to find her.


     “What is it Ashley?”


     “I can’t write a poem and you said everyone 


is entering right?”


 “Yes I did, so you’re telling me that you can’t 


Write a poem?”    


“ Well Ashley I know how you 


can do it you see in 2 months are the story book 


contest….” So Mrs. Landing gave Ashley an 


idea… Three week later Mrs. Landing told 


everyone that they had to turn in their poems 


that day and she had them write them out in 


their best handwriting. Ashley had 


gotten inspired by the story she had been writing 


for the storybook contest. She called her poem 


roses. When she turned it in her teacher read it 
 

and she loved it. A week later, a school 


assembly was called it was to announce who 


won the contest first they called the 3rd place, 


then 2nd  went to Liz “And now what you’ve all 


been waiting for the 1st place winner is” Mrs. 


Landing announced “Ashley McRay” A loud 


clapping form the kids at school told Ashley to  


go up and accept her medal. Mrs. Landing told 


her to read her poem:
Roses
Roses pink and white
Roses all in sight
Some are big some are small
But they all have one thing alike


Roses are so beautiful
Roses are so wonderful
Roses are different in many ways
And don’t look all alike


So you ask why I say
They all have one thing alike
So I will tell you if you stay
Their all just the same
Their all just roses 
But different kind I say.




In a few weeks she was on the road to New 


York. In about 2 days she was representing New York at the 


finals in Washington D.C. on May 4 her birthday. Some say 


that she won because it was her birthday or that she cheated 


by copying someone’s poem from another year but, I don’t 


think that do you?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Playing Position==
While traditionally, the harmonica was designed to play mostly the blow notes and major chords, blues musicians had discovered the benefit of using other &quot;positions&quot;, mainly focusing upon the draw notes. The reason for using these position instead of the 1st position is that draw notes are louder, and are easier to [[harmonica/Bending|bend]] to achieve a scale not otherwise available on the harmonica.

There are seven &quot;natural positions&quot; that can be achieved without much bending, with 3 major-based and 4 minor-based positions.

===1st position===
*Major; Tonic notes are located at blow notes 1, 4, 7 and 10.
This is known as Ionian mode, where the notes play is in the original key of the harp; also known as &quot;straight harp&quot;. On a C harp, this will be in C-major, and root chord is the C-major triad. Obviously, it will give the song a major feel. This is suitable for folk and pop tunes.

The melody will repeatedly wind back and resolve on the root note, which in this case is the C note. Also, it's recommend to move to E and G frequently, to emphasize the major triad that make up its core harmonics. Lastly, it is common to precede the root with the seventh note, which is half step lower; in this case, the note is B.

===2nd position===
*Major; Tonic notes are located at draw 2 (also blow 3), blow 6 &amp; blow 9
This is known as Mixolydian mode, also known as &quot;cross harp&quot;, having the feel of major and provide a driving, unsettling quality. On a C harp, this will be in G, and the root chord is the G-major triad. Playing just the unbended notes, the harmonica sounds in the key a fifth above its intended key.

The melody will tend to resolve on the tonic note, particularly the root note; in the case of a C harp, the note is G. Also, the player will frequently precede the root note with the seventh note of the mode; in this case, it will be F. Note that, unlike Ionian mode, the seventh note is a whole step lower. This is known as the &quot;flatted seventh&quot;, which is a key aspect of the blues' tonal quality.

Another important aspect to keep track of is the tritone interval; in this case, it is the interval between F and B; it is the most tense and unstable interval in terms of western music, but most perfect for blues and jazz.

The reason why blues harpists commonly play in second position is that in traditional crossharp, the dominant chord or seventh chord is produced in place of the tonic chord, and in the blues, ''all'' chords are typically played as dominant (seventh or ninth) chords. The player can play slurs or bends around the minor/major third of the scale and around the tritone/fifth of the scale, both of which are vital to many blues compositions. Also, it allows draw bends on the lower octaves, making it suitable for blues or even jazz.

With a minor third (or a blue third), the player can use a C harmonica to play in G mixolydian or G minor. Blues players can also play a tritone in this position. This way, the player can play slurs or bends around the minor/major third of the scale and around the tritone/fifth of the scale, both of which are vital to many blues compositions. 

The tuning of a harmonica played in this style is one fifth above the nominal tuning of the harmonica, i.e. in this instance, a C harmonica is played in the key of G. Therefore, to be in tune with a normal guitar tuning of E, an A harmonica is often used. This is because by playing the C harmonica in G, or an A harmonica in E, the dominant or seventh chord is produced in place of the tonic chord, and in the blues, all chords are typically played as dominant (seventh or ninth) chords.

===3rd position===
*Minor; Tonic notes located at draw notes 1, 4, and 8. 
This is known as Dorian mode, also known as &quot;slant harp&quot;, having the feel of minor, giving it a moody, contemplative quality. In this position, this will be playing the harmonica a full tone above its intended key. On a C harp, this will be in D, with the root chord being D-minor triad. In this case, the seventh note and the third note is a half-step lower than the corresponding note in Ionian mode, which is what make it melancholy and wistful. Likewise, it also allow draw bends. Thus it is most suited for minor-key folk and blues songs.

The scale occurs mainly on draw notes, though once again bends and overblows give players a variety of options. Blues players can achieve a tritone by bending the 6 draw. Starting hole is hole 1 draw or hole 4 draw, depending on the occasion.

This is also the traditional way of playing Blues on Chromatic, providing a ii-minor key.

===4th position===
*minor; Tonic note located in draw 3', 3, 7, and 11
This is known as Aeolian Mode, which is the corresponding minor key to the Ionian mode. In the case of a C harp, it will be in A minor, with root chord of A-minor triad. In addition to 7th and 3rd flatted, it will also have the sixth flatted by half a step. This make it more stately and austere, and good for folk ballads.

===5th position===
*minor; Tonic notes located in blow 2', 2, 6, 10
This is known as Phrygian Mode, which have the feel of a minor key. In the case of a C harp, it will be in the key of E, with its root chord of E-minor triad. It will have 7th, 3rd, sixth and second flatted. What makes it difficult to play is that the lower octave have 3 bends, making it hard to play accurately. This provide a mediterranean feel, especially when the flatted second is emphasized. It is common to waver between the flatted second and the root note.

===6th position===
*minor; Tonic notes located in draw 4', 4, 8, and 12
This is known as Locrian Mode, with a placid, minor feel. On a C harp, this will be in the key of B, with the principle triad of B-D-F, which is a diminished triad.  Note that the outer notes of the diminished triad form a tritone. Problems arise from the fact that it is extremely unstable.

===12th position===
*major; The Tonic notes are draw 2', 2', 6, and 10
This is known as the Lydian mode, and has a major feel. On a C harp, this will give the key of F. It will have a natural seventh, but have a raised fourth, thus forming a tritone with the tonic notes. When playing it, it is a good idea to play the coe major triad of the mode to counter balance the highly emphasized raised fourth. Note that it has lots of bends in the first octave but plays easily in the second and third octave.

On a recent experiment of Lydian mode, I found it is an excellent key for something with rock beat. try playing this sequence: 2, 2+, 1, 2+, and repeat with numerous variance. Fun, huh?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi George,

Do you want help moving [[Music]] to [[Music Theory]]? That seems a very good idea, as [[Music]] should probably redirect to the music bookshelf.

If you see any pages and/or redirects that should just be deleted, let me know on my talk, or tag them for speedy. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)


Hi George, I've been working on the Guitar wikibook lately, and I've noticed how many contributions you have been making. I've been adding some content, but I've also been trying to rearrange some of the content to make it more accessible. Hopefully I've been making good changes, and not editing recklessly.

Since you seem to be a long time contributor, and the most recent bulk contributor, I was wondering what you think about the book right now. I've been looking at the [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kategorie:Lieder German wikibook], and they have a large amount of content that could easily be translated and merged into this wikibook. Generally I was wondering what you think of the book right now, and how you think it could be developed in the future.

If you are interested in bouncing ideas around, or you can think of any other contributors that might be interested in collaborating, please leave me a message. Thanks, --[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 03:57, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

OS X includes a '''bash''', Bourne Again Shell, for taking advantage of its power Unix-like kernel Darwin. The bash shell was developed by Brian Fox in 1987 for the GNU Project, as a free, as in freedom, and improved terminal for using with Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The terminal is used by entering commands and their parameters in the form of text, with output also usually being text based. It's is comparable to Windows' MS-DOS prompt.

'''man &lt;nowiki&gt;[command name]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - Used by entering ''man'' and then the name of the command, who wish to know more about. It then displays the command's ''man page,'' which tells the user exactly what the command does and that additional parameters the user can specify. When it doubt use it!

'''ls''' - Lists the contents of the current directory

'''cd &lt;nowiki&gt;[directory]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - Moves from the current directory to the specified path name. 

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' For users coming from Windows or the Classic Mac OS, path names in OS X are written with a forwards slash between directory names much like a website's url. Also a tilde '~' means /Users/(Home Folder), so you can move from anywhere back to your home folder in terminal by entering ''cd ~'' or do your documents folder by entering ''cd ~/Documents.}} 

'''ps -ax''' - Lists all the current active processes along with their process number

'''kill &lt;nowiki&gt;[number]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - This can be used to force quit any process running on your system by entering the process number obtained by using '''ps -ax'''. Probably not a good idea to use it unless you know what you're quitting. 

'''vi &lt;nowiki&gt;[Filename]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - vi is the standard Unix text editor, however it would take another article to describe all it commands and how to use it. If you don't specify a file name a new file will be created. 

'''pico''' - Another text editor, slightly more user friendly, but not as standard, as vi. 

'''emacs''' - Another 'text editor' emacs has evolved to become almost and operating system in and of itself, again it would take another wikibook to describe all it's features and uses. 

'''tar -parameters &lt;nowiki&gt;[Filename]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - Tar, short for Tape Archive, is a bundling program than can also be used to compress or decompress files. Use -x or -c, as parameters, to extract or create a tar file. Further options can change the name of the tar file and the compression used. 

'''mkdir''' - Creates a new folder

'''rmdir''' - Deletes a folder

'''rm''' - Deletes a file

No problem. I've been speaking hebrew since I was in kindergarten, so I can help out. [[User:Supertik1010|Supertik1010]] 02:33, 31 August 2006 (UTC)


==You're Welcome==

I'm glad you approve of the use of the Hebrew Language template. In addition, you should be aware that ''several'' good Hebrew grammars exist in the Public Domain. You may want to have a look at [http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04344731&amp;id=n3cKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=hebrew+grammar+date:0-1920&amp;as_brr=1 Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar] an excellent Public Domain book on the subject of Biblical Hebrew. You could probably use that as the basis of Free Content to pull from. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wikijeff|Wikijeff]] 02:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

==Learning from you==

I'm actually learning Hebrew from your book and from the information on wikipedia and jewfaq.org, so I won't be able to help a whole lot.  The only edits I've really made for your book are just minor corrections that tend not to even be related to the Hebrew, and if I correct the Hebrew it's after checking like five other sites to make absolutely certain.  I'm going to be borrowing my friend's textbook for her Hebrew 1 class though and I ordered a really basic alephbet book off amazon, so I hope to contribute more in the near future.  Until then, I really appreciate your book, it's really easy to follow and it's been a great help in learning the alephbet! [[User:Jacobroche|Jacobroche]] 01:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

==Hello!==
There you are! Ever since I've started working on the Hebrew wikibook I saw that you were the main contributor, however, your last edit was sometime in late 2007. We need to work together. Now what do you think about my idea (look at my user page)? Ētamš ([[User_talk:Etams|Talk]]  • [[Special:Contributions/Etams|Contribs]]) 19:43, 8 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Etiology==
*Inflammatory condition of extraocular muscles and tissues; thought to be autoimmune
*Frequently associated with hyperthyroidism, but also described in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients
*Histology shows widespread lymphocytic infiltrates, and interstitial edema
*Edema can lead to compression of the optic nerve, decreased visual acuity, reduction in visual fields, and ultimately blindness
*Fibrosis develops over course of 2-5 years, so treatment (including RT) ought to start early


==Treatment Overview==
*Permanent control of hyperthyroidism when present is recommended
*First line: high dose glucocorticoids, with favorable response in up to 60% patients
*Surgery (orbital decompression) or RT can be effective second line therapies


==Systematic Review==
*'''Israel; 2009''' PMID 19491222 -- &quot;Treatment Modalities for Graves' Ophthalmopathy - Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.&quot; (Stiebel-Kalish H, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Jun 2.)
**Meta-analysis. 33 trials, 1367 patients. 
**Meds: Corticosteroids: Intravenous pulsed better than oral. Somatostatin analogs: minor but statistically significant advantage over placebo
**RT: No benefit for orbital RT over sham on clinical activity, superior for diplopial (OR 4.9, SS). Combination corticosteroids + RT significantly better than either treatment alone

==Radiation==
*May be offered to those who are symptomatic and who failed high dose steroids, or are contraindicated for steroids (optic neuropathy or corneal ulceration)
*Most common dose: 20 Gy in 10 fractions, although one study showed better resulst with 10 Gy in 1 Gy/fx, and even 20 Gy in 1 Gy/week x 20 weeks
*Fields: lateral fields with posterior angulation, and lens sparing
*RT may initially increase edema and thus symptoms; patients can be maintained on steroids early in the treatment
*Best benefit of RT is concurrently with corticosteroids
*Side effects (commonly 6 months - 3 years): cataracts, radiation retinopathy, radiation optic neuropathy
*Relative contraindication: Diabetes, and particularly diabetes with HTN due to high rate of retinopathy


===Randomized===
*'''Amsterdam''' 
**'''2004''' PMID 14715820 -- &quot;A randomized controlled trial of orbital radiotherapy versus sham irradiation in patients with mild Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Prummel MF, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004 Jan;89(1):15-20.)
***Randomized, double-blind. 88 patients (44 orbital RT, 44 sham)
***Outcome: RT 52% vs. 27% at 12 months (SS) in improving eye muscle motility and decreasing diplopial. RT group less need for further treatment (SS). But, QOL improvement similar in both groups. Worsening ophthalmopahty simlar (~15%)
***Conclusion: RT effective in mild ophthalmopahty, but no improved QOL or treatment costs
**'''1993''' PMID 8105213 -- &quot;Randomized double-blind trial of prednisone versus radiotherapy in Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Prummel MF, Lancet. 1993 Oct 16;342(8877):949-54.)
***Randomized double-blind. 56 patients with moderaly severe GO. Treated with 1) 3-month oral prednisone + sham RT vs. 2) RT 20 Gy + placebo capsules
***Conclusion: RT and oral prednisone equally effective, but RT better tolerated

*'''Mayo, 2001''' PMID 11535445 -- &quot;A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of orbital radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Gorman CA, Ophthalmology. 2001 Sep;108(9):1523-34.)
**Randomized, double-blind. 42 patients. Moderate, symptomatic Graves ophthalmopathy. Orbit treated with 20 Gy, sham therapy to other side; 6 months later therapy reversed.
**Outcome: No difference at 6 month cross-over. Slight improvement in muscle volume and proptosis in first treated eye at 12 months.

*'''Mainz, 2000''' (Germany) PMID 10634372 -- &quot;Low- versus high-dose radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy: a randomized, single blind trial.&quot; (Kahaly GJ, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2000 Jan;85(1):102-8.)
**Randomized. Euthyroid patients with moderately severe GO. Treated with 1) 20 Gy @ 1 Gy/week over 20 weeks, 2) 10 Gy @ 1 Gy/fx over 2 weeks, or 3) 20 Gy @ 2 Gy/fx over 2 weeks
**Outcomes: response to therapy 67% vs. 59% vs. 55% (SS)
**Conjunctivitis: none vs. 18% vs. 36%
**Conclusion: similar response rates, but 1 Gy/week protocol more effective and better tolerated

*'''Utrecht, 2000''' (Holland) PMID 10801172 -- &quot;Radiotherapy for Graves' orbitopathy: randomised placebo-controlled study.&quot; (Mourits MP, Lancet. 2000 Apr 29;355(9214):1505-9.)
**Randomised double-blind. 60 patients. Moderately severe GO. Treated with 1) RT 20/10 or 2) sham RT
**Outcome: success in 60% RT vs. 31% sham (SS). Improvement in diplopia grade, but no reduction in proptosis or eyelid swelling. Also significant improvement in elevation, but no other variables. But only 25% of RT patients spared from additional strabismus surgery
**Conclusion: RT should be used only for motility impairment

===Retrospective===
*'''Amsterdam, 2004''' (Holland) PMID 15288988 (1982-1993) -- &quot;Orbital irradiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy: Is it safe? A long-term follow-up study.&quot; (Wakelkamp IM, Ophthalmology. 2004 Aug;111(8):1557-62.)
**Retrospective. 157/245 patients treated with 20/10 and/or oral glucocorticoids. Probable retinopathy defined as 1-5 hemorrhages, definite retinopathy &gt;5 lesions. Mean F/U 11 years
**Mortality similar, none from intracranial tumor.
**Retinopathy: possible 15%, definite 3%. Of 23 possible, 22 received RT, 1 steroids. Of 5 definite, all received RT. Diabetes highly associated with retinopathy (RR 21)
**Cataracts: similar ~30%
**Conclusion: orbital irradiation safe, except possibly for diabetic patients

*'''Pisa, 2003''' (Italy) PMID 12915636 (1972-1996) -- &quot;Long-term safety of orbital radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Marcocci C, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003 Aug;88(8):3561-6.)
**Retrospective. 204 patients. Median f/u 11 years
**Cataracts: 10%. No tumors.
**Retinopathy: mild in 14% with diabetes and HTN, 3% with HTN alone, none with DM alone
**Conclusion: Safe, HTN with DM may be a relative contraindication

*'''Sapporo, 2003''' (Japan) PMID 12614743 -- &quot;Effect of steroid pulse therapy with and without orbital radiotherapy on Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Ohtsuka K, Am J Ophthalmol. 2003 Mar;135(3):285-90.)
**Prospective, nonrandomized. 39 patients, high dose steroids +/- RT 24 Gy
**No difference between groups. Both significan improvement in EOM hypertrophy

*'''Mayo, 2002''' PMID 12414422 -- &quot;The aftermath of orbital radiotherapy for graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Gorman CA, Ophthalmology. 2002 Nov;109(11):2100-7.)
**Retrospective. 42 patients. All RT, ~half also decompressed later. 3 year F/U
**If RT only, slight improvement in outcome. 
**Conclusion: Limited evidence for RT benefit in mild-moderate ophthalmopathy

*'''Muenster, 2002''' 1963-78 (Germany) PMID 11777638 -- &quot;A long-term follow-up study after retro-orbital irradiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Schaefer U, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Jan 1;52(1):192-7.)
**Retrospective. 250 patients bilateral ocular RT. Median F/U 31 years
**OS (10 year, 20 year, 30 year): 89%, 68%, 49%; Normal popluation: 92%, 76%, 52%; Cancer specific OS: 98%, 92%, 88%. No radiation-induced cancer deaths evident
**Conclusion: long-term results satisfactory, in a small cohort

*'''Meinz, 2002''' (Germany)(1981-1997) PMID 12548473 -- &quot;[Retrobulbar irradiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy -- long-term results][Article in German]&quot; (Pitz S, Klin Monatsbl Augenheilkd. 2002 Dec;219(12):876-82.)
**Retrospective. 104 patients, 29 RT only, 75 RT + steroids. Mean F/U 40 months
**Clinically no improvement in proptosis, lid signs, and intraocular pressure. Retrobulbar pain improved in 75%; improved motilty in 25%. Surgical decompression in 25% at 1 year
**Conclusion: No treatment-related side effect. Improvement in ocular motility. RT shortens duration of disease, allowing earlier rehabilitative surgery

*'''Stanford, 2001''' PMID 11697323 -- &quot;Long-term results of irradiation for patients with progressive Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Marquez SD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Nov 1;51(3):766-74.)
**Retrospective. 197 patients. RT 20 Gy. Min F/U 1 year, max 29 years
**Outcome: improved soft-tissue 89%, proptosis 70%, EOM dysfunction 85%, corneal abnormalities 96%, sight improved 67%. Time to response &gt;6 months
**Side effects: 12% cataracts (median 11 years)
**Conclusion: safe and effective for progressive Graves</text>

==Federalist No. 21==
Federalist No. 21 is titled ''&quot;Other Defects of the Present Confederation&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''HAVING in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the principal circumstances and events which have depicted the genius and fate of other confederate governments, I shall now proceed in the enumeration of the most important of those defects which have hitherto disappointed our hopes from the system established among ourselves. To form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper remedy, it is absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted with the extent and malignity of the disease.''

''The next most palpable defect of the subsisting Confederation, is the total want of a SANCTION to its laws. The United States, as now composed, have no powers to exact obedience, or punish disobedience to their resolutions, either by pecuniary mulcts, by a suspension or divestiture of privileges, or by any other constitutional mode. There is no express delegation of authority to them to use force against delinquent members; and if such a right should be ascribed to the federal head, as resulting from the nature of the social compact between the States, it must be by inference and construction, in the face of that part of the second article, by which it is declared, &quot;that each State shall retain every power, jurisdiction, and right, not EXPRESSLY delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.&quot; There is, doubtless, a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist, but we are reduced to the dilemma either of embracing that supposition, preposterous as it may seem, or of contravening or explaining away a provision, which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of those who oppose the new Constitution; and the want of which, in that plan, has been the subject of much plausible animadversion, and severe criticism. If we are unwilling to impair the force of this applauded provision, we shall be obliged to conclude, that the United States afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws. It will appear, from the specimens which have been cited, that the American Confederacy, in this particular, stands discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind, and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world.''

''The want of a mutual guaranty of the State governments is another capital imperfection in the federal plan. There is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compose it; and to imply a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility, would be a still more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned, than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations.''

''The want of a guaranty, though it might in its consequences endanger the Union, does not so immediately attack its existence as the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws.''

''Without a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the Union in repelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the existence of the State constitutions, must be renounced. Usurpation may rear its crest in each State, and trample upon the liberties of the people, while the national government could legally do nothing more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret. A successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law, while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the Union to the friends and supporters of the government. The tempestuous situation from which Massachusetts has scarcely emerged, evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative. Who can determine what might have been the issue of her late convulsions, if the malcontents had been headed by a Caesar or by a Cromwell? Who can predict what effect a despotism, established in Massachusetts, would have upon the liberties of New Hampshire or Rhode Island, of Connecticut or New York?''

''The inordinate pride of State importance has suggested to some minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal government, as involving an officious interference in the domestic concerns of the members. A scruple of this kind would deprive us of one of the principal advantages to be expected from union, and can only flow from a misapprehension of the nature of the provision itself. It could be no impediment to reforms of the State constitution by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable mode. This right would remain undiminished. The guaranty could only operate against changes to be effected by violence. Towards the preventions of calamities of this kind, too many checks cannot be provided. The peace of society and the stability of government depend absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this head. Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State. The natural cure for an ill-administration, in a popular or representative constitution, is a change of men. A guaranty by the national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and sedition in the community.''

''The principle of regulating the contributions of the States to the common treasury by QUOTAS is another fundamental error in the Confederation. Its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national exigencies has been already pointed out, and has sufficiently appeared from the trial which has been made of it. I speak of it now solely with a view to equality among the States. Those who have been accustomed to contemplate the circumstances which produce and constitute national wealth, must be satisfied that there is no common standard or barometer by which the degrees of it can be ascertained. Neither the value of lands, nor the numbers of the people, which have been successively proposed as the rule of State contributions, has any pretension to being a just representative. If we compare the wealth of the United Netherlands with that of Russia or Germany, or even of France, and if we at the same time compare the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of that contracted district with the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of the immense regions of either of the three last-mentioned countries, we shall at once discover that there is no comparison between the proportion of either of these two objects and that of the relative wealth of those nations. If the like parallel were to be run between several of the American States, it would furnish a like result. Let Virginia be contrasted with North Carolina, Pennsylvania with Connecticut, or Maryland with New Jersey, and we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of those States, in relation to revenue, bear little or no analogy to their comparative stock in lands or to their comparative population. The position may be equally illustrated by a similar process between the counties of the same State. No man who is acquainted with the State of New York will doubt that the active wealth of King's County bears a much greater proportion to that of Montgomery than it would appear to be if we should take either the total value of the lands or the total number of the people as a criterion!''

''The wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes. Situation, soil, climate, the nature of the productions, the nature of the government, the genius of the citizens, the degree of information they possess, the state of commerce, of arts, of industry, these circumstances and many more, too complex, minute, or adventitious to admit of a particular specification, occasion differences hardly conceivable in the relative opulence and riches of different countries. The consequence clearly is that there can be no common measure of national wealth, and, of course, no general or stationary rule by which the ability of a state to pay taxes can be determined. The attempt, therefore, to regulate the contributions of the members of a confederacy by any such rule, cannot fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme oppression.''

''This inequality would of itself be sufficient in America to work the eventual destruction of the Union, if any mode of enforcing a compliance with its requisitions could be devised. The suffering States would not long consent to remain associated upon a principle which distributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand, and which was calculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some States, while those of others would scarcely be conscious of the small proportion of the weight they were required to sustain. This, however, is an evil inseparable from the principle of quotas and requisitions.''

''There is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience, but by authorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in its own way. Imposts, excises, and, in general, all duties upon articles of consumption, may be compared to a fluid, which will, in time, find its level with the means of paying them. The amount to be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own option, and can be regulated by an attention to his resources. The rich may be extravagant, the poor can be frugal; and private oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects proper for such impositions. If inequalities should arise in some States from duties on particular objects, these will, in all probability, be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in other States, from the duties on other objects. In the course of time and things, an equilibrium, as far as it is attainable in so complicated a subject, will be established everywhere. Or, if inequalities should still exist, they would neither be so great in their degree, so uniform in their operation, nor so odious in their appearance, as those which would necessarily spring from quotas, upon any scale that can possibly be devised.''

''It is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption, that they contain in their own nature a security against excess. They prescribe their own limit; which cannot be exceeded without defeating the end proposed, that is, an extension of the revenue. When applied to this object, the saying is as just as it is witty, that, &quot;in political arithmetic, two and two do not always make four.&quot;'' 

''If duties are too high, they lessen the consumption; the collection is eluded; and the product to the treasury is not so great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds. This forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of the citizens by taxes of this class, and is itself a natural limitation of the power of imposing them.''

''Impositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of indirect taxes, and must for a long time constitute the chief part of the revenue raised in this country. Those of the direct kind, which principally relate to land and buildings, may admit of a rule of apportionment. Either the value of land, or the number of the people, may serve as a standard. The state of agriculture and the populousness of a country have been considered as nearly connected with each other. And, as a rule, for the purpose intended, numbers, in the view of simplicity and certainty, are entitled to a preference. In every country it is a herculean task to obtain a valuation of the land; in a country imperfectly settled and progressive in improvement, the difficulties are increased almost to impracticability. The expense of an accurate valuation is, in all situations, a formidable objection. In a branch of taxation where no limits to the discretion of the government are to be found in the nature of things, the establishment of a fixed rule, not incompatible with the end, may be attended with fewer inconveniences than to leave that discretion altogether at large.''

==Federalist No. 22==
Federalist No. 22 is titled ''&quot;The Same Subject Continued: Other Defects of the Present Confederation&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Analysis===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IN ADDITION to the defects already enumerated in the existing federal system, there are others of not less importance, which concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of the affairs of the Union.''

''The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number. The utility of such a power has been anticipated under the first head of our inquiries; and for this reason, as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon the subject, little need be added in this place. It is indeed evident, on the most superficial view, that there is no object, either as it respects the interests of trade or finance, that more strongly demands a federal superintendence. The want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers, and has given occasions of dissatisfaction between the States. No nation acquainted with the nature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with the United States, by which they conceded privileges of any importance to them, while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the Union might at any moment be violated by its members, and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets, without granting us any return but such as their momentary convenience might suggest. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at that Mr. Jenkinson, in ushering into the House of Commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries, should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to the commerce of Great Britain, and that it would be prudent to persist in the plan until it should appear whether the American government was likely or not to acquire greater consistency.''

''Several States have endeavored, by separate prohibitions, restrictions, and exclusions, to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this particular, but the want of concert, arising from the want of a general authority and from clashing and dissimilar views in the State, has hitherto frustrated every experiment of the kind, and will continue to do so as long as the same obstacles to a uniformity of measures continue to exist.''

''The interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States, contrary to the true spirit of the Union, have, in different instances, given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others, and it is to be feared that examples of this nature, if not restrained by a national control, would be multiplied and extended till they became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than injurious impediments to the intcrcourse between the different parts of the Confederacy. &quot;The commerce of the German empire is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing through their territories, by means of which the fine streams and navigable rivers with which Germany is so happily watered are rendered almost useless.&quot; Though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this description to be strictly applicable to us, yet we may reasonably expect, from the gradual conflicts of State regulations, that the citizens of each would at length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens.''

''The power of raising armies, by the most obvious construction of the articles of the Confederation, is merely a power of making requisitions upon the States for quotas of men. This practice in the course of the late war, was found replete with obstructions to a vigorous and to an economical system of defense. It gave birth to a competition between the States which created a kind of auction for men. In order to furnish the quotas required of them, they outbid each other till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size. The hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment, and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods. Hence, slow and scanty levies of men, in the most critical emergencies of our affairs; short enlistments at an unparalleled expense; continual fluctuations in the troops, ruinous to their discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the perilous crisis of a disbanded army. Hence, also, those oppressive expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions practiced, and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would have induced the people to endure.''

''This method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy and vigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden. The States near the seat of war, influenced by motives of self-preservation, made efforts to furnish their quotas, which even exceeded their abilities; while those at a distance from danger were, for the most part, as remiss as the others were diligent, in their exertions. The immediate pressure of this inequality was not in this case, as in that of the contributions of money, alleviated by the hope of a final liquidation. The States which did not pay their proportions of money might at least be charged with their deficiencies; but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in the supplies of men. We shall not, however, see much reason to reget the want of this hope, when we consider how little prospect there is, that the most delinquent States will ever be able to make compensation for their pecuniary failures. The system of quotas and requisitions, whether it be applied to men or money, is, in every view, a system of imbecility in the Union, and of inequality and injustice among the members.''

''The right of equal suffrage among the States is another exceptionable part of the Confederation. Every idea of proportion and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a principle, which gives to Rhode Island an equal weight in the scale of power with Massachusetts, or Connecticut, or New York; and to Deleware an equal voice in the national deliberations with Pennsylvania, or Virginia, or North Carolina. Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense. It may happen that this majority of States is a small minority of the people of America; and two thirds of the people of America could not long be persuaded, upon the credit of artificial distinctions and syllogistic subtleties, to submit their interests to the management and disposal of one third. The larger States would after a while revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller. To acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the political scale, would be not merely to be insensible to the love of power, but even to sacrifice the desire of equality. It is neither rational to expect the first, nor just to require the last. The smaller States, considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare depend on union, ought readily to renounce a pretension which, if not relinquished, would prove fatal to its duration.''

''It may be objected to this, that not seven but nine States, or two thirds of the whole number, must consent to the most important resolutions; and it may be thence inferred that nine States would always comprehend a majority of the Union. But this does not obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between States of the most unequal dimensions and populousness; nor is the inference accurate in point of fact; for we can enumerate nine States which contain less than a majority of the people; and it is constitutionally possible that these nine may give the vote. Besides, there are matters of considerable moment determinable by a bare majority; and there are others, concerning which doubts have been entertained, which, if interpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven States, would extend its operation to interests of the first magnitude. In addition to this, it is to be observed that there is a probability of an increase in the number of States, and no provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes.''

''But this is not all: what at first sight may seem a remedy, is, in reality, a poison. To give a minority a negative upon the majority (which is always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a decision), is, in its tendency, to subject the sense of the greater number to that of the lesser. Congress, from the nonattendance of a few States, have been frequently in the situation of a Polish diet, where a single VOTE has been sufficient to put a stop to all their movements. A sixtieth part of the Union, which is about the proportion of Delaware and Rhode Island, has several times been able to oppose an entire bar to its operations. This is one of those refinements which, in practice, has an effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory. The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of something approaching towards it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. In those emergencies of a nation, in which the goodness or badness, the weakness or strength of its government, is of the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for action. The public business must, in some way or other, go forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good. And yet, in such a system, it is even happy when such compromises can take place: for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes, kept in a state of inaction. Its situation must always savor of weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.''

''It is not difficult to discover, that a principle of this kind gives greater scope to foreign corruption, as well as to domestic faction, than that which permits the sense of the majority to decide; though the contrary of this has been presumed. The mistake has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at certain critical seasons. When the concurrence of a large number is required by the Constitution to the doing of any national act, we are apt to rest satisfied that all is safe, because nothing improper will be likely TO BE DONE, but we forget how much good may be prevented, and how much ill may be produced, by the power of hindering the doing what may be necessary, and of keeping affairs in the same unfavorable posture in which they may happen to stand at particular periods.''

''Suppose, for instance, we were engaged in a war, in conjunction with one foreign nation, against another. Suppose the necessity of our situation demanded peace, and the interest or ambition of our ally led him to seek the prosecution of the war, with views that might justify us in making separate terms. In such a state of things, this ally of ours would evidently find it much easier, by his bribes and intrigues, to tie up the hands of government from making peace, where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to that object, than where a simple majority would suffice. In the first case, he would have to corrupt a smaller number; in the last, a greater number. Upon the same principle, it would be much easier for a foreign power with which we were at war to perplex our councils and embarrass our exertions. And, in a commercial view, we may be subjected to similar inconveniences. A nation, with which we might have a treaty of commerce, could with much greater facility prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade, though such a connection should be ever so beneficial to ourselves.''

''Evils of this description ought not to be regarded as imaginary. One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption. An hereditary monarch, though often disposed to sacrifice his subjects to his ambition, has so great a personal interest in the government and in the external glory of the nation, that it is not easy for a foreign power to give him an equivalent for what he would sacrifice by treachery to the state. The world has accordingly been witness to few examples of this species of royal prostitution, though there have been abundant specimens of every other kind.''

''In republics, persons elevated from the mass of the community, by the suffrages of their fellow-citizens, to stations of great pre-eminence and power, may find compensations for betraying their trust, which, to any but minds animated and guided by superior virtue, may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in the common stock, and to overbalance the obligations of duty. Hence it is that history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments. How much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has been already delineated. It is well known that the deputies of the United Provinces have, in various instances, been purchased by the emissaries of the neighboring kingdoms. The Earl of Chesterfield (if my memory serves me right), in a letter to his court, intimates that his success in an important negotiation must depend on his obtaining a major's commission for one of those deputies. And in Sweden the parties were alternately bought by France and England in so barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited universal disgust in the nation, and was a principal cause that the most limited monarch in Europe, in a single day, without tumult, violence, or opposition, became one of the most absolute and uncontrolled.''

''A circumstance which crowns the defects of the Confederation remains yet to be mentioned, the want of a judiciary power. Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation. The treaties of the United States, to have any force at all, must be considered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws, be ascertained by judicial determinations. To produce uniformity in these determinations, they ought to be submitted, in the last resort, to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL. And this tribunal ought to be instituted under the same authority which forms the treaties themselves. These ingredients are both indispensable. If there is in each State a court of final jurisdiction, there may be as many different final determinations on the same point as there are courts. There are endless diversities in the opinions of men. We often see not only different courts but the judges of the came court differing from each other. To avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice.''

''This is the more necessary where the frame of the government is so compounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this case, if the particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate jurisdiction, besides the contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local regulations. As often as such an interference was to happen, there would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the particular laws might be preferred to those of the general laws; for nothing is more natural to men in office than to look with peculiar deference towards that authority to which they owe their official existence. The treaties of the United States, under the present Constitution, are liable to the infractions of thirteen different legislatures, and as many different courts of final jurisdiction, acting under the authority of those legislatures. The faith, the reputation, the peace of the whole Union, are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices, the passions, and the interests of every member of which it is composed. Is it possible that foreign nations can either respect or confide in such a government? Is it possible that the people of America will longer consent to trust their honor, their happiness, their safety, on so precarious a foundation?''

''In this review of the Confederation, I have confined myself to the exhibition of its most material defects; passing over those imperfections in its details by which even a great part of the power intended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure rendered abortive. It must be by this time evident to all men of reflection, who can divest themselves of the prepossessions of preconceived opinions, that it is a system so radically vicious and unsound, as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its leading features and characters.''

''The organization of Congress is itself utterly improper for the exercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the Union. A single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those slender, or rather fettered, authorities, which have been heretofore delegated to the federal head; but it would be inconsistent with all the principles of good government, to intrust it with those additional powers which, even the moderate and more rational adversaries of the proposed Constitution admit, ought to reside in the United States. If that plan should not be adopted, and if the necessity of the Union should be able to withstand the ambitious aims of those men who may indulge magnificent schemes of personal aggrandizement from its dissolution, the probability would be, that we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers upon Congress, as they are now constituted; and either the machine, from the intrinsic feebleness of its structure, will moulder into pieces, in spite of our ill-judged efforts to prop it; or, by successive augmentations of its force an energy, as necessity might prompt, we shall finally accumulate, in a single body, all the most important prerogatives of sovereignty, and thus entail upon our posterity one of the most execrable forms of government that human infatuation ever contrived. Thus, we should create in reality that very tyranny which the adversaries of the new Constitution either are, or affect to be, solicitous to avert.''

''It has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the existing federal system, that it never had a ratification by the PEOPLE. Resting on no better foundation than the consent of the several legislatures, it has been exposed to frequent and intricate questions concerning the validity of its powers, and has, in some instances, given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of legislative repeal. Owing its ratification to the law of a State, it has been contended that the same authority might repeal the law by which it was ratified. However gross a heresy it may be to maintain that a PARTY to a COMPACT has a right to revoke that COMPACT, the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates. The possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority. The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE. The streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure, original fountain of all legitimate authority.''

This Federalist Paper, like the previous one, states defects in the country. It talks about defects that render the existing federal system altogether unfit for the administration of the affairs of the Union.

==Federalist No. 23==
Federalist No. 23 is titled ''&quot;The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to the Preservation of the Union&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE necessity of a Constitution, at least equally energetic with the one proposed, to the preservation of the Union, is the point at the examination of which we are now arrived.''

''This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches the objects to be provided for by the federal government, the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects, the persons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head.''

''The principal purposes to be answered by union are these the common defense of the members; the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks; the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States; the superintendence of our intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.''

''The authorities essential to the common defense are these: to raise armies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for the government of both; to direct their operations; to provide for their support. These powers ought to exist without limitation, BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE OR DEFINE THE EXTENT AND VARIETY OF NATIONAL EXIGENCIES, OR THE CORRESPONDENT EXTENT AND VARIETY OF THE MEANS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THEM. The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite, and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed. This power ought to be coextensive with all the possible combinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense.''

''This is one of those truths which, to a correct and unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it; and may be obscured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal; the MEANS ought to be proportioned to the END; the persons, from whose agency the attainment of any END is expected, ought to possess the MEANS by which it is to be attained.''

''Whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with the care of the common defense, is a question in the first instance, open for discussion; but the moment it is decided in the affirmative, it will follow, that that government ought to be clothed with all the powers requisite to complete execution of its trust. And unless it can be shown that the circumstances which may affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate limits; unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed, it must be admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority which is to provide for the defense and protection of the community, in any matter essential to its efficacy that is, in any matter essential to the FORMATION, DIRECTION, or SUPPORT of the NATIONAL FORCES.''

''Defective as the present Confederation has been proved to be, this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers of it; though they have not made proper or adequate provision for its exercise. Congress have an unlimited discretion to make requisitions of men and money; to govern the army and navy; to direct their operations. As their requisitions are made constitutionally binding upon the States, who are in fact under the most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them, the intention evidently was that the United States should command whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the &quot;common defense and general welfare.&quot; It was presumed that a sense of their true interests, and a regard to the dictates of good faith, would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head.''

''The experiment has, however, demonstrated that this expectation was ill-founded and illusory; and the observations, made under the last head, will, I imagine, have sufficed to convince the impartial and discerning, that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the system; that if we are in earnest about giving the Union energy and duration, we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon the States in their collective capacities; we must extend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of America; we must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and requisitions, as equally impracticable and unjust. The result from all this is that the Union ought to be invested with full power to levy troops; to build and equip fleets; and to raise the revenues which will be required for the formation and support of an army and navy, in the customary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments.''

''If the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a compound instead of a simple, a confederate instead of a sole, government, the essential point which will remain to be adjusted will be to discriminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which shall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power; allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the objects committed to its charge. Shall the Union be constituted the guardian of the common safety? Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose? The government of the Union must be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. The same must be the case in respect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to extend. Is the administration of justice between the citizens of the same State the proper department of the local governments? These must possess all the authorities which are connected with this object, and with every other that may be allotted to their particular cognizance and direction. Not to confer in each case a degree of power commensurate to the end, would be to violate the most obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success.''

''Who is likely to make suitable provisions for the public defense, as that body to which the guardianship of the public safety is confided; which, as the centre of information, will best understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten; as the representative of the WHOLE, will feel itself most deeply interested in the preservation of every part; which, from the responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it, will be most sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions; and which, by the extension of its authority throughout the States, can alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by which the common safety is to be secured? Is there not a manifest inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of the general defense, and leaving in the State governments the EFFECTIVE powers by which it is to be provided for? Is not a want of co-operation the infallible consequence of such a system? And will not weakness, disorder, an undue distribution of the burdens and calamities of war, an unnecessary and intolerable increase of expense, be its natural and inevitable concomitants? Have we not had unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the revolution which we have just accomplished?''

''Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management. It will indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the people, to see that it be modeled in such a manner as to admit of its being safely vested with the requisite powers. If any plan which has been, or may be, offered to our consideration, should not, upon a dispassionate inspection, be found to answer this description, it ought to be rejected. A government, the constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers which a free people OUGHT TO DELEGATE TO ANY GOVERNMENT, would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the NATIONAL INTERESTS. Wherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers may safely accompany them. This is the true result of all just reasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to showing, that the internal structure of the proposed government was such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people. They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are not too extensive for the OBJECTS of federal administration, or, in other words, for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can any satisfactory argument be framed to show that they are chargeable with such an excess. If it be true, as has been insinuated by some of the writers on the other side, that the difficulty arises from the nature of the thing, and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can safely be reposed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views, and resort to the expedient of separate confederacies, which will move within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the most essential national interests, without daring to trust it to the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative.''

''I trust, however, that the impracticability of one general system cannot be shown. I am greatly mistaken, if any thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency; and I flatter myself, that the observations which have been made in the course of these papers have served to place the reverse of that position in as clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience can be susceptible of. This, at all events, must be evident, that the very difficulty itself, drawn from the extent of the country, is the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government; for any other can certainly never preserve the Union of so large an empire. If we embrace the tenets of those who oppose the adoption of the proposed Constitution, as the standard of our political creed, we cannot fail to verify the gloomy doctrines which predict the impracticability of a national system pervading entire limits of the present Confederacy.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is one of the more significant essays in the series. It attempts to justify the increased strength of the federal government under the proposed [[../../Constitution|United States Constitution]], compared to the then-active [[../../Articles of Confederation/]]. 

Critics of the Constitution, particularly the Anti-Federalists who opposed the expansion of federal power, brought many counterarguments against Hamilton's position. Though they failed to carry the day, as the Constitution was indeed ratified, their concern about the federal government being overpowered motivated the [[../../Bill of Rights/]], particularly Amendment X.

Federalist No. 24 is titled ''&quot;The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton. 

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''To THE powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government, in respect to the creation and direction of the national forces, I have met with but one specific objection, which, if I understand it right, is this, that proper provision has not been made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace; an objection which, I shall now endeavor to show, rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations.''

''It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form, supported only by bold assertions, without the appearance of argument; without even the sanction of theoretical opinions; in contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the general sense of America, as expressed in most of the existing constitutions. The proprietory of this remark will appear, the moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation, in the article of military establishments; a principle unheard of, except in one or two of our State constitutions, and rejected in all the rest.''

''A stranger to our politics, who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture, without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention, would be naturally led to one of two conclusions: either that it contained a positive injunction, that standing armies should be kept up in time of peace; or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops, without subjecting his discretion, in any shape, to the control of the legislature.''

''If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he would be surprised to discover, that neither the one nor the other was the case; that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the LEGISLATURE, not in the EXECUTIVE; that this legislature was to be a popular body, consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected; and that instead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies, there was to be found, in respect to this object, an important qualification even of the legislative discretion, in that clause which forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of it, will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident necessity.''

''Disappointed in his first surmise, the person I have supposed would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further. He would naturally say to himself, it is impossible that all this vehement and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext. It must needs be that this people, so jealous of their liberties, have, in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they have established, inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this point, the omission of which, in the new plan, has given birth to all this apprehension and clamor.''

''If, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in review the several State constitutions, how great would be his disappointment to find that TWO ONLY of them contained an interdiction of standing armies in time of peace; that the other eleven had either observed a profound silence on the subject, or had in express terms admitted the right of the Legislature to authorize their existence.''

''Still, however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head. He would never be able to imagine, while any source of information remained unexplored, that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous. It would probably occur to him, that he would be likely to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact between the States. Here, at length, he would expect to meet with a solution of the enigma. No doubt, he would observe to himself, the existing Confederation must contain the most explicit provisions against military establishments in time of peace; and a departure from this model, in a favorite point, has occasioned the discontent which appears to influence these political champions.''

''If he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey of the articles of Confederation, his astonishment would not only be increased, but would acquire a mixture of indignation, at the unexpected discovery, that these articles, instead of containing the prohibition he looked for, and though they had, with jealous circumspection, restricted the authority of the State legislatures in this particular, had not imposed a single restraint on that of the United States. If he happened to be a man of quick sensibility, or ardent temper, he could now no longer refrain from regarding these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their country! How else, he would say, could the authors of them have been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan, about a point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general sense of America as declared in its different forms of government, and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them? If, on the contrary, he happened to be a man of calm and dispassionate feelings, he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature, and would lament, that in a matter so interesting to the happiness of millions, the true merits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so unfriendly to an impartial and right determination. Even such a man could hardly forbear remarking, that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by alarming their passions, rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their understandings.''

''But however little this objection may be countenanced, even by precedents among ourselves, it may be satisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinsic merits. From a close examination it will appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in respect to military establishments in time of peace, would be improper to be imposed, and if imposed, from the necessities of society, would be unlikely to be observed.''

''Though a wide ocean separates the United States from Europe, yet there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of confidence or security. On one side of us, and stretching far into our rear, are growing settlements subject to the dominion of Britain. On the other side, and extending to meet the British settlements, are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of Spain. This situation and the vicinity of the West India Islands, belonging to these two powers create between them, in respect to their American possessions and in relation to us, a common interest. The savage tribes on our Western frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies, their natural allies, because they have most to fear from us, and most to hope from them. The improvements in the art of navigation have, as to the facility of communication, rendered distant nations, in a great measure, neighbors. Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime powers of Europe. A future concert of views between these nations ought not to be regarded as improbable. The increasing remoteness of consanguinity is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between France and Spain. And politicians have ever with great reason considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of political connection. These circumstances combined, admonish us not to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the reach of danger.''

''Previous to the Revolution, and ever since the peace, there has been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our Western frontier. No person can doubt that these will continue to be indispensable, if it should only be against the ravages and depredations of the Indians. These garrisons must either be furnished by occasional detachments from the militia, or by permanent corps in the pay of the government. The first is impracticable; and if practicable, would be pernicious. The militia would not long, if at all, submit to be dragged from their occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to do it, the increased expense of a frequent rotation of service, and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious pursuits of individuals, would form conclusive objections to the scheme. It would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as ruinous to private citizens. The latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of peace; a small one, indeed, but not the less real for being small. Here is a simple view of the subject, that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments, and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the legislature.''

''In proportion to our increase in strength, it is probable, nay, it may be said certain, that Britain and Spain would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood. If we should not be willing to be exposed, in a naked and defenseless condition, to their insults and encroachments, we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements might be annoyed. There are, and will be, particular posts, the possession of which will include the command of large districts of territory, and facilitate future invasions of the remainder. It may be added that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the Indian nations. Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers? To act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of prudence and policy.''

''If we mean to be a commercial people, or even to be secure on our Atlantic side, we must endeavor, as soon as possible, to have a navy. To this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals; and for the defense of these, fortifications, and probably garrisons. When a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets, this supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose; but where naval establishments are in their infancy, moderate garrisons will, in all likelihood, be found an indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards, and sometimes of the fleet itself.''

This Federalist Paper considers the powers necessary to the common defense of the country further from other essays. It states the weapons and forts needed to protect the country. It also states that if the navy becomes strong enough, garrisons on the shoreline will not be needed as the ships could be used for protection instead. However, where naval establishments are in their infancy, moderate garrisons will be found an indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards, and sometimes of the fleet itself.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT MAY perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the preceding number ought to be provided for by the State governments, under the direction of the Union. But this would be, in reality, an inversion of the primary principle of our political association, as it would in practice transfer the care of the common defense from the federal head to the individual members: a project oppressive to some States, dangerous to all, and baneful to the Confederacy.''

''The territories of Britain, Spain, and of the Indian nations in our neighborhood do not border on particular States, but encircle the Union from Maine to Georgia. The danger, though in different degrees, is therefore common. And the means of guarding against it ought, in like manner, to be the objects of common councils and of a common treasury. It happens that some States, from local situation, are more directly exposed. New York is of this class. Upon the plan of separate provisions, New York would have to sustain the whole weight of the establishments requisite to her immediate safety, and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbors. This would neither be equitable as it respected New York nor safe as it respected the other States. Various inconveniences would attend such a system. The States, to whose lot it might fall to support the necessary establishments, would be as little able as willing, for a considerable time to come, to bear the burden of competent provisions. The security of all would thus be subjected to the parsimony, improvidence, or inability of a part. If the resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive, its provisions should be proportionally enlarged, the other States would quickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the Union in the hands of two or three of its members, and those probably amongst the most powerful. They would each choose to have some counterpoise, and pretenses could easily be contrived. In this situation, military establishments, nourished by mutual jealousy, would be apt to swell beyond their natural or proper size; and being at the separate disposal of the members, they would be engines for the abridgment or demolition of the national authcrity.''

''Reasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the State governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with that of the Union, the foundation of which will be the love of power; and that in any contest between the federal head and one of its members the people will be most apt to unite with their local government. If, in addition to this immense advantage, the ambition of the members should be stimulated by the separate and independent possession of military forces, it would afford too strong a temptation and too great a facility to them to make enterprises upon, and finally to subvert, the constitutional authority of the Union. On the other hand, the liberty of the people would be less safe in this state of things than in that which left the national forces in the hands of the national government. As far as an army may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power, it had better be in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous. For it is a truth, which the experience of ages has attested, that the people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion.''

''The framers of the existing Confederation, fully aware of the danger to the Union from the separate possession of military forces by the States, have, in express terms, prohibited them from having either ships or troops, unless with the consent of Congress. The truth is, that the existence of a federal government and military establishments under State authority are not less at variance with each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system of quotas and requisitions.''

''There are other lights besides those already taken notice of, in which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the national legislature will be equally manifest. The design of the objection, which has been mentioned, is to preclude standing armies in time of peace, though we have never been informed how far it is designed the prohibition should extend; whether to raising armies as well as to KEEPING THEM UP in a season of tranquillity or not. If it be confined to the latter it will have no precise signification, and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended. When armies are once raised what shall be denominated &quot;keeping them up,&quot; contrary to the sense of the Constitution? What time shall be requisite to ascertain the violation? Shall it be a week, a month, a year? Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues? This would be to admit that they might be kept up IN TIME OF PEACE, against threatening or impending danger, which would be at once to deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition, and to introduce an extensive latitude of construction. Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger? This must undoubtedly be submitted to the national government, and the matter would then be brought to this issue, that the national government, to provide against apprehended danger, might in the first instance raise troops, and might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy. It is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision.''

''The supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be founded on the supposed probability, or at least possibility, of a combination between the executive and the legislative, in some scheme of usurpation. Should this at any time happen, how easy would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger! Indian hostilities, instigated by Spain or Britain, would always be at hand. Provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be given to some foreign power, and appeased again by timely concessions. If we can reasonably presume such a combination to have been formed, and that the enterprise is warranted by a sufficient prospect of success, the army, when once raised, from whatever cause, or on whatever pretext, may be applied to the execution of the project.''

''If, to obviate this consequence, it should be resolved to extend the prohibition to the RAISING of armies in time of peace, the United States would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle which the world has yet seen, that of a nation incapacitated by its Constitution to prepare for defense, before it was actually invaded. As the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse, the presence of an enemy within our territories must be waited for, as the legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the State. We must receive the blow, before we could even prepare to return it. All that kind of policy by which nations anticipate distant danger, and meet the gathering storm, must be abstained from, as contrary to the genuine maxims of a free government. We must expose our property and liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders, and invite them by our weakness to seize the naked and defenseless prey, because we are afraid that rulers, created by our choice, dependent on our will, might endanger that liberty, by an abuse of the means necessary to its preservation.''

''Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us our independence. It cost millions to the United States that might have been saved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance of this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a suggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the same kind. Considerations of economy, not less than of stability and vigor, confirm this position. The American militia, in the course of the late war, have, by their valor on numerous occasions, erected eternal monuments to their fame; but the bravest of them feel and know that the liberty of their country could not have been established by their efforts alone, however great and valuable they were. War, like most other things, is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence, by perserverance, by time, and by practice.''

''All violent policy, as it is contrary to the natural and experienced course of human affairs, defeats itself. Pennsylvania, at this instant, affords an example of the truth of this remark. The Bill of Rights of that State declares that standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be kept up in time of peace. Pennsylvania, nevertheless, in a time of profound peace, from the existence of partial disorders in one or two of her counties, has resolved to raise a body of troops; and in all probability will keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the public peace. The conduct of Massachusetts affords a lesson on the same subject, though on different ground. That State (without waiting for the sanction of Congress, as the articles of the Confederation require) was compelled to raise troops to quell a domestic insurrection, and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a revival of the spirit of revolt. The particular constitution of Massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure; but the instance is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under our government, as well as under those of other nations, which will sometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the security of the society, and that it is therefore improper in this respect to control the legislative discretion. It also teaches us, in its application to the United States, how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be respected, even by its own constituents. And it teaches us, in addition to the rest, how unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity.''

''It was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedaemonian commonwealth, that the post of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same person. The Peloponnesian confederates, having suffered a severe defeat at sea from the Athenians, demanded Lysander, who had before served with success in that capacity, to command the combined fleets. The Lacedaemonians, to gratify their allies, and yet preserve the semblance of an adherence to their ancient institutions, had recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing Lysander with the real power of admiral, under the nominal title of vice-admiral. This instance is selected from among a multitude that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by domestic examples; which is, that nations pay little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to the necessities of society. Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed, because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws, though dictated by necessity, impairs that sacred reverence which ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a country, and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all, or is less urgent and palpable.''

Federalist No. 26 is titled ''&quot;The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense Considered&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT WAS a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular revolution the minds of men should stop at that happy mean which marks the salutary boundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE, and combines the energy of government with the security of private rights. A failure in this delicate and important point is the great source of the inconveniences we experience, and if we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the error, in our future attempts to rectify and ameliorate our system, we may travel from one chimerical project to another; we may try change after change; but we shall never be likely to make any material change for the better.''

''The idea of restraining the legislative authority, in the means of providing for the national defense, is one of those refinements which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than enlightened. We have seen, however, that it has not had thus far an extensive prevalency; that even in this country, where it made its first appearance, Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the only two States by which it has been in any degree patronized; and that all the others have refused to give it the least countenance; wisely judging that confidence must be placed somewhere; that the necessity of doing it, is implied in the very act of delegating power; and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that confidence than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by impolitic restrictions on the legislative authority. The opponents of the proposed Constitution combat, in this respect, the general decision of America; and instead of being taught by experience the propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have heretofore run, they appear disposed to conduct us into others still more dangerous, and more extravagant. As if the tone of government had been found too high, or too rigid, the doctrines they teach are calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it, by expedients which, upon other occasions, have been condemned or forborne. It may be affirmed without the imputation of invective, that if the principles they inculcate, on various points, could so far obtain as to become the popular creed, they would utterly unfit the people of this country for any species of government whatever. But a danger of this kind is not to be apprehended. The citizens of America have too much discernment to be argued into anarchy. And I am much mistaken, if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction in the public mind, that greater energy of government is essential to the welfare and prosperity of the community.''

''It may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin and progress of the idea, which aims at the exclusion of military establishments in time of peace. Though in speculative minds it may arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such institutions, fortified by the events that have happened in other ages and countries, yet as a national sentiment, it must be traced to those habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from whom the inhabitants of these States have in general sprung.''

''In England, for a long time after the Norman Conquest, the authority of the monarch was almost unlimited. Inroads were gradually made upon the prerogative, in favor of liberty, first by the barons, and afterwards by the people, till the greatest part of its most formidable pretensions became extinct. But it was not till the revolution in 1688, which elevated the Prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain, that English liberty was completely triumphant. As incident to the undefined power of making war, an acknowledged prerogative of the crown, Charles II. had, by his own authority, kept on foot in time of peace a body of 5,000 regular troops. And this number James II. increased to 30,000; who were paid out of his civil list. At the revolution, to abolish the exercise of so dangerous an authority, it became an article of the Bill of Rights then framed, that &quot;the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, UNLESS WITH THE CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT, was against law.&quot;''

''In that kingdom, when the pulse of liberty was at its highest pitch, no security against the danger of standing armies was thought requisite, beyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by the mere authority of the executive magistrate. The patriots, who effected that memorable revolution, were too temperate, too wellinformed, to think of any restraint on the legislative discretion. They were aware that a certain number of troops for guards and garrisons were indispensable; that no precise bounds could be set to the national exigencies; that a power equal to every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government: and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the judgment of the legislature, they had arrived at the ultimate point of precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the community.''

''From the same source, the people of America may be said to have derived an hereditary impression of danger to liberty, from standing armies in time of peace. The circumstances of a revolution quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the security of popular rights, and in some instances raise the warmth of our zeal beyond the degree which consisted with the due temperature of the body politic. The attempts of two of the States to restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of military establishments, are of the number of these instances. The principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power of an hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the representatives of the people in their popular assemblies. Even in some of the States, where this error was not adopted, we find unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept up, in time of peace, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. I call them unnecessary, because the reason which had introduced a similar provision into the English Bill of Rights is not applicable to any of the State constitutions. The power of raising armies at all, under those constitutions, can by no construction be deemed to reside anywhere else, than in the legislatures themselves; and it was superfluous, if not absurd, to declare that a matter should not be done without the consent of a body, which alone had the power of doing it. Accordingly, in some of these constitutions, and among others, in that of this State of New York, which has been justly celebrated, both in Europe and America, as one of the best of the forms of government established in this country, there is a total silence upon the subject.''

''It is remarkable, that even in the two States which seem to have meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of peace, the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than prohibitory. It is not said, that standing armies SHALL NOT BE kept up, but that they OUGHT NOT to be kept up, in time of peace. This ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict between jealousy and conviction; between the desire of excluding such establishments at all events, and the persuasion that an absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe.''

''Can it be doubted that such a provision, whenever the situation of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it, would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition, and would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of the State? Let the fact already mentioned, with respect to Pennsylvania, decide. What then (it may be asked) is the use of such a provision, if it cease to operate the moment there is an inclination to disregard it?''

''Let us examine whether there be any comparison, in point of efficacy, between the provision alluded to and that which is contained in the new Constitution, for restraining the appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two years. The former, by aiming at too much, is calculated to effect nothing; the latter, by steering clear of an imprudent extreme, and by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the exigencies of the nation, will have a salutary and powerful operation.''

''The legislature of the United States will be OBLIGED, by this provision, once at least in every two years, to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot; to come to a new resolution on the point; and to declare their sense of the matter, by a formal vote in the face of their constituents. They are not AT LIBERTY to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the support of an army, if they were even incautious enough to be willing to repose in it so improper a confidence. As the spirit of party, in different degrees, must be expected to infect all political bodies, there will be, no doubt, persons in the national legislature willing enough to arraign the measures and criminate the views of the majority. The provision for the support of a military force will always be a favorable topic for declamation. As often as the question comes forward, the public attention will be roused and attracted to the subject, by the party in opposition; and if the majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits, the community will be warned of the danger, and will have an opportunity of taking measures to guard against it. Independent of parties in the national legislature itself, as often as the period of discussion arrived, the State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if necessary, the ARM of their discontent.''

''Schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community REQUIRE TIME to mature them for execution. An army, so large as seriously to menace those liberties, could only be formed by progressive augmentations; which would suppose, not merely a temporary combination between the legislature and executive, but a continued conspiracy for a series of time. Is it probable that such a combination would exist at all? Is it probable that it would be persevered in, and transmitted along through all the successive variations in a representative body, which biennial elections would naturally produce in both houses? Is it presumable, that every man, the instant he took his seat in the national Senate or House of Representatives, would commence a traitor to his constituents and to his country? Can it be supposed that there would not be found one man, discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy, or bold or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger? If such presumptions can fairly be made, there ought at once to be an end of all delegated authority. The people should resolve to recall all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own hands, and to divide themselves into as many States as there are counties, in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in person.''

''If such suppositions could even be reasonably made, still the concealment of the design, for any duration, would be impracticable. It would be announced, by the very circumstance of augmenting the army to so great an extent in time of profound peace. What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force? It is impossible that the people could be long deceived; and the destruction of the project, and of the projectors, would quickly follow the discovery.''

''It has been said that the provision which limits the appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of two years would be unavailing, because the Executive, when once possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission, would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature. But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace? If we suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic insurrection or foreign war, then it becomes a case not within the principles of the objection; for this is levelled against the power of keeping up troops in time of peace. Few persons will be so visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion; and if the defense of the community under such circumstances should make it necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty, this is one of those calamaties for which there is neither preventative nor cure. It cannot be provided against by any possible form of government; it might even result from a simple league offensive and defensive, if it should ever be necessary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defense.''

''But it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a united than in a disunited state; nay, it may be safely asserted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter situation. It is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so formidable can assail the whole Union, as to demand a force considerable enough to place our liberties in the least jeopardy, especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the militia, which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and powerful auxiliary. But in a state of disunion (as has been fully shown in another place), the contrary of this supposition would become not only probable, but almost unavoidable.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper outlines the fallacy of restricting the government's power to control the military. Hamilton reasons that restricting the size of standing armies is necessary for a people's government to function, but preventing standing armies altogether is outright foolish. He argues that the new system would require the Congress to consider the necessity of standing armies every two years. He states the majority of laws meant to prevent standing armies are vague and ineffective. The subjct is continued in Federalist No. 27.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT HAS been urged, in different shapes, that a Constitution of the kind proposed by the convention cannot operate without the aid of a military force to execute its laws. This, however, like most other things that have been alleged on that side, rests on mere general assertion, unsupported by any precise or intelligible designation of the reasons upon which it is founded. As far as I have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors, it seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an internal nature. Waiving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and external, let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that disinclination in the people. Unless we presume at the same time that the powers of the general government will be worse administered than those of the State government, there seems to be no room for the presumption of ill-will, disaffection, or opposition in the people. I believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be proportioned to the goodness or badness of its administration. It must be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule; but these exceptions depend so entirely on accidental causes, that they cannot be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic merits or demerits of a constitution. These can only be judged of by general principles and maxims.''

''Various reasons have been suggested, in the course of these papers, to induce a probability that the general government will be better administered than the particular governments; the principal of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election will present a greater option, or latitude of choice, to the people; that through the medium of the State legislatures which are select bodies of men, and which are to appoint the members of the national Senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be composed with peculiar care and judgment; that these circumstances promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the national councils, and that they will be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of faction, and more out of the reach of those occasional ill-humors, or temporary prejudices and propensities, which, in smaller societies, frequently contaminate the public councils, beget injustice and oppression of a part of the community, and engender schemes which, though they gratify a momentary inclination or desire, terminate in general distress, dissatisfaction, and disgust. Several additional reasons of considerable force, to fortify that probability, will occur when we come to survey, with a more critical eye, the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to erect. It will be sufficient here to remark, that until satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion, that the federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people, there can be no reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the Union will meet with any greater obstruction from them, or will stand in need of any other methods to enforce their execution, than the laws of the particular members.''

''The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition; the dread of punishment, a proportionably strong discouragement to it. Will not the government of the Union, which, if possessed of a due degree of power, can call to its aid the collective resources of the whole Confederacy, be more likely to repress the FORMER sentiment and to inspire the LATTER, than that of a single State, which can only command the resources within itself? A turbulent faction in a State may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to the government in that State; but it can hardly be so infatuated as to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the Union. If this reflection be just, there is less danger of resistance from irregular combinations of individuals to the authority of the Confederacy than to that of a single member.''

''I will, in this place, hazard an observation, which will not be the less just because to some it may appear new; which is, that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exercise of government, the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life, the more it is familiarized to their sight and to their feelings, the further it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs of the human heart, the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of the community. Man is very much a creature of habit. A thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his mind. A government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the people. The inference is, that the authority of the Union, and the affections of the citizens towards it, will be strengthened, rather than weakened, by its extension to what are called matters of internal concern; and will have less occasion to recur to force, in proportion to the familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency. The more it circulates through those channls and currents in which the passions of mankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulsion.''

''One thing, at all events, must be evident, that a government like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity of using force, than that species of league contend for by most of its opponents; the authority of which should only operate upon the States in their political or collective capacities. It has been shown that in such a Confederacy there can be no sanction for the laws but force; that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natural offspring of the very frame of the government; and that as often as these happen, they can only be redressed, if at all, by war and violence.''

''The plan reported by the convention, by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several States, will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each, in the execution of its laws. It is easy to perceive that this will tend to destroy, in the common apprehension, all distinction between the sources from which they might proceed; and will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of each State, in addition to the influence on public opinion which will result from the important consideration of its having power to call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole Union. It merits particular attention in this place, that the laws of the Confederacy, as to the ENUMERATED and LEGITIMATE objects of its jurisdiction, will become the SUPREME LAW of the land; to the observance of which all officers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in each State, will be bound by the sanctity of an oath. Thus the legislatures, courts, and magistrates, of the respective members, will be incorporated into the operations of the national government AS FAR AS ITS JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY EXTENDS; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws. Any man who will pursue, by his own reflections, the consequences of this situation, will perceive that there is good ground to calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the Union, if its powers are administered with a common share of prudence. If we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary, we may deduce any inferences we please from the supposition; for it is certainly possible, by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of the best government that ever was, or ever can be instituted, to provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest excesses. But though the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should presume that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of public good, or to the obligations of duty, I would still ask them how the interests of ambition, or the views of encroachment, can be promoted by such a conduct?''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper states that the combined forces of many states, under the direction of one federal government, will provide a much greater show of force and be more apt to discourage rebellion. Hamilton reasons that confederacies are more prone to violence and war, and that extending the authority of the federal government to the citizen, rather than the state, is the only way to have power. This essay continues the subject started in Federalist No. 26.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THAT there may happen cases in which the national government may be necessitated to resort to force, cannot be denied. Our own experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of other nations; that emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise in all societies, however constituted; that seditions and insurrections are, unhappily, maladies as inseparable from the body politic as tumors and eruptions from the natural body; that the idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law (which we have been told is the only admissible principle of republican government), has no place but in the reveries of those political doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental instruction.''

''Should such emergencies at any time happen under the national government, there could be no remedy but force. The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief. If it should be a slight commotion in a small part of a State, the militia of the residue would be adequate to its suppression; and the national presumption is that they would be ready to do their duty. An insurrection, whatever may be its immediate cause, eventually endangers all government. Regard to the public peace, if not to the rights of the Union, would engage the citizens to whom the contagion had not communicated itself to oppose the insurgents; and if the general government should be found in practice conducive to the prosperity and felicity of the people, it were irrational to believe that they would be disinclined to its support.''

''If, on the contrary, the insurrection should pervade a whole State, or a principal part of it, the employment of a different kind of force might become unavoidable. It appears that Massachusetts found it necessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders within that State; that Pennsylvania, from the mere apprehension of commotions among a part of her citizens, has thought proper to have recourse to the same measure. Suppose the State of New York had been inclined to re-establish her lost jurisdiction over the inhabitants of Vermont, could she have hoped for success in such an enterprise from the efforts of the militia alone? Would she not have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force for the execution of her design? If it must then be admitted that the necessity of recurring to a force different from the militia, in cases of this extraordinary nature, is applicable to the State governments themselves, why should the possibility, that the national government might be under a like necessity, in similar extremities, be made an objection to its existence? Is it not surprising that men who declare an attachment to the Union in the abstract, should urge as an objection to the proposed Constitution what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which they contend; and what, as far as it has any foundation in truth, is an inevitable consequence of civil society upon an enlarged scale? Who would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty republics?''

''Let us pursue this examination in another light. Suppose, in lieu of one general system, two, or three, or even four Confederacies were to be formed, would not the same difficulty oppose itself to the operations of either of these Confederacies? Would not each of them be exposed to the same casualties; and when these happened, be obliged to have recourse to the same expedients for upholding its authority which are objected to in a government for all the States? Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union? All candid and intelligent men must, upon due consideration, acknowledge that the principle of the objection is equally applicable to either of the two cases; and that whether we have one government for all the States, or different governments for different parcels of them, or even if there should be an entire separation of the States, there might sometimes be a necessity to make use of a force constituted differently from the militia, to preserve the peace of the community and to maintain the just authority of the laws against those violent invasions of them which amount to insurrections and rebellions.''

''Independent of all other reasonings upon the subject, it is a full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against military establishments in time of peace, to say that the whole power of the proposed government is to be in the hands of the representatives of the people. This is the essential, and, after all, only efficacious security for the rights and privileges of the people, which is attainable in civil society.''

''If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo. The smaller the extent of the territory, the more difficult will it be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of opposition, and the more easy will it be to defeat their early efforts. Intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their preparations and movements, and the military force in the possession of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the part where the opposition has begun. In this situation there must be a peculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the popular resistance.''

''The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny. But in a confederacy the people, without exaggeration, may be said to be entirely the masters of their own fate. Power being almost always the rival of power, the general government will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments, and these will have the same disposition towards the general government. The people, by throwing themselves into either scale, will infallibly make it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress. How wise will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly prized!''

''It may safely be received as an axiom in our political system, that the State governments will, in all possible contingencies, afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority. Projects of usurpation cannot be masked under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men, as of the people at large. The legislatures will have better means of information. They can discover the danger at a distance; and possessing all the organs of civil power, and the confidence of the people, they can at once adopt a regular plan of opposition, in which they can combine all the resources of the community. They can readily communicate with each other in the different States, and unite their common forces for the protection of their common liberty.''

''The great extent of the country is a further security. We have already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign power. And it would have precisely the same effect against the enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils. If the federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one State, the distant States would have it in their power to make head with fresh forces. The advantages obtained in one place must be abandoned to subdue the opposition in others; and the moment the part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself, its efforts would be renewed, and its resistance revive.''

''We should recollect that the extent of the military force must, at all events, be regulated by the resources of the country. For a long time to come, it will not be possible to maintain a large army; and as the means of doing this increase, the population and natural strength of the community will proportionably increase. When will the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense empire, who are in a situation, through the medium of their State governments, to take measures for their own defense, with all the celerity, regularity, and system of independent nations? The apprehension may be considered as a disease, for which there can be found no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning.''

==Federalist No. 29==
Federalist No. 29 is titled ''&quot;Concerning the Militia&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties of superintending the common defense, and of watching over the internal peace of the Confederacy.''

''It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union &quot;to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.&quot;''

''Of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the plan of the convention, there is none that was so little to have been expected, or is so untenable in itself, as the one from which this particular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security. If standing armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnecessary, will be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper.''

''In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, it has been remarked that there is nowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for calling out the POSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty, whence it has been inferred, that military force was intended to be his only auxiliary. There is a striking incoherence in the objections which have appeared, and sometimes even from the same quarter, not much calculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors. The same persons who tell us in one breath, that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and unlimited, inform us in the next, that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter, fortunately, is as much short of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as absurd to doubt, that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute its declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution of those laws, as it would be to believe, that a right to enact laws necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of landed property, or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to it. It being therefore evident that the supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely destitute of color, it will follow, that the conclusion which has been drawn from it, in its application to the authority of the federal government over the militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What reason could there be to infer, that force was intended to be the sole instrument of authority, merely because there is a power to make use of it when necessary? What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner? How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?''

''By a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy, we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself, in the hands of the federal government. It is observed that select corps may be formed, composed of the young and ardent, who may be rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government, is impossible to be foreseen. But so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps as dangerous, were the Constitution ratified, and were I to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this State on the subject of a militia establishment, I should hold to him, in substance, the following discourse:''

''&quot;The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.''

''&quot;But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will really fit them for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.&quot;''

''Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should I reason on the same subject, deducing arguments of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and perdition. But how the national legislature may reason on the point, is a thing which neither they nor I can foresee.''

''There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to consider it as a mere trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the serious offspring of political fanaticism. Where in the name of common-sense, are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our brothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits and interests? What reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for the militia, and to command its services when necessary, while the particular States are to have the SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS? If it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.''

''In reading many of the publications against the Constitution, a man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance, which instead of natural and agreeable images, exhibits to the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes &quot;Gorgons, hydras, and chimeras dire&quot;; discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents, and transforming everything it touches into a monster.''

''A sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power of calling for the services of the militia. That of New Hampshire is to be marched to Georgia, of Georgia to New Hampshire, of New York to Kentucky, and of Kentucky to Lake Champlain. Nay, the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of louis d'ors and ducats. At one moment there is to be a large army to lay prostrate the liberties of the people; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six hundred miles, to tame the republican contumacy of Massachusetts; and that of Massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic Virginians. Do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the people of America for infallible truths?''

''If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism, what need of the militia? If there should be no army, whither would the militia, irritated by being called upon to undertake a distant and hopeless expedition, for the purpose of riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen, direct their course, but to the seat of the tyrants, who had meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project, to crush them in their imagined intrenchments of power, and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people? Is this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a numerous and enlightened nation? Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations? Do they usually commence their career by wanton and disgustful acts of power, calculated to answer no end, but to draw upon themselves universal hatred and execration? Are suppositions of this sort the sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning people? Or are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered enthusiasts? If we were even to suppose the national rulers actuated by the most ungovernable ambition, it is impossible to believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish their designs.''

''In times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighboring State should be marched into another, to resist a common enemy, or to guard the republic against the violence of faction or sedition. This was frequently the case, in respect to the first object, in the course of the late war; and this mutual succor is, indeed, a principal end of our political association. If the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the Union, there will be no danger of a supine and listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor, till its near approach had superadded the incitements of selfpreservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper, unlike the rest of the Federalist Papers, which were published more or less in order, No. 29 did not appear until after Federalist No. 36. In it, Hamilton states that a federally regulated militia will be more uniform, and will benefit from the uniformity. He argues that an excessively regulated militia can harm a nation's work force, and that a smaller, but still well-regulated militia is the answer. He says the militia, as it is directly of the people, is not a danger to liberty.

==Federalist No. 30==
Federalist No. 30 is titled ''&quot;Concerning the General Power of Taxation&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT HAS been already observed that the federal government ought to possess the power of providing for the support of the national forces; in which proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising troops, of building and equipping fleets, and all other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and operations. But these are not the only objects to which the jurisdiction of the Union, in respect to revenue, must necessarily be empowered to extend. It must embrace a provision for the support of the national civil list; for the payment of the national debts contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in general, for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national treasury. The conclusion is, that there must be interwoven, in the frame of the government, a general power of taxation, in one shape or another.''

''Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of the body politic; as that which sustains its life and motion, and enables it to perform its most essential functions. A complete power, therefore, to procure a regular and adequate supply of it, as far as the resources of the community will permit, may be regarded as an indispensable ingredient in every constitution. From a deficiency in this particular, one of two evils must ensue; either the people must be subjected to continual plunder, as a substitute for a more eligible mode of supplying the public wants, or the government must sink into a fatal atrophy, and, in a short course of time, perish.''

''In the Ottoman or Turkish empire, the sovereign, though in other respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects, has no right to impose a new tax. The consequence is that he permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people without mercy; and, in turn, squeezes out of them the sums of which he stands in need, to satisfy his own exigencies and those of the state. In America, from a like cause, the government of the Union has gradually dwindled into a state of decay, approaching nearly to annihilation. Who can doubt, that the happiness of the people in both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the proper hands, to provide the revenues which the necessities of the public might require?''

''The present Confederation, feeble as it is intended to repose in the United States, an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants of the Union. But proceeding upon an erroneous principle, it has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the intention. Congress, by the articles which compose that compact (as has already been stated), are authorized to ascertain and call for any sums of money necessary, in their judgment, to the service of the United States; and their requisitions, if conformable to the rule of apportionment, are in every constitutional sense obligatory upon the States. These have no right to question the propriety of the demand; no discretion beyond that of devising the ways and means of furnishing the sums demanded. But though this be strictly and truly the case; though the assumption of such a right would be an infringement of the articles of Union; though it may seldom or never have been avowedly claimed, yet in practice it has been constantly exercised, and would continue to be so, as long as the revenues of the Confederacy should remain dependent on the intermediate agency of its members. What the consequences of this system have been, is within the knowledge of every man the least conversant in our public affairs, and has been amply unfolded in different parts of these inquiries. It is this which has chiefly contributed to reduce us to a situation, which affords ample cause both of mortification to ourselves, and of triumph to our enemies.''

''What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions? What substitute can there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance, but that of permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every well-ordered constitution of civil government? Ingenious men may declaim with plausibility on any subject; but no human ingenuity can point out any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the public treasury.''

''The more intelligent adversaries of the new Constitution admit the force of this reasoning; but they qualify their admission by a distinction between what they call INTERNAL and EXTERNAL taxation. The former they would reserve to the State governments; the latter, which they explain into commercial imposts, or rather duties on imported articles, they declare themselves willing to concede to the federal head. This distinction, however, would violate the maxim of good sense and sound policy, which dictates that every POWER ought to be in proportion to its OBJECT; and would still leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the State governments, inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency. Who can pretend that commercial imposts are, or would be, alone equal to the present and future exigencies of the Union? Taking into the account the existing debt, foreign and domestic, upon any plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the importance of public justice and public credit could approve, in addition to the establishments which all parties will acknowledge to be necessary, we could not reasonably flatter ourselves, that this resource alone, upon the most improved scale, would even suffice for its present necessities. Its future necessities admit not of calculation or limitation; and upon the principle, more than once adverted to, the power of making provision for them as they arise ought to be equally unconfined. I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.''

''To say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions upon the States, is on the one hand to acknowledge that this system cannot be depended upon, and on the other hand to depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit. Those who have carefully attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by experience or delineated in the course of these papers, must feel invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests in any degree to its operation. Its inevitable tendency, whenever it is brought into activity, must be to enfeeble the Union, and sow the seeds of discord and contention between the federal head and its members, and between the members themselves. Can it be expected that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the total wants of the Union have heretofore been supplied in the same mode? It ought to be recollected that if less will be required from the States, they will have proportionably less means to answer the demand. If the opinions of those who contend for the distinction which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth, one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in the economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to say: Thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by supplying the wants of government, and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or anxiety. How is it possible that a government half supplied and always necessitous, can fulfill the purposes of its institution, can provide for the security, advance the prosperity, or support the reputation of the commonwealth? How can it ever possess either energy or stability, dignity or credit, confidence at home or respectability abroad? How can its administration be any thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing, impotent, disgraceful? How will it be able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of its engagements to immediate necessity? How can it undertake or execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good?''

''Let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in the very first war in which we should happen to be engaged. We will presume, for argument's sake, that the revenue arising from the impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public debt and of a peace establishment for the Union. Thus circumstanced, a war breaks out. What would be the probable conduct of the government in such an emergency? Taught by experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the success of requisitions, unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh resources, and urged by considerations of national danger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the State? It is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided; and if it should be taken, it is evident that it would prove the destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming essential to the public safety. To imagine that at such a crisis credit might be dispensed with, would be the extreme of infatuation. In the modern system of war, nations the most wealthy are obliged to have recourse to large loans. A country so little opulent as ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree. But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures for paying? The loans it might be able to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in their conditions. They would be made upon the same principles that usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors, with a sparing hand and at enormous premiums.''

''It may perhaps be imagined that, from the scantiness of the resources of the country, the necessity of diverting the established funds in the case supposed would exist, though the national government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation. But two considerations will serve to quiet all apprehension on this head: one is, that we are sure the resources of the community, in their full extent, will be brought into activity for the benefit of the Union; the other is, that whatever deficiences there may be, can without difficulty be supplied by loans.''

''The power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation, by its own authority, would enable the national government to borrow as far as its necessities might require. Foreigners, as well as the citizens of America, could then reasonably repose confidence in its engagements; but to depend upon a government that must itself depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling its contracts, when once its situation is clearly understood, would require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the pecuniary transactions of mankind, and little reconcilable with the usual sharp-sightedness of avarice.''

''Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who hope to see realized in America the halcyon scenes of the poetic or fabulous age; but to those who believe we are likely to experience a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have fallen to the lot of other nations, they must appear entitled to serious attention. Such men must behold the actual situation of their country with painful solicitude, and deprecate the evils which ambition or revenge might, with too much facility, inflict upon it.'' 

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper states that taxes are the life-force of a government, and that it will not function without them. The power to collect taxes deemed necessary is crucial for the government, and few deny that. Hamilton details the differences between internal and external taxes. He argues that the federal government needs a power of taxation equal to its necessities, both present and future. External taxes alone cannot provide enough revenue for a government as extensive as the one proposed, especially in a time of war. This is the first of seven essays by Hamilton on the then-controversial issue of taxation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

Forensic pharmacology and toxicology, it is seen throughout pop culture in shows such as CSI, Law and Order SVU, Forensic Files, Quincey, Six Feet Under and more.  The success of this entertainment genre may be a recent phenomenon, but the history of this science can be dated back to ancient times. 

While the techniques practiced today by analytical chemists and forensic scientists are based on a modern understanding of our world, the basis for forensic investigation is anything but modern.  In the ancient world, one of the most feared crimes (and most difficult to solve) was poisoning.  Around 330B.C. the Romans had publicly forced many individuals accused of poisoning their spouses to eat and drink their own concoctions. (Bell 2)  Today’s term forensic is tied to these proceedings.  The Latin word forum, where the business and legal proceedings took place.  In both business and law, it was hoped that all parties would always tell the truth. 

For most people, they may be aware of drug testing as part of employee screening.  To others, they may know of it just from television.  However, this is where the knowledge of those tests ends.  To average-Joe sixpack, it may seem as foreign to him as the ancient civilizations that started our understanding of science. The processes involved in these tests may go unknown to many, but the methods in which drugs can be tested are numerous and diverse.  This paper will address the various methods that exist for the screening of drugs of abuse in both for the purposes of drug screening and forensic analysis. 

=Concepts for Analytical and Forensic Analysis=

Before jumping into the types of tests which may be at the arsenal of investigators, it is important to understand the general idea of how tests should be conducted for investigational research.  The array of tests performed on evidence can be thought of like a funnel.  (FIGURE-1)   To identify drugs, various testing can be conducted so that the possibilities of drugs is narrowed until a drug is identified.  The methods for complex analysis are determined based on the results of initial tests often based on straightforward color 

For the purpose of efficacy, all substances must be treated as a general unknowns, even if a researcher has a general idea as to what the substance might be.  For the earliest of these tests, or presumptive tests, the scientific analysis may be simpler than one would expect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual observation on the part of scientific investigators is the first step in the analysis of drugs.  Visual analysis of drugs includes observed color, crystal structure and all supporting evidence which links drugs to the scene of a crime.  Accurate visual evidence can eliminate the possibility of certain drugs (and the associated cost to labs).  If a green substance thought to be drugs is brought into the lab, there would be little point in investigating for cocaine or heroin in the initial test. 

Table INSERT - Identification of drugs based on visual observation.

Visual observation of drugs can also be supplemented by manuals such as the PDR and the Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) guide to logo identification.   LSD, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstacy) are often marketed emblazoned with logos or cartoons.  By comparing images and logos of recently obtained unknowns with an index of seized drugs (such as the one found at http://www.ecstasydata.org/) a presumptive judgement can be made as to where the type of pill came from, the active ingredients and what adulterants are likely to be found in the pill.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The visual analysis of unknown substances including drugs may be further analyzed by microscopy.  The microscope has gone hand in hand with forensics ever since the time of the fictional Sherlock Holmes.  Today the microscope made familiar by Sherlock Holmes takes many different forms and they may be optical or electromagnetic.  

=Compound Optical Microscope=
The most common form of the microscope is still the optical compound type that mostly everyone is familiar with. 

Forensic scientists still use optical compound microscopes for analysis of substances, yet other technologies exist as well,  – electron microscope (scanning and/or tunneling), phase contrast, and microscopes with polarimeter filters which can be utilized to observe certain frequencies of light.    

One of the simplest uses of visual observation for the detection of materials of forensic interest is in the analysis of the marijuana leaf.  Marijuana leaves exhibit bear claw shapes called cystolithic hairs on the dorsal leaf surface.(Bell 304)(Figure-2)  This visual observation is specific enough to narrow down the genera of the marijuana plant, but not specific enough to tell whether or not it is Cannibus sativa with a high level of the active ingredient Δ9-THC.

=Fluorescent Microscopy=
Fluorescent microscopy is most commonly used in a series of assays known as immunocytochemistry which will be discussed later on page 21.  However, Fluorescent Microscopy is also useful in the identification of LSD.  LSD when isolated can be detected in 1ppm by fluorescence.  Using filters specific for certain wavelengths, forensic scientist can look for light at the 400nm wavelength which is indicative of LSD presence. (Fanga et al, 2002)

=Scanning Electron Microscopy=  

[[Image:SEM.jpg|400px]]

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be used to obtain the same results found with phase contrast microscopes.  However it is more often used in the presumptive analyses associated with the identification of unique crystal structures.  SEM is often paired with other technologies such as x-ray crystallography sources.  The most modern techniques of this type work use the SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXRA) to allow the microscope analyze components of samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spectroscopy is an extension of microscopy which in itself encompasses the microscopy that was previous discussed.  In short, spectroscopy is the use of electromagnetic energy to study matter and to interpret results.  Microscopy can be viewed as spectroscopy of the visible portions of light where as spectroscopy is said to encompass the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Spectroscopy is useful since only a very small quantity of sample is needed for analysis.  In addition, samples may be reused after analysis with IR, NMR or UV spectroscopy. 

=Absorbance Spectroscopy – UV/VIS spectrophotometry=
One of the simplest types of spectroscopy is UV/VIS spectrophotometry.  This paper has already mentioned how color can be used to analyze an unknown for preliminary tests.  UV/VIS Spectrophotometry takes this principle and applies the principles of electromagnetic absorption of energy to it.    Chemical structures can absorb energy and reflect energy.  In most cases related to forensic pharmacology, color is due to the absorption of light by conjugated pi systems of two nearby elements of a molecule (in other substances such as metals, color is due to unique absorption that is characteristic of that the element(s) present).   

A spectrophotometer takes the absorption information of a substance diluted into a liquid sample in order to obtain an output of absorption using Beers’ Law. 

In Spectrophotometry Cell length is controlled for.  The Coefficient and Concentration for unknowns is not usually known in forensic analysis, therefore this method is not utilized often for dealing with unknowns. 

Although this method is more precise than the visual analysis of color, it is used far less in presumptive tests.  The reasons for this are primarily due to the similarities in many UV/VIS spectra and the need to have a pure analyte for analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Polarimetry is very useful in the analysis of drugs of abuse.  Illicit drugs such as  methamphetamine can be prepared in a variety of ways (As will be discussed later in Appendix I).  Different steps in the synthesis of drugs often lead to structural differences known as enantiomers.  In enantiomers, structures are said to be chiral.  These structures may have the same molecular mass and an identical number of the same particles but they are put together in mirror images – much like a person’s left and right hand.  The key to chirality is that structures that are enantiomers cannot be superimposed.  (note - that in the example still using your hand, it is easy to think that hands can be superimposed by placing each hand palm to palm.  However if you are looking at each hand from the same perspective with both palms and fingers oriented in the same direction, the thumbs will point in different directions.  The same is true for organic molecules).

Polarimetry is one way to designate between these mirror images.  Each chiral structure rotates light in one way or the other.  To identify whether a compound rotates light one way or another it can be placed in a diffraction grid matrix assembly (Figure 4) which can be set up to measure optical rotation.  Polarimeters can be purchased commercially, and these analyses can be conducted quite simply.  However the assembly of instrumentation that measures optical rotation is also quite simple and the section that follows will make it easier to understand the processes involved in polarimetry based on the construction of a polarimeter.

The two main parts of a polarimeter are a light source with a single wavelength and a diffraction grating.  If using regular light as your source, a light polarizer is also needed.  For this simple experiment however a helium-neon laser was utilized as the monochromatic light source with a wavelength of 632.8nm. 

When light would pass through the diffraction grating, a pattern like that seen in Figure 4 is observed. 

In a diffraction grid matrix like the one seen on the left, the points of light are marked on a piece of graph paper on which the laser is projecting for calibration.  

By knowing these properties of light, the angles of the original set up, and the original position of light it can be calculated how much any object placed in the path of the light would rotate the pattern shown in Figure 4 by using the following formula.  

Huygens’ principle. 
mλ=dsinө
where m=any integer
λ=the wavelength
d=Distance and
ө=angle

Once again, it is important to note the control for λ .  If white light was used for a polarimeter, the results would not be able to be measured since the different frequencies of light would produce different angles at the gradient as is seen in (FIGURE -5).

Similarly, if a green laser were put through a gradient at the same time as a red laser at the same distance and angle, the positioning of the grid would be tighter with green due to the shorter wavelength.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The melting point (MP) of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid.   Melting points are often used to classify organic compounds and to obtain an understanding of the purity of an analyte. A large database of MPs are available for use by analytical chemists and forensic scientists.  The more impurity is present, the lower the melting point. Eventually, a minimum melting point will be reached. The mixing ratio that results in the lowest possible melting point is known as the eutectic point.

&lt;/div&gt;

Welcome back! This is the third lesson of &quot;Learn to read, write and pronounce Korean&quot;. In the previous two lessons, you already learned a total of 8 letters. 

In this lesson, you will learn 4 additional basic letters and many new Korean words.  You will even use your knowledge to write some Korean words, rather than just reading them.

==The vowel ㅗ (''o'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅗ (''o'')
| image=ㅗ (o) stroke order.png
| sound=Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg}}
The first new letter is the vowel ㅗ (''o''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅗ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Close-mid back rounded vowel|[o]]]
|}

The vowel ㅗ (''o'') is pronounced like [[w:Close-mid back rounded vowel|the ''ow'' in the American English pronunciation of ''r'''ow''''']] or the ''a'' in the Australian English pronunciation of ''b'''a'''ll'' ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [o]). Since this vowel is much wider than it is tall (unlike the vowels you have learned so far), it would be difficult to fit it beside a consonant in a little square box. Instead, it is written below the initial consonant:

{|
|- align=center
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄹ
| rowspan=2 | =&gt;
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 로
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅗ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''r'' &lt;br/&gt; ''o''
|
| ''ro''
|}

Even when ㅗ (''o'') is already below the consonant, it is still possible to add another consonant below to make the syllable end in a consonant:
{|
|- align=center
| rowspan=3 style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅂ
| rowspan=3 | =&gt;
| rowspan=3 style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 볼
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅗ
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㄹ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''b'' &lt;br/&gt; ''o'' &lt;br/&gt; ''l''
|
| ''bol''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [ [[w:Voiceless bilabial plosive|p]] [[w:Close-mid back rounded vowel|o]] [[w:Alveolar lateral approximant|l]] ]
|
| [pol]

==Final ㅇ (''ieung'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound

The consonant ㅇ (''ieung'') can appear at the end of a syllable. When ㅇ (''ieung'') comes at the beginning of a syllable, it is just a placeholder enabling the syllable to start with a vowel, but when it comes at the end of a syllable, it is pronounced like [[w:Velar nasal|the ''ng'' in ''ri'''ng''''']] and is [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transliterated as ''ng'']].

==The consonant ㄷ (''digeut'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㄷ (''digeut'')
| image=ㄷ (digeut) stroke order.png
| sound=Voiced alveolar plosive.ogg}}
Time to learn the consonant ㄷ (''digeut''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄷ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Voiced alveolar plosive|[d]]] or [[w:Voiceless alveolar plosive|[t]]]
|}

The letter ㄷ (''digeut'') is pronounced similar to [[w:Voiceless alveolar plosive|the ''t'' in ''s'''t'''op'' or ''s'''t'''rain'']]. It is [[w:Aspiration (phonetics)|'''not''' aspirated]], so it does '''not''' sound like the ''t'' in '''''t'''ry'' or '''''t'''oday''.  Many English speakers liken it more to the ''d'' sound.  It is [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transliterated as ''d'' or ''t'']].

==The consonant ㅅ (''siot'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅅ (''siot'')
| image=ㅅ (siot) stroke order.png
| sound=Voiceless_alveolar_sibilant.ogg}}
Meet ㅅ (''siot''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅅ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|[s]]] or [[w:Voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative|[ɕ]]]
|}

The letter ㅅ (''siot'') is usually pronounced like the [[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|''s'' in '''''s'''and'']] and is [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transliterated as ''s'']].  When the following vowel is ㅣ (''i''), though, ㅅ sounds a little different because the body of the tongue is raised toward the palate to make the [i] sound.  So, the syllable 소 (IPA: [so]) sounds like the English word &quot;so&quot;, but the syllable 시 (IPA: [ɕi]) is somewhere between the English &quot;see&quot; and &quot;she&quot;.

===Exercise===
Practise reading:
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:사나|사나]]         | hint = the capital of Yemen

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:사담|사담]]        | hint = a former Iraqi ruler
| eng = (''Sa-dam'') [[w:Saddam|Saddam]]}}

==The vowel 一 (''eu'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=一 (''eu'')
| image=ㅡ (eu) stroke order.png
| sound=Close back unrounded vowel.ogg}}
The last letter for this lesson is 一 (''eu''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 一
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''eu''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Close back unrounded vowel|[ɯ]]] or [[w:Close-mid central unrounded vowel|[ɘ]]]
|}

The vowel 一 (''eu'') looks just like an ordinary horizontal line. It is much wider than tall, so it is also written below the preceding consonant rather than next to it. Its pronunciation is a bit strange for English speakers, somewhat like [[w:Close back unrounded vowel|the ''oo'' of ''b'''oo'''t'' but without rounding the lips]].  In words of foreign origin, it is often an in-between neutral vowel sound used to make consonant clusters more pronounceable for the Koreans.  In such words (and otherwise when unstressed), it often is pronounced similar to [[w:Close-mid central unrounded vowel|the ''u'' of the Southern American English pronunciation of ''n'''u'''t'']], and the guttural &quot;e&quot; sound in French.

for the same.
Or complete the following requirements:
==1. Know the causes of shock and demonstrate its proper treatment.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/First aid/Shock}}

==2. Know the proper steps for rescue breathing.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/First aid/Rescue_breathing}}

'''The following is in addition to the information above for review purposes.  This teaches students how to handle live situations they may come upon.'''

In the next revision of the first aid honors the first aider needs to know what to do when they come across an accident of any type. They will need to know the correct procedures in their correct order. This is not currently addressed anywhere in any of the Basic, Standard, Advanced First Aid Honors. 

It is important to check for a pulse before anyone attempts to carry out CPR.  If the heart is beating you '''do not''' perform CPR. CPR is to maintain the blood flow in place of the beating heart in order to carry the air you are breathing into the victim to the victim's brain. Usually if the heart is not beating there is no breathing, but it is possible for breathing to stop while the heart is still beating.

Whenever an accident or emergency occurs and you are the first person to arrive at the scene, there is one important technique to follow first: Check Call Care (see below). Then use DRABC to care for the victim.

Oh No! There's been an accident! What do I do first?

'''Check Call Care''' 

;Check: To Check for danger, you must first survey the scene to ensure ''your own safety;'' then, do a primary survey. 

;Call: After checking the victim, call an ambulance, giving them a description of the emergency situation as well as the location of the scene. 

;Care: After calling the ambulance, provide appropriate care based on your primary survey of the victim until an ambulance or other advance medical personnel arrives and takes over. 

'''DRABC'''

;Danger: 
Before you try to help the victim, you must determine if the scene is safe. If anything dangerous is present, such as a live wire, a vicious animal, deep water, or fire, you cannot endanger your own life to try to help the victim. Summon trained medical personnel immediately, and they will handle the situation. If you get hurt at the scene, you end up as just another victim for the ambulance to treat. Once you have called for help, you have done all you can in such a situation. 

If the scene is safe, try to determine what may have happened or what caused the accident. Never move the victim to give treatment unless immediate life-threatening danger exists, such as a fire or an unstable structure ready to collapse. 

;Response: 
After determining that the scene is safe, you must check for a response in the victim. You will look, listen and feel to determine if the victim: 
# Is conscious 
# Has an open, unobstructed airway 
# Is breathing 
# Has a heartbeat 
# Is not bleeding severely 

To check for consciousness, gently tap the victim and ask, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; If the victim can speak or cry, he or she is conscious, breathing, and has a pulse. If the victim is unresponsive, he or she may be unconscious, indicating a possibly life-threatening condition. An unconscious person's tongue relaxes and may fall back to block the airway, stopping breathing and eventually the heartbeat. 

Next, if the victim is unconscious, kneel next to the victim's head and check for the ABC's: Airway, Breathing and Circulation. 

;Airway:

To open the airway of an unconscious victim, tilt the head back and lift the chin. 

;Breathing:

To check for breathing, you must look, listen and feel. Place your face above the victim's mouth and nose, so that you can listen and feel for air being exhaled while watching the victim's chest for a gentle rise and fall that occurs when breathing. If the victim is not breathing, you must give 2 slow breaths. This is called rescue breathing. If the breaths do not go in, retilt the head and try again. If the breaths still do not go in, the victim has an obstructed airway, and you may try to clear the airway with a blow between the shoulder blades in the back, or with abdominal thrusts. If the breaths do go in, then continue with your DRABC. 

;Circulation:

To check for circulation, you must check the victim's pulse at one of the carotid arteries, located in the neck on either side of the Adam's apple. Using your index and middle finger (Never use your thumb--it has its own pulse and you may mistake it for that of the victim!) find the Adam's apple and then slide your fingers toward the side of the neck facing you into the groove in the side of the neck. Take at least 5 to 10 seconds to feel for the pulse. If the victim is an infant, locate the pulse in the brachial artery, on the inside of the upper arm in between the elbow and the shoulder. If the victim has a pulse but is not breathing, you must go immediately do Rescue Breathing. If the victim is not breathing and does not have a pulse, go immediately to CPR (if you have been trained). Check the body for signs of any severe external bleeding (bleeding is severe when blood spurts from a wound, and it is life-threatening).

==14. Know how to prevent infection.==
Although infection may occur in any wound, it is a particular danger in wounds that do not bleed freely; in wounds in which torn tissue or skin falls back into place and prevents the entrance of air; and in wounds that involve the crushing of tissues. Incisions, in which there is a free flow of blood and relatively little crushing of tissues, are the least likely to become infected.

There are two types of bacteria commonly causing infection in wounds—aerobic and anaerobic.  The former bacterial live and multiply in the presence of air or free oxygen, while the latter  are bacterial that live and multiply only in the absence of air.  

The principal aerobic bacteria that cause infection, inflammation, and blood poisoning are streptococci and staphylococci, some  varieties of which destroy  red blood  cells.  The staphylococci and  streptococci may be introduced at the time of infliction, or they may be  introduced  to  the  wound later, at the time of first aid treatment or in the hospital if nonsterile instruments  or dressings are employed.

Wash minor wounds immediately with soap and clean water; then dry and paint them with a mild, nonirritating antiseptic. Apply a dressing if necessary. In the first aid environment, do not attempt to wash or clean a large wound, and do not apply an antiseptic to it since it must be cleaned thoroughly at a medical treatment facility. Simply protect it with a large compress or dressing and transport the victim to a medical treatment facility.  After an initial soap and  water cleanup, puncture wounds must also be directed to  a  medical  treatment  facility  for  evaluation.

* Replace the batteries and test your smoke detectors on a regular basis (when adjusting your clocks for daylight savings time, for example).
* Do not smoke or allow anyone else to smoke in your home.
* Never overload circuits or extension cords. Do not place cords and wires under rugs, over nails or in high traffic areas. Immediately shut off and unplug appliances that sputter, spark or emit an unusual smell. Have them professionally repaired or replaced.
* When using appliances follow the manufacturer's safety precautions. Overheating, unusual smells, shorts and sparks are all warning signs that appliances need to be shut off, then replaced or repaired. Unplug appliances when not in use. Use safety caps to cover all unused outlets, especially if there are small children in the home.
* Portable heaters need their space. Keep anything combustible at least three feet away.
* Keep fire in the fireplace. Use fire screens and have your chimney cleaned annually. The creosote buildup can ignite a chimney fire that could easily spread.
* Kerosene heaters should be used only where approved by authorities. Never use gasoline or camp-stove fuel. Refuel outside and only after the heater has cooled.
* Practice an escape plan from every room in the house. Caution everyone to stay low to the floor when escaping from fire and never to open doors that are hot. Select a location where everyone can meet after escaping the house. Get out then call for help.
* Keep your home clean and neat.

==21. What are the basic water safety principles?==
* Learn to swim.
* Swim in areas where a lifeguard is on duty
* Young children and weak swimmers should wear a personal floatation device (PFD) when they are around water.
* Set limits for inexperienced swimmers, such as not allowing them to enter water that is more than chest-deep.
* Inspect swimming areas for hazards such as underwater trees, holes, and swift currents.
* Swim parallel to the shore if caught in a rip tide.
* Get out of the water if there is a risk of a lightning strike.

==22. What are the ways to save a drowning victim without swimming?==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/First aid/Non-swimming rescue}}

==23. What are the basic electrical safety principles?==
* Do not overload circuits or extension cords.
* Only use an extension cord that is rated to handle the current an appliance will use.  An appliance's amperage is listed on the outside of the appliance.
* Shut off the power before working on a circuit.
* Unplug an appliance before servicing it.
* Water and electricity do not mix.  Do not use an electric appliance when standing in a puddle of water or while in a bathtub or shower.
* Do not use a land-line telephone or touch any &quot;wired&quot; appliance during an electrical storm.
* Do not insert anything into an electrical socket other than an electrical plug which is in good condition or an outlet safety cover. 
* Replace broken or frayed electrical cords.

==24. How can you prevent food poisoning?==
Food poisoning is causes by eating food which is contaminated with any infectious or toxic agent such as bacteria or parasites.  The two main ways food becomes contaminated is by improper storage, or by coming into contact with contaminated food (cross-contamination).

===Food Storage===
The basic rule for storing food is to pay attention to the temperature.  Keep hot foods hot, and keep cold foods cold.  Most bacteria will not grow in food that is hotter than 140°F (60°C), and bacterial growth is greatly slowed at temperatures below 40°F (4°C).  It is unsafe to store foods susceptible to bacteria growth between these temperatures.  

Food poisoning is often caused by eating left-overs that were not promptly refrigerated.  As soon as the food temperature falls below 140°F (60°C), it should be refrigerated.  The longer food is left in the &quot;danger zone&quot;, the more bacteria will multiply in it.  If it contains enough bacteria, it will overwhelm the body's immune system and sickness will result.

Be careful about refrigerating large quantities of hot food.  For instance, the potato salad in the center of a two-gallon container can remain warm for ''hours'' after refrigeration - providing ample time for bacteria to multiply.  Divide large quantities of food into smaller containers prior to refrigeration so that the food can cool throughout.

===Cross Contamination===
Cross contamination usually happens during food preparation.  Raw meat and raw eggs should always be treated as if they were contaminated.  Cooking them kills the bacteria and makes them safe to eat.  Do not allow other food to come into contact with raw meat or eggs, or that food will become contaminated.  Do not use the same utensils to handle raw meat and food that is ready to eat.  

Wash your hands before you eat or cook, and always wash your hands after handling raw meat or eggs - before handling any other food.  

Do not allow pets to walk on food preparation surfaces (i.e., don't let the cat walk on the counter top or dining table).  Animals pick up many types of bacteria on their feet, and this is easily transferred to food.  If you do catch your pet walking on the countertop, be sure to disinfect it before using it as a food preparation surface.

{{MatlabNav}}

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
As far as I've seen there is little help out there to help people decipher MATLAB's error messages. Most of the syntax errors are not difficult to fix once you know what is causing them so this is intended to be a guide to identifying and fixing errors in MATLAB code.

Warnings are also shown here as these often lead to errors later.

== Arithmetic errors ==

Usually these are self-explanatory. As a reminder, here are some common functions that cannot be performed and what MATLAB returns (along with a warning for each one):

 a/0 = Inf if a &gt; 0, -Inf if a &lt; 0, and NaN if a = 0.
 log(0) = -Inf
 MATLAB defines 0^0 to be 1.

NaN will very often result in errors or useless results unless measures are taken to avoid propagating them.
 
 ???Error using ==&gt; minus
 Matrix dimensions must agree.

So check the dimensions of all the terms in your expression. Often it is an indexing mistake that causes the terms to be of different size.
If you are using power function you might add a single dot after the parameter. i.e. y=x.^2 instead of y=x^2

Matrix multiplication requires the number of ''columns'' in the first matrix to equal the number of ''rows'' in the second. Otherwise, you get the message:

 ??? Error using ==&gt; mtimes
 Inner matrix dimensions must agree.

Note the difference between this error and the previous one. This error often occurs because of indexing issues OR because you meant to use componentwise multiplication but forgot the dot.

Attempting to take the inverse of a singular matrix will result in a warning and a matrix of Infs. It is wise to calculate the determinant before attempting to take the inverse or, better, to use a method that does not require you to take the inverse since its not numerically stable.

Attempting to take a power of a nonsquare matrix results in the error

 ??? Error using ==&gt; mpower
 Matrix must be square.

This is usually because you meant to use componentwise exponentiation and forgot the dot.

== Indexing errors ==

Indexing is a pain in MATLAB, it is probably one of the hardest things to get down, especially since the syntax for an index is the same as the syntax for a function. One annoying fact is that the names of variables are case sensitive, but the names of functions are NOT. So if you make an array called Abs and you try to index abs(1), it will return 1 no matter what the first value in the array Abs is. Unfortunately, MATLAB will not return an error for this (although MATLAB v2008+ or so will return a warning saying that this will be changed in a later version), so a good rule of thumb is ''never ever name your variables the same as a function''. This clears up some indexing problems.

Some things are rather obvious but take some practice in avoiding:

You cannot try to access part of an array that does not exist yet.

 &gt;&gt; A = [1,3];
 &gt;&gt; A(3)
 ??? Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

Unfortunately, MATLAB doesn't tell you which variable you exceeded the dimensions on if there's more than one so you'll have to check that. This often occurs if, for example, you are using a loop to change which part of an array is accessed, but the loop doesn't stop before you reach the end of the array. This also happens if you end up with an empty matrix as a result of some operation and then try to access an element inside it.

You cannot try to access a negative, complex, noninteger, or zero part of an array; if you do you get this message:

 &gt;&gt; A(-1)
 &gt;&gt; A(i)
 &gt;&gt; A(1.5)
 &gt;&gt; A(0)
 ??? Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals.

Note that MATLAB starts counting at 1, not 0 like C++. And again, it doesn't tell you which index is not real or logical. Also note that if 0 was a ''logical'' 0 (false) then the statement A(0) would be valid and would return all 0 values in the array.

Attempting to use non-standard MATLAB syntax in your indexing will often result in the error:

 &gt;&gt; A(1::, 2)
 ??? A(1::, 2)
         |
 Error: Unexpected MATLAB operator.

The &quot;operator&quot; :: is one of several possible operators that MATLAB does not accept. This could be an example of someone trying to access all rows of A after the first one and the second column, in which case you should use the &quot;end&quot; syntax, as in:

 &gt;&gt; A(1:end, 2)
 ans = 3

Make sure you are careful when using the colon operator, because it does many different things depending on where you put it and misuse often results in these errors. Try putting in one piece of your code at a time and see what it is doing, it may surprise you.

== Assignment errors ==

Ah, assignment, that is using the = sign to give a variable, or certain elements of an array, a particular value.

Let's start with a classic mistake:

 &gt;&gt; a = 2;
 &gt;&gt; if a = 3
 ??? if a = 3
          |
 Error: The expression to the left of the equals sign is not a valid target for an assignment.

This error occurs because you meant to see if &quot;a&quot; equaled 3, but instead you told MATLAB to assign &quot;a&quot; a value of 3. You cannot do that on the same line that the if/while statement is on. The correct syntax is

 &gt;&gt; if a == 3
 &gt;&gt; end

This creates no errors (and you can put anything inside the conditional you want).

You cannot have a normal array with two different classes of data inside it. For example,

 &gt;&gt; A = @(T) (1+T)
 A = 
    @(T) (1+T)
 &gt;&gt; A(2) = 3
 ??? Conversion to function_handle from double is not possible.

For such a purpose you should use cell arrays or struct arrays.

Here's the tricky one. Take a look at the following code:

 &gt;&gt; A = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
 &gt;&gt; A(2,:) = [3,5];
 ??? Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch.
 &gt;&gt; A(2,:) = [1,4,5,6];
 ??? Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch.
 &gt;&gt; A(1:2, 1:2) = [1,2,3,4];
 ??? Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch.

What is happening here? In all three cases, take a look at the dimensions of the left and the right hand sides. In the first example, the left hand side is a 1x3 array but the right side is a 1x2 array. In the second, the left hand side is 1x3 while the right is 1x4. Finally, in the third, the left hand side is 2x2 while the right is 1x4. In all three cases, the dimensions do not match. They must match if you want to replace a specific ''portion'' of an existing variable. It doesn't matter if they have the same number of data points or not (as the third example shows); the dimensions must also be the same, with the exception that if you have a 1xn array on one side and an nx1 on the other MATLAB will automatically transpose and replace for you:

 &gt;&gt; A(2,:) = [1;2;3]
 A =   1     2     3
       1     2     3
       7     8     9

If you do not want this be aware of it!

== Struct array errors ==

Struct arrays are rather complex, and they have a rigid set of rules of what you can and can not do with them. Let us first deal with indexing within struct arrays. Suppose you define the variable &quot;cube&quot; and want to store the volume and the length of one side of two different cubes in a struct array. This can be done as follows:

 &gt;&gt; cube(1).side = 1;
 &gt;&gt; cube(1).volume = 1;
 &gt;&gt; cube(2).side = 2;
 &gt;&gt; cube(2).volume = 8;

This seems like a good way of storing data and it is for some purposes. However, suppose you wanted to abstract the volumes from the struct and store them in one array. You ''cannot'' do it this way:

 &gt;&gt; volumes = cube.volume
 ??? Illegal right hand side in assignment. Too many elements.

You'll notice that if you tell MATLAB to display ''cube.volume'', it will display both values, but reassign the variable ''ans'' each time, because it is treated as two separate variables. In order to avoid the error, you must format 'cube.volume' as an array upon assignment.

 &gt;&gt; volumes = {cube.volume}

You can also write in a separate assignment for each cube but this is more adaptable to larger numbers of cubes.

Just like extracting data, you must input the data one at a time, even if it is the same for all instances of the root (cube).

 &gt;&gt; cube.volForm = @(S) (S^3)
 ??? Incorrect number of right hand side elements in dot name assignment.  Missing [] around left hand side is a likely cause.
 &gt;&gt; cube(:).volForm = @(S) (S^3)
 ??? Insufficient outputs from right hand side to satisfy comma separated
 list expansion on left hand side.  Missing [] are the most likely cause.

Unfortunately missing [] is not the cause, since adding them causes more errors. The cause is that you cannot assign the same value to all fields of the same name at once, you must do it one at a time, as in the following code:

 &gt;&gt; for ii = 1:2
 &gt;&gt;   cube(ii).volForm = @(S) (S^3);
 &gt;&gt; end
 &gt;&gt; cube
 ans = 1x2 struct array with fields:
   volume
   side
   volForm

The same volume formula is then found in both cubes. This problem can be alleviated if you do not split the root, which is highly recommended. For example, you can use a struct like this:

 &gt;&gt; shapes.cubeVol = @(S) (S^3);
 &gt;&gt; shapes.cube(1).vol = 1;
 &gt;&gt; shapes.cube(2).vol = 8;

This avoids having to use a loop to put in the formula common to ''all'' cubes.

== Syntax errors ==

===Parenthesis errors ===
Unlike in C++, you are not required to terminate every line with anything but a line break of some sort. However, there are still syntax rules you have to follow. In MATLAB you have to be especially careful with where you put your parenthesis so that MATLAB will do what you want it to.

A very common error is illustrated in the following:
 
 &gt;&gt; A(1
 ??? A(1
        |
 Error: Expression or statement is incorrect--possibly unbalanced (, {, or [.

This error is simple enough, it means you're missing a parenthesis, or you have too many. Another closely related error is the following:

 &gt;&gt; A(1))
 ??? A(1))
         |
 Error: Unbalanced or misused parentheses or brackets.

MATLAB tries to tell you where the missing parenthesis should go but it isn't always right. Thus for a complex expression you have to go through it very carefully to find your typo. A useful trick is to try to set a breakpoint a line after the offending line. It won't turn red until the error is corrected, so keep trying to correct it and saving the file until that breakpoint turns red. Of course, after this you have to make sure the parenthesis placement makes sense, otherwise you'll probably get another error related to invalid indecies or invalid function calls.

=== String errors ===

There are two ways that you can create a string; use the ' ''string'' ' syntax, or type two words separated by only whitespace (not including line breaks), as in

 &gt;&gt; save file.txt variable

In this line, ''file.txt'' and ''variable'' are passed to the ''save'' function as strings. It is an occasional mistake to forget a parenthesis and accidentally try and pass a string to a function that does not accept strings as input:

 &gt;&gt; eye 5
 ??? Error using ==&gt; eye
 Only input must be numeric or a valid numeric class name.

These should not be hard to spot because the string is color-coded purple. Things like this occur if you uncomment a line of text and forget to change it. 

Forgetting the closing ' in the other syntax for a string results in an obvious error:

 &gt;&gt; A = 'hi
 ??? A = 'hi
         |
 Error: A MATLAB string constant is not terminated properly.

The unterminated string is color-coded red to let you know that it is not terminated, since it's otherwise easy to forget.

A common mistake with strings is to try to compare them using the '==' operator. This does not work if the strings are not the same length, because strings are '''arrays of characters''', and to compare arrays with '==' they must be the same size. To compare two strings you must use the '''strcmp''' function:

 &gt;&gt; 'AA' == 'AaA'
 ??? Error using ==&gt; eq
 Matrix dimensions must agree.
 &gt;&gt; strcmp('AA', 'AaA')
 ans = 0
 &gt;&gt; strcmp('A', 'a')
 ans = 0
 &gt;&gt; strcmp('AA', 'AA')
 ans = 1

Note that MATLAB strings are case sensitive, 'A' and 'a' are not the same string.

Also beware that the ' character for beginning and ending strings is the same character indicating transposition. So if you close a string and don't begin it, you will most likely end up with an error about an undefined variable (if you're trying to transpose an undefined variable) or just get really weird results because you transposed something you didn't intend to.

=== Other miscellaneous errors ===

You cannot leave trailing functions, and if you do MATLAB gives you an error that is similar but not exactly the same as that for a missing parenthesis, since it doesn't want to venture a guess:

 &gt;&gt; A = 1+3+
 ??? A = 1+3+
             |
 Error: Expression or statement is incomplete or incorrect.

These usually are not hard to spot, and often result from forgetting the &quot;...&quot; necessary to split a line.

The double colon is not the only &quot;unexpected MATLAB operator&quot;, there is also &quot;..&quot;, &quot;....&quot;, and several other typos that generate this error.

If you accidentally type the ` character you get the error:

 &gt;&gt; ??? `
        |
 Error: The input character is not valid in MATLAB statements or expressions.

This usually occurs because you intended to put a &quot;1&quot; in the equation but missed the key.
Another possibility is that you named your m-file with unusual letters for computers. Like in Germany &quot;ä, ü or ö&quot;. Be sure to name your m-files only with usual letters and no capital letters.

== Function Calling errors ==

It is quite possible to try to call a function that doesn't exist, such as:

 &gt;&gt; samplemat = [1 2; 1 4]
 &gt;&gt; A = eigen(samplemat);
 ??? Undefined command/function 'eigen'.

This can happen because you do not know the name of the function that performs the operation intended (for example, if you wanted to compute the eigenvalues of matrix &quot;samplemat&quot;, you would want to call ''eig'', not ''eigen''). It is often useful to pull up MATLAB's help (go to '''help -&gt; product help ''' or type ''doc'' into the command prompt) and do a search for the operation you want.

If you're trying to call a function '''you''' created and you get this error, there are several possible reasons:

# The m-file must be in one of the paths listed under '''file -&gt; set path''', or must be in your current directory
# The m-file must have the same name as the name in the function declaration. You must be aware of this especially if you change the name of your functions, you must also change the name of the file or MATLAB will not find the right function!

If MATLAB finds the function, it will attempt to run it. However, there are several potential pitfalls to avoid in calling functions. It is necessary to know the nature of the input and output arguments of a given function in order to call it. For MATLAB's built-in functions, this information is found in the documentation, or by typing

 &gt;&gt; help ''functionname''

It is a good idea to set up some comments so that the help function can read them in your own code as well, so you can keep track of how all your functions work and what they do at a quick reference. To do this, note that the help function reads only the block of comments directly under the function declaration, so for example, if you write a function like this:

 function outvars = myfunc(invars)
 % function outvars = myfunc(invars)
 % Outputs outvars
 % All of this is outputted when you type &gt;&gt; help myfunc &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 % But this wouldn't be

save the function as &quot;myfunc.m&quot;, and type

 &gt;&gt; help myfunc

it will output:

 &gt;&gt; function outvars = myfunc(invars)
 Outputs outvars
 All of this is outputted when you type &gt;&gt; help myfunc

Most functions (not all however) require at least one input argument, and calling it with too few will result in an error:

 &gt;&gt; A = ode45()
 ??? Error using ==&gt; ode45
 Not enough input arguments.  See ODE45.

You cannot call a function with too many input arguments either:

 &gt;&gt; A = plus(1,2,3)
 ??? Error using ==&gt; plus
 Too many input arguments.

Input arguments must be in a format expected by the function. This will be very function-specific, so see the documentation or help for details on what they expect. For example, the first argument to ODE45 and other ODE solvers has to be the function handle; if you pass arguments in the wrong order you will be given an error to that effect.

You can choose how many of the output arguments you want out of those available by using the bracket notation. You can choose to save fewer outputs than the function offers, but you cannot assign more variables than the function can output:

 &gt;&gt; A = [1,2;3,4]
 D = eig(A); %one output argument
 [V,D] = eig(A); %two output arguments
 [V,D,Mistake] = eig(A);
 ??? Error using ==&gt; eig
 Too many output arguments.

All assigned output arguments must also be of the correct class if you are replacing parts of an array that already exists (see the section on assignment for more on this). If you're creating a new variable with the output, this is not an issue.

== Control Flow errors ==

The most common one by far is if you forget the 'END', which is an issue in M-file functions. It will tell you that 'at least one END is missing' and try to tell you where the loop or conditional statement starts.

If you have ''too many'' END statements and more than one function in an M-file, MATLAB may give you a cryptic message about not formatting the functions correctly. This is because ''all functions in the same M-file must either end with an END statement or not''. It doesn't matter which, but if you have too many END statements in one of the functions, MATLAB will think your function is ending early and will get confused when the next function in line does not have an END statement at the end of it. So if you get this confusing message, look for extra END statements and it should fix your problem.  If the message is displayed when publishing, say to an HTML file, the problem may be an erratic hierarchical indentation.  Try selecting all and then hitting cntrl-i for automatic indentation to fix the problem.

Having an extra END in a 'switch' statement gives a message that you used the 'case' keyword illegally, because MATLAB thinks you ended the switch statement early, and 'case' has no meaning outside a 'switch' statement.

== Other errors ==

There are numerous types of errors that do not generate errors from the MATLAB compiler, which have to do with calling the wrong function, using the wrong operation, using the wrong variable, introducing an infinite loop, and so on. These will be the hardest to fix, but with the help of the MATLAB debugger, they will be easier to find. See [[MATLAB Programming/Debugging M Files|Debugging M Files]] for details on how to use the debugger.

{{recipe}}

This is one of those recipes from the 70s with lots of already-processed ingredients.  I love it.  It's very moist because the syrupy strawberry mixture starts on top and soaks through as the cake bakes.
==Ingredients==
* 1 c mini marshmallows
* 2 c (2 10 oz. packages) frozen, sliced strawberries, completely thawed in syrup
* 1 pkg (3oz) strawberry jello (known as ''jelly'' outside of North America)
* 2 1/4 c flour
* 1 1/2 c sugar
* 3 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 c shortening
* 1 c milk
* 3 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
==Procedure==
#Generously grease bottom of pan (13&quot; x 9&quot;). 
#Sprinkle marshmallows evenly over bottom of pan.
#Thoroughly combine completely thawed strawberries and syrup with dry jello; set aside. 
#In a large mixing bowl, combine remaining ingredients.
#Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.
#Pour batter over marshmallows - spread out.  Spoon strawberry mixture evenly over batter. 
#Bake 350 deg 45-60 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
#Serve warm or cool with ice cream or whipped cream.

After &quot;aurora&quot; or &quot;se fue&quot;, the leader takes hold of the right hand of the follower in front of him with his left hand, takes her hand out to the left and makes her do an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]] and [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].

{{Question-answer|title=Where does the name Generic come from?|question=
Since Java 1.5 a new feature was added to the Java language called [[Java Programming/Generics|Generic]]. It is similar to C++ Templates. Why the name Generic was given to this feature? Anybody who knows??
|answer=Generics come from other languages, see article on [[w:Generic programming]] for more information.}}

{{Question-answer|title=What is CORBA?|question=What is Corba? What are the components of Corba and also discuss the working of corba? What is the difference between RMI and CORBA?|answer=CORBA is language independent &quot;Remote Method Invocation&quot; like [[Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation|RMI]]. [[Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation|RMI]] only works with Java, CORBA can be used with any languages. For more information see: [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture]].

[[Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation|RMI]] is much simpler to use than CORBA, so in an only Java environment RMI should be used.

If you need to call methods between different language environments, use [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]]. With [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]] a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.}}

{{Question-answer|title=Vector class on Java|question=Can Vector support nonhomogenious data?|answer=The Vector class can receive any object (so it can not receive primitive types), even different types of data in the same Vector.

The Vector and Hashtable classes are legacy classes that come from the 1.0 version of Java and have enforced synchronized methods resulting in performance issues on systems that does not require this characteristic. Additional classes were added at 1.2, those are ArrayList and HashMap, without synchronization. Both syncronized and not syncronized versions are implementing the List and Map interfaces, respectivelly.

Since Java 1.5, there is Generics, which allows you to specify that you want a container, like an ArrayList, to contain only certain types of things. This allows you to guarantee that what you are getting out of the container is a certain type at compile time, without explicitly casting it. This is safer (you avoid cast errors at run time) and makes your code more readable and understandable. You should use generics whenever possible.}}

{{Question-answer|title=I wanted to configure my PC so I could run Java program?|question=How can I run Java programs on a PC?
|answer=Java applications can be run in the same way as any other program if they are found in .JAR or .JNLP packages.  If you are trying to run a .class file, simply open a command line prompt and type &lt;tt&gt;java MyClass&lt;/tt&gt;, where MyClass is the name of the class file you are trying to launch. }}
 
{{Question-answer|title=What are the equivalent String functions in Java to the functions LEFT(), MID(), RIGHT() in BASIC?|question=What are the equivalent String functions in Java to the functions LEFT(), MID(), RIGHT() in BASIC?
|answer=The Java String class provides substring() methods that should provide what you need. For example, mid(str, a, b) in Visual Basic would be something like str.substring(a, a+b).}}

{{Question-answer|title=What is a class and how does it accomplish data hiding?|question=What is a class and how does it accomplish data hiding?
|answer=A class is a template to create objects. Methods and variables declared private can not be access outside of the class. Those can be only accessed internally, it means that they are hidden from the outside.
It makes programming esier because it is garantide that those internal information won't be messed up by outside code.}}

{{Question-answer|title=Can a keyword used for variable name?|question=Can a keyword used for variable name?
|answer=No. Keywords are resirved by the compiler and can not be used for variables.}}

{{Question-answer|title=What are the jump statements available in Java?|question=What are the jump statements available in Java?
|answer=Java does not have jump statements.
The {{java:goto}} is reserved, but not used.
The {{java:break}} statement is close to a jump statetement, but the destination of the jump is well defined. It breaks/jumps out from a loop, or a {{java:switch}} statement.}}

{{Question-answer|title=What is automatic type conversion?|question=What is automatic type conversion?
|answer=}}

{{Question-answer|title=Can a constructor be private?|question=Can a constructor be private?
|answer=Yes. Singleton constructors are private. When the constructor is private no object of that class can be created outside of that class. How and when an object can be created of that class is defined by that class. }}

{{Question-answer|title=What is the differance between composition and aggregation?|question=What is the differance between composition and aggregation?
|answer=}}

{{Question-answer|title=Why a char uses 2 bytes of memory in java while it occupies only one byte in C++?|question=Why a char uses 2 bytes of memory in java while it occupies only one byte in C++?
|answer=Java uses [[w:unicode|unicode]], while C++ uses [[w:ASCII|ASCII]]. Unicode consists of a repertoire of about 100,000 characters, which is much more than what the ASCII character-set can represent. See also [[Java Programming/Syntax/Unicode Source]] }}

&lt;li&gt;A Java file located on a CD should be opened the same way as a Java file on a hard disk. You should use the path of the file on the CD. If you want to open a file from the command line or a prompt, use the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command to move to the folder and open your Java file as you would open a text file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not confuse an object of a class and a field of a class. &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; is a field of the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; class and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; is an object of the &lt;code&gt;PrintStream&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; class is linked to the standard output at Java startup. That's why you must use the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/li&gt;

== main() function ==

{{Question-answer|title=main() function|question=
Who calls the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function in C?
|answer=The operating system calls the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function, when the program starts. At that point the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function has already been translated to machine code, which is stored in an executable file along with the rest of the program. The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is also being used for command line parameter passing to the program; the compiler adds the operating system specific calls to do that.}}

== multiple main ==

Q. Can we have a multiple main in a single program? Can we create a prog without a main function?

A. Each C program has one and '''only one''' &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function. There will be an unresolved link error, if the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is omitted from a C program. So the answer to the second question is that you must have a &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function defined in a C program.

== Run time environment ==
Q. What is run time environment in C?

A. During development, the programmer needs to be concerned with two types of errors. One is called the compilation error, the other is called the run time errors. Compilation error occurs when the C source program is being compiled to native code. When the compiler catches a error in the code, it will report to the programmer to fix it. Higher the programming language the more types of errors it would catch. Not all bugs can be caught by the compiler. Run time bugs like divide by zero can not be caught by the compiler.

C language add some primitive run time error checking and exit the program with some information about the problem and its location, by giving a so called a core-dump.

This run time error checking program added to the executable is called the '''run time environment''' to the program.

== Learning on a mac ==

Q. Can I use C on a Mac? 

A. Yes, C is the most wide spread portable high level language.

== fscanf ==

Q. How can i use the file operator &quot;fscanf&quot; to read a string or an array of characters from a test file?

A. You can do it with code as shown below

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
 main()
 {
    FILE *fp;
    char string[20];
    clrscr();
    if((fp = fopen(&quot;balaram.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;)) != NULL) // Opens the file if exists
    {
       fseek(fp,0,SEEK_SET);            // This is optional, to place the seek pointer to begining of the file
       fscanf(fp,&quot;%s&quot;,string);          // Reads the sequence of characters to the array(String) 'string'
       printf(&quot;The String is : %s\n&quot;,string);
    }
    else
    {
       printf(&quot;FILE CAN NOT BE OPENED\n&quot;);
    }
    fclose(fp);
    getch();
 }
&lt;/source&gt;




== Why binary files? ==

Q1. What is the need to do file manipulations in binary format? 

A1. It depends on the application. Your application may store some information in file, that it reads back in later. The easiest way is to define a 'struct', that can have both interger and character values. When you read your data back, just map to your 'struct'. If different application created the file, make sure that you are using the same 'struct' and both C program compiled on the same (32 or 64 bit) platform. Integer length are different on 32 and 64 bit platform.

Q2. If so, what data type is used in C to represent &quot;binary data&quot;?

A2. The binary data can contain both integer, double, and or character values. You need to know the format though, where one data value starts and ends. 
The best way is to create 'struct' for a record. You read in the record from the file as unsigned character string and then map to the 'struct'.

== Is return type compulsory in C &amp; why it is compulsory in C++? ==
Both in C and C++ the return type from a function is not compulsory. If you have a function that do not need to return a value, use the 'void' type. In that case the 'return' keyword is optional, but can be used without specifying any value.

== Homework assignments ==

Q) Write a program that count the no. of lines and characters in file.

A) We don't do your homework here.

== How to install a C Compiler ==

Any C compiler that can be downloaded or installed (whether the freeware versions of Turbo C, Dev-CPP, Visual Studio Express or Gcc) should either have an installer or have sufficient instructions to properly install their product. 

== Turbo C variable length string data elements that are delimited by &quot;*&quot;, need parsed ==

Hi,

I'm trying to code (in Borland Turbo C).
Have many variable length string text data elements that are delimited by &quot;*&quot;, 

Example 
David*Smukinhoven*123456 Main St.*HongKong*China*(888)488-6359**0* *
Jon*Eva*10 Downing Street*USA*Japan*(555)654-9874*20106*17.02*yen*


I need to break up the string into different fields so I can put the data into different forms.

I have a little experience with C; I do not want to use C++.

ANY HELP will be Apprciated

----
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
Use &lt;code&gt; char *strtok(char *s1, const char *s2); &lt;/code&gt; function.
See example bellow:

 char *s1 = &quot;David*Smukinhoven*123456 Main St.*HongKong*China*(888)488-6359**0* *Jon*Eva*10 Downing Street*USA*Japan*(555)654-9874*20106*17.02*yen*&quot;;
 char *parsed = char *[100];
 char *elem = strtok( s1, &quot;*&quot; );
 int i = 0;
 while (  elem != null )
 {
    /* Strores the element */ 
    parsed[i++] = elem;
 
    /* Get the next element */
    elem = strtok( null, &quot;*&quot; );
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

== API or function database for C? ==

Q) When I was learning Java, the professor showed the class an official API site (if I remember the term correctly), which showed documented all the functions that could be used listed by package, including inputs, outputs, and author(s) notes.  Is there a similar site for all the functions in C?  I did some Google work and found some sites that mentioned some packages, but I was wondering if there was an official site that had everything, or at least the more important packages?

A) The main API used with the C language is known as the Standard C Library. The list of standard libraries can be found at [[C Programming/Standard libraries]], but does not include platform specific functions or third party libraries.  You will need to consult the programming documentation for your platforms as necessary. 

== Regarding memory allocation ==

Q) Where the memory will be allocated for an array declaration? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Parthisands|Parthisands]] ([[User talk:Parthisands|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Parthisands|contribs]]) 2007-06-14T04:37:54.&lt;/small&gt;

A) For automatic declarations (such as those created on a function call), they will appear on the stack.  For declarations made either statically or via malloc, they are located in the heap.

:A: Use a text editor. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:00, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

== about memory management ==

Q) What is the output if we use free(NULL);

A) free() does not ever &quot;output&quot; anything. It is acceptable to call free(NULL); no operation will be performed. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] ([[User talk:Spoon!|talk]]) 02:25, 17 May 2008 (UTC)

== memory management  ==

A) There's no output, you should learn a bit more man.

== howto do graphics programming ==

How to show graphics using C ?

A) There is no direct support (since it is platform dependent), there are 3rd party libraries that provide such function, see what you get by using the terms ACE, SDL or OpenGL or DirectX on a WEB search engine.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:06, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

== ABOUT C HEADER FILE ==

HI,
Q. WHICTH HEADER FILES ARE NEED TO INCLUDE IN C PROGRAMS AND WHICTH NOT?
EXAMPLE:-
MATH.H HEADER FILE IS NEED TO INCLUDE BUT STDIO.H HEADER FILE IS NOT NEED TO INCLUDE WHEN WE SAVE PROGRAM WITH .C EXTENTION.

A) The answer to your question is on the book in [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Preprocessor#.23include here]], it explains the use of the include directive you must also understand the functions you are calling to know what to include. (PS: Next time try to write in lowercase it is good etiquette, as is it seems that you are shouting, see [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline]] for other common practices.)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:21, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

== Multiple return values? ==

Q: Can a C function have multiple return values?

A: Basicaly no. A C function can return only one value. However, that return value can be a pointer to the first element of an array, or a pointer to a multiple value struct. In that case anything can be returned. In addition, the function can take in additional pointer arguments, where the function &quot;fills in&quot; information in the locations pointed to by the pointers (which are usually variables in the caller function), thus effectively returning additional information.

A) [[C Programming/Simple math]]

== interrupts  ==

What are innterrupts?
: Interrupts are external events that cause program execution to suspend and resume at a different place.  The &quot;different place&quot; is an interrupt service routine, or ISR.  When the ISR completes, the program resumes execution at the point where it was suspended.  

they are of how many types?
:There are two major types of interrupts: hardware and software.  Hardware interrupts are generated by an event in hardware, such as the arrival of a character from a UART, a key being pressed on a keyboard, or an anomally detected by the processor (such as division by zero, or access to an illegal memory address).  A software interrupt is generated by software.  Software interrupts can be generated by a program as a method of communication.

How to use interrupts in 'c'?
:You must consult the documentation for the operating system you are programming for.  In some cases, you can raise them directly, but in other cases, you must use the functions provided by the platform.

== Variables ==

what does static variable mean?
: A static variable is one that has persistent storage.  It is not accessible outside its scope, but it retains its value as the program exits and re-enters its scope.  There are two &quot;scopes&quot; to consider.  The first is when a static variable is declared in a file, but outside of a function.  Such a variable is available to all functions in the file, but not available to functions outside the file.  The second scope to consider is a static variable declared inside a function.  In this case, the variable is accessible only to that function.  When the function exits, the variable does not disappear, but retains its value, so that when the program re-enters the function, it's still there in exactly the same state as when the function was previously exited.

what is a pointer?
:A pointer is the address of a variable.  The variable can be a scalar, an array, or a structure.  It could also be a function.

what is a structure?
:A structure is an organized blob of data.  It consists of programmer-defined elements that have been grouped together.

what are the difference between structures &amp; arrays?
:Arrays are a group of variables all having the same type.  The elements of the array can be indexed numerically (as in x[5] - that's the fifth element in the array.  Structures are similar, but do not have the restriction of requiring every element within to be of the same type.  A structure could contain (for example) an int, an array of 25 chars, and a pointer.  Each element in the structure is ''named'', and it is accessed by its element name.

in header files whether functions are declared or defined?
:You could do either, but if the header file is included by more than one c file, the program might not link.  Exceptions to this are functions that are declared as static, and functions that are declared as inline.  However, it's not generally a good idea to define a function in a header file.  It is a good practice, however, to define the function's prototype (i.e, its interface) in a header file.  The prototype defines the number of arguments to the function, as well as the type of each argument.  It also defines the type of the function's return value.

== Header files ==

What is the use of '#' in '#include&lt;header file name&gt;'?

The pound symbol marks the start of a preprocessor directive; see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Compiling#preprocessor C Programming/Compiling]
[[Special:Contributions/66.240.31.42|66.240.31.42]] ([[User talk:66.240.31.42|talk]]) 17:02, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== Memory Allocation ==

Q) When we use &lt;code&gt;int x[SIZE];&lt;/code&gt; compiler make &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int)*SIZE&lt;/code&gt; bytes in the data segment of the program code. When we use function &lt;code&gt;void *malloc(unsigned int size);&lt;/code&gt; at run time the program requests the operating system to allocated the block of size bytes.  But, what does the &lt;code&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; operator do? Does it also request the operating system?

A) The new operator does nothing in C, since C is not C++.  Even if it was implemented in C,  it would allocate it on the heap provided by the operating system.

== Swapping values ==
Q) how can we interchange the value in a program without storing the value

A) See [[wikipedia:XOR swap algorithm|XOR swap algorithm]] on Wikipedia, and not that it has problems. 

== Games in C ==

Q) We can make games using JAVA. Is it possible to do it with C and what is the basic knowledge in C is required.

A) There's plenty of third-party libraries available for C that let you do this. 


== How can I differ ==

How can I differentiate between programing in C, C+ and C++

* C+ isn't a language.  C++ uses additional features, such as classes and templates, and enforces a slightly stronger type checking. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 14:56, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

== ctype.h ==

Why do we use ctype.h header file?

* It provides access to functions that quickly determine the nature of the character (i.e. isupper, islower, etc.)  These functions are locale specific in the event you are programming in a non-English language. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 14:56, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

== Programs without main ==
Can you write a C program without using main function in c language?
* You can write a program without using main() in the C language.  Aside from some platforms that require you to use a different program startpoint, C is capable of creating freestanding applications (that don't require an operating system) which require you to define the necessary startpoint yourself.  The procedure for doing this depends on the compiler you are using, as well as the target platform.  However, you probably should learn the C language before attempting this. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 19:19, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

== about C language ==

I want to learn C language.How I begin C language.

i would like ,advantage\disadvatage c programming

A. go to this site 
   http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_programming
   and download the PDF version.this will be the best source for learning C . for amateurs!!

  learning C means learning the basics of programming..!! 
  if u want to learn any other languages like 
  JAVA, Basic,C++ etc ...first start with C!

== main() ==

can u  give some idea about command line parameters used in main()?And what is it's importance?

Answer:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int main (int argc, char **argv);
&lt;/source&gt;

The number of command line arguments (including the program itself) is found in argc.  argv contains pointers to the set of command line arguments, where argv[0] is a string to the program, argv[1] to the first pointer, and so on.

== Reserved keywords ==

Q) What is the definition of reserved keyword?

A) A reserved keyword is something that is either in use with by the C standard, or expected to be used in the near future. 

== about enumerated datatype ==

Q) What is an enumeration?

A) An enumeration is a set of values.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
enum numbers {ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, numbers is an enumeration, and allows you to use the words &quot;ZERO&quot;, &quot;ONE&quot;, &quot;TWO&quot;, and &quot;THREE&quot; as identifiers to represent the corresponding numbers. 

== Pointer bounds ==
Q) How can be check that a pointer may be outside its bound?

A) By keeping track of the data. If you let a pointer carelessly drift out of bounds, then you're already doing something wrong.  The easiest ways to protect against this is to either use a sentry value (e.g. null terminations on strings) or to know the number of current records.</text>

      <comment>/* Example XSLT Usage: */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Purpose: ==

Run a macro and insert the output into your XSLT.

== Arguments: ==


RenderMacroContent(String Text, Int32 PageId)

Text: an encoded version of the template 'macro' code (see below for proper encoding)

PageId: NodeID for the node you want to use for the content for the macro

== String Text Encoding Instructions: ==
When you are putting the code for your macro in a template it looks something like this:

&lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&quot;LatestNews&quot; numberOfItems=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&gt;

To encode this for the RenderMacroContent function follow these steps:

1. Change '&lt;' to '&amp;amp;lt;'
:::&amp;amp;lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&quot;LatestNews&quot; numberOfItems=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&gt;

2. Change '&gt;' to '&amp;amp;gt;'
:::&amp;amp;lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&quot;LatestNews&quot; numberOfItems=&quot;3&quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&amp;amp;gt;

3. Change '&quot;' to '&amp;amp;quot;'
:::&amp;amp;lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&amp;amp;quot;LatestNews&amp;amp;quot; numberOfItems=&amp;amp;quot;3&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&amp;amp;gt;

4. When you put this into the XSLT, enclose the whole thing in single quotes:
:::umbraco.library:RenderMacroContent('&amp;amp;lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&amp;amp;quot;LatestNews&amp;amp;quot; numberOfItems=&amp;amp;quot;3&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&amp;amp;gt;'...

== Example XSLT Usage: ==

&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;umbraco.library:RenderMacroContent('&amp;lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&amp;quot;LatestNews&amp;quot; numberOfItems=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&amp;gt;', @id)&quot; disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;

This string should of course be encoded, so it would look like this:

&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;umbraco.library:RenderMacroContent('&amp;amp;lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&amp;amp;quot;LatestNews&amp;amp;quot; numberOfItems=&amp;amp;quot;3&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&amp;amp;gt;', @id)&quot; disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;

== Little Bonus: XSLT to do the encoding for you ==

If you want to be able to just &quot;cut &amp; paste&quot; the standard template macro code into your XSLT and have it encoded properly, add this bit of code to a new XSLT:

&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;Macro&quot;&gt; 
	&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;{PUT YOUR TEMPLATE MACRO CODE HERE}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;MacroEncoded&quot;&gt; 
	&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;umbraco.library:Replace(umbraco.library:Replace(umbraco.library:Replace($Macro, '&amp;quot;', '&amp;amp;quot;'), '&amp;gt;', '&amp;amp;gt;'), '&amp;lt;', '&amp;amp;lt;')&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

Then use this to render the encoded XSLT to a test page in your browser (which you can then cut &amp; paste into your XSLT code):

&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$MacroEncoded&quot; /&gt;

{{BookCat}}


== Version 4 Warning ==
Warning, Umbraco 4 macros with new templates have a different syntax however the XSLT extention still requires the old v3 one so if you copy the macro inserted into a v 4 template you need to change it to v3

i.e.

&lt;umbraco:Macro Alias=&quot;Name&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;&lt;/umbraco:Macro&gt;

becomes

&lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&quot;Name&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;&lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&gt;

''(Please replace the following questions with their answers)''

What is &quot;Noah's Classifieds&quot;?
Is it a computer, an algorithm, a particular software application, a programming language, a library of support code, a small fish, or what?

What do people do with &quot;Noah's Classifieds&quot;?
Is it purely a learning tool as a toy example to help programmers learn OOP?
If I'm not a programmer, is there anything useful I could do with it?

What prerequisites do I need to have before using &quot;Noah's Classifieds&quot;?
Do I need to have PHP installed on my computer before using it?
Can I use it on my [http://noahsclassifieds.org/forum/index.php?topic=3401.0 MacOS, Windows, or Linux box]?
Will it run on my server that has no display plugged into it?
Will it run on my laptop that has [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html no internet connection]?


Who currently maintains &quot;Noah's Classifieds&quot;?

== The database ==
Listed in perceived order of importance;
=== n_user ===
User Accounts are stored here.
=== n_item ===
Classified Listings are in this database.
=== n_category ===
The sections shown on the front page are enumerated here.
=== n_settings, n_ecommsettings, n_globalstat ===
Various administrative settings for the page are held in these databases.
=== the others ===
Other tables hold other sorts of information to control cross referencing, cron jobs, email notifications, search and rss functionality, etc. Most of this information can be easily controlled through the Admin section of the site. To manually create a new Admin account, set isAdm to 1 for any existing user in the n_user table.

=== Pages that make database connections ===
The pages which connect to the database all reside in the gorum directory, and are; /gorum/dbinstall.php, /gorum/dbproperty.php, and /gorum/installlib.php. Additionally, /feedcreator/feedcreator.class.php makes a query to the database, and many files in the /app/ and /gorum/ folders contain calls to the executeQuery functions defined by /gorum/dbproperty.php.

== The sourcecode {{stage short|00%|Sep 01, 2006}}==

== The Tasks of the Variables ==

=== $registrationType ===

=== $otherTamplate ===

If this Variable is set (uncomment the related line in constants.php to do so) Noah's uses an unusual template. A template takes only effect on the look and style of Noah's Classifieds software. The file must be stored in the root directory of Noah's and needs a number in front of the suffix (e.g. template4.php). This index is declared to the system as our variable $otherTemplate.

(Noah includes the template-file while loading include.php wether it's the default one or not - line 24.)

== File and Function Descriptions ==


=== config.php ===
The config.php contains just the parameters for the database. The second - really little - task of this file is to construct the $dbHost string, addicted to whether the port is given or not.

=== item.php ===
The item.php comes in include.php into play. At first, if the variable ''$immediateAppear'' isn't set yet, the script sets it to &quot;true&quot;. If needed or not at the moment, (I guess it's always needed) the variable ''item_typ'' is build at the beginning of that script.

=== object.php ===

Anything that communicates with the database is derived from the object class. Items (adverts), categories, users and even the global settings. Start at this class because most of its functions aren't ever overloaded.

=== gorum/gorum.php ===

This File is included in index.php and itself includes another bunch of files. 

include(&quot;./gorum/constants.php&quot;);
if( $registrationType!=User_noUserFromGorum ) include(&quot;./gorum/loginlib.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/gorumlib.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/object.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/form.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/generformlib.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/roll.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/dbproperty.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/privilegeproperty.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/htmllist.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/tools.php&quot;);
include(&quot;./gorum/showdetails.php&quot;);

Furthermore it seems like it differs the type of user and loads user_simple.php or in the other case user_email.php.

=== gorum/roll.php ===

This contains the roll class. Roll is simply the class that handles link generation. It is nice because it adds a memory capability.

== The classes {{stage short|00%|Sep 01, 2006}}==
Unusually, this webapplication is full objective. As mentioned before, Noah's works with classes - in fact a lot. For example the ad itself is permanently handled as an object. This is useful but it needs to get used to.&lt;br&gt;
The most important one is the class called &quot;Object&quot;. This is the parent one I will introduce next.
=== Object - the mothership ===

Traditional File Approach

Most organisations began information processing on a small scale, buying a computer for perhaps one or two individual applications, and then computerising other departments one by one. Applications were developed independently, and files of information relevant to one particular department were created and processed by dozens or even hundreds of separate programs. 
This led to several problems such as:

Data redundancy - The same data was duplicated in many different files. 

Data inconsistency - When the same items of data were held in several different file, the data has to be updated in each separate file when it changes.

&lt;center&gt;'''Appendix Purpose and Scope'''&lt;/center&gt;
This Appendix to the '''C++ Programming''' book will attempt to provide users a complementary practical understanding of the [[w:C++|C++ programming language]]. It will be an aggregation dependent on the lessons and theoretical content already presented on the '''C++ Programming''' book, so to consistently list all '''compilable example programs''' that are used in the main book, this appendix will be useful to refresh your knowledge in a hands-on approach, guarantee performance and permit easier maintenance of the used code and test derivations of the examples used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an open work, if you find any problems with terms or concepts '''you can help by contribute to it''', '''your participation is needed and welcomed!''' You are also welcome to state any preference, shortcomings or vision for the actual book content, structure or other conceptual matters, see [[Talk:C++ Programming|this Wikibook's discussion page for the right forum for participating]].

== [[C++ Programming/About the Book|About the book]] ==
&lt;center&gt;'''Referencing the [[C++ Programming/Chapters|learning chapters]]'''&lt;/center&gt;
{{SideBox|1=If you have questions related to C++ that are not addressed on the book, ask at the [[Talk:C++ Programming/Q&amp;A|Q&amp;A]] or check&lt;br&gt;[[Subject:C++ programming language]]}}
== Preamble ==
'''C++ Programming by examples''' can be used as an alternative approach to learn the language, by putting practice over theory. In any case this will require you to have greater level of expertise. You will need to understand how C++ files are organized, have and know how to operate a compiler and understand some nuances that will not be visible in code. Do understand that you will be able to read and program in C++, to some degree but to get to really understand the language, theory, not only practice, is required. Use the primary book as a reference anytime you have a doubt.

In the book we cover [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler#Where to get a compiler|where to get a compiler]] (see the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|Compiler Section]]), this will provide you the tool needed to proceed. If you don't have, want or need a compiler installed on you machine you can use a WEB free compiler available at http://ideone.com (or http://codepad.org but you will have to change the code not to require interactive input).

== '''Chapter 1:''' ''C++ a multi-paradigm language'' ==
----
::This is the initial chapter of the book, it  attempts to introduce the C++ language to the reader, speak of the language history and its evolution. providing an overview in an attempt to convey the reasons why one should come to know the language.
::To understand C++, first one must establish what a programming language is, how they relate with each other (Low-level/High-level), the different programming paradigms, the Procedural programming and Object-oriented programming (Objects and Classes, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Multiple inheritance, Polymorphism), Generic programming, etc. As a way to permit to, not only to provide some useful background, but for readers with experience in other languages to understand how particular C++ is as compared to the other languages that are closely related, C (the origin of C++), Java, C#, (C++/CLI) and D.
;:In this chapter readers are asked to examine the first C++ source code, the common [[C++ Programming/Examples/Hello World|Hello World]] and provided the resources to understand it in step-by-step way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Panic disorder is one of the [[Psychiatry#anxiety disorders|anxiety disorders]].  It is characterized by the repeated occurrence of discrete [[Psychiatric Disorders/Anxiety disorders/Panic attack|panic attacks]], associated with at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack.  These attacks are discrete in that they have a recognizable beginning and end.  In between the attacks, patients often no symptoms at all.  However, with repeated episodes, they may experience some anticipatory anxiety.  In addition, about half of panic disorder patients also experience Agoraphobia.

==Phenomenology==

The central feature of panic disorder is a [[Psychiatric Disorders/Anxiety disorders/Panic attack|panic attack]].  Panic attacks themselves are not a disease, but rather a cluster of symptoms that come on and depart relatively rapidly.  Many diseases can cause panic attacks, including other anxiety disorders, and a number of medical disorders.  These will be described later.  

&quot;Panic Disorder&quot; is used to describe individuals who have recurrent [[Psychiatric Disorders/Anxiety disorders/Panic attack|panic attacks]] without an alternative explanation. By definition, the panic attacks have to be recurrent.  For [[w:DSM-IV|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-IV]] this means two or more, however in practice most patients have many more attacks than that.

The attacks seem to come “out of the blue” and most often occur without clear precipitant or stressor.   [[w:DSM-IV|DSM-IV]] does not require that the panic attacks be spontaneous, and there can be situational triggers, however spontaneous attacks are probably the most common. Though, by definition, the attacks have a definable beginning and ending, there may be anticipatory and residual anxiety surrounding the attacks. 

The attacks can occur any time, including while the patient is sleeping.  In the case of nocturnal attacks, the panic seems to occur most often during [[w:NREM|non-REM sleep]], and thus they are different from nightmares. 
   
Early on, patients may not recognize these symptoms as being anxiety based, and patients may end up in the emergency believing they are having a heart attack.

==Epidemiology==

In all, anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorder.   Panic is not the most common of these:  the phobias have that honor.  The lifetime prevalence of panic disorder is from 1 to 2%.   It is more common in women than in men. 

==Etiology and Pathophysiology==

Panic disorder appears to be genetic.  It certainly runs in families and the risk of panic increases with the degree of consanguinity.  However, sufficient twin and adoption studies are lacking to distinguish genetic from other familiar factors (for a discussion of why such studies are important in determining genetic versus environmental factors, see [[w:Nature versus nurture|this article]]), and direct genetic studies have not shown clear [[w:Genetic linkage|linkages]].  This suggests that if the disorder is genetic, the pattern of inheritance is complicated. 

One interesting clue is that several substances can precipitate panic in individuals who are predisposed.  The best studied is sodium lactate infusion, and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide inhalation.  These are of etiology interest, as both may represent, to the body, signs of suffocation.  Other agents that can also induce panic include cholecystokinin, tetrapeptide, caffeine, yohimbine, isoproterenol, and the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil.
 
These findings help implicate several transmitter systems.  The panic inducing effect of yohimbine and isoproterenol, along with studies showing a blunted growth hormone response to clonidine infusion helps suggests a [[w:Norepinephrine|noradrenergic]] role in the regulation of anxiety.  [[w:Serotonin|Serotonin]] likely has a regulatory role as well; this is suggested, among other things, by the efficacy of serotonergic agents in treating panic. 

The most direct affected neurotransmitter system is the [[w:Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA-ergic system]].  GABA, a major inhibitory transmitter system in the brain, is the major treatment site for all direct acting anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines.  The panic inducing effect of flumazenil lends further support.  There is also some direct evidence suggesting that GABA levels are decreased in the area of the occipital cortex of patients with panic disorder.  
Some Functional MRI studies suggest that panic disordered patients show abnormal activation in the area of the [[w:Hippocampus|hippocampus]] and [[w:Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyrus]].

How to put this all together?  Some have suggested that panic disorder is really a “false suffocation alarm”, perhaps caused by oversensitivity to acid-base disturbances in the brain.   This alarm, when triggered may activate certain areas of the brain responsible for our normal anxiety/arousal reactions, including the [[w:Locus ceruleus|locus ceruleus]]—which is noradrenergic, or the [[w:Nucleus raphe dorsalis|dorsal raphe nucleus]]—which is serotonergic.  Both structures help regulate [[w:Limbic system|limbic areas of the brain]], including the [[w:Hippocampus|hippocampus]], [[w:Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyrus]] and the [[w:Amygdala|amygdala]]. It is well known that stimulation of these limbic areas, all of which are rich in GABA receptors, can produce intense anxiety.

==Differential Diagnosis==

As already noted, panic attacks are not unique to panic disorder, and can be seen in almost any of the anxiety disorder.  The difference in these cases it that the attacks are caused by the specific disorder:  thus, a person with a phobia around heights may panic when forced to climb a ladder; similarly, a person with a social phobia may panic when having to give a public speech.   In each case, the panic attack is directly associated with the person’s phobia or fear, and will not occur if the precipitants can be avoided. 

Many medical conditions can produce symptoms that are similar or identical to panic attacks.  Most common are medical conditions that affect the cardiopulmonary system, thus bringing on a sensation of shortness of breath or chest pain.  Dramatic examples include [[w:Pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]], [[w:Myocardial infarction|myocardial infarctions]], and these should first be ruled out in an individual for which they represent a possibility.  Chronic diseases, such as [[w:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], or [[w:Congestive heart failure|heart failure]] also can cause feelings of anxiety and panic.  [[w:Supraventricular tachycardia|Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)]] can be difficult to distinguish from panic attacks, but as distinguished by the very rapid onset of SVT, often peaking within seconds, and the positive response to a [[w:Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva maneuver]].  [[w:Hypoglycemia|Hypoglycemia]] may cause anxiety, but is somewhat slower in onset, and predictably responds to sugar ingestion.  

The list of other disorders that can cause anxiety is long.  Some disorders typically cited include [[w:Focal seizures|simple partial seizures]], [[w:Pheochromocytoma|pheochromocytoma]], [[w:Mastocytosis|mastocytosis]], and [[w:Carcinoid syndrome|carcinoid syndrome]].   Each of these disorders can cause seemingly paroxysmal anxiety, but each also has symptoms and laboratory findings that are unique to each disorder. 

A number of medications and drugs can cause panic symptoms, either in ingestion or during withdrawal.  Examples of drugs that typically can cause anxiety include [[w:Levodopa|levodopa]], most [[w:Stimulant|stimulants]] and [[w:Sympathomimetics|sympathomimetics]].  Alternately, drugs that usually produce anxiolytic or sedative effects, such as [[w:Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]] or [[w:Barbiturate|barbiturates]], can cause anxiety during withdrawal. 

In summary, differential list are quite long for panic, however we should not be overwhelmed by this list.  A good history and physical, with proper supporting labs will rule out most of the possible mimics of anxiety.   In fact, it is the very fact that the patient often looks and acts so healthy that distinguishes panic disorder from these other syndromes.

==Comorbidity==
The most common complication of panic disorder is agoraphobia.  Agoraphobia, literally “fear of the marketplace” is often mistakenly thought to be a fear of open places.  In reality, what occurs is that, for many individuals with panic disorder, the attacks are so unpredictable that the individual begins to restrict his or her traveling in order to be sure of being in a “safe place” such as home, when the attack occurs. Simply put, most of us would rather have these frightening attacks at home than in the mall, and the only way to be sure of this is to spend as much time at home as possible.   One can imagine that this is a particularly disabling complication of the disorder; it can affect as many as half of Panic Disordered patients. 

Drug and alcohol abuse is another serious complication, often beginning as an unsuccessful attempt to treat the symptoms, and sometimes then taking on a life of its own.  Use of benzodiazepines or other tranquilizers are particularly problematic, as withdrawal symptoms may mimic, or even precipitate panic. 
Depression is common as well, and patients suffering from comorbid panic and major depression may have a higher risk for suicide than those with either disorder alone.  

Though it may be surprising, patients with panic disorder alone are not at a higher risk for suicide than the general population. 

Another commonly reported comorbidity is mitral valve prolapse.  Though it is tempting to suggest an etiological role in either direction, the relationship between panic and mitral valve prolapse seems to stem from some shared abnormality, rather than any direct relationship. 

==Course==

===Onset===

Most often, there is no prodrome; instead, a panic full-blown panic attack is often the first sign of the disease.  It can occur at any age, but most often begins during the late teens or the early twenties.  It tends to be a disease of adolescence and adulthood:  onset during childhood or geriatric years is much less common. 

===Long-term course===
There appear to be at least two different potential courses.  One group of patients experience waxing and waning of symptoms over the course of many years.  During bad periods, the symptoms can be daily; at times that are more quiescent the patient may only have panic attacks once every few months, however they do not experience long attack free intervals.  A second group experience a more episodic course, with a group of attacks being followed by long, symptoms free periods.

==Treatment==
As with most therapeutics in psychiatry, there are two types of treatment for panic:  acute treatment and preventive treatment.   Acute treatment refers to relieving symptoms that are occurring now:  in this case, the acute panic attack.  Preventative treatment refers to decreasing the frequency and severity of future attacks. 

Both treatment strategies have several options, including pharmacologic and psychotherapy options.  Neither strategy is good or bad in itself, but represent two approaches that have their own advantages and limitations. 

===Acute Treatment===
Acute treatment of panic attacks is very difficult, as the attacks may begin and end before treatment has time to take effect.  Treatment is more likely to be effective in cases where these is some warning, or way to predict that panic will occur, or in patients who have an unusually long time until the peak of symptoms.  Obviously, in cases where panic attacks are not caused by panic disorder, but by a more predictable problem, for example a phobia, treatment is more likely to be effective.  For example, a patient who has fear of flying may take a medication before getting on a plane. Patients, during a panic attack feel very desperate, and will take anything to relieve their anxiety.  That said, often the treatments are more effective at diminishing the subsequent anticipatory and secondary anxiety than in treating the panic attack itself.  

====Pharmacological treatment==== 
Acute treatment of panic, or really any type of acute anxiety, usually involves the use of fast acting medications.  These typically have short half lives, and rapid times to onset. 
The most common medications used for acute treatment of anxiety are the [[w:Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]].  They all work through  potentiation of [[w:Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] action at GABA-A receptors in the CNS.  Because of their indirect effect on the GABA receptor, the benzodiazepines are relatively safe compared with other sedatives. 

There are three classes of benzodiazepines: 2-keto, 3-hydroxy, and triazolo.  2-keto drugs include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, prazepam, clorazepate, halazepam, clonazepam, and flurazepam.  Many of these are pro-drugs; they are [[w:Cytochrome P450 oxidase|oxidized]] in the liver (usually to active metabolites).  They therefore tend to have long half-lives and are more susceptible to drug interactions and age effects.  The 3-hydroxy drugs include oxazepam, lorazepam, and temezepam.  These are conjugated in the liver (to inactive substances); thus, they have shorter half-lives, and are less affected by age and other drugs.  The triazolo class includes alprazolam, triazolam and adinazolam.  These are oxidized, but with more limited active metabolites.  Thus, they are somewhat shorter-acting than the 2-keto drugs.  The mechanism of action relates to specific receptors on GABA receptors.

The most commonly used benzodiazepines for acute anxiety, at least in the US, are alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam and diazepam.  All have a relatively quick onset, and, except for diazepam, short to medium half lives. 
 
The advantage of benzodiazepines is that they can be effective, if administered in time.  Indeed, there are few other medications that can be used in a “as needed” or PRN basis.   In addition, they are relatively safe, even in overdose. 
 
There are downsides of using benzodiazpines.  Though they are relatively safe, they still can cause respiratory depression, even coma or death in overdose.  The chance of this is much higher in individuals who already have respiratory or cardiac problems.   The risk is also greatly increased if the benzodiazepines are taken along with another CNS depressant, such as alcohol.
  
In addition, there is a risk of [[w:Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] and [[w:Withdrawal|withdrawal]].   Tolerance is a pharmacodynamic neuroadaption, in which an individual becomes “used to” a given medication, and begins needing more medication to achieve the same effect.   Tolerance mainly occurs with repeated use, thus the risk of tolerance increases if benzodiazepines are used frequently.  Withdrawal is also common with repeated and continuous use of benzodiazepines.  The symptoms of withdrawal are often virtually identical to the original anxiety symptoms.  For  this reason, benzodiazepines can, at times, create a vicious circle in which an individual begins to experience rebound anxiety as soon as they stop using their medication. 

[[w:Addiction|Addiction]] is another concern.  Addiction refers to the compulsive use of a medication, usually for the psychic effects of the medication, such as in order to “get high.”  While tolerance and withdrawal are common with repeat use of benzodiazepines, addiction is much less common.  The greatest predictor of benzodiazepine addiction is a prior history of substance dependence, either to alcohol or some other substance.  
  
It should never be assumed that addiction is an inevitable, or even common result of benzodiazepine use;  it is not.  Often physicians need to spend time educating their patients about this, and the difference between true addiction and physical dependence/tolerance or withdrawal.

====Psychological Treatments==== 
There are a number of psychological treatments aimed at curbing anxiety once it begins.  Most of the symptomatic treatments are rooted in behavioral therapy.  Most commonly used are the relaxation therapies, which, as the name implies, are geared towards promoting relaxation and lessening anxiety.  Common examples include progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises.  Both are easily taught, and become more effective the more they are practiced.  Thus, when instructing patients in their use, they should be encouraged to practice them often, so that panic does occur, the behavioral strategies can be done almost automatically. 

===Preventive Treatment=== 
Preventive treatment refers to  treatment strategies aimed at decreasing the frequency and severity of future attacks.  Ideally, one wishes to eliminate the attacks altogether, and sometimes this is possible, but even if it is not, any alleviation in the severity of the disorder will likely be of great benefit to the patient.  For example, a patient who is afraid to go to work for fear of having a panic attack there may feel sufficiently safe to resume working if the attacks begin to seem more minor.  

====Pharmacological treatment==== 
In practice, [[w:Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]] are sometimes used preventive as well as symptomatic treatment.  In this case, instead of being used as needed, they are given continually, usually in divided doses, so that there is a constant blood level throughout the day.  Some of the short acting benzodiazepines have come out with longer acting versions that can be taken once a day:  alprazolam is an example. 
 
Despite the common use of these agents, the continuous use of benzodiazepines is controversial for the reasons discussed above:  mainly those of tolerance and dependence.  Though, admittedly there are different opinions and some conflicting data, it is the opinion here that these are not first line treatments for prevention of panic, or any anxiety disorder. 
Antidepressants have largely supplanted benzodiazepines as first line treatment for the prevention of panic.  Most currently available antidepressants likely have some effect on anxiety.  However, the SSRIs are likely the most popular, and a number of studies have demonstrated them to be as good or better than the benzodiazepines in treating anxiety.  
The dose and treatment strategy for the use of antidepressants in panic is similar to that for depression:  similar doses are required, and a similar time course is used.  For that reason, antidepressant treatment will not be discussed in detail here, and the reader (listener) is referred to the section on the treatment of depression. It is notable, however, that some clinicians suggest a slow titration for fear that the antidepressants may cause some anxiety or agitation if administered too aggressively.  

Other medications have also shown efficacy in treating panic disorder.  Propranolol has been used to prevent panic, though it is genereally thought to be less consistently effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines.  Inositol has also shown promise, though it is little used in clinical populations currently.
  
Buspirone, which has proved effective in some types of anxiety, most notably generalized anxiety disorder, is NOT effective for panic disorder. 
Cognitive-behavior therapy, used either independently or in conjunction with medical treatment, should also be considered, especially in light of the fact that in addition to reducing the frequency of panic attacks, it is also an effective treatment for agoraphobia.

====Psychological treatments==== 
There are a number of psychological treatments aimed at preventing anxiety.  Much of psychoanalysis and dynamic therapy was aimed as reducing anxiety in the sense that anxiety itself wasn’t seen as the problem, but as a signal of ongoing conflicts and stresses which, once attended to would lessen the resulting anxiety. 
That said, the long term dynamic therapies such as psychoanalysis are no longer considered the treatment of choice for preventing panic disorder.  Most commonly used now are the [[w:Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapies]] or CBT. 
 
CBT is based on [[w:Learning theory (education)|learning theory]]; the idea is that people learn to develop automatic responses of fear or dread in relation to a stimulus.  What is learned can be unlearned, and much of CBT is spent teaching the patient to tolerate the triggers of anxiety.  In the case of phobias, the triggers are clear; in the case of panic disorder, the trigger is, in a sense, the anxiety itself, and the patient learns to tolerate their anxiety.  

CBT  treatment has been shown in some studies to be as effective as medication treatment.  It has the additional advantage of alleviating the concomitant agoraphobia, which medications are generally less effective in treating.  Indeed, agoraphobia left to itself may persist long after panic is prevented, and in those cases CBT may be the only treatment with will address with lingering and disabling complication.

==Preface==
This book will be a descriptive grammar of the Esperanto language invented by L. L. Zamenhof, which will be complete and comprehensive in regards to a) the grammar of Esperanto as first outlined by Zamenhof in ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' and other foundational documents, and b) Esperanto as it is spoken today by the most committed Esperantists. (Proposed reforms to the Esperanto language will be discussed if they have serious support from a significant fraction of Esperanto enthusiasts).

This book is not intended as a textbook for learning Esperanto. For that purpose, you are cordially referred to another Wikibook: the [[Esperanto|Esperanto Textbook]].

This book was started practically on a dare from the August 2006 issue of Bob's Poetry Magazine [http://bobspoetry.com/Bobs03Au.pdf], in which Robert Happelberg boasted that he could print a complete and comprehensive grammar of Esperanto in just one 6 by 7 inch page. While this is obviously wrong, it's not too far off the mark. When completed, this book will require several standard size (8.5 by 11 in the USA) pages, but will still be much shorter than a complete grammar of a natural language like English or Slovene.

In view of this goal, the number of examples provided for each concept will be kept to a bare minimum. Those wishing to build their Esperanto vocabularies are also referred to the Esperanto textbooks. It is acceptable in the beginning to word the text in an accessible manner like in a textbook, but the goal should be for all the text to be technical with a full command of linguistic jargon.

==Numbers==

In Esperanto, the cardinal numbers are all built up from little more than a dozen words:

* 0 Nulo
* 1 Unu
* 2 Du
* 3 Tri
* 4 Kvar
* 5 Kvin
* 6 Ses
* 7 Sep
* 8 Ok
* 9 Naŭ
* 10 Dek
* 100 Cent
* 1,000 Mil
* 1,000,000 Miliono
* 1,000,000,000 Miliardo
* 1,000,000,000,000 Biliono

All other numbers are simply built up from these. To give a couple of examples:

* 16 Dek ses (one ten and six)
* 42 Kvardek du (four tens and two)
* 442 Kvarcent kvardek du (four hundreds, four tens and two)
* 1,729 Mil sepcent dudek naŭ (one thousand, seven hundreds, two tens and nine)
* 22,729 Dudek du mil sepcent dudek naŭ (Twenty two thousands, seven hundreds, two tens and nine)
* 3,022,729 Tri miliono dudek du mil sepcent dudek naŭ (three millions, twenty two thousands, seven hundreds, two tens and nine)
* 4,003,022,729 Kvar miliardo tri miliono dudek du mil sepcent dudek naŭ (four billions, three millions, twenty two thousands, seven hundreds, two tens and nine)
* 5,004,003,022,729 Kvin biliono Kvar miliardo tri miliono dudek du mil sepcent dudek naŭ (five trillions, four billions, three millions, twenty two thousands, seven hundreds, two tens and nine)




The ordinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.) are simply adjectives and are formed as all other adjectives in Esperanto, as will be detailed in the chapter on adjectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Robertboland,

The page &quot;Panic Disorder&quot; appears to be an encyclopedia article, not a book. If you would like to add links to encyclopedia articles from a wikibook, just use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:ARTICLE_NAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to make a link to the wikipedia article. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

:No problem. I moved the &quot;Psychiatry&quot; page to [[Psychiatric Disorders]] to better reflect the content... is &quot;Abnormal Psychiatry&quot; a better term? &quot;Psychiatry&quot; seems too vague a name to use for this particular book! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

::&quot;Module&quot; just means &quot;page&quot;... I have no idea why thay name was used. It can be a book, a chapter, or a subchapter.
::By the way, if you want &quot;Panic Disorder&quot; to be a chapter of this book, the way to do it would be to name the page [[Psychiatric Disorders/Panic Disorder]], which would make it a chapter of the main book (you can move it there using the &quot;move&quot; tag at the top of the page). 
::I think it's best not to use &quot;shorthands&quot; for book titles :). For me, I'd rather save &quot;Psychiatry&quot; for a bookshelf page, since there might be more books on the subject added over time, and the page named &quot;Psychiatry&quot; could list and descrive those books for the curious reader. 
::(Oh: when you leave messages on talk and discussion pages, don't forget to put four tildes &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; after your comment.

==Nouns==

In Esperanto, all singular nouns end in &quot;o,&quot; regardless of gender, and all plural nouns end in &quot;oj.&quot; Nouns are turned feminine by the insertion of &quot;in&quot; between the word root and the &quot;o&quot; or &quot;oj&quot; suffix. For example:

* Hundo (dog)
* Hundoj (dogs)
* Hundino (she-dog)
* Hundinoj (she-dogs)

===Proper names, including exonyms===

Just as in English and other languages, names of persons and specific places in Esperanto are capitalized regardless of where they occur in the sentence. (Names of months and days of the week are only capitalized if they begin a sentence.)

To fully assimilate an exonym into Esperanto, an &quot;o&quot; is added at the end and the writing is made to conform to the standards of Esperanto: for example, &quot;Novjorko&quot; refers to New York.

===Pronouns===

===Riismo===

Some Esperanto enthusiasts feel Esperanto is somewhat sexist in its use of nouns and pronouns, and have proposed a reform called Riismo.

According to the ''Prezento de Riismo'', in Riism:

*The pronoun [[Wiktionary:ri|ri]] replaces the pronouns [[Wiktionary:li|li]] and [[Wiktionary:ŝi|ŝi]]. One does not use the pronouns [[Wiktionary:li|li]] or [[Wiktionary:ŝi|ŝi]].
*The [[suffix]] [[Wiktionary:-iĉ-|-iĉ-]] is used symmetrically with the suffix [[Wiktionary:-in-|-in-]]. These are used in order to emphasize the sex of a noun, or to specify it when necessary.
*All nouns without the suffixes [[Wiktionary:-iĉ-|-iĉ-]] or [[Wiktionary:-in-|-in-]] are epicene (have no gender). However, if there is danger of confusion, one may specifically indicate the lack of gender with the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''ge-''. 
:For example, a ''dentisto'' can be a ''dentistiĉo'' (masculine) or a ''dentistino'' (feminine); a ''(ge)patro'' (parent) is either a ''patriĉo'' (father) or a ''patrino'' (mother).

Use of the pronoun [[Wiktionary:ri|ri]] parallels usage in many natural languages, such as Finnish, Swahili and Chinese, in which the third-person pronouns have no distinction between feminine and masculine. Esperanto has a gender-neutral (or ''epicene'') third-person pronoun, [[Wiktionary:ĝi|ĝi]], but this has been dispreferred because it translates English ''it'', and is often thought to be inanimate. 

The masculine suffix ''-iĉ-'' has been independently invented many times, by symmetrically leveling out the three gendered suffixes to four: ''-nj-'' (affectionate feminine), ''-ĉj-'' (affectionate masculine), ''-in-'' (feminine), therefore ''-iĉ-'' (masculine). 

The suffix and radical changes of riism do not increase the number of basic forms of the language.  Both riist and non-riist (standard) Esperanto have three relevant forms: one morphologically unmarked and two marked.  The difference lies in the assignment of gender: 

*'''Standard''': The unmarked form of the 20 or so gendered nouns is masculine, and the two marked forms are the feminine and the inclusive/epicene. ''E.g.'' [[Wiktionary:patro|patro]] (father) versus [[Wiktionary:patrino|patrino]] (mother) and [[Wiktionary:gepatroj|gepatroj]] (parents [of both sexes]), the latter extended by some speakers to an epicene singular [[Wiktionary:gepatro|gepatro]] (parent). 
*'''Riist''': The unmarked form is epicene, and the two marked forms are the feminine and the masculine. ''E.g.'' [[Wiktionary:patro|patro]], (parent), versus [[Wiktionary:patrino|patrino]] (mother) and [[Wiktionary:patriĉo|patriĉo]] (father).

Riism does not eliminate the prefix [[Wiktionary:ge-|ge-]]. In order for a riist and a speaker of standard Esperanto to communicate without confusion, the riist can add the prefix [[Wiktionary:ge-|ge-]], when in standard Esperanto usage the noun would be masculine.  

However, for all but a couple dozen words, the standard Esperanto word is epicene, and [[Wiktionary:ge-|ge-]] is not required.  For example, [[Wiktionary:dentisto|dentisto]] is a dentist of unspecified sex in both riist and in modern standard Esperanto.  The main words where the prefix [[Wiktionary:ge-|ge-]] can be useful are:

*Kin terms: [[Wiktionary:avo|avo]] [[Wiktionary:edzo|edzo]] [[Wiktionary:fianĉo|fianĉo]] [[Wiktionary:filo|filo]] [[Wiktionary:frato|frato]] [[Wiktionary:kuzo|kuzo]] [[Wiktionary:nepo|nepo]] [[Wiktionary:nevo|nevo]] [[Wiktionary:onklo|onklo]] [[Wiktionary:patro|patro]] [[Wiktionary:vidvo|vidvo]]
*Words for boys and men: [[Wiktionary:bubo|bubo]] [[Wiktionary:knabo|knabo]] [[Wiktionary:viro|viro]]
*Titles: [[Wiktionary:fraŭlo|fraŭlo]] [[Wiktionary:grafo|grafo]] [[Wiktionary:princo|princo]] [[Wiktionary:reĝo|reĝo]] [[Wiktionary:sinjoro|sinjoro]]
*[[Wiktionary:amiko|amiko]] (friend)

Some critics of Riism consider the elimination of [[Wiktionary:li|li]] and [[Wiktionary:ŝi|ŝi]] to be a major fault.  They contend that the gendered pronouns are useful for the very same reasons of emphasis and precision that the suffixes [[Wiktionary:-iĉ-|-iĉ-]] and [[Wiktionary:-in-|-in-]] are; and that while '''Riism''' eliminates a sexual inconsistency for nouns, its requirement that [[Wiktionary:li|li]] and [[Wiktionary:ŝi|ŝi]] be ''wholly eliminated'' (as opposed to being relegated to those uses where sex is specifically implied) introduces an inconsistency in gender between nouns and pronouns. ([[Ido]] has solved this problem by using four gendered pronouns: masculine, feminine, epicene, and inanimate.)

Indeed, several languages with epicene pronouns have introduced gender distinctions in order to more easily translate from gendered European languages, supporting the argument that the ''he-she'' distinction is worth maintaining. For instance, Japanese has two nouns, ''kare'' and ''kanojo'', that can be used as masculine and feminine third-person singular pronouns, and Chinese has introduced a graphic distinction for the feminine when writing the epicene pronoun ''tā'', with the old grapheme now assumed to be masculine. 

The pronoun ''ri'' would also cause problems with comprehension, a common flaw with proposals made on paper but not used much in actual conversation. Many verbs begin with ''ri-'', to avoid confusion with verbs having the prefix ''re-''. Since personal pronouns are most commonly used immediately before a verb, the pronoun ''ri'' would cause similar ambiguity: ''ri gardas'' (s/he keeps) vs. ''rigardas'' (looks), ''ri petas'' (s/he asks) vs. ''ripetas'' (repeats), etc. Critics making this objection often propose that the epicene pronoun should be ''gi'', by analogy with the prefix ''ge-''. 

Other critics argue that the alleged lack of an epicene pronoun is spurious, because Zamenhof himself specified that [[Wiktionary:ĝi|ĝi]] should be used when the sex of an individual is unknown, and that the idea that ''ĝi'' cannot be used for people is due to interference from English. In Zamenhof's day it was customary to specify gender whenever it was known, and indeed in many European languages this is grammatically required. A shift from ''li'' and ''ŝi'' to ''ĝi'' could be argued to be a stylistic change similar to the ongoing shift from copula-plus-adjective to verb (such as ''bluas'' for ''estas blua''), and that nothing so radical as the creation of a new pronoun is required.

A similar semantic change has taken place with gender of Esperanto nouns. In the early days of the language, members of a profession were assumed to be masculine unless specified otherwise with ''-in-'', reflecting the expectations of most industrial societies. That is, ''dentisto'' was a male dentist, and ''instruisto'' was a male teacher. These became gender neutral in the mid-to-late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century in Esperanto, just as ''actor'' and ''author'' did in English, because of social transformation. The list above shows the gendered nouns that are left today; they remain masculine only because, officially at least, Esperanto has no other way of indicating masculine gender.

Meanwhile, many Esperantists use the work-around of the demonstrative pronoun [[Wiktionary:tiu|tiu]] (this/that) as an epicene personal pronoun, but only when ''li'' or ''ŝi'' would be inappropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The anxiety disorders include disorders with symptoms of anxiety or excessive worrying, phobias and [[Psychiatric Disorders/Anxiety disorders/Panic attack|panic attack]].  Specific disorders include [[/Panic Disorder/]], [[/Agoraphobia without History of Panic Disorder/]], [[/Specific Phobia/]], [[/Social Phobia/]], [[/Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/]], [[/Posttraumatic Stress Disorder/]], [[/Acute Stress Disorder/]], [[/Generalized Anxiety Disorder/]], and the [[/Secondary Anxiety Disorders/]].

Anxiety is not, it itself, pathological, and in the right situation, appropriate anxiety is a necessary survival adaptation, motivating an individual to avoid potential or impending harm.  One way to think of anxiety is as a warning signal, telling us of potential danger or harmful situations.  Anxiety disorders are present when this warning system is not working properly: it may be overly sensitive, and cause the individual to overreact to minor or nonexistent dangers, or it may create so severe a reaction that the individual is too disabled to cope with the potential harm.  

Anxiety involves various psychological and physical symptoms.  The individual feels anxious and fearful.  This is accompanied by various physical manifestations: restlessness, psychomotor agitation, shortness of breath, hyperventilation, stomach upset, chest pain and diaphoresis.   Thought and cognition can be affected:  a moderate amount of anxiety can actually be good for attention and concentration, however too much tends to make one distracted.  

Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent of psychiatric disorders.  Community samples, such as the  [[w:Psychiatric_epidemiology|Epidemiological Catchment Area Project]], found surprisingly high lifetime prevalences (''Figure 1'').  Clinical samples have shown anxiety disorders to be a very common reason for presentation to primary care doctors and emergency departments. 

[[File:Anxiety_prevalence.jpg]]

Anxiety disorders seem more common in women.  They may decrease with age, and they can present differently at different ages.  In children, an anxiety disorder can manifest as separation anxiety (“school phobia”).  Elderly patients may tend towards somatic presentations (“stomach problems,” headaches, sleep problems).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A panic attack is not a disorder in itself, but a syndrome, or cluster of symptoms that may be part of a number of disorders.  It is a cardinal feature of panic disorder, but can be caused by almost any anxiety disorder (with the exception of Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  

A panic attack begins quickly, and peaks within 10 minutes. The entire attack usually lasts no more than 20 minutes, and attacks that occur for over an hour are very rare. However, once the attack is finished, patients may have residual symptoms as they recover from what is a very frightening event.

Symptoms of a panic attack include the following: Palpitations, pounding heart, or increased heart rate, Sweating, Trembling or shaking, Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering, Feeling of choking, Chest pain, Nausea, Dizziness, Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization, Feeling of losing control/going crazy, Fear of dying, Paresthesias, and Chills. Among these symptoms, the most common, and perhaps most central to the disorder are the pulmonary ones: the feeling of shortness of breath and/or choking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Computers ==

[[Image:Jeep_Liberty_Gas_PCM_2005.jpg|thumb|right|2005 Jeep Liberty Gasoline NGC PCM w/ integrated TCM]]

Computer modifications are needed to realize to full potential of any performance upgrades.  The Jeep Liberty computer can be reprogrammed with a different flash image, tricked with a different intake temperature sensor, or tricked with a performance chip.  The B&amp;G Jeep Liberty Flash (JTEC-NGC) permanently changes the timing and fuel tables, raises the rev limit and speed limit, and removes torque management.  A different intake temperature sensor tricks the engine into adjusting the fuel mixture.  Performance chips make various changes, but all suffer from short-lived gains.

The 3.7L gas and 2.8L diesel are very different engines with very different computer modifications.  SP Diesel makes a chip for the diesel engine. The ECU on the 2.8L CRD is made by Bosch, and at this time there are two companies offering a re-flash for the CRD ECU, [http://www.greendieselengineering.com Green Diesel Engineering] and [http://www.inmotionusa.com INMOTION TUNING].  Both vendors offer choices between ECO (economy) and Performance tuning programs.

== Mufflers and Headers ==

Many different companies manufacture cat-back [[w:Exhaust system|exhaust systems]] for the Jeep Liberty.  Borla makes a split pipe dual exhaust system.  The Borla single side and [[Gibson Performance]] systems aren't preferable for off-roading because their larger [[w:Muffler|mufflers]] hang more vulnerably below the lower control arm mounts.  Rusty's Offroad offers a [[w:Flowmaster Mufflers|Flowmaster]] Delta Flow based system with a 2.5&quot; clamped mandrel bent tail pipe.

A good off-road or muffler shop should be able to fabricate an off-road friendly exhaust system around a universal aftermarket muffler.  Just remember, it's illegal to remove the [[w:Catalytic converter|catalytic converter]].  The Flowmaster 40 and 50 SUV mufflers are common choices, the latter being more quiet and durable.  Flowmaster has also released a strengthened diamond plate off-road muffler.  Generally, MagnaFlow mufflers offer more performance but less aggressive sound than Flowmasters.  MagnaFlows are built from stainless steel while Flowmasters are built from rust susceptible aluminized steel.  Aeroturbine and Gibson also manufacturer exhaust options.  A 2.5&quot; center in/side out muffler works well with the stock 2.5&quot; mandrel bent tubing.  A short restriction in the tubing, immediately upstream of the stock muffler flange, can be removed to increase flow.  A new muffler can be welded in its place or, if disassembly is required, a DynoMax flange adapter.  Increasing tail pipe diameter will deepen tone and most mufflers will get louder as they break-in.  Exposed tail pipe tips should be avoided in off-road applications.

Contrary to popular belief, increasing backpressure will not increase low-end torque.  On the other hand, decreasing pipe diameter will increase low-end torque.  Decreasing pipe diameter increases velocity and thus the [[w:Scavenging|scavenging effect]].  The scavenging effect is most pronounced at lower RPMs where it affects low-end torque, but is negligible when using forced induction.  The goal is to eliminate as much backpressure as possible while still maintaing sufficient velocity.

JBA manufactures stainless steel short-tube [[w:Manifold (automotive engineering)|headers]] for the Jeep Liberty.  Ceramic coated stainless steel versions, colored silver or titanium, are also available.  These headers only work with 2005-2007 Libertys because other years have a different catalytic converter connection.  Short-tube headers don't create as much scavenging effect because they don't pulse as well as equal length long-tube headers.  On the other hand, short-tube headers pass emmisions testing, keep the catalytic converters, and are easier to install.  The JBA short-tube headers include the &quot;Firecone,&quot; which JBA claims increases scavenging.  Regardless, all good aftermarket headers remove restrictions and increase efficiency.

== Filters and Intakes ==

[[Image:Jeep_Liberty_Gas_Intake_2005.jpg|thumb|right|2005 Jeep Liberty Gasoline Air Intake]]

There are a number of different drop-in air filters and replacement intakes available for the Jeep Liberty.  The most popular aftermarket filters are made by K&amp;N, who makes both drop-ins and a FIPK replacement intake.  AEM Induction Systems and aFe also make a replacement intakes and filters.  Since the replacement intakes draw air from the engine compartment, their performance can be increased by installing a ram-air hood that forces cool air into the engine compartment.  The CRD's turbo charger makes performance intakes and filters less advantageous for it than its gas counterpart.  There is currently no FIPK available for the CRD.  While most aftermarket filters allow greater airflow, they also allow more dust and dirt to enter the engine.  For this reason performance filters like the K&amp;N aren't recommended if the Liberty will be taken off road in dusty conditions.  Another alternative is to install a snorkel, which by raising the air intake to roof height will keep dust out and allow for river crossings at the same time .  At this time there are snorkels being manufactured for the Liberty.

== Superchargers ==

Kenne Bell discontinued its [[w:Supercharger|supercharger]] for the Jeep Liberty's 3.7L engine.  The relatively high piston rings in the 3.7L caused piston land weakness and failure, a problem correctable with forged pistons. A 4.7L supercharger can be installed onto the 3.7L, without issue, if a new tube and upgraded pistons are installed.

== Throttle Bodies ==

[[Image:ChryslerPowerTechV6 ThrottleBodies Stock-Fastman.jpg|thumb|right|Stock (left) vs The Fastman (right) Throttle Body]]

The Fastman ported [[w:Throttle_body|throttle body]] allows better flow than the stock PowerTech throttle body.  Simple throttle body spacers should be avoided as they provide absolutely no performance increase when installed on the Liberty.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:ChryslerPowerTechV6 ThrottleBody Stock.jpg|Stock Throttle Body
Image:ChryslerPowerTechV6 ThrottleBody Fastman.jpg|The Fastman Throttle Body
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Transmissions and Torque Converters ==

The TransGo Shift Kit causes the Jeep Liberty's [[w:Automatic transmission|automatic transmission]] to shift more quickly.  The same 45RFE PSK kit works with both 45RFE and 545RFE.  The kit corrects the soft 1-2 and heavy throttle long 2-3 shifts and provides a firmer 4th and lockup.

The APS High Stall Torque Converter is an efficient [[w:Torque converter|torque converter]] that allows more power to be transferred from the engine to the transmission.  It features additional stall, firmer lockup, increased torque multiplication, and 6% more efficiency than stock.  It's only available for the 45RFE and not the more common 42RLE.

Suncoast Converters also has a 1200 RPM stall heavy-duty torque converter for the 2.8L CRD.  This converter improves fuel economy and power delivery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alpha 2 receptors''' are located mainly on presynaptic nerve endings, as well as Beta cells of the pancreas. These receptors are inhibitory in nature. When '''Norepinephrine''' is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, some circles back to bind with the Alpha 2 receptor. This causes feedback inhibition, thus reducing the amount of Norepinephrine released. Alpha 2 stimulation also results in inhibition of insulin release. Binding of Alpha 2 receptors is mediated by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a decrease in the amount of intracellular cAMP. Alpha 2 agonists include Norepinephrine and '''Clonidine'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alpha 1 receptors are located in:
*Eye radial (i.e dilator) muscle
*Arterioles and viens,
*Male sex organs, Urinary bladder,
*Kidney and Liver.

Alpha 1 receptors use G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; Coupled secondary mediators and cause increase in phospholipase C and calcium levels in the cell.


Alpha1 blockers:
*'''Selective Blockers''': Prazosin, Doxazocin, Terazocin
*'''Non selective Alpha blockers''' (both alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptor blockers): Phentolamine(competitive inhibitor), Phenoxybenzamine (non competitive inhibitor)


Effects of Alpha1 receptor blockage:
*'''Eye''': Miosis 
*'''Arterioles and veins''': Reduced sympathetic tone in blood vessels- This results in vasodilation, Decrease in preload and after load on heart, lowering of peripheral vascular resistance and thus a fall in blood pressure is noted. The drop in blood pressure causes a reflex tachycardia.


Alpha 1 receptors (GPCR) that are located on arteriole smooth muscle and coupled to IP3/DAG cause vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.

&lt;u&gt;Prazosin&lt;/u&gt;: Prazosin can lower BP rapidly so we warn patients to relax for 1 hour after taking the first dose and for any increase in dose.
Other side effects: Orthostatic hypotension, Nasal stuffiness, First dose syncope, Urinary incontinence and failure of ejaculation.

It is a smooth muscle relaxant so it is used in cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy, as it decreases the tone of urinary sphincters.

This tutorial will guide you through how to make a simple animated Gif Using Blender and Gimp. This is useful for creating Avatars for forums etc.
This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of blender and Gimp, see the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Basic_Animation|basic animation tutorial]].

To start off you will need an animation, this usually should be no longer than 25 frames long.

# Open Blender. and delete the default cube and add a UV sphere, the default settings for the sphere work fine.
# Now set the camera size in the scene buttons (F10) to 50 by 50 (I am creating an avatar for deviant art where the required size is 50 by 50 pixels, you may change this if you want)
# set the frames to start at frame 1 and end at frame 20.
# select the sphere and insert a LOC keyframe at frame 1 and 21, then go to frame 11, move the sphere and insert another LOC keyframe. this will create a looping animation.
# Set the image type to PNG or JPEG (it doesn't matter) and render the animation.

Now to combine the images into an animated GIF using Gimp.

# Open the first image with gimp.
# Now click File-&gt; open as Layer or press &quot;Ctrl-Alt-O&quot;. Select the next frame and it will be added as a new layer. Repeat this for all of the images, or select all of the images by pressing &quot;Ctrl-A&quot;.
# If you press Filters-&gt;Animation-&gt;Playback it should play the animation. It will probably have a low frame rate making it &quot;choppy&quot;. this will be fixed in the next step.
# Change the frame rate to 40 ms(25 frames per second). Choose file-&gt;Save as-&gt; &quot;Name&quot;.gif, then choose Save as Animation. 

Note: Don't know wheter this is an additional feature of Gimp 2.6.8 or not, but i found out following:
In Gimp 2.6.8, within the export wizard, you have to choose option: -save as animation- first and next at the option: -single picture where not mentioned- the option: one single picture per layer. -Sorry i use the german version of gimp-

You should end up with something like this:

Welcome back! This is the 4th lesson of &quot;Learn to read, write and pronounce Korean&quot;. This lesson covers the rest of the basic Korean letters.

==The vowel ㅜ (''u'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅜ (''u'')
| image=ㅜ (u) stroke order.png
| sound=Close back rounded vowel.ogg}}
The first new letter is the vowel ㅜ (''u''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅜ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Close back rounded vowel|[u]]]
|}

The vowel ㅜ is pronounced like [[w:Close back rounded vowel|the ''oo'' in ''b'''oot''''']]. Similar in appearance to ㅗ (''o'') and 一 (''eu''), the vowel ㅜ (''u'') is wider than it is tall, so it is written below the consonant rather than next to it.

{|
|- align=center
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㄷ
| rowspan=2 | =&gt;
| rowspan=2 style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | 두
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:200%; border:3px solid;&quot;| ㅜ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; 
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''d'' &lt;br/&gt; ''u''
|
| ''du''
|}

===Exercise===

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor= [[wikt:사우디아라비아|사우디아라비아]] | hint = the largest country on the Arabian Peninsula
| eng = (''Sa-u-di-a-ra-bi-a'') [[w:Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]]}}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor= [[wikt:불가리아|불가리아]]            | hint = country in Southeastern Europe
| eng = (''Bul-ga-ri-a'') [[w:Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]}}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor= [[wikt:루마니아|루마니아]]            | hint = another country in Eastern Europe

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor= [[wikt:수리남|수리남]]               | hint = country in South America
| eng = (''Su-ri-nam'') [[w:Suriname|Suriname]]}}

You can check your answers by clicking at &quot;Show&quot; above, as usual.

===Exercise: writing practice===
Try to write the following words:
&lt;!-- The common translation of Rwanda seems to be 르완다, but the we haven't yet taught ㅘ.
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = Rwanda (''Ruanda'')
| answer = Rwanda -&gt; ''Ru-an-da'' -&gt; 루안다
}}
--&gt;
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = Burundi
| answer = Burundi -&gt; ''Bu-run-di'' -&gt; [[wikt:부룬디|부룬디]]
}}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = Uganda
| answer = Uganda -&gt; ''U-gan-da'' -&gt; [[wikt:우간다|우간다]]
}}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = Brunei
| answer = Brunei -&gt; ''Beu-ru-na-i'' -&gt; [[wikt:브루나이|브루나이]]
}}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = Sudan
| answer = Sudan -&gt; ''Su-dan'' -&gt; [[wikt:수단|수단]]
}}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = Ulsan
| answer = Ulsan -&gt; ''Ul-san'' -&gt; [[wikt:울산|울산]]
}}


==The vowel ㅓ (''eo'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅓ (''eo'')
| image=ㅓ (eo) stroke order.png
| sound=Open-mid back unrounded vowel.ogg}}
The next of the vowels to learn is ㅓ (''eo''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅓ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|Romanization]]:
| ''eo''
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Open-mid back unrounded vowel|[ʌ]]]
|}

The vowel ㅓ is pronounced like [[w:Open-mid back unrounded vowel|the ''u'' in ''pl'''u'''s'']] ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ ʌ ]) and [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transcribed as ''eo'']] (think &quot;surg'''eo'''n&quot;). Similar in appearance to ㅏ (''a''), the vowel ㅓ (''eo'') is taller than it is wide, so it is written next to the consonant.

| answer = [[wikt:바이러스|바이러스]] }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | question = Oregon (hint: ''Origeon'')
| answer = [[wikt:오리건|오리건]] }}

==The vowel ㅔ (''e'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅔ (''e'')
| image=ㅔ (e) stroke order.png
| sound=Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg}}
The next vowel to learn is the digraph ㅔ (''e''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:

|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Close-mid front unrounded vowel|[e]]]
|}

The appearance the vowel ㅔ shows that it was originally a [[w:Diphthong|diphthong]] of ㅓ (''eo'') and ㅣ (''i''). Today, it is pronounced like [[w:Close-mid front unrounded vowel|the ''e'' in the Australian pronunciation of word ''b'''e'''d'']] and [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transcribed as ''e'']].

|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [[w:Open-mid front unrounded vowel|[ɛ]]]
|}

The appearance the vowel ㅐ shows that it was originally a [[w:Diphthong|diphthong]] of ㅏ (''a'') and ㅣ (''i'').

== Move the final Book? ==

I just wanted to give you a hint. There is a special university wikibook, it is called [[Wikiversity]]. Maybe you find information there that is useful. Also, we could later on link our Project to the School of Psychology, as they are desperatly looking for free CogPsy books. --[[User:Aschoeke|Aschoeke]] 14:59, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

==How to write a book==

Another hint: If you still have trouble to find the right form for your introduction or have some concept problems then take a look on this page: [[:de:Hilfe:Neues Buch beginnen/ Gliederung zuerst]]. This page is in german though. -- 
[[User:Iroewer|Iroewer]]

==500 words==

Hey people, there is hardly anyone that has the required 500 words Schmalhofer wants you to have in your introduction! If you don't know how to count your words, just copy them to Word. There you click EXTRAS, 'Wörter zählen' and you get the information you need.

[[User:Iroewer|Iroewer]] 01:19 29 April 2006 (UTC)

:Actually in the paragraph, he talks about &quot;up to 500 Words&quot;. I misread it to first. Still, I think, that it is better to be in the over 300 area.
Bye,--[[User:84.136.177.206|84.136.177.206]] 01:16, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

----
== Final State ==

2 hours before deadline, most chaps are close to be complete. I don't want to decide when it is. So please update the front page and change in the stage-tag from 75% to 100% when you think, that you are finished!

The deadline is standing for today 24 o'clock. No exception. Stuff that is added later can not be considered for grading!

BTW, we are listed as &quot;Good Wikibook&quot; and we are close to be a featured one! :)

== Overview ==

The '''''Grey Lady''''' is Ghost of Ravenclaw House.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

The Grey Lady helps [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] find information about the lost Ravenclaw diadem, which has been made into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. We discover that she was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s daughter Helena, and had stolen the diadem and hidden it in Albania. Harry correctly determines that it had been retrieved by Voldemort, and stored in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] (in its Junk Storeroom state).

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

It turns out that the character who became [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]] on his death had gone to Albania, where the Grey Lady (as she became) had been hiding, to bid her come back to see her mother before she died. When she refused, the Baron, angered, had killed her.

The Grey Lady apparently stole the Diadem from Rowena Ravenclaw out of jealousy of her mother's achievements or fame. We are not told why she refused to return, though we can safely guess that it was either fear of retribution, or remorse.

&lt;noinclude&gt;
From [[Rueda de Casino/Guapea|Guapea]], the follower does an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]], and the leader moves in front of her, facing the centre of the circle, changing hands so that he has her right hand in his right.  He then steps back on his left on 1, while she steps back on her right, and they do basic steps, 'bouncing' in opposite directions for a few bars.

The caller will use one of these two calls:

* Dame - on 5, the leaders move towards the follower to the right, and &lt;b&gt;continue doing Cubano&lt;/b&gt; with the new follower.  This is different to the usual [[Rueda de Casino/Dame|Dame]].

* Se Fue - on 1, when the leader is to the right of the follower, he will change hands so that his left holds her right, and give her an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]] then [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].

Typically there will be a couple of Dame calls, then Se Fue.

She repeats this turn, then [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].

The leader needs to be firm with this, push her straight back out of the circle, otherwise she may turn.  Also, some followers will be unfamiliar with the right turn (it's actually the same footwork as [[Rueda de Casino/Setenta|Setenta]] for the followers, except with less turn), so you may need to use your left hand to 'guide' her back out of the circle.

Keep hold of her right hand with your left, and turn to your right, all the way, on the spot, to face her again.  Push her hand as in [[Rueda de Casino/Guapea|Guapea]], then duck underneath her arm to return to a normal hold, then back to [[Rueda de Casino/Guapea|Guapea]].

This is a standard move, but the name is not standard.  We made it up because we didn't know the name.

      <comment>Undid revision 1613705 by [[Special:Contributions/220.225.252.2|220.225.252.2]] ([[User talk:220.225.252.2|discuss]]) empty category?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Conditional comments are a proprietary extension to Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows (IE/win) version 5.0 and later. They are not available in Internet Explorer for Mac (IE/mac). They are a very useful way of handling the CSS bugs in the various versions of Internet Explorer.

== Syntax ==
An ordinary (X)HTML comment looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This text will be ignored by the browser. --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Conditional comments add additional syntax to comments. The simplest example is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE]&amp;gt; This text will be shown by IE/win ver. 5.0 and higher. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Browsers that don't understand the conditional comment syntax will process this as a normal comment, i.e. the content of the comment will be ignored.

Specific versions of IE/win can be targeted by changing the expression after the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;. For example to target any version of IE/win with a major version of 5 use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE 5]&amp;gt; The major version number of this browser is 5. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The text will display in IE/win versions 5.0 and 5.5.

To target a specific version number, e.g. 5.0, the syntax is slightly quirky.
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE 5.0]&amp;gt; You are using IE/win 5.0. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE '''5.5000''']&amp;gt; You are using IE/win 5.5. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE 6.0]&amp;gt; You are using IE/win 6.0. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Inequalities can be used in the expression by placing an operator '''before''' the &lt;code&gt;IE&lt;/code&gt;. The operators are:
;&lt;code&gt;lt&lt;/code&gt; : less than (but at least version 5.0 which is the lowest version supporting conditional comments)
;&lt;code&gt;lte&lt;/code&gt; : less than or equal (but at least version 5.0 which is the lowest version supporting conditional comments)
;&lt;code&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt; : greater than
;&lt;code&gt;gte&lt;/code&gt; : greater than or equals

Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if gte IE 6]&amp;gt; This text will be shown by IE/win ver. 6.0 and higher. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

All the expressions can be negated by prefixing with &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if !gte IE 6]&amp;gt; This text will be shown by verions of IE/win ver. below 6 that support conditional comments. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;


&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if !IE]&amp;gt; This text will be not be shown by any version of IE/win that understands conditional comments. It won't be shown by any other browsers either because they will treat this as a normal comment. &amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The second example may seem pointless but with a small tweak you can arrange to hide text from IE/win version 5 and above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if !IE]&amp;gt;--&amp;gt; This text will be not be shown by any version of IE/win that understands conditional comments. It will be shown by other browsers because they will treat this as text sandwiched between two normal comments. &amp;lt;!--&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The following HTML document is a working example.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Conditional comments&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;--&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is page is not being viewed with Internet Explorer for Windows version 5.0 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE]&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is page is being viewed with Internet Explorer for Windows version 5.0 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;![endif]--&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Use with CSS ==
Conditional comments can be used to pass additional stylesheets to IE/win. These stylesheets can provide fixes to layout bugs in IE/win. The basic idea is:
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Conditional comments&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE 5]&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;bugFixForIE5x.css&quot;&gt;
    &lt;![endif]--&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">CSS allows the reader of a document to apply style sheets to the document. These are called ''user style sheets''. They become part of the cascade along with the author's style sheets.

The following sections explain how you can set your own user style sheet in various web browsers—Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Opera.

== Apple Safari ==
Setting a user style sheet in Apple Safari:
# Create a style sheet and save it on a drive that can be seen by the user.
# Open Safari.
# Select Safari  I Preferences... from the menus.
# On the Advanced tab, with the Style Sheet combo box select &quot;Other...&quot;.
#  Browse for the file.

The user style sheet is loaded when it is set up and when Safari is started.

== Mozilla Firefox ==
Setting a user style sheet in Mozilla Firefox:
# Find your profile by following [http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile Mozilla's instructions].
# Create a style sheet and save it as &lt;code&gt;userContent.css&lt;code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;chrome&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory of your profile.

== Opera ==
Setting a user style sheet in Opera:
# Create a style sheet and save it on a drive that can be seen by the user.
# Open Opera.
# Select Tools&gt;Preferences... from the menus.
# On the Advanced tab select Content from the list on the left.
# Click on the 'Styles options...' button.
# Fill in the 'My style sheet' box.

For a full description of Opera's style modes, refer to [[Style_Presentation_Modes_in_Opera_12.16|'''Style Presentation Modes in Opera 12.16''']].

== Windows Internet Explorer ==
Setting a user style sheet in Internet Explorer for Windows:
# Create a style sheet and save it on a drive that can be seen by the user.
# Open Internet Explorer.
# Select Tools&gt; I nternet Options... from the menus.
# On the General tab click on Accessibility... (near bottom right).
# Under 'User style sheet' check 'Format documents using my style sheet'.
# Either type the location of the style sheet into the box or browse for the file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As anyone who throws parties in warehouses will tell you, good lighting can change a harsh, uninviting, dirty and burned out building or parking lot into something inviting, cozy, and warm.  In situations where you can't bring in rugs, where there are no internal walls, little furniture, etc., it is the light that ends up organizing a space.

Thankfully, there are cheap, simple ways of structuring light to make community spaces.

== General ==

Avoid work lights, clip lights, and bare bulbs.  They reinforce the disaster area harshness.

== Indoor Suggestions:  Paper Lanterns ==

In occupying the remnants of a pre-disaster building, I recommend dangling china ball paper lanterns from the ceiling in clusters to illuminate focused areas with warm, diffused light.

# run romex or UF [[w:power cable|power cable]] across the ceiling from a [[w:circuit breaker|circuit breaker]] or generator, and put 4 outlet-junctions at points across the ceiling.
# cut or wrap wires for each individual bulb, with a bulb socket on one end, and a plug on the other.  make them long enough to (A) cross the ceiling from the junction to wherever you want to hang the light and then (B) dangle down from the ceiling an appropriate distance.  a good height for lighting is 7 or 8 ft, just above where a person can reach.
# the Chinese [[w:Paper Moon (lantern)|Paper Moon]] lanterns attach to the same wire that the socket is on, just above the socket, and enclose the bulb.

With a good ladder and proper wire and wirecutters/strippers ready, two people can do the ceiling wire and 5 lanterns in an hour.  If you need to wrap your own wire, make it two hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Programmming: An introduction==
Before you even begin programming, it would be a good idea to understand a little bit about what you are getting into. This chapter will help you understand the purpose of programming, as well as some basic concepts of it.

===Getting things done===
The point of ''any'' program is to accomplish some task, whether it be as simple as a calculation or as complex as a computer game, a program gets something done. Think of the computer as a person awaiting instructions; You must speak that person's language in order to tell them what you want done, and you must give that person your instructions. It is the same with the computer, you need to know the computer's '''language''' as well as give it '''instructions''' in that language.

That is what a program is, a series of instructions in the computer's language.

 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#efefef&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
|'''Note:''' A Programming language is not really the language a computer uses. The computers native language is actually ''Binary''. Computers therefore need a''Compiler'' to translate from code to Binary.
|}

===Instructions===
As mentioned earlier, a program is a series of instructions in the computer's language. And just as English has words and grammar, so does a programming language.

Let's say you wanted Bob to go to the store and get some eggs. You could say, 

'''&quot;Bob, go to the store.&quot;'''

Bob would not get you your eggs though. He would go to the store, just as you instructed him however. The same concept applies to programming, you need to tell the computer ''exactly'' what you want done. Because the computer won't be able to guess what you mean. So instead, you tell Bob:

'''&quot;Bob, go to the store - eggs.&quot;'''

This time, bob might get the eggs; but only because he could guess you meant to get some eggs. But a computer would not understand you if you programmed like that. Instead you would tell bob:

'''&quot;Bob, go to the store and get 12 eggs; be back at 5:00&quot;''' This would tell bob exactly what to do.

Your '''instructions''' (programs) should always be precise, using the correct grammar of the programming language. Remember, a computer can only do what you tell it to.

===Language===
In order to give your computer instructions however, you must know a language you can talk to it in. In this case the language is '''Game Maker Language (GML)'''. You will learn more about GML in the upcoming chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intro ==

Functional Analysis can mean many things depending on which mathematician you ask. The core of the subject, however, is to study linear spaces with some topology which allows us to do analysis; ones like spaces of functions, spaces of operators acting on the space of functions, etc.

== Hilbert space ==

A Banach space is called a Hilbert space if for each ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; of elements in the space there is a unique complex number called an ''inner product'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Do I Need To Be Connected==
...  to the Internet to create HTML Pages?

No, in fact you don't need to be connected to the Internet at all to create web-pages. If the pages are not ready for publication or the site is not ready ... the pages can be stored on your computer, a ZIP drive, a flash drive, wherever.

I have spent months generating entire web-sites offline prior to &quot;publishing&quot; them online.

==Using a Macintosh Computer==
If you are using TextEdit on a Macintosh computer, the steps for creating a web-page are a little different than when using Windows Notepad.

From the Format Menu, you must first select Make Plain Text and then change the preferences under the Saving header by unchecking the box for Append '.txt' Extension to Plain Text Files.

Also, the default preferences are set to show .html as they would appear in a browser, which will not allow you to edit them. To fix this, check the Ignore Rich Text Commands in HTML Files under the Rich Text Processing header.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What else does this page need? It's pretty basic right now. Does it need more technical detail? Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 17:41, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

====Added a section about ruby laser====
I added some illustrations of a ruby laser. I took some artistic license to make the pictures clearer and hopefully easier to understand. They need to be checked for accuracy. They might need to be resized (I left most of them about half their full size). Also need to know if the brightness/contrast is ok on other monitors. 

I also added a description which needs to be checked for accuracy, without making it too technical. I wonder if the heading &quot;How a Ruby Laser Works&quot; might be deleted, and just mention in the introductory paragraph that the section describes the working of a ruby laser? Maybe there's no need for the sub-headings at all? --[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 18:17, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

Hi, I think the technical level is appropriate for the wikijunior level-no problems there.

The section on the internals of the ruby rod/silvered vessel is maybe a little light on content-suggest that you make note of the highly silvered/reflective vessel that focusses the flash-tube energy into the rod, as well as the necessity for water cooling within the vessel-The laser is very hot when working.

Otherwise good explanation!
--[[User:Xrayman|Richard]] 02:41, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for the advice.  I added your points to the text. Probably some omissions and errors remaining in the ruby laser section, if anyone wants to make corrections.  I think other sections need to be simplified if they're going to be understood by the average 8-year-old. --[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 05:46, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

“Stress &amp; Heart Disease”


Cardiovascular disease has a number of behavioral risk factors, some of which are related to sress. Studies from 1970s seem to support the notion that stress leads to the people who died of a sudden heart attack had experienced more stressful life events in the 6 months preceding the attack than did those who survived (Rahe, Romo, Bennett &amp; Siltanen, 1974)

In 1897, Sir Simon Osler noted, &quot;in the worry &amp; strain of modern life,jarterial degeneration is not only very common but develops at a relatively early age. For this, i believe that the high pressure at which men live, and the habit of working the machine to its maximum capacity are responsible for coronary disease,&quot;

Medical researchers are not sure wxactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. Stress itself might be a risk factor, or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as high cholesterol or high B.P.) worse. For example, if you are under stress, your blood pressure goes up, you may overeat, heart beat increase, you may exercise less &amp; you may be more likely to smoke.

There has been a lot of research in this field over the last two decades and the results obtained show clearly that excessive stress can lead to the following

* Increase in Heart Rate
* Increase in B.P.
* Increased concentration of fat in blood.
* Increased Blood Sugar.
* Increased Cholesterol in Blood.
* Increased Blood Clotting.
* Increased deposition of fat &amp; Cholesterol in the arteries.
* Spasm of Coronary &amp; other arteries.

This shows us that stress in itself is such an influential risk factor that even in the absence of other risk factors it can become responsible for coronary heart disease. We can call stess the mother of all risk factors as it can single handedly give rise to various other factors.

There are many cases or people without high cholesterol, overweight and family history, having normal b.p. developing angina only because of excessive stress. The problem with stress is that there are no means of measuring it even with the latest scientific gadgets. There is not unit, such as ml, mm,mg, etc. to define it.Because of this reason modern science &amp; cardiologists have specifically abstained from talking about stress in heart disease. It is now known that city dwellers have 3 times more chances of heart disease than those in small villages, the major reason being excessive stress in city life.

Research has also revealed that Type A personalities who are aggressive, always short of tim,  short tempered and stessful are much more prone to develop heart disease.Most of the youg heart patients of modern day have Type A behavior.

It is obvious that without controlling stress we can not stop the progress of heart disease. Sudden stress or anger leads to the spasm of coronary arteries that precipitates sudden angina and heart attacks. This is the reason or mechanism why many people develop heart disease

Hi Guillom,

This is waht we're looking for so far.

*For the image page itself, use: {{tl|No license}}
:*For the 3 users who have hundreds of images uploaded without tags, it might be better to use a modified template that adds them to their own separate category (e.g.: Images without copyright uploaded by &lt;username&gt;)...if the bot can wait on those, that might be a good idea.
*For the uploading user, use: {{tl|Image copyright}}
*If possible, it might be nice to add {{tl|Imgd}} to pages using the image (after the cleanup is completed, this template will be altered to say that the images were deleted, and why)

Let me know what you think. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:37, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

:Hi johnny,
:Everything's ok except the last part. Tagging all pages where there are tagged images will be really much work. I'll see if I can do it, but I can't promise for this part.
:About the uploading user, do we agree on the fact I should warn him only once, even if there are several of his images tagged?

::Ok, I figured that might not work too well.
::I don't know about the once-warning thing... I'd like to make sure they know which images have problems. Though for the ones with 100s of images, obviously not (I think the bot should just leave those ones alone). 
::Another idea might be to have a dry run that just has the bot leave a notice on the talk page with a link to their list of untagged on the tolserver, so, for example, [[User:JamBam16]] would recieve a warning and a link to [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=-num&amp;max=500&amp;img_user_text=JamBam16&amp;grouped= this page] (holy crap! look at his contribs!)
::Going back to irc now... --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
:::About tagging pages containing images without license: I think we could avoid it by using the [[MediaWiki:Sitenotice]] to warn everybody.
:::About the once-warning: yes, I think the best solution is to provide the link to their untagged images. The question is: I don't know if the images « tagged as untagged » still appear in the list. We should try and see. Another solution is to provide a link to the upload log of the user.
:::Last thing: Where should I redirect people who have questions about licenses? I will add a message on my talk page to warn people I won't answer them, so I have to direct them to such a page. [[User:Guillom|guillom]] 10:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial describes the creation of stone textures.

*1: We start with Solid Noise (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Render &gt; Clouds &gt; Solid Noise''). Remember to tick the Tileable check box.

You can modify this a bit, but its effect may appear negative in the final result.
You will see a rather smooth texture.

[[Image:Solidnoise.png]]

If you plan to make your image seamless, perhaps for usage in a 3D application, you might want to do a Gaussian Blur (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur) at 100 to make the texture more neutral.

[[Image:Smoothsolidnoise.png]]--&gt;

*2: Now you have to add some stony grit on it. This can be done with Scatter RGB (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Noise &gt; Scatter RGB'') with Independent RGB off and the values very low (Recommended around 0.05 per channel)



*3: Create a New Layer using the New Layer button [[Image:Newlayer.png]] on the layer window (If you don't have one, in The Gimp's main window, go to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Toolbox&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; File &gt; Dialogs &gt; Create New Doc &gt; Layers, Channels, and Paths''.) and do the Plasma filter (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filter &gt; Render &gt; Clouds &gt; Plasma''). Try to get a good balance of black and white. Don't forget to set the Mode in the layer window to &quot;Value&quot; (not &quot;Normal&quot;).

[[File:GIMP Plasma.png]]

Moving the turbulence up just a little can also help if your aiming to make the texture seamless.

[[Image:Heavyplasma.png]]

*4: Now you have to use Lighting Effects (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Light Effects &gt; Lighting Effects''), go to the bump map tab and choose the layer with the rendered Plasma. Place the light source as desired. Let the plug-in do the rest.

[[Image:Stone_gimp.png]]

If you need to make your texture seamless, you probably want to do a Bump map instead, which has the same lighting for all pixels.

[[Image:Gobo1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A gobo]]
A '''Gobo''' (derived from ''Go Between'' or '''Go'''''es'' '''B'''''efore'' '''O'''''ptics'') is a thin piece of metal, wood, or glass used to used to modify the shape of the projected light. It is generally used with Ellipsoidal Reflector Spots, which normally provide a specific slot for gobo use. Old soda cans make a cheap replacement for custom made metal gobos, but don't last as long as professionally made gobos.

Plastic gobos—which are generally custom made—are available when a pattern is needed in color and glass does not suffice. However, these thin plastic films generally need to be used with special cooling elements to prevent melting them. A lapse in the cooling apparatus, even for just a few seconds, can cause an expensive gobo to be ruined.

Glass gobos can become very complex, and can make use of coloring, much like a stained glass window. 

Most manufacturers produce a swatch book of their gobos, and like gels they are referred to by a number rather than name. For example, most manufacturers offer a gobo of a window, but they are all slightly different. So instead of calling it ''window'', it would be identified as gobo 77143 [http://www.rosco.com/us/gobocatalog/gobos/pages/77143.html]

'''Horse''' produce a meat that is sweet, tender, low in fat, and high in protein. Just like [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] and [[Cookbook:pork|pork]], in some societies there is a taboo regarding the consumption of horse meat.

Horse meat has about 40% less calories than even the leanest beef, while supplying 50% more protein and up to 30% more iron.{{fact}}

=== Can someone expand upon Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)? ===
Particularly these questions taken from the Wikipedia article (which isn't so good either).

* I would appreciate more visual aids to elaborate on both the '''electromagnetic explanation''' (physical explanation) and '''charge-transfer complex''' (chemical explanation). I barely understand what charge-transfer complex means, but I have no idea how that links to SERS.
* I like the '''tennis ball + spring system analogy''' presented on the Raman spectroscopy page. It could be cleaned up and with a few diagrams could make this article much more approachable to newcomers like myself.
* To what extent do you need to understand '''quantum mechanics to begin interpreting Raman data''', specifically SERS? How about '''electromagnetics'''? Could these prerequisites be '''simply motivated and explained''' in this article? 
* I keep hearing about '''selection rules''', are these related to quantum mechanics somehow?
* I also hear that understanding '''group theory''' helps explain Raman and a lot of spectroscopic techniques in general. Can someone help explain why?
** I know it has something to do with symmetry and all these methods have something to do with squishing and twisting and bending chemical bonds, but the math gets very boring and uninteresting and it's easy to lose sight of why I'm learning it.
* Can someone perhaps fix up the article to include some '''more contextual information like where near-IR, mid-IR, far-IR, etc. methods fit in''', perhaps with some nice animated GIFs showing what goes on in each?

Much excellent work has gone into this article since April, and it is now 45 KB long. Perhaps it is time to begin splitting it into several articles? If not now, what criteria do we use to determine when it should be split? ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 13:39, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

: Yes it seems to be about 'split-up' time. I have been waiting for more contributors to join, so we can settle on a structure of the material, and once thats settled, then split it up (and then I like the idea that the whole book could be printed out in one go - but as it stands now its not suitable for printing as its mainly links in many sections) [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 19:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

I checked some of the other wikibooks, as we would probably want to structure it similar to those, and it appears they all have a front page which is basically a table of contents to several other pages, each of which is a subpage of the first one. e.g. [[Acoustics]] points to [[Acoustics/Fundamentals_of_Acoustics]]. So once we agree on the name of the top page, we can create subpages for each of the major sections in a similar way. ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 16:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

I have split the article into subsections - right now just 7 sections. As some of these will grow theý can be put on individual pages and get links directly from the the main table of contents as they have done in other books. [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 22:28, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

=== Search engines ===
How is '''Google Desktop''' relevant as a ''Nanotechnology Related Search Engine''? That is like saying Google is useful for searching about nanotechnology, which it is, but listing it here is still not very helpful. Plus, its only useful at all if you have documents about nanotechnology on your hard drive, which many of the readers of this article will not. ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 16:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

: I agree completely, but it is such a nice program that I thought it deserved the PR :-) if you do have lots of nanotech files on your hdd, google desktop is a wonderful tool to find what you want and things you thought you didn't even have. [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 19:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

=== Article name ===
Looking at the [[Wikibooks:Physics bookshelf|Physics bookshelf]], the names of this article, and the one on [[Microwiki]], appear to be inconsistent with all the others, such as [[Astronomy]], [[Engineering Thermodynamics]], and [[Special relativity]]. Is there some reason these names were picked rather than something like [[Nanotechnology]] and [[Microtechnology]], which currently just redirect to these articles? Perhaps the names of these two articles should be changed to make them more obvious and straightforward? ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 16:49, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

: It could also be nanoscience and microfabrication and ... there are so many variations over the micro/nano theme. that's why I made redirects to something simple that I can remember and fairly unique so it can be found through search engines easily (though there are some uses of microwiki and nanowiki on the net already). If its confusing we can change it. [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 19:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

Personally I think ''Nanowiki'' is confusing. It confuses the technology with the tool we are using to document the technology. I think we should just keep it simple and name it [[Nanotechnology]], the most commonly used and searched for term. The fact that it also includes a lot of Nanoscience is not confusing, it is just that the technology depends so much on the science, just like many other fields, such as [[Biotechnology]]. ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 16:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

: I have moved both books (microwiki and nanowiki) - and now theres a bit of work to be done changing links in the wikimedia; wikibooks subject pages; and wikipedia - but they can stay for a while since nanowiki/microwiki redirects. Better to all that now before we start adding images etc...--[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 08:42, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

This edit was made to the ---Search engines--- section at 09:50, 5 September 2006. The edit was lost when I redid the pagemove, I didn't put it back in because it seems to go against the format of the surrounding sections. Edit was as follows, completely replaced the search engines section as it is currently:

=== Talk page history ===
FYI: due to the copy paste of this article to a new one, and the subsequent revert and move of the article, somehow the history on this talk page before Sept 4 was lost (or at least I cannot find it). Fortunately the history on the main article page was not lost. ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 13:14, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
: yes, I was in doubt about how to make the move from nanowiki to nanotechnology and sb-johnny helped me to get it right for the main page. But all edits are still visible on the talk page, so nothing is really lost. [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 19:29, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

=='Chat' about the future of the Nanotechnology wikibook==
[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 21:23, 21 November 2006 (UTC): I'm asking several people to join and contribute specific sections I know they have written about. I also hope to set up an editorial board for the book.

==Structure of the book==
The section on nanomaterials is based on quick attempt to divide them. I'm not sure of some other division wouldn't be more suitable. The introduction describes various ways of classifying nanomaterials and it could be done in still more ways. Comments on ways to divide this chapter are very welcome! [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 18:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

==If you would you like to contribute:==
On the subject of the future of Nanotechnology wikibook: I'm wondering if you would like my help? I've never contributed to anything on neither Wikipedia nor Wikibooks before and I am being Swedish, so I might need some help with editing  texts I've written (like spell-checking and such). But I am studying nanoscience and I believe I could contribute in areas like perhaps electron microscopy or some applications, like nanowires etc. I mean - of course I can add anything I want - I just wonder if someone know something that is more urgent or wanted (or something that this person feel is too boring to write him/her-self).
[[User:Deity|Deity]] 23:25, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Deity - you are very welcome to add and edit where ever you feel you can contribute! The book is still just starting and I think it would be nice to have small sections on all subjects to sort of cover the entire subject minimally for a start. I hope it will be more appealing for people to add more material to a page that already contains material than a blank page. So if there is a rather empty section where you feel you already have material, know a lot, or would find it fun to contribute then please go ahead! If you would like someone to proof read it, you can email it to me first - but the wiki users are generally very good at helping proof reading so i would just upload it and we can take it from there.

Material is in preparation for the section on environmental nanotechnology, but just add to these pages if you want to, then we'll edit it together when the off line material gets uploaded. 18:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Intorduction - Origins and Background ==

I'm a newbie...was surfing by and noticed the Wikibook title.

Perhaps someone more qualified than myself can contribute information to the Introduction that gives background to lay readers about both the origins of the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; and its earliest roots. 

What I ''do'' know is that the late Navy Commodore Grace Hopper is generally considered to have coined the term as early as the 1940s, when she was heading up a mainframe computer project, in cooperation with IBM, in the bowels of the Pentagon. I heard her give a first-hand account of the work she had done on this project, which pioneered the way for nanotechnology, in a speech she gave on the topic at a trade association (American Logistics Association) conference--in the context of emerging information technologies, problems with slow government payments to vendors/suppliers, and the potential for using electronic funds transfer (EFT) to address the problem--in the mid-1980s. 

People working or studying in the nanotechnology field will no doubt have heard of Grace Hopper and may be able to more readily fill in these blanks on the Introduction's canvas.--[[User:Alangray53|Alangray53]] 14:37, 23 December 2006 (UTC)Alan Gray

== Nanomagnetizm ==

Its good but ı think there must be some information about nanomagnetizm because we can see most interesting changes in magnetizm when we go from bulk to nano size.

== Printable Version ==

I suggest this book should be printable and downloadable as PDF because that will ease most low-budget people to take this book entirely in one attempt.[[User:Robin688|Robin688]] ([[User talk:Robin688|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Robin688|contribs]]) 15:59, 2 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

=Status on the book=
This book was started based on a few notes I had made - and the feeling that there was a need for such a resource. But it is a big project and it will take time to fill in the big gaps to make a complete book. The related book on [[Nanotechnology]] is taking most of my resources these days, while I hope to others will start adding to this one. It could also have been made as a 'bookshelf' in wikibooks - and if this book remains fragmented for too long, I suggest we cut it down to a couple of short notes/books.//[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 20:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

=Comments=

Where can I find a book on how to design microchips? Would this fall under this booK? I've looked all around wikibooks and wikipedia and I cannot find anything on this - how to design chips - what programs to use... are there GNU programs to design chips? How to manufacture them... ie... you can't you need to have billion dollar fabs... or there are other less well known methods or companies that will homebrew or custom fab chips... Just some thoughts. Interesting book so far though. --anon user (some interested party on the west coast) 4 December 2006
: See section [[Microtechnology/Overviews#Books]] and the software section further down on the page - and hopefully this wikibook will end up having much material about all the microfabrication processes too. There are many foundry services where you can have custom made microfabrication done for you. I have addded a list of some foundry services to the above page as well -you are welcome to expand it! //[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 20:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

=linking to microwiki=
In wikipedia you can link to this book kby adding 
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{wikibookspar||The Opensource Handbook of Microfabrication and Microtechnology}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a little box as the one on the right{{wikibookspar||The Opensource Handbook of Microfabrication and Microtechnology}}
which for some reason doesnt work very well in wikibooks...

= Missing step in fabrication (big one) =

What about the first step in the fabrication process- the growth of silicon crystals and then the use of lasers to cut the silicon into wafers so that they may later be etched with the various lithographic techniques? I have been unable to find a review on laser-cutting re: silicon, and it would be great if anybody could offer some links. Or add the content. :) -- [[User:Kanzure|Kanzure]] 15:46, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

Why is information about laser-cutting silicon is so difficult to find?
Could it be that silicon isn't actually cut using lasers?

According to [[Wikipedia:Wafer (electronics)]], the boule is actually cut into wafers using a diamond saw or diamond wire.

== delete and clear pages ==
Still not happy with the need to, since sometimes its hard to remember to comply (I could be moving content about in large volumes), and nonobservance should not generate more work and be seen as an imposition on others.

Could you during a week or so refrain from looking into the &quot;page as tagged&quot; and just click on the dif. of the last edit ?
I think that this practice will not only remove the problem of clear pages but will also intersect 2 edits at a time, and so it would be more productive. If this works for a time probably we could add the info somewhere or spread the method to other admits. Administrators are less in number, so failure to observe the &quot;new&quot; practice will be reduced, and any fault to observe it will affect the user himself (the acting admin).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:01, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

:Panic, do what you want to do. I only ask as a courtesy. I'll continue to examine pages as I have, and either you'll make it easier or you won't. There is no &quot;new method&quot;, most people don't perpetually wipe pages clean. I only asked because you are doing a fair bit of merging / moving / tagging work and it would have been nice if you could work with us instead of at us. Whatever, just carry on in your own way and disregard - it's only our time, after all, so don't worry.

:Panic, I already do check the history and compare some versions. I prefer to at least know what I'm dealing with, however, and your page erasures and lack of edit comments confounds that. But again, it's my time, and that is apparently not important to you, so do whatever you prefer - as apparently you intend to anyway.

::What I'm attempting (but failing to) is providing an alternate solution that by a simple change on the first step will not only remove the problem but be more productive in general.
::I presume that the pages tagged for deletion are shown to admins like the pages on patrol, does delete require one also to see the &quot;current&quot; status of the page to delete them ? (if so you could have saved us lots of time if you had explained this to me)
::That would indeed remove the usefulness of starting the operation by the click of the dif. , even if that is the case there is a very hight probability that 90% of the delete actions would require one to check not only the logs but major changes of content and even require one to see how and if content was moved to other pages by users (so to preserve the edit logs).
::This is also a problem I have in the patrol option, it only shown the the option to validate the page on the first view, making it less useful to correct edits or even to tag pages since it will require a reloading of the page from the patrol view or back stepping into that view.
::[[User:Mike.lifeguard]] I already stated that I would start to comply with the request, that doesn't bar me from asking questions or proposing a better solution.

A friendly reminder for you this time. When adding tags to pages, please mark them patrolled to avoid duplication of work. To get the patrol link, you have to access the page from [[Special:Newpages]] (pending [[bugzilla:12572]]). Also, I've been developing a [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Twinkle Speedy documentation|script]] for [[WB:NPP|NPP]] that I'd like to get tested more widely.

:IME, duplication of patrolling effort is a Good Thing. I certainly pick up things that others don't and assume it works ''vice versa''. Besides, I'm trying to cut down on my work - have set up an RSS aggregator to watch some books, so that I can just watch RC@Cookbook: and RC. When patrolling works from RC, I'll consider it. (yes, I know, duplication vs cut down on work - I'm not cutting down on patrolling, just rationalising it so I can get through it faster without dropping any checks) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:56, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Topology/Bases ==

Sorry, I wasn't quite clear. I just want those two sentences to be on seperate lines, and indented so that they look like a part of the problem, bulleting is not required. 
Thanks a lot for the help.

== Image copyright ==

Sorry for the breaching, but I still do not understand how to do with it. I upload this picture in terms of these two sentences from the website,[http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/image_linking.html http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/image_linking.html] and  [http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/bibliography.html http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/bibliography.html]:

== Upload ==

Cheers for the welcome. What do I have to do to be allowed to upload images for my contribution? [[User:開|開]] ([[User talk:開|talk]])
:Hello, 開. Let me answer for Webaware, as he does not appear to be online at the moment. Your account must be at least four days old, and then you will automatically have the ability to upload images here. However, it may be more beneficial if you upload these images to [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]], as they can then also be used on other Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, as well as here. Let me know if you need further assistance.

== License missing ==

Sorry for bothering you again. Since its license missed, yesterday I just deleted the link with it and followed &quot;Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add a license template and source; ...&quot; So my action must confuse you. --[[User:Yliang|Yliang]] ([[User talk:Yliang|talk]]) 18:02, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

You said that [[:Image:Sonar Principle EN.svg]] had been re-done with non-garbled text, but it doesn't appear to be. Is it just my system, or have I done something wrong / stupid / etc.? Thanks --[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|talk]]) 10:26, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

== Image upload help ==

I wish to upload an image that I've created in MS Paint and so I have it available as a &quot;.bmp&quot; or &quot;.doc&quot; file. I don't know much about these things, so could you tell me how I can convert it to one of the acceptable formats? Thanks!

[[User:SPat|SPat]] ([[User talk:SPat|talk]]) 15:41, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

:G'day SPat, .bmp aren't very web-friendly images and .doc are a no-no. I'm assuming you're running on Windows, so download [http://www.irfanview.com/ IrfanView] (a really handy, free graphics manipulation program). Open the .bmp in IrfanView, and save as a .png with maximum compression.
:You might want to see if the image looks the same when you reduce the number of colours - e.g. many .bmp files use 24-bit colour, usually an overkill as they can often be reduced to 256 colours without loss of colour but with major reduction in size.
:Now it is ready for upload to Wikibooks or the [[Commons:|Wiki Commons]]. NB: Commons is generally a better place to host images, as they can then be shared with Wikibooks in  other languages, and other Wiki projects. Be sure that the images you upload are licensed properly, or they will be deleted! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:52, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

Thanks a lot. Due to time constraints, I have uploaded the image only to Wikibooks and not commons. I'll do something about it when I'm back in a fortnight. 

[[User:SPat|SPat]] ([[User talk:SPat|talk]]) 10:30, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

:No worries. You might want to check out what images are already available on Commons too - there's actually quite a bit up there. Also, if you need a hand with specific images (e.g. that one you uploaded), I can help either with transformations or rebuilding as vector graphics (SVG). cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:37, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

== Regarding the pages on Physics for dummies ==

Regarding the speedy deletion candidatute, I'd like to clarify that those pages are NOT misplaced edits. Its just that I have used scanned notes as base modules. The text on geometrical opptics will be available within a few hours' time.

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 10:36, 19 April 2008 (UTC)

:Do you have a plan to develop text from these scanned images of handwritten notes? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:33, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

:: Definitely! At present, I am doing whatever I can to write modules that can serve as templates for writing effective textbooks - you might want to check the [[Problems In Highschool Chemistry]] text for example. I abandoned it, because developing the text while publishing it online was very slow paced. The handwritten notes thus serve as texts for any readers till then and may as well fetch me some volunteers. If not, I'll wikify them someday anyways. &lt;B&gt;Someday soon than later, because the texts need to be edited!&lt;/B&gt;--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 16:55, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

== The IIT JEE QP Scans ==

My apologies for the mistake regarding the scans. They are NOT my work. The mistake occurred because I was repeatedly using the back button for the uploads. Also, the IIT JEE Question papers are recreated based on students' recollection of them by various tutors and hence are in the public domain.

My arguement miht be wrong, but it is a fact that the various publications here in India that provide the solutions to these &lt;I&gt;Memory Based, Recreated&lt;/I&gt; papers have never been warned by any of the seven IITs for copyright infringement or similar legal constraints.

Only the solutions to the questions are the property of their publishers. Again, since the wikibooks solutions book is my work, it will be open source.

I hope that clears the concerns regarding source.--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 16:47, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

== .SVG images ==
G'day! I am currently working on [[Solved Question Papers IIT JEE]] which requires me to submit tones of figures as images. Earlier I used Jasc Paint Shop Pro to create images in .svg (a real LONG time ago) but i was not satisfied with the images particularly because there was nothing vector about them! There was no way I could draw Cartesian curves or LOGO [the fd 100 rt 90 logo ;)] figures with it. These are needed because I require scaled diagrams!

Effectively, I have zero experience in dealing with svg images. Can you recommend me some editor (preferably freeware) and some starter’s guide to svg images? I would have searched online if you would not have been experienced enough with .svg to give me just the right piece of info!
--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 03:05, 24 April 2008 (UTC)

:G'day, I use Inkscape on Linux - it's available on Windows as well, is free, and popular amongst other wiki contributors.
:One thing you need to watch for is text - the wiki projects dynamically convert .svg to .png on the fly, resized to fit the image: tag, and the conversion often doesn't get the text flows right. To fix that, you need to convert text objects to paths before uploading to wiki.

:Because that image has a copyright license not compatible with Commons, it can't be loaded there. You could load it into Wikibooks if you can supply a [[WB:MEDIA#Non-free use|fair use rationale]], but you would need to demonstrate that it has a purpose other than just for decoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''In his book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, Charles Darwin wrote that creatures experience genetic mutations prior to birth.'' 
Clarification of this sentence is required.  Darwin was not aware of &quot;genetic mutations&quot;.  Mendel's work with hybrid crosses with peas was the door to understanding genetic mutations; but while he was conducting his experiments between 1856 and 1863, his research was not known until 1900 by de Vries and Corran.  While this is a small point, it is a very important one, as it implies an understanding of meiotic processes (and thereby an understanding of biology) that was unknown before the rediscovery of Mendel's work.

'''Lithium ion batteries''' (sometimes abbreviated '''Li-Ion''') are a type of [[w:rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[w:battery (electricity)|battery]] commonly used in consumer electronics. They are currently one of the most popular types of battery, with one of the best energy-to-weight ratios, no [[w:memory effect|memory effect]] and a slow loss of charge when not in use.  They can be dangerous if mistreated, however, and unless care is taken they may have a shorter lifespan compared to other battery types. A more advanced lithium-ion battery design is the [[w:lithium polymer cell|lithium polymer cell]]. 
[[File:Sony Li-ion battery LIP-4WM.jpg|thumb|Sony Li-ion battery LIP-4WM]]

==History==

[[w:Gilbert N. Lewis|Gilbert N. Lewis]] pioneered lithium batteries in 1912; the first non-rechargeable cells were created in early 1970s. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery required nearly 20 years of development before it was safe enough to be used on a mass market level, and  the first commercial version was created by [[w:Sony|Sony]] in [[w:1991|1991]], following research by a team led by [[w:John B. Goodenough|John B. Goodenough]].{{fact}}

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
Lithium ion batteries can be formed into a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so as to efficiently fill available space in the devices they power.

The batteries are also lighter than equivalents in other chemistries — often much lighter. This is because [[w:lithium|lithium]] ions have an extremely high charge density — the highest of all known naturally occurring ions.  [[w:Lithium|Li]] ions are small and mobile, but more readily stored than hydrogen.  Thus a battery based on lithium is smaller than one with hydrogen elements, such as [[w:NiMH|nickel metal hydride]], and with fewer volatile gases. The ions need fewer storage intermediaries, so more battery weight is usable as charge, instead of overhead.{{fact}}

Li-ion batteries do not suffer from the [[w:memory effect|memory effect]]. They also have a low self-discharge rate of approximately 5% per month, compared with over 30% per month and 20% per month in [[w:nickel metal hydride|nickel metal hydride]] batteries and [[w:nickel cadmium|nickel cadmium]] batteries, respectively.{{fact}}

According to one manufacturer, Li-Ion cells (and, accordingly, &quot;dumb&quot; Li-Ion batteries) do not have any self-discharge in the usual meaning of this word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|
title=Gold Peak Industries Ltd., Lithium Ion technical handbook|
url=http://www.gpbatteries.com/pdf/Li-ion_Handbook.pdf|
format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What looks like a self-discharge in these batteries is a permanent loss of capacity, described in more detail below. On the other hand, smart Li-Ion batteries do self-discharge, due to the small constant drain of the built-in voltage monitoring circuit. This drain is the most important source of self-discharge in these batteries.

===Disadvantages===
A unique drawback of the Li-ion battery is that its life span is dependent upon aging from time of manufacturing (shelf life) regardless of whether it was charged, and not just on the number of charge/discharge cycles. This drawback is not widely publicized.{{fact}}

At a 100% charge level, a typical Li-ion [[w:laptop|laptop]] battery that is full most of the time at 25 degrees [[w:Celsius|Celsius]] or 77 degrees [[w:Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit]], will irreversibly lose approximately 20% capacity per year. However a battery stored inside a poorly ventilated laptop, may be subject to a prolonged exposure to much higher temperatures than 25 °C, which will significantly shorten its life. The capacity loss begins from the time the battery was manufactured, and occurs even when the battery is unused. Different storage temperatures produce different loss results: 6% loss at 0 °C/32 °F, 20% at 25 °C/77 °F, and 35% at 40 °C/104 °F. When stored at 40% charge level, these figures are reduced to 2%, 4%, 15% at 0, 25 and 40 degrees Celsius respectively.{{fact}}

This makes Li-Ion batteries unsuitable for back-up applications compared to lead-acid batteries, and even to Ni-MH batteries.

Because the maximum power that can be continuously drawn from the battery depends on its capacity, in high-powered (relative to ''C'', battery capacity in A·h) applications, like portable computers and video cameras, rather than showing a gradual shortening of the running time of the equipment, Li-Ion batteries may often just abruptly fail.{{fact}}

Low-powered cyclical applications, like mobile phones, can get a much longer lifetime out of a Li-Ion battery.{{fact}}

A stand-alone Li-Ion cell must never be discharged below a certain voltage to avoid an irreversible damage. Therefore all systems involving Li-Ion batteries are equipped with a circuit that shuts down the system when the battery is discharged below the predefined threshold&lt;ref&gt;Gold Peak Industries Ltd., Lithium Ion technical handbook&lt;/ref&gt;. It should thus be impossible to &quot;deep discharge&quot; the battery in a properly designed system during normal use. This is also one of the reasons Li-Ion cells are not normally sold as such to consumers, but only as finished batteries designed to fit a particular system.

When the voltage monitoring circuit is built inside the battery (so called &quot;smart battery&quot;) rather than equipment, and continuously draws a small current from the battery even if it is not in use, the battery further must not be stored fully discharged for prolonged periods of time, to avoid damage due to deep discharge.

Li-ion batteries are not as durable as [[w:nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride]] or [[w:nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] designs and can be extremely dangerous if mistreated. They are usually more expensive.

Li-ion chemistry is not safe as such, and a Li-ion cell requires several mandatory safety devices to be built in, before it can be considered safe for use outside of a laboratory. These are: shut down separator (for overtemperature), tear away tab (for internal pressure), vent (pressure relief), thermal interrupt (overcurrent/overcharging)&lt;ref&gt;Gold Peak Industries Ltd., Lithium Ion technical handbook&lt;/ref&gt;. The devices take away useful space inside the cells, and add an additional layer of unreliability. Typically, their action is to permanently and irreversibly disable the cell.

Despite these safety features, Li-ion batteries are subject of frequent recalls (see [[#Safety concerns]]).

The number of safety features can be compared with that of a [[w:nickel metal hydride:]] cell, which only has a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device (preventing damage due to mild overcharging) and a back-up pressure valve.{{fact}}

There is an ongoing research to develop alternative Li-ion chemistries, which would be safe with fewer or no safety devices, such as &lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|
title=&quot;Saphion&quot; technology incorporates a phosphate based cathode material|
url=http://www.valence.com/saphion.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Specifications and design==

* Specific energy density: 150 to 200 [[w:watt-hour|W·h]]/kg (540 to 720 [[w:kilojoule|kJ]]/kg)
* Volumetric energy density: 250 to 530 W·h/L (900 to 1900 J/cm3)
* Specific power density: 300 to 1500 W/kg (@ 20 seconds [http://www.e-one.com.tw/News_2005_e.htm] and 285 W·h/L)

A typical chemical reaction of the Li-ion battery is as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Li}_{\frac12} \mathrm{Co} \mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{Li}_{\frac12}\mathrm{C}_6 \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}_6 + \mathrm{Li}\mathrm{Co}\mathrm{O}_2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; {{fact}}

Lithium-ion batteries have a nominal [[w:open-circuit voltage|open-circuit voltage]] of 3.6 [[w:volt|V]] and a typical charging voltage of 4.2 V. The charging procedure is one of constant voltage with current limiting.  This means charging with constant current until a voltage of 4.2 V is reached by the cell and continuing with a constant voltage applied until the current drops close to zero. (Typically the charge is terminated at 7% of the initial charge current.)  In the past Lithium-ion batteries could not be fast-charged and typically needed at least two hours to fully charge.  Current generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less; some reach 90% in as little as 10 minutes. {{fact}}

Lithium ion internal design is as follows. The [[w:anode|anode]] is made from [[w:carbon|carbon]], the [[w:cathode|cathode]] is a metal [[w:oxide|oxide]], and the [[w:electrolyte|electrolyte]] is a [[w:lithium|lithium]] [[w:salt|salt]] in an [[w:organic compound|organic]] [[w:solvent|solvent]]. Since the lithium metal which might be produced under irregular charging conditions is very reactive and might cause explosion, Li-ion cells usually have built-in protective electronics and/or fuses to prevent polarity reversal, over-voltage and over-heating. {{fact}}

===Solid electrolyte interphase===

A particularly important element for activating Li-ion [[w:batteries|batteries]] is the '''solid electrolyte interphase''' (SEI). [[w:Liquid|Liquid]] [[w:electrolyte|electrolyte]]s in Li-ion [[w:batteries|batteries]] consist of solid [[w:lithium|lithium]]-[[w:salt|salt]] [[w:electrolyte|electrolyte]]s, such as LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, LiBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or LiClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[w:organic compound|organic]] [[w:solvents]], such as [[w:diethyl ether|ether]]. A liquid [[w:electrolyte|electrolyte]] conducts Li ions, which act as a carrier between the [[w:cathode|cathode]] and the [[w:anode|anode]] when a [[w:battery (electricity)|battery]] passes an electric current through an external circuit. However, solid electrolytes and organic solvents are easily decomposed on [[w:anodes|anodes]] during charging, thus preventing battery activation. Nevertheless, when appropriate organic solvents are used for electrolytes, the electrolytes are decomposed and form a solid electrolyte interface at first charge that is electrically insulating and high Li-ion conducting. The interface prevents decomposition of electrolytes after the second charge. For example, ethylene [[w:carbonate|carbonate]] is decomposed at relatively high voltage, 0.7 V vs. Li, and forms a tight and stable interface. This interface is called an SEI. {{fact}}

See [[w:uranium trioxide|uranium trioxide]] for some details of how the cathode works. While uranium oxides are not used in commercially made batteries, the way in which uranium oxides can reversibly insert cations is the same as the way in which the cathode in many lithium ion cells work. {{fact}}

==Guidelines for prolonging Li-ion battery life==
* Unlike [[w:nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad batteries]], lithium-ion batteries should be charged early and often. However, if they are not used for a longer time, they should be brought to a charge level of around 40%.  Lithium-ion batteries should never be &quot;deep-cycled&quot; like NiCd batteries.
* Li-ion batteries should be kept cool. Ideally they are stored in a refrigerator. Aging will take its toll much faster at high temperatures. The high temperatures found in cars cause lithium-ion batteries to degrade rapidly.
* Lithium-ion batteries should never be depleted to empty (0%).
* According to one book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
title=Characteristics and Behavior of 1M LiPF6 1EC:1DMC Electrolyte at Low Temperatures|
author=L.M. Cristo, T. B. Atwater|
publisher=U.S. Army Research|
location=Fort Monmouth, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;, lithium ion batteries should not be frozen.  Note that most lithium-ion battery electrolytes freeze at approximately −40 °C, which is much colder than the lowest temperature reached by most household freezers. 
* Li-ion batteries should be bought only when needed, because the aging process begins as soon as the battery is manufactured. {{fact}}
* When using a notebook computer running from fixed line power over extended periods, the battery can be removed and stored in a cool place so that it is not affected by the heat produced by the computer. {{fact}} (However, a notebook computer's battery prevents sudden loss of the data in memory during power failures and [[w:brownouts|brownouts]]. Reasonable alternatives are the use of an older lithium ion battery or an external [[w:uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supply]].)

===Storage temperature and charge===

Storing a Li-ion battery at the correct temperature and charge makes all the difference in maintaining its storage capacity. The following table shows the amount of ''permanent'' capacity loss that will occur after storage at a given charge level and temperature. &lt;ref name=&quot;bu1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries |title=How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries |accessdate=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is significantly beneficial to avoid storing a lithium-ion battery at full charge. A Li-ion battery stored at 40% charge will last many times longer than one stored at 100% charge, particularly at higher temperatures. &lt;ref name=&quot;bu1&quot;/&gt;

If a Li-ion battery is stored with too low a charge, there is a risk of allowing the charge to drop below the battery's low-voltage threshold, resulting in an unrecoverably dead battery. Once the charge has dropped to this level, recharging it can be dangerous. An internal safety circuit will therefore open to prevent charging, and the battery will be for all practical purposes dead. &lt;ref name=&quot;bu1&quot;/&gt;

In circumstances where a second Li-ion battery is available for a given device, it is recommended that the unused battery be discharged to 40% and placed in the refrigerator to prolong its shelf life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bu1&quot;/&gt;  ''Batteries should be allowed to completely warm to room temperature over up to 24 hours before any discharge or charge''.

==Safety concerns==
Lithium-ion batteries can easily rupture, ignite, or explode when exposed to high temperatures, or direct sunlight.  They should not be stored in a car during hot weather.  Short-circuiting a Li-ion battery can also cause it to ignite or explode.  Never open a Li-ion battery's casing.  Li-ion batteries contain safety devices that, protect the cells inside from abuse. If damaged, these can cause the battery to ignite or explode.

Internal contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. The mid-2006 recall of 4.1 million Sony batteries used in Dell laptops was a consequence of internal contamination with metal particles. Under some circumstances, these can pierce the separator rapidly converting all of the energy in the cell to heat. See example: [http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 Dell laptop &quot;explodes&quot; at Japanese conference]

Kuzhikalail M. Abraham, a lithium battery consultant with [http://www.e-kemsciences.com]E-Kem Sciences, says the computer industry's drive to increase battery capacity can test the limits of sensitive components such as the membrane separator, a polyethylene or polypropylene film that is only 20-25 µm thick. He points out that the energy density of lithium-ion batteries has more than doubled since they were introduced in 1991. &quot;When you pack the battery with more and more material, the separator can undergo stress,&quot; he says.

The mid-2006 Dell laptop battery recall isn't the first of its kind, but it is the largest. During the past decade there have been numerous recalls of lithium-ion batteries in cellular phones and laptops owing to overheating problems. Last December, Dell pulled about 22,000 batteries from the U.S. market. In 2004, Kyocera Wireless recalled about 1 million batteries used in phones.&lt;ref&gt;Tullo, Alex. &quot;Dell Recalls Lithium Batteries.&quot; Chemical and Engineering News 21 Aug 2006: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;It is possible to replace the lithium cobalt oxide cathode material in li-ion batteries with lithiated metal phosphate cathodes that don’t explode and even have a longer shelf life. But for the moment these safer li-ion batteries seem mainly destined for electric cars and other large-capacity applications, where the safety issues are more critical... The fact is that lithiated metal phosphate batteries hold only about 75 percent as much power....&quot; (ref: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/opinion/01cringely.html)

==New technology==

In February 2005, Altair NanoTechnology[http://www.altairnano.com/applications.html ], a small firm based in [[w:Reno, Nevada|Reno]], announced a nano-sized electrode material for lithium-ion batteries. Its prototype battery has three times the power of existing batteries and can be fully charged in six minutes.

In March of 2005, Toshiba announced another fast charging lithium-ion battery, based on new nano-material technology, that provides even faster charge times, greater capacity, and a longer life cycle.  The battery may be used in commercial products in 2006 or early 2007, primarily in the industrial and automotive sectors.[http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2005_03/pr2901.htm]

In November 2005, A123Systems announced[http://www.a123systems.com/html/news/articles/051102_news.html] a new higher power, faster recharging Li-Ion battery system[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/11/a123systems_lau.html#more] [http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/gridable-hybrids/message/2099] based on research licensed from MIT. Their first [http://hybrids-plus.com/pmwiki/index.php?n=Ext.A123Cells cell] is in production (1Q/2006) and being used in [http://www.dewalt.com DeWalt power tools] and [http://hybrids-plus.com/ Hybrids Plus] Prius [[w:PHEV|PHEV]] conversions.

All these formulations involve new electrodes.  By increasing the effective electrode area — thus decreasing the internal resistance of the battery — the current can be increased during both use and charging.  This is similar to developments in [[w:ultracapacitor|ultracapacitor]]s.  Therefore, the battery is capable of delivering more power (Watts); however, the battery's capacity (Amp-hours) is increased only slightly.

In April 2006, a group of scientists at [[w:MIT|MIT]] announced that they had figured out a way to use viruses to form nano-sized wires that can be used to build ultrathin lithium-ion batteries with three times the normal energy density. Science Express (preprint) [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1122716]

As of June 2006, researchers in France have created nanostructured battery electrodes with several times the energy capacity, by weight and volume, of conventional electrodes [http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?ch=nanotech&amp;sc=&amp;id=17017&amp;pg=1].

A safety/monitor circuit draws less than 10uA when the battery is not in use. That's 240uAh a day and 87.6mAh a year. In a 2000mAh cell, that's about 4% '''a year'''. Most significant loss?

And WTF is that edit history doing here?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linking==
A lot of these recipes are transwikied articles, and need to be indexed using &lt;nowiki&gt;=====&lt;/nowiki&gt;, so they can be linked to. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:23, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

How is this done?  I even RTFM, yet do not understand.  [[User:72.174.2.252|72.174.2.252]] 09:10, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

First time wikier here, so I dare not make the changes myself, but... we're missing Melon Ball (not bomb) and its close sister, Broken Down Golf Cart.  The way I make it is - MB: 1 oz vodka, 1 oz Melon liquer (McGuinness is favored over Midori), shaken and poured over ice in a rock glass.  BDGC: MB + 1 oz Amaretto.


==More linking and TOC==
Hi. Yes, I know the Table of Contents looks terrible right now due to an edit I made. I was attempting to do what SBJohnny suggested with the &lt;nowiki&gt;=====&lt;/nowiki&gt; so I can start cleaning up some of this stuff. Obviously that glitched up the TOC. I'd like to request that you help me fix the overall problem (creating links to specific drinks) rather than reverting my change because it looks terrible.

What I'm trying to do (and I added a notice to the Administrator's board requesting help) is to get the {{tl|TOCright}} template to limit the number of subheadings it includes. That would solve the problem perfectly (I think). If anyone has any other ideas, I'd love to hear them. Thanks! --[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;#C71585&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;'''Willscrlt'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;font color=&quot;#4169E1&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Willscrlt|'''T'''alk]]&amp;middot;[[Special:Contributions/Willscrlt|'''C'''ntrb]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; 08:40, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

== Bullshot? not quite ==

The entry for a ''Bullshot'' is rather modern. The traditional bullshot was made using either vodka or gin as the spirit and (spiced) beef stock (real not cube), (spiced) oxtail soup, (spiced) beef consomme (don't know if that's tautologous) or (Spiced) congealed beef consomme, and no red bull whatsoever mixed with ice served with or without ice. The definitive bullshot recipe is presented as part of a (UK) television documentary on the life of Noel Coward, the one I'm thinking of features Nigella Lawson (before she slimmed down) as part of a group discussion, can't find the tape. I've heard of a variant that uses Beef Tea but... well, it's far from genuine or current. Truly woeful sentence structure, I know.

== Proposal: Make this a terms glossary, not listing of recipes ==

This is, frankly, an insane undertaking and seems superfluous, given the individual cocktail pages. An index of recipes and a glossary of terminology would be more reasonable [[User:Aaron Pannell|AP]] ([[User talk:Aaron Pannell|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aaron Pannell|contribs]]) 17:55, 30 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
'''Fermentation''' is the process of controlling bacteria, yeast, and moulds to modify food, producing a desired product.

Fermentation can improve food so that it:
*tastes different, bringing new, often ''strong'' flavours to the source foods
*is easier to digest
*is more nutritious
*lasts longer

__FORCETOC__

== How to Ferment a Food ==

As with any food preparation, there are certain aspects of the fermentation process that can change the quality and acceptability of the end product. Here are some of the important ones that are generally applicable; check individual recipes for special tips and variations.

=== Ingredient selection ===
Selecting good quality ingredients is important when fermenting food. It doesn't generally matter if the ingredients aren't picture perfect &amp;ndash; cider vinegar won't look or taste any different for using ugly apples &amp;ndash; but avoid using old, rotting, or very dirty food. Remember that a fermentation is where yeast and bacteria are given a chance to multiply, so give your ferment a fighting chance and stick to good quality ingredients.

=== Salt ===

Many ferments use [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]. Salt helps by inhibiting undesirable bacteria and moulds, and by drawing juices out of foods. It is best to use a salt that has no free-flow agents or iodine added to it, as these can inhibit the fermentation a little. [[w:Iodine|Iodine]] is an effective antibacterial agent, and even in the very small amounts used in iodised salt, it can affect the bacteria that ferment the food. Salt suitable for fermenting is often called &quot;pickling salt&quot; or &quot;Kosher salt&quot;.

Iodine is an effective antibacterial agent,  but that is not what we are talking about here, in iodized table salt. The chemical additive is Sodium Iodide ie. Iodine in chemical combination with Sodium. Sodium Iodide is not antibacterial.  The same thing applies to deadly Chlorine gas, but in combination with Sodium it equals Sodium Chloride, table salt.

=== Water ===

When adding [[Cookbook:Water|water]] to a fermentation, avoid [[w:Chlorination|chlorinated water]] if possible. Chlorine is added to municipal water supplies to prevent the build-up of bacteria and other water-borne microorganisms, and as such can inhibit a fermentation. 

Tap water can be made chlorine-free in most areas simply by boiling it and letting it cool again, or even just by leaving it in an uncovered pot overnight. This doesn't work in areas where the water is chlorinated by adding [[w:Chloramine|chloramine]] to the water, a practice done specifically to keep the chlorine in the water. Many modern water filters will remove both chlorine and chloramine, however.

=== Temperature ===
[[Image:Yoghurtmaker.jpg|right|thumb|Yoghurt making kit]]
All fermentations are temperature sensitive. Some prefer it cooler, some hotter. Many are best served by warmer temperature at the start of fermentation, and cooler temperatures once fermenting has peaked. Temperature affects which microorganisms grow fastest, and can affect the flavour of the food, or even whether it will succeed or fail.

Here are some common ferments, and typical fermenting temperatures.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
! Fermented food !! Start temperature !! Post-peak temperature

| style=&quot;text-align: left&quot; | Lager

|
|}

As can be seen, it is useful to be able to control the temperature of a fermentation. Some common ways to control the temperature are:

* sit the fermenting food in a picnic cooler or esky
* sit the container of fermenting food in a basin or tub of water at the desired temperature (because water has greater thermal mass than air, and changes temperature more slowly)
* put the fermenting food into an electric oven, and use the oven light to keep it warm (because oven lights are usually incandescent bulbs, which produce more heat than light)
* make a specialised incubator for fermenting &amp;ndash; e.g an old picnic cooler with a heat source and a thermostat, or a refrigerator with a variable thermostat and heat source
* buy a specialised incubator for fermenting &amp;ndash; e.g. a yoghurt maker, or an oven with a 45°C yoghurt mode (as sold in Turkey!)

This '''[[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] salsa''' recipe produces a tangy tomato sauce with strong flavour. No cooking is required.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Salsa ferment ingredients.jpg|right|thumb|The ingredients. We'd run out of fresh chilis that day, so we used chili powder instead.]]
* 1 kg (2 lb) fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|capsicum]] (bell pepper)
* 3-6 fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]]
* 1 fresh [[Cookbook:Onion|red onion]]
* 3-4 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* 1 bunch of fresh [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaf, Chinese parsley)
* 1-2 teaspoons non-iodised [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]] to taste (optional)

==Procedure==
[[Image:Salsa ferment.jpg|right|thumb|Salsa packed lightly into a jar.]]
# Clean and dry a large (1 litre) preserves jar and a large bowl
# [[Cookbook:Dice|Dice]] the tomatoes
# Quarter and [[Cookbook:Slicing|slice]] the capsicum
# Finely slice the chilis, removing the seeds if you prefer. Make sure to wash your hands right after cutting the chilis, and DO NOT touch your eyes or face for some time after handling the chilis! (If you do, the chili juice residue could cause a very painful burning sensation.)
# Peel and chop the onion and garlic finely
# Roughly chop the cilantro
# Mix all ingredients together in the bowl with salt and (optional) spices; mix well!
# Pack tightly into the jar, leaving 1cm space at the top; don't seal the jar yet

==Fermentation==

With the above fresh ingredients, there should be enough microbial load for the salsa to start fermenting by itself. Bubbles will begin rising to the top of the jar, showing that fermentation is under way - you should be able to see this through the side of the jar. Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar. Just cover with a cloth, or cling-wrap. Sit the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess.

If you are concerned that fermentation will not start by itself, you can add a starter culture. A good starter culture is a little juice from a recently fermented [[Cookbook:sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] or [[Cookbook:kimchi|kimchi]], as this will bring across the necessary lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.

The salsa will be fermented in two to three days. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to the refrigerator. It will last well in the fridge, but will continue to slowly ferment, getting more sour as time passes. Best within a few days, unless you like it quite sour!

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The salt used should be non-iodised salt if possible - e.g. pickling salt, kosher salt. This is because the iodine in iodised table salt will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.
*Use fresh ingredients where possible; if you do use canned or dried ingredients, you may need to use a starter (see Fermentation, above).
*This recipe prefers to ferment at a temperature between 18°C-22°C (64°F-72°F). It will happily ferment outside that range, however if you want to keep it in that range, there are some tips available on the [[Cookbook:Fermentation#Temperature|fermentation page]].
*There is a suggestion on the [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]] that more salt is required; read the discussion and decide for yourself, but traditional French recipes add no salt during the fermentation of crushed tomatoes. Salt volume recommendations made without specifying brand (and therefore grain size and shape) are not precise in any case.

==Warnings==
*When handling hot chilis, use gloves or take extra care to keep your hands away from eyes and other sensitive areas ''even after washing them''.

==Post Production==

After 20-60 days of filming, you are finished shooting your motion picture. After all that effort, the only thing you have to show for your work is about 100 reels of film, 60 rolls of audio tape, and a well-worn copy of the script which has been marked up by the script supervisor.  That's it!  Other than publicity stills and maybe a documentary and perhaps some effects shots being done at effects houses around town, this is all you get for your 40 million dollars.  So now, what do you do?

Now you start '''Post Production'''.  Now you turn the developed film and audio reels into a motion picture for viewing at a film festival.  (Much later, you worry about getting the movie ready for distribution.)

Once the dailies are prepared for editing, the film editor begins to edit the picture and the dialog.  The sound department will get busy creating an infinite number of sound effects and the film composer will create beautiful music for your movie.  If any visual effects are needed, they will get done too at special effects houses... along with the titles and credits.

Finally, when everyone is happy, the negative will be cut to match the edit of the movie and a print will be made for showing at Sundance.

Let's look at these steps individually.

==Dailies/Workprint/Telecine/Capture/Syncing Audio==

Each day during production of a feature film shot on motion picture film, dailies are prepared for viewing by the director, the crew and the studio executives. To save money, the same dailies can be used by the editor to edit the movie... or at least they can be created at the same time.

Preparing the dailies for editing seems like a trivial task but can be a major headache if not done very carefully. This is just as true for digital video as for film.   Some people think that just because they use a digital camcorder, they do not have to process the film dailies.  Dailies still have to be captured into the computer so they can be edited.  And if you are using a separate sound system for recording the dialog, you will still have all the problems of syncing '''audio to picture''' for your digital dailies.

For more information on preparing film dailies for editing and the telecine process, see the section on [[../Post-production/Telecine|Telecine]] in the Movie Making Manual.

==Logging==

If you film and edit only one scene (or a short), you can easily keep track in your head of all the raw footage.  But for a feature film, keeping track of all the different shots is not easy.  [http://www.filemaker.com/solutions/customers/stories/20004.html Walter Murch] uses Apple's FileMaker Pro.  At Macworld Expo, there is usually at least one lecture on how he uses this database during the editing process.

==Picture and Dialog Editing==

When the movie is edited, the editor must think about more than just the picture and the dialog.  The sound effects and the music work together with the pictures and the dialog to tell the story.  The sound effects, music, picture and dialog all interact.  The editor must figure out how all these elements work together to tell the story.

In Hollywood, there are special teams that do the visual effects, music, and sound effects.  But if you are just one person doing the edit of low-budget motion picture, you might have to do everything yourself as you edit the movie.

;Narrative Films Only
:This manual covers dramatic movies with scripted dialog.  Be aware that editing a documentary, corporate video, multimedia or event video is totally different from editing narrative dramas.  For more information about the process of film editing for narrative motion pictures and televison drama see the section [[../Post-production/Editing|What is Editing]] in the Movie Making Manual.

For narrative feature films, there are two different kinds of scenes - Action sequences and Conversation.  When you edit a conversation, there are lots of constraints... special the script which dictates the spoken dialog.  Action sequences have few constraints.

There are two kinds of music - '''Background''' music and '''Narrative''' music.  Background music means very soft music while narrative music is music that gets in your face.  At this stage, a temp track is acceptable for background music but for music which tells part of the story, you really need to use something which will be close to the final music.

While there are many kinds of sound effects, at this stage you are only worried about the sound effects that help tell a story, not the sound effects which make the scenery seem realistic such as Ambience, Walla and Foley.  These can be done when the editing is finished.  For now, just worry about the sound effects that help narrate the story.

For more instructions on how to edit a dramatic scene with scripted dialog, see the section [[Movie Making Manual/Scene Editing|How To Edit a Dramatic Scene]] in the Movie Making Manual.

==ADR (Automated Dialog Replacement)==

Once you have edited the movie, you might need to replace some of the spoken dialog. For more information on ADR, see the [[Movie Making Manual/ADR|ADR in the Movie Making Manual]].

==Sound Effects==

Once all the scenes are edited, you begin to add all the little sounds which makes the movie seem real.  If a scene does not seem realistic, you have not added enough sound effects such as:

===Ambience===

The background sounds of the environment.

===Walla===

This is the indistinguishable sounds of people talking in the background.

===Foley===

The footsteps and the rustling of clothing make your scene seem real,  which are so numerous that it is faster to record these sound effects live while watching the movie.  If you have only a few footsteps, you can do this from sound effects libraries in your editing program.  But in general, when you need hundreds of tiny sound effects, it is easier to do them with Foley

For more information on Sound for motion pictures, see [[Movie Making Manual/Sound Design|Sound Design]] in the Movie Making Manual.  For more information on Foley, see the section [[Movie Making Manual/Foley|Foley]] in the Movie Making Manual.  (Note:  &quot;Foley&quot; stands for '''Jack Foley''' who pioneered this kind of sound effects creating.)

==Visual Effects==

When doing the basic edit, blank frames or storyboard frames are used in place of visual elements.  Once the effects shots are finished, they must be inserted into the edit.

===Titles and Credits===

Titles can be done any way that you wish.  Determining which people to include in the credits can be complicated.  This is a good place to make a lot of people angry.  Therefore, you must be very careful to list all the people who deserve credit for making the movie.  Sometimes, the unions decide this.  Sometimes your contracts with the cast and crew decide this.  Doing the credits is not as easy as it looks.

==Film Scoring==

Music creates the mood.  Once the edit is complete (with a temp score), the temp score must be replaced by the final score.  For more information on film scoring, see the section [[Movie Making Manual/Music|Music/Film Scoring]]  in the Movie Making Manual.

==Breakdown into reels==

A motion picture must be in manageable pieces for distribution and projection.  In the break between reels, there must be no sound or picture.

==Conform the Negative==

Most of the time, it is not possible to edit at the highest possible resolution.  In these cases, up until now, editing is off-line.  If there is no digital intermediary, you need to conform the negative.

==Prepare for Distribution==

This should be in the marketing section because it is done '''after''' you have a distributor but '''before''' the distributor accepts delivery of the motion picture and all its elements. Therefore, only after you have sold the movie, do you learn what film formats are required.  This is a hidden expense can be rather nasty.  If you have not planned ahead, this can cost you a fortune. Read Robert Rodriguez' '''Rebel without a Crew''' which is about the making of &quot;El Mariachi&quot; This book should be required reading in all film schools.

==Animated Feature Films==

Note that if you are making an animated feature-length motion picture, the procedures above are done in a slightly different order.</text>

To scald milk bring it nearly to a boil (185°F, 85°C, or more), preferably in a thick-bottomed pan, and stirring actively, to keep a protein skin from forming on the surface and keep the proteins and sugar from sticking to the bottom. Scalding served two purposes, to kill potentially harmful bacteria in the milk, and to destroy enzymes that keep the milk from thickening in recipes. Pasteurization, however, accomplishes both of those goals, and since almost all store-bought milk in Western countries is pasteurized these days, scalding is essentially an unnecessary step.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The bulk of a web page consists of paragraphs, structured with the use of headings. The two kinds of elements are described in the following.

== Paragraphs ==
The {{HTML:element|p}} element is used to split text into paragraphs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An introductory paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another introductory paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Headings ==
There are six levels of headings. The most important heading(s) in a document should be level one. Sub-headings should be level two. Sub-sub-headings should be level three, etc. Do not skip levels. If the default sizes do not suit your document, use CSS to change them. Headings should be used to effectively outline your content.  By doing so, users can find information more quickly (i.e. wikipedia), and some search engines use headings to help rank page content.

&lt;!--
The examples have been rewritten using div tags to avoid the problems mentioned below. The styles are taken from Appendix D of the CSS2 specification.

Please note, as [[w:Mediawiki|Mediawiki]] has it's own [[w:Cascading_Style_Sheets|CSS]] used to display this page, the examples below may include things which one would not normally see, such as a line underneath the header.  These can be added with a custom CSS file, but that will not be covered on this page.
--&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;This is Level 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight:bolder; font-size:2em; margin:.67em 0&quot;&gt;This is Level 1&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;This is Level 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight:bolder; font-size:1.17em; margin:.83em 0&quot;&gt;This is Level 3&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;This is Level 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight:bolder; font-size:.83em; margin:1.5em 0&quot;&gt;This is Level 5&lt;/div&gt;

==Example==
This example will be used in the next section where we see how to change the appearance of a document.

    &lt;title&gt;Sundial&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Sundial&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sundial measures time by the position of the sun. The most commonly seen designs, such as the
       'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of
       the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However,
       sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard
       and daylight saving time, as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are known from ancient
       Egypt, and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman
       cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament
       (Isaiah 38:2).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have
       invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth. The French astronomer Oronce
       Finé constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published
       a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and 
       laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio 
       instrumenti ad horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying 
       illustrations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Installation of standard sundials&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By tilting such a 
       sundial, it may be installed so that it will keep time. However, some mass-produced garden 
       sundials are inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected. A sundial designed for 
       one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base so that its style 
       or gnomon is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation, so that it points at the north celestial
       pole in the northern hemisphere, or the south celestial pole in the southern hemisphere.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow 
       geographic and political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style or gnomon (which
       must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a 
       rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. 
       An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for 
       winter. Rotating the sundial will not work well because most sundials do not have equal hour 
       angles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ordinary sundials do not correct apparent solar time to clock time. There is a 15 minute 
       variation through the year, known as the equation of time, because the Earth's orbit is 
       slightly elliptical and its axis is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit. A quality 
       sundial will include a permanently-mounted table or graph giving this correction for at least 
       each month of the year. Some more-complex sundials have curved hour-lines, curved gnomons or 
       other arrangements to directly display the clock time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a factory recovery option available for the Jeep Liberty that includes three Mopar tow hooks; two front and one rear.  A cheaper and more versatile option is a front or rear [[../Accessories/Towing_Hitches|hitch receiver]] accompanied by a hitch clevis or winch.  Yet another option is to replace the front tow hooks with a bumper or bullbar with integrated recovery provisions.  All of these alternatives require removal of an existing hooks.

== Mopar Hooks ==

[[Image:Jeep_Liberty_Tow_Hook_Front_2005.jpg|thumb|right|OEM Front Tow Hook MY2005]]
[[Image:Jeep_Liberty_Tow_Hook_Rear_2005.jpg|thumb|right|OEM Rear Tow Hook MY2005]]

Each front tow hook sandwiches the unibody bumper between the hook base and an m-bolt/clip-nut combination.  The clip-nut on both the front and rear hooks is a common automotive fastener which may be available at well stocked hardware stores.  The m-bolt used with the front tow hooks is not a common fastener and will need to be purchased from a dealer.

== Electric Winches ==

The ARB bullbar for the Liberty KJ is designed accommodate the Warn M8000 winch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages|french=yes}} 

== Pauvre ==

Pauvre is not marked with '+' as changing its meaning depending on whether it stands before or after the noun, but right under that is said that it can mean unlucky or poor - shouldn't it be marked in the list, then?

== Errors ==


-ancien changes in meaning pre/post as do others, no explanation of rule

-words of time like premier/dernier come before or after based on rules, no explanation.

why is this page marked complete?

the box of irregular plural adjectives seems to turn into a box of irregular nouns, bijou and chou are not adjectives! also, journal does not end in -au. [[User:Stanlavisbad|Stanlavisbad]] ([[User talk:Stanlavisbad|talk]]) 13:49, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

:I have removed the irregular nouns and reduced the completion to 75% in the two templates. 

:I am not sure whether there are any adjectives ending in -au or -eu that form plurals ending in -aux and -eux, but I have left those table rows in for the moment. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:52, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

== de versus des for plurals ==

Why under &quot;Beau, nouveau, and vieux&quot; have you made the masculine and feminine plural articles &quot;de&quot; instead of &quot;des&quot;? Of course, there are contexts in which &quot;de&quot; would be part of the appropriate construction, but these do not supply that context and in fact, supply the opposite (as in, handsome boy turns into handsome boys - there is no indication that an unusual use of &quot;de&quot; would be warranted in this context). The article is quite sparse in terms of explaining what it is doing in each section and it is very difficult to understand the sub-organization. Moreover, this issue with the basics of indefinite articles seems like a significant oversight.[[User:Lucyep|Lucyep]] ([[User talk:Lucyep|talk]]) 22:30, 24 September 2010 (UTC)
:I didn't write this part myself, but the usage is supported by a number of grammar references. e.g. 
:*According to [http://french.about.com/library/prepositions/bl-devsdes.htm about.com], &quot;when the  plural indefinite or partitive article is used with an adjective that precedes a noun, '''des''' changes to '''de'''.&quot; 
:*According to Glanville Price's 2008 &quot;A Comprehensive French Grammar&quot; p35 (Blackwell, ISBN 978-1-4051-5384-3) &quot;The plural partitive (or indefinite) article '''des''' is replaced by '''de''' when an adjective precedes the noun&quot;.

Hi! Thanks for cleaning up some of the namespaces on the WebDesign book, and for your additions to the CSS and Javascript challenges. Great point about the additional step for the Javascrpit challenge to make sure that the email field is displayed if JS is disabled!

A few questions:
* I'm guessing you're aware that the book has been copied over to Wikiversity - because it it mostly activities like the challenges. Would you be keen to take part editing it there? I'm not sure how it's going to work with copies in both places... whether things like the challenges that are all activities should be removed from Wikibooks, or just link to the copy at Wikiversity? What do you think? - (OK, forget this point, I just saw that you updated the wikiversity pages too :) )
* You're right about the poetry - it shouldn't technically be in a list, but the point of the activity is to learn to style basice HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs and lists. I'm wondering whether a better solution would be to change the content so that a list is more applicable? In their current state, the image for Challenge 1 (with its bullet points) isn't really possible from the HTML... it would be good to resolve it! Again, interested to know your thoughts...

Why are you writing in Hindi script in the Urdu book?

== Afrikaans-wikti ==

Dear Sultanzahir, not speaking Urdu but nevertheless trying to add Urdu words to the Afrikaans wiktionary, I have some questions:&lt;br&gt;
What is the plural of [[ماں]]? Is it [[مانیں]] or [[مائیں]] (http://af.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A7%DA%BA) ?&lt;br&gt;
Where does one stress the plural of &quot;مادر&quot;: is &quot;مادریں&quot; stressed on the last syllable &quot;e&quot; [mɑːdəˈɾẽː] or on the first syllable [ˈmɑːdəɾẽː]? Where is &quot;مادروں&quot; stressed, and &quot;مادرو&quot;  (http://af.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1)?&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Are you sure you want to contribute? ==
Read [[Help:Contributing|Help:Why contribute?]] first.

== Does the book or a similar one already exist? ==
* It is easier to build on existing books than to start a new one.
* Check on the [[Subject:Books by subject|bookshelves]] if similar books exist, or if your content could be part of an existing wikibook.

== Are you willing to support the new book? ==
There exist many books that have a great introduction paragraph, but not more. Are you willing to write a substantial part of the book by yourself?

== Be bold, Start the book ==
If your answers are: YES, YES, NO, YES, then start the book!

Point of Sale Systems reside in a space in which everything goes wrong, at the most inopportune moment. Murphy is quite at home here. This strange reality has led to the fact that instead of attracting the nerdy software types, this industry tends to bring in the battle hardened types. This has led to the creation of sturdy and rugged applications that appear to be created for the specific task of surviving an unforgiving environment. 
The fact that all the data that is being handled is generally highly classified, goes a long way to reinforce the notion that users will generally accept less sophisticated applications in favour of what they see as tried and tested. Ugly as sin, but pays the rent type applications.

We often find that our public has come to accept far less that than they deserve, simply because they are afraid of what may happen if they change, or that the information that lies in the hands of their IT guys is so sensitive that one needs to lock him into a room, and never let him out. (figuratively in the form of some contract I mean). This always, and I mean always leads to a very predictable outcome. 

1.) The software tends to run ok, with lots of bugs, that everyone in the organisation has learned to live with. 
They roll up their eyes and say, &quot;Software problems, whats new?&quot;.
2.) The software begins to get frayed, around the edges, and it is clear that the client is paying too much, for too little. At least he thinks so.

=== Technically start the Book ===

Read the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] first on how to arrange and name your book. Then [[Help:How to contribute|make]] the contents/[[Wikibooks:Title pages|cover page]]. Name the title what you would like the book to be called, choose a short and descriptive title, but not abbreviations. Create the page the way you want it, and save it.

=== Show the book to the public ===
Next, you have to make the book available to other users. Of course, people can see it on [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]], but its visibility on that list is not permanent, so you need to put it in a bookshelf. Go to the [[All bookshelves|bookshelves]], and put your book into a bookshelf you choose. If you are not sure, choose the [[Template:Miscellaneous bookshelf|Miscellaneous bookshelf]], and another editor will put it elsewhere if necessary.

Once you have gone to the page of the bookshelf you want to add your book to, add your book in the correct category (if applicable) in alphabetical order. Save that page and go back to the [[Main Page]]. To get your book by typing it in the search box or URL. Create all of the pages within that textbook as &quot;Textbooktitle/Whateverthepageis&quot; to avoid problems with other textbooks. See [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] for more.

You might also want to add the book to the list of [[Template:New|new Wikibooks]] that appears on the main page. To get there, click on this link, or click &quot;(edit template)&quot; on the main page. Make a link to your page at the front, and follow the rest of the directions you see at the bottom of the source. Save that page.

Note: If you are a new user, you cannot place your book on the bookshelf by yourself.  Once you add your book to the list [[Template:New|new Wikibooks]], then someone will put it there for you. This is a protection Wikibooks needs to counter vandalism.

== Adding Wikibook suggestions ==
If, on the other hand, you think you have an idea for a new Wikibook but you are not completely sure on how far you want to go with it, you can add a suggested Wikibook on most of the [[Subject:Books by subject|bookshelves]] instead.  Most bookshelves have a list of suggested Wikibooks, and feel free to add suggestions.  If you are feeling inspired to write some material, you might even want to see what others have suggested and create one of those suggested wikibooks instead.

Another very appropriate place to try and see if other people would be willing to help out on a new Wikibooks is the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Staff Lounge]].  Many regular contributors to Wikibooks read this page periodically, so you can get some suggestions for how your book idea can be put together, or perhaps find some other people who might be interested in helping you out in putting the book together.  This is also a very good place to suggest new titles for Wikibooks that perhaps you might not have the time to complete yourself.

== Take a look at other books ==
You can learn how to create a good book and find new ideas by analysing existing ones. Wikibooks don't have strict policies determining shape of a book so don't be confused if you find books that are designed completely different. Generally, it's a good idea to look up some [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured books]] like [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]].

== Additional elements ==

=== Creating printable books ===

If you want people to read your book as continuous text, in a PDF file etc., it is worthwhile maintaining a &quot;print version&quot; from the start. See [[Help:Print versions]].

=== Foreword ===
You can create &quot;Foreword&quot; or &quot;Introduction&quot; chapter explaining what is the scope of the book and how to read it.

=== List of authors and manual of style===
It's likely that other people may edit your book. There should be a page listing most important contributors to the book. It can be named &quot;Authors&quot;. It's a good practise to create a manual of style for the book, explaining how the book should be written, which [[Wikibooks:Templates|templates]] are used etc.

=== Stage of development ===
You can mark which chapters are finished using [[Help:Development stages|development stages marks]]. You can also show how much of your book is ready in bookshelves where you book is placed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FOSS Licensing}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Under the current [[w:Copyright|copyright]] regime, [[w:Software|software]] users are subject to restrictive regulations. This regime is said to provide individuals with incentives in terms of economic returns and thus encourages them to develop creative works. However, some software developers disagree with this default configuration of copyright law and value other things more than short-term economic incentives. 

The [[w:Free and Open Source Software|Free/Open Source Software]] (FOSS) Movement was started by grassroots developers who are not content with the current copyright system. They tactically use specifically designed FOSS licenses to allow a community with a different world-view to develop and flourish. Lawyers are sometimes brought in to facilitate the collaboration between developers. 

However, [[w:software development|software development]] and [[w:software licensing|software licensing]] are very different activities, and developers and lawyers often have very different mindsets. While developers tend to use whatever resources are available to them to achieve a particular feature, lawyers may request a copy of the license of every existing module that developers wish to adopt, before they actually approve the integration into the project. And while developers tend to use acronyms to make their communication more succinct, lawyers tend to use arcane terms and complicated sentences to make sure their ideas can be clearly delivered. Therefore, in order to successfully develop FOSS applications, both these professions are required to cooperate with each other. 

As the [[w:Free software movement|FOSS Movement]] has been growing rapidly in recent years, more and more different kinds of stakeholders are brought in to participate in different roles. Some of them are end-users, developers, business entities, or government agencies that provide funding for FOSS projects. This primer is designed to provide these stakeholders with some basic knowledge about copyright, software copyright and FOSS licenses. Legal issues may vary in different situations and this primer may not be able to provide answers to all situations. But, hopefully, it will serve as a bridge between lawyers and non-lawyers in this joint venture of FOSS development.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FOSS Licensing}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
A general introduction to [[w:Free and open source software|free/open source software]] (FOSS) is provided in the first of this series of primers. That first primer is available at the [[FOSS Licensing/About IOSN|International Open Source Network]] (IOSN) website at: 

http://www.iosn.net/foss/foss-general-primer/foss_primer_current.pdf 

Under the prevailing copyright regime, licenses decide whether software can be free and/or open. As [[w:David A. Wheeler|David A. Wheeler]] said, FOSS are programs whose licenses give users the freedom to run them for any purpose, to study and modify them, and to redistribute copies of either the original or modified programs without having to pay royalties to original developers. {{ref|1}}

Starting from the mid-[[w:1980s|1980s]], the birth of the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL or LGPL) has enabled a model for software development. {{ref|2}} Following GNU GPL, various [[w:Free software license|FOSS licenses]] have been drafted and adopted by FOSS communities, academic institutes and commercial companies. The number of FOSS licenses is growing rapidly. In early [[w:2003|2003]], 43 licenses were recognized by the [[w:Open Source Initiative|Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) as open source licenses. A year-and-a-half later, in [[w:2004#July|July 2004]], the number had reached 54. The diversity among FOSS licenses sometimes causes confusion and difficulty for people who want to participate in FOSS projects or adopt FOSS solutions. Some have argued that to reduce the transaction cost, new licenses should not be created. However, the number of FOSS licenses has been growing.{{ref|3}}

This primer aims to provide an introduction to [[w:Free software license|FOSS licensing]] issues. It begins with a brief overview of “[[w:intellectual property|intellectual property]]” rights,{{ref|4}} and then moves on to the development of [[w:copyright|copyright]] law, the category of “intellectual property” that is most relevant here. The primer will then examine different proprietary and FOSS licenses which use copyright law to regulate the use of software. Finally, it briefly explains how the FOSS movement uses licenses as a way to create a different model of [[w:software development|software development]]. 

There are many [[w:Free software licenses|FOSS licenses]], and they may differ from each other in major ways. Due to page limitations, however, only three pervasively adopted licenses are discussed in this primer: the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]], the [[w:GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL) and the [[w:BSD licenses|Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) style licenses. These three are important not only because a large number of FOSS projects are under licenses, but also because they represent very different styles of FOSS licensing. 

In the [[FOSS Licensing/Scenarios|last section]] of the primer, some scenarios are given to highlight possible [[w:copyright|copyright]] issues regarding the use of FOSS by end-users, developers and vendors. Given the increased attention paid by governments to FOSS development, the primer also includes two cases regarding government-sponsored FOSS projects.

* {{note|4}} The term “[[w:Intellectual Property|Intellectual Property]]” covers different areas of law such as [[w:Copyright|Copyright]], [[w:Patent|Patent]], and [[w:Trademark|Trademark]]. Some people, especially [[w:free software|free software]] advocates, advise against using the term because they believe that these different areas of law cannot be generalized. Another reason to object to its usage is that the term implies that these disparate legal issues are taken as based on an analogy of the property rights to tangible objects, whereas software is intangible. See, for example, “Some Confusing or Loaded Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding.” Available from http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html ; accessed on 13 October 2006. It is true that the term “intellectual property” is relatively new and is loaded with the above meaning. Nevertheless, since the existing legal structure does take intangible objects as tangible objects, the term is still used in this primer but is within quotation marks to draw attention to these critical opinions.</text>

Intangible products of human creative activities are regarded as a kind of property and are granted protection in the same way as property rights have been traditionally protected and applied to tangible objects. 

[[w:Copyright|Copyright]], [[w:patent|patent]], [[w:trademark|trademark]] and [[w:trade secret|trade secret]] all fall under the category of “[[w:intellectual property|intellectual property]]”. But each must be understood to be significantly distinct from the others. 

== Trade Secret== 

A [[w:trade secret|trade secret]] is a confidential practice, method, process, design, the “know-how” or other information used by a business to compete with other businesses. The precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction. However, there are three factors that (though subject to different interpretations) are common to all such definitions: a trade secret is some sort of information that is not generally known to the relevant portion of the public; confers some sort of economic benefit on its holder; is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Trade secrets are regulated by using a variety of civil and commercial means, such as confidentiality or [[w:non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure agreements]] signed by those who are given access to special knowledge and information.

== Trademark ==
[[w:Trademark|Trademarks]] are brand names. distinctive names, phrases, symbols, designs, pictures or styles used by a business to identify itself and its products or services to its consumers. In many countries, colors, three-dimensional marks, sounds, and even smells can also be trademarked.

A trademark or service mark includes any word, name, symbol, device, or any combination, used or intended to be used to identify and distinguish the goods/services of one seller or provider from those of others, and to indicate the source of the goods/services.  Although federal registration of a mark is not mandatory, it has several advantages, including notice to the public of the registrant's claim of ownership of the mark, legal presumption of ownership nationwide, and exclusive right to use the mark on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the registration. Trademarks are usually given for periods between 7 and 20 years with unlimited renewability.
 
'''Purpose of a trademark'''
The specific purpose of a trademark is to prevent others from using the same words, designs, graphics or symbols to identify a good or service. The significance of this is that, the trademark does not prevent the good or service itself. As long as a group uses different words, symbols or designs to identify  the same good, the trademark is not violated. 

'''Interpretations of a Trademark'''
Other than the simple protection against copying, trademarks can be interpreted in many different ways.  The first interpretation associates trademarks with the quality of the good or service. According to the economists Landes and Posner, trademarks are a sign to consumers that the good or service possesses quality. A good or service with a trademark indicates that that good or service is worthy of placing a unique name on it. This unique name means that someone wants to be able to distinguish this good or service. Thus rationally, only goods that possess quality would be worthy of such a distinction. 

Another interpretation of a trademark  is that it is a signal of innovation. While patents are made to protect and invention or idea when it is created, the inventor is likely going to want to spread the word about his invention or idea. By trademarking that invention, it is a formal declaration that this idea exists. It can also be used to express innovation should an idea not be novel enough to pass through patent regulations. Many ideas are unique yet due to being somewhat related to something already in existence, are unable to be patented. Trademarking allows for that idea to be represented as brand new.

A third interpretation of a trademark is the ability to build a brand from it. To promote an idea or invention, one needs a unique way of identifying it. Once the idea or invention is trademarked, it can acquire significance through its mark.

Trademarks can be acquired through the United States Trademark and Patent Office by filling out an application. The process involves searching through the list of active trademarks to ensure that a similar mark does not already exist.

== Patent ==

While [[#Trade Secrets|trade secrets]] enable a business to keep certain information from the public, [[w:Patents|patents]] are designed to grant the inventor [[w:monopoly|monopoly]] rights or monopoly status over certain newly developed knowledge for a period of time (usually 20 years) in exchange for its disclosure. Typically, to gain such rights, the inventor is required to file a patent application, which will be reviewed by a designated patent examiner. Novelty of the invention is an essential criterion in granting a patent.

== Copyright ==

[[w:Copyright|Copyright]] is applied to various kinds of creative works, such as [[w:literature|literary]] works, music compositions, paintings and software. Unlike [[#Patent|patents]], copyright applies to a work upon its creation, regardless of its novelty. 

However, the ideas employed by the work cannot be copyrighted. [[w:Copyright|Copyright]] only prevents others from copying the copyright holder’s particular way of expressing those ideas. Under Copyright Law, the copyright holder is entitled to exclusive rights of reproduction, modification, distribution, and public display and performance of her copyrighted work. A license is often used to explain under which terms and conditions the work can be used. To accommodate different situations, the copyright holder is entitled to draft and adopt different kinds of licenses for each piece of her work. 

== How is software regulated? ==

[[w:Computer Software|Software]] is now subject to Copyright Law. Moreover, in recent years it has been argued that software should be patentable as well. Although [[w:software patents|software patents]] have been granted in some cases, they are still questioned by many, especially by the FOSS community. Due to page limits and the complexity of the issue, this primer does not address this topic.</text>

== Why do We have Copyright? == 
Compared to other legal concepts, [[w:copyright|copyright]] is a relatively new invention in human history. The development of copyright regulation reflects the social and technological transformation around human creative activity and distribution of the resultant profits. While granting exclusive private rights to authors or [[w:copyright#The exclusive rights of the copyright holder|copyright holders]] has been considered as a way of encouraging human creative activity, copyright law also claims to recognize the larger public interest, particularly with respect to education, research and access to information.{{ref|9}}

Copyright law uses various means to balance public and private interests. In the [[w:Statute of Anne|Statute of Anne]] ([[w:1710|1710]]), the earliest modern copyright law, authorities are allowed to limit and control the price of printed books according to their best judgement. In the [[w:United States Constitution|United States Constitution]], authors are granted exclusive rights to their writings within a limited time. In copyright law, fair use exceptions are specified to avoid the drawbacks of excessive assertion of exclusive rights and to attain a balance between conflicting interests.

== What can be Copyrighted? ==
[[w:Copyright|Copyright]] applies to the expression of ideas in different forms, including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intellectual works. {{ref|10}} The ideas expressed in such works are themselves not copyrightable. {{ref|11}} Since the 1980s, the copyrightability of software became internationally accepted.{{ref|12}}

== How do I Copyright my Work? ==
Nowadays, [[w:copyright|copyright]] law does not require formalities. The author does not need to publish, register, pay a registration fee of any kind, nor attach a copyright notice to his/her/its work, for the copyright to take effect. Copyright is automatically applied to a work once it is created {{ref|13}} and the creator of the work automatically becomes the copyright holder.

== What Rights are Granted to the Copyright Holder? ==
[[w:Copyright|Copyright]] is actually a bundle of rights, including the right to reproduce the work, to prepare derivative works based on it, to distribute copies of a work, and to perform and display a copyrighted work publicly. A few other kinds of rights are defined in copyright law. {{ref|14}} Without the consent of the copyright holder, it is illegal for anyone to perform any of the activities mentioned above. 

== The Expansion of Copyright Law ==
Copyright Law has been expanded with time. 

; '''The first copyright legislation (the [[w:Statute of Anne|Statute of Anne]], [[w:1710|1710]]):'''
: Compared to other legal systems, copyright law came relatively late in human civilization. The first known copyright legislation was the [[w:Statute of Anne|Statute of Anne]], enacted in 1710 in Great Britain.{{ref|15}} For a newly created work, the Statute of Anne granted the copyright holders the right to print and reprint books and other writings for 14 years. 

; '''All-dimensional expansion of copyright law:'''
: We can see from the [[w:Statute of Anne|Statute of Anne]] that, initially, the scope of copyright was quite limited. The copyrightable works were limited to books and other writings, the rights granted to the copyright holder were limited to printing and reprinting the work, and the length of the protection was limited to 14 years. Now, copyright law does much more. Copyrightable works now include paintings, sculpture, music compositions, music recording, architecture, and software. The bundle of rights granted to the copyright holder have been expanded to include the right to print, reprint, modify, display publicly, perform publicly, and distribute the work. Moreover, the term of copyright protection has been increased to 50 years after the author’s death. (In Europe and the US, it has been expanded to 70 years.){{ref|16}}

== From National to International ==
The expansion of copyright law has not been limited to one jurisdiction; it has become standardized internationally. 

; '''[[w:Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]:'''
: In the late [[w:19th century|19th century]], as copyrighted works gradually became important in international trade, the transnational copyright system gradually became a serious issue. The Berne Convention of [[w:1886|1886]] first introduced the national treatment principle. This means that signatories to the Berne Convention will treat the work of a foreign copyright holder just as they treat their own citizens’ work. Thus, it created an international standard for copyright regulation. 

: However, without a dispute resolution mechanism, the Berne Convention offered a somewhat weak copyright, as it will be too costly for copyright holders to claim their rights in a foreign country where they believed their rights had been infringed. 

; '''More enforceable international standard: WTO and TRIPs:'''
: In the 1990s, the [[w:World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and the [[w:TRIPs|Trade Related Intellectual Property Agreement]] (TRIPs) sought to establish a stronger international copyright regime. Every economy intending to become a WTO member is required to sign the TRIPs, and every TRIPs signatory must agree to comply with all of the key sections of the [[w:Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. The WTO also provides a dispute-settlement and enforcement mechanism for copyright infringements among member countries. Thus, copyright has become more enforceable internationally.{{ref|17}}

== The Abolition of Formality Requirements ==
As set forth in the [[w:1908|1908]] Berne Convention, [[w:copyright|copyright]] is applied to a work once it is created, without the need for any formality.{{ref|18}} The author is not required to register, or even to publish a work to enjoy full copyright protection. In Berne Convention signatory countries, the law assumes that all authors claim all rights granted to them unless they explicitly state otherwise. 

[[w:Copyright|Copyright]] laws in different countries have been revised to comply with this standard. For example, anticipating that it would join the Berne Convention Union, the US revised its [[w:United States copyright law|Copyright Act]] and abolished formality requirements in [[w:1976|1976]].{{ref|19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FOSS Licensing}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Extension of Copyright Law to Software ==
Since [[w:1980|1980]], it has become an international trend for copyright to be applied to [[w:computer software|computer software]]. The [[w:WIPO Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]] ([[w:1996|1996]]) also states that computer software should be regulated by copyright law. 

== Copyrightability of the Source Code and the Object Code ==
Software can be expressed in both source code and object code. However, [[w:TRIPs|TRIPs]] states that software copyright applies to both forms.{{ref|20}} In practice, [[w:proprietary software|proprietary software]] companies tend to release their product only in object code, and keep the source code of the product as their trade secret.{{ref|21}}

As mentioned earlier, under copyright law only the expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves can be copyrighted. For example, with a literary work or a music composition, although the form of the work is copyrighted, other people can use the ideas expressed in the work as inspiration for their new works. With software, ideas can only be perceived by reading the source code. Since the source code is not often accessible, in effect the proprietary company is able to withhold the ideas that underpin the software. This contravenes the principle that only form and not the idea should be exclusively owned – a principle designed to maintain the balance between private and public interests. 

== Users’ Rights Denied in Proprietary Licensing Models ==
The revision of the [[w:United States copyright law|US copyright law]] in [[w:1976|1976]] and shifts in the [[w:information technology|information technology]] (IT) industry in the [[w:1970s|1970s]] changed the practices of software distribution. Before that, users received both source and binary object codes. Today, under proprietary license models, [[w:proprietary software|proprietary software]] companies usually make the source code inaccessible to ensure and maximize profit. Studying a proprietary software is usually explicitly prohibited. For example, even in licenses for developers, for example, Microsoft End User Agreement and Microsoft Developer Network Subscription, reverse-engineering, decompilation and disassembly are not allowed except and only to the extent that it is expressly permitted by the applicable law.{{ref|22}}

For end-users, proprietary licenses usually allow only one copy of the software for each computer. That means, if the user has one desktop and one laptop, or two desktops, she will have to purchase two copies if she wants to run the program legally on both machines. If there are defects in the program that she has legally purchased, her only recourse is to contact the proprietary company regarding these defects. She will not be able to legally debug the program herself, or use unofficial patches, since modification of the program is not allowed. In effect, users of proprietary software are completely dependent upon the vendor. 

Under the traditional proprietary licensing model, end-users were not able to protect their interest in a cooperative manner. The [[w:free software movement|FOSS movement]] has contributed to the positive transformation of this situation. The [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), which was founded in [[w:1985|1985]], is dedicated to promoting users’ rights to use, study, copy, modify and/or redistribute computer programs.{{ref|23}} These are the rights that are not usually granted to end-users in the licenses of proprietary software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FOSS Licensing}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The development of [[w:Free and open source software|FOSS]] may be considered a reaction of the community of software developers to existing legal definitions of software copyright. For both [[w:free software|free software]] and [[w:open source|open source]] developers, access to the source code is a prerequisite to exercise the rights bundled in copyright, such as the right to make copies of a work, to distribute these copies, and to prepare derivative works. 

== Transition in IT Industry and Legal Institutions ==
In the [[w:1970s|1970s]], developments in legal institutions and the IT industry stimulated the formation of the [[w:free software movement|free software movement]] in the US. For one thing, the [[w:united states copyright law|US copyright law]] went through a major revision in [[w:1976|1976]], and the question of whether software is copyrightable was put on the table under relentless pressure from IT companies.{{ref|24}} Second, while software used to be bundled with hardware in the hardware market, the IT industry began to consider the software itself as a separate product.{{ref|25}} At this point, IT companies began to recruit more developers from research institutes to develop software, and the companies asked these individuals to sign confidentiality agreements upon recruitment. 

== Richard Stallman on a Stark Moral Decision ==
Prior to the above transition, the common practice in laboratories was to share sources and copies. For [[w:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]] (RMS) who worked at the [[w:Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) laboratory at the time, the change undermined the community that honoured sharing and the ethic of “helping your neighbours”. For Stallman, a talented programmer who could easily sign a contract and a confidentiality agreement with a proprietary company in exchange for a well-paid salary, the “stark moral decision” was between private gain for himself (and proprietary software companies) or the survival and sustainability of the community of software developers. He chose the latter and began the Free Software movement.{{ref|26}}

== Free Software Defined ==
[[w:Free software|Free software]] is about granting users the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Free software is any software that provided the following freedoms. The freedom to: 

# Run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). 
# Study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
# Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2). 
# Improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.{{ref|27}}

Apart from emphasizing access to the [[w:source code|source code]], the [[w:Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]] also stipulates the user’s right to copy, to distribute the copy, to modify the software, and to distribute the derivative work of a copyrighted work. All these rights are granted exclusively to the [[w:copyright|copyright]] holder under copyright law.

== Creating a Free Software Environment ==
=== The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation ===

It is not sufficient to stipulate the rights of users or non-copyright holders. It is also important to have a computing environment in which these rights can be exercised. Thus, the [[w:GNU project|GNU project]] was launched in [[w:1984|1984]] to develop the GNU system, a complete UNIX-style free operating system. Today, the GNU project also includes other software applications. 

In [[w:1985|1985]], the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was established to promote the idea of [[w:free software|free software]]. It promotes the development and use of free software not only by distributing free software, but also by encouraging the creation of a coherent system, the GNU operating system, and providing alternative solutions to proprietary software. For more information, see http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html . 

=== GNU General Public License ===

Under existing legal norms, once a work is created, copyright protection is granted exclusively to the copyright holder. Without an explicit expression, it is assumed that the copyright holder claims all the rights granted to her. The law burdens the copyright holder with explicit expression if she wishes to relinquish some or all rights granted to her. 

Some people may not want to exercise all of the rights granted to them. However, they may not know how to make such an explicit expression. The [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL) serves as a legal tool to help people to do so. 

[[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] is a license. Unlike proprietary licenses, it grants users the rights that the law grants exclusively to the copyright holder. These include the right to access the source code; to run the program; to make copies and redistribute the copies; and to modify the program and distribute the modified program. 

On the other hand, although [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] grants the user many rights and freedoms to use the software, it also sets certain limitations on those who want to distribute the program or make and distribute derivative works to ensure that the software and its derivations will remain free. {{ref|28}}

When a work is licensed under [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], it means that its author still claims copyright but adopts a different license as an explicit expression to allow the public to have greater freedom to use her work than what the copyright law allows by default. 

== Open Source Software ==
While [[w:free software|free software]] advocates consider the four freedoms to be a moral issue, promoters of [[w:open source|open source]] software focus more on the technical values and are, consequently, more business-friendly.{{ref|29}} The [[w:Open Source Initiative|Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) operates as an organization to promote the open source movement by managing and promoting the [[w:Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]] (OSD) and its certification mark for open source licenses and products. 

== Open Source Definition == 
The [[w:Open Source Definition|OSD]] is a revision of a policy document of the [[w:Debian|Debian]] GNU/Linux Distribution that served to clarify which licenses are free licenses.{{ref|30}} The OSI explains the basic idea of [[w:Open Source|Open Source]] as: 

: ''The basic idea behind open source is very simple: When programmers can read, redistribute, and modify the source code for a piece of software, the software evolves. People improve it, people adapt it, people fix bugs.''{{ref|31}}

The [[w:Open Source Definition|OSD]] echoes the rights stated in the [[w:Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]], including the users’ access to the sourcecode (Section 2), the rights of users to copy the work and distribute the copies (Section 1), and the right to modify the work and distribute derivative works (Section 3). 

The OSD also has several non-discrimination clauses (Sections 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10). Though not stated in the same way, these non-discriminatory ideas are also found in the Free Software Definition. Section 7 of the OSD aims to prevent the source code from being withheld by indirect means such as by requiring non-disclosure agreements. However, the emphasis on the integrity of the author’s source code and the requirements for the distribution of modified works (Section 4) are not explicitly stated in the Free Software Definition. For details, see http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php.

== OSI-approved Licenses == 
The [[w:Open Source Initiative|OSI]] certifies and recognizes licenses as open source by following certain procedures. The certification is made upon request, and newly approved open source licenses are added to a list of open source licenses maintained by the OSI at http://www.opensource.org/licenses . 

The number of OSI-approved licenses has been growing with the recent FOSS development. Some licenses are derived from the FOSS community: the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]], the [[w:PHP License|PHP License]] and the [[w:NetHack General Public License|NetHack General Public License]]. Those from academic/research institutes include the NASA Open Source Agreement, the [[w:MIT License|MIT License]] and the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License. Some proprietary companies that have adopted FOSS as part of their strategies have also developed FOSS licenses including the [[w:Apple Public Source License|Apple Public License]], the [[w:Eclipse Public License|Eclipse Public License]], the [[w:Q Public License|Qt Public License]] and the [[w:Mozilla Public License|Mozilla Public License]]. Actually, a large proportion of OSI-approved licenses are developed by for-profit companies. 

== Free or Restrictive? ==
Although the [[w:Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]] and the [[w:Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]] have much in common, they do differ in rhetoric, which reflects their differences in philosophy. 

For example, some people may describe the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] and the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] as “highly restrictive” because the [[w:Free Software Foundation|FSF]] set many restrictions to make sure that [[w:free software|free software]] and their derivative works stay free. However, for the FSF, these restrictions are prerequisites for a healthy environment for free software. 

The [[w:Free Software Foundation|FSF]] also maintains a list of free software licenses and non-free software licenses. Although the FSF may sometimes describe these relatively simple licenses as “permissive”, it never qualifies their more complicated ones as “restrictive”. 

Though there are philosophical differences, in most cases, the [[w:Free Software License|FSF]] and the [[w:Open Source Initiative|OSI]] agree on the classification of FOSS and non-FOSS licenses. Twenty-six OSI-approved licenses have been analysed by the FSF, and only two of these, the [[w:Original Artistic License|Original Artistic License]] and the [[w:Reciprocal Public License|Reciprocal Public License]], are regarded as non-free licenses.

Under current legal norms, software is protected by copyright law. Therefore, the [[w:free software movement|FOSS movement]] has developed many different [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]] to enable software developers to easily state that they grant their users some rights that copyright law grants exclusively to them. FOSS licenses also serve as agreements among FOSS developer communities. 

There are many FOSS licenses, and their characteristics differ. In a later section of this primer, we will focus on three major licenses: the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] and the [[w:BSD Licenses|BSD License]]. They not only represent three very different styles of FOSS licensing but are also the most pervasively adopted licenses.{{ref|32}} Table 1 helps us to get a quick and general overview.{{ref|33}}

The [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]] listed in Table 1 have the following common features: 

* The source code of the original work is open.
* Making copies of the original work is allowed.
* Distribution of the original work is allowed. A copyright notice should be attached to all distributions.
* The license grant is non-exclusive, global, royalty-free, and for all purposes.
* Warranty is disclaimed.
 
However, these [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]] differ from each other in how these rights can be exercised. For one, although authors are always required to provide access to the source code , whether redistributors are also required to provide such access varies from one license to another. For example, when redistributing a [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]]-ed program, one is not required to provide the source code. 

Even for licenses that require redistributors to provide the source code, there are different regulations regarding the distribution fee the redistributors can collect. The [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] and the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] are particularly detailed about when one can collect a fee higher than the physical transmission fee. This is because the GNU GPL and the LGPL offer redistributors various ways to distribute the program, with or without the source code, while simultaneously ensuring that redistributions remain free software. An individual can sell free software for any price she wishes, since the market would help to keep the price within a reasonable range. But if a package is sold without the source code, the fee collected for the distribution of the source code itself cannot exceed the cost of physical transmission. 

Clauses on derivative works vary widely. Although access to the source code of original works is a requirement, access to the source code of derivative works might not be. And even if a FOSS license requires the source code of derivative works to be open, it may not require them to be licensed under exactly the same license as the original work. For example, although a derivative work of a [[w:GNU GPL|GPL]]-ed program also has to be licensed under the GNU GPL, a derivative work of a [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]]-ed program does not have to be licensed under the BSD license. As a matter of fact, a derivative work of a BSD-ed program does not even have to be distributed along with source code. 

FOSS licenses also differ on the possibility of allowing a FOSS program to be combined with proprietary programs. When combining different programs into a larger project, it is quite inevitable that the larger project, while embracing all or part of the source code of the programs combined, becomes the derivative work of all of the combined programs. For example, project ABC is combined with a GPL-ed program A, a BSD program B and a proprietary program C, and has source code from all three programs. As a derivative work of program B, project ABC need not be licensed under the BSD License or even required to open its source. However, as a derivative work of program A, project ABC is required to be licensed under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]]. 

Thus, the developer will have no choice but to license the whole project ABC under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], or find an alternative to program A, especially if she wishes to make it a proprietary software project. 

This is why the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] is considered by proprietary companies to have the so-called “viral” effect, and it is regarded as unfriendly to the proprietary software development model. But the GNU GPL is designed to serve the interests of the free software community rather than the proprietary business sector. The FSF has also designed the LGPL to encourage greater use of free libraries even in proprietary software projects. 

The three typical FOSS licenses – the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] and the [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]] – are explained further below. 

== GNU General Public License ==
The [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] is the classic [[w:free software license|free software license]]. It is also the most well-known and the most widely adopted among all FOSS licenses. The GNU GPL was developed to fulfil the freedoms defined by the [[w:Free Software Movement|Free Software Movement]]. It is not just a license, but is also an expression of the basic ideas behind the movement 

=== Copyleft ===
; The idea
: The way the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] guarantees freedom is also called “[[w:copyleft|copyleft]]”. While the traditional proprietary model says “copyright, all rights reserved”, the GNU GPL says “copyleft, all rights reversed”. Copyleft is not just about making the original work free when the copyright holder releases it, but also about keeping it free when it is being further distributed and modified. Although there is no limitation when derivative works are created only for internal use, when they are being distributed to the public, coplyleft is applied to make sure that derivative works are as free as the original work. 

; How it works
: Copyleft prevents [[w:free software|free software]] from being turned into [[w:proprietary software|proprietary software]]. It uses copyright law to achieve the exact opposite of its usual purpose. Instead of being the means of privatizing software, in copyleft licenses the rights granted to authors are reversed to keep the software free.{{ref|34}}

Unlike works in the [[w:public domain|public domain]] that everyone is free to exploit, a [[w:GPL|GPL]]-ed work or a copyleft-ed work is copyrighted. The author of the GPL-ed work does not give up her rights as a copyright holder, but exercises these rights in a way different from a traditional copyright holder. 

If authors who want to make their software free simply disclaim their rights as copyright holders and release their work into the public domain, it will expose the work to the danger of being privatized and closed again. Instead, to keep their works and their derivates free, authors must claim their rights, and with the exclusive rights granted to them, they include the copyleft clause so as to regulate the ways other people can make use of their work. By licensing their work under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], authors are allowing users to have the rights stipulated by the [[w:Free Software Movement|Free Software Movement]].

Also by licensing under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], authors require people who wish to distribute the program and developers who wish to modify the work and distribute the modified works, to take on some responsibility in keeping derivatives as free as the original work.

=== Major Terms and Conditions of GNU GPL ===
; User’s freedoms 
: When a program is licensed under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], besides the freedom to access the source code, users are also free to: 

# Run the program (Section 0). 
# Make copies of the program (Section 1). 
# Redistribute the program, even for commercial purposes, provided an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty are retained (Section 1). Redistribution in the object code or executable form is also possible, so long as the [[w:source code|source code]] is available for all recipients (Section 3). 
# Prepare and distribute derivative works of the program, provided the derivative works are also licensed to all third parties under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] (Section 2). 
 
; No warranty
: Though the distribution of the work can be commercial, the work itself is licensed free of charge. Therefore, there is no warranty for GPL-ed software (Sections 11, 12). The distributor could choose to offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee (Section 1).  
; License issued directly from the author
: The work is not sub-licensable. When a program is redistributed, recipients still receive the license from the original licensor. Redistributors may not impose any further restrictions on recipients' exercise of the rights granted in the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] (Section 6). 
; Acceptance and termination 
: By the act of modifying or distributing the [[w:GPL|GPL]]-ed program, a person indicates his acceptance of the license (Section 5). The license grant is irrevocable but when the licensee violates the license, the rights granted will be terminated automatically. However, the rights of those who received the copy of the program from her will not be affected (since they received the license from the original licensor) so long as they remain in full compliance with the license (Section 4). 
; Co-exist with other legal obligations?
: The GNU GPL does not concede to any contradictory conditions that are imposed on the recipients. If compliance with the license is not possible as a consequence of a court judgment, allegation of patent infringement or any other reason, then the recipient may not redistribute the program at all (Section 7). A GPL-ed program cannot be incorporated into a proprietary program, or linked with a proprietary library. 

The full GNU GPL text can be found at http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.txt 

The [[w:Free Software Foundation|FSF]] also maintains a thorough FAQ on the GNU GPL which can be accessed at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html

== GNU Lesser General Public License ==
Apart from the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], the [[w:Free Software Foundation|FSF]] offers a special copyleft license for libraries. The [[w:GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL) permits LGPL-ed libraries to be linked with proprietary software. 

This exception is to serve different situations. It can be a strategic decision to encourage the development of proprietary applications on the GNU system.{{ref|35}} For a free library whose features may be largely replaced by other proprietary libraries, releasing it under the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] rather than the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] can encourage its wider use,{{ref|36}} and thus make possible more improvements on it. With a larger body of free software users, there would also be wider support for free software in general.{{ref|37}} 

However, the FSF still encourages people to use the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] for their libraries rather than the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]], especially for those libraries that have a significant number of unique capabilities. This is because people who are interested in utilizing such GPL-ed libraries will have to release their modules as GPL-ed software too, resulting in more useful modules and programs available in the free software environment.{{ref|38}} 

=== Major Terms and Conditions of LGPL ===
The [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] is identical to the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] in many ways, including clauses that disclaim warranty, declare that the license is issued directly from the author, and specify when the license is applied and terminated. Also, other legal obligations applied upon users are the same as those for the GNU GPL.

On users’rights, the LGPL distinguishes two different kinds of situations when one uses a library. A “work based on the Library” means either the Library itself or any derivative work under copyright law (Section 0), while a“work that uses the Library” means a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it (Section 5). 

; Works Based on the Library 
: In the case of a “work that uses the Library”, i.e., the Library itself and its derivative works, the terms are very similar to those in the GNU GPL.

* User’s Freedoms 
*# Run the program (Section 0). 
*# Make copies of the program (Section 1). 
*# Redistribute the program, even for commercial purposes, provided an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty are retained (Section 1). Redistribution in the object code or executable form is also possible, so long as the [[w:source code|source code]] is available for all recipients (Section 4). 
*# Prepare and distribute derivative works of the program, provided the derivative works are also licensed to all third parties under the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] (Section 2c). 
*:In addition, one may opt to apply the terms of the GNU GPL instead of the LGPL to a given copy of the LGPL-ed library, especially when one is incorporating part of the code into a program that is not a library (Section 3). 

; Works that use the Library 
: In the case of a “work that uses the Library,” the work itself is NOT subject to the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]]. But when linking the “work that uses the Library” with the Library, an executable version that is a derivative work of the Library would be created, and such a version is covered by the LGPL (Section 5). 

Although the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] allows authors to distribute the object code of executables (Section 5) and license these under terms of their choice, it is also required that those terms permit modification of the work for the customer’s own use and reverse engineering. When distributing executables, the author has a choice either to distribute the Library together, provided the source code of the Library is made available in those ways similar to the distribution of [[w:GPL-|GPL-]]ed programs, or not to distribute the Library together but only use a suitable shared library mechanism to link with the Library (Section 6). 

By creating this category, the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] provides a way for LGPL-ed libraries to be used in proprietary programs. The full LGPL text can be found at http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.txt.

== BSD Style Licenses ==
The [[w:BSD licenses|Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License]] was first used for the [[w:Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley Software Distribution]], a version of Unix developed in the University of California at Berkeley.{{ref|39}} It is easy to follow the BSD License template to create one’s own license by changing the values of owner, organization and year, which appear in the copyright notice and the license. Unlike the GNU GPL and the LGPL, BSD style licenses are not copyleft licenses. A BSD License allows people to freely distribute and modify the original work, but it does not require that the modified works be as free as the original work. BSD style licenses are relatively simple and have only limited restrictions on the use of the software. 

*User’s Freedoms 
*# Make copies and redistribute the program, with either its source code or its binary code. The distributor is not obliged to provide the source code. 
*# Prepare derivative works and distribute them, either with their source code or binary code. The author is free to choose either FOSS or proprietary licenses for derivative works. 
*# Incorporate the program into proprietary software. 

The original BSD License (four-clause BSD) has an advertising clause. The revised BSD License (three-clause BSD) is very similar to the [[w:MIT License|MIT License]], but the latter does not have the “no endorsement for derivative works” clause. There is also the two-clause BSD, which has taken away the endorsement clause and is most similar to the MIT License.{{ref|40}} 

== Multiple Licensing ==
It is important to note that a work can be licensed under more than one license. The choice of license reflects the type of relationship that the author wishes to have with the user of the copyrighted work. Since there can be more than one kind of user, and more than one possible relationship, the copyright holder is entitled to choose different kinds of licenses for different situations. 

Take [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] as an example. OpenOffice is dual-licensed under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] and the [[w:Sun Industrial Standards Source License|Sun Industrial Standards Source License]] (SISSL). Although OpenOffice states clearly that users are encouraged to use the GNU GPL to participate fully in the OpenOffice community, SISSL is provided as an alternative for developers and companies who are not able to use the GNU GPL.{{ref|41}} ,{{ref|42}} [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] is another example. MySQL offers both the GNU GPL and a commercial license. Organizations that do not want to release their applications under the GNU GPL can choose to use MySQL under the MySQL Commercial License.{{ref|43}}

== What about Documentation? ==

=== GNU Free Documentation License (GNU FDL) ===
Good documentation and manuals are extremely important for FOSS programs. When they are not licensed as free/open, it is difficult for people to make complete use of relevant FOSS programs. 

Although the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] is a license designed mainly for software, it can also be used for works that are not software, so long as it is defined clearly what the “[[w:source code|source code]]” is when adopting the license.{{ref|44}} The [[w:Free Software Foundation|FSF]] also provides a license that is specially designed for documentation. The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] (GNU FDL or FDL) is a form of copyleft license for manuals, textbooks or other documents that grants everyone the freedom to copy and redistribute the documents, with or without modifications, either commercially or non-commercially.{{ref|45}} 

By applying GNU FDL to a document, the author grants users the right to make verbatim copies of the work, to modify the work and to distribute modified works. Since it is a [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] license, it requires the copy and the distribution of modification of the FDL-ed work is also licensed under the FDL. 

=== Creative Commons Licenses ===

{{TextBox|BY: Attribution. For any reuse and distribution, it is required that credit is given to the original author.

NC: Non Commercial. The work cannot be used for commercial purposes.

ND: No Derivative Works. The work cannot be altered or transformed; derivative works built upon the work are not permitted.

SA: Share Alike. It is allowed to alter and transform the work, and to prepare derivative works upon the work, so long as the resulting work is licensed under a license identical to this.

&amp;bull; Starting in 2004, Creative Commons made the “attribution” requirement the default in the second version. Thus only the first six CC licenses above remain in the second version.}}

Inspired by the FOSS development, the [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] advocates for openness of digital content and is urging for a more reasonable and flexible layer of copyright in the face of increasingly restrictive default rules.{{ref|46}}

In [[w:2002|2002]], the first versions of [[w:Creative Commons Licenses|Creative Commons Public Licenses]] (CC licenses) were released. By identifying major concerns of authors – i.e., whether attribution is required (attribution, BY), whether users are allowed to make commercial uses of the work (non-commercial, NC), whether users are allowed to make derivative works (no derivative works, ND), and when derivative works are allowed, whether they are required to be licensed under exactly the same license as the original work (share alike, SA) – [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] developed a set of 11 different CC licenses. Each represents a unique combination of the above four conditions. Authors are free to choose among the 11 licenses and decide which best suits their needs and works. 

In [[w:2004|2004]] [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] released the second version of CC licenses. Since the requirement of attribution has been widely adopted by users of CC licenses, the attribution requirement has become default, and thus there are only six CC licenses in the second version. However, the 11 licenses in the first version are not superseded and are still available (Table 2).{{ref|47}} 

[[w:Creative Commons licenses|CC licenses]] are designed for all kinds of digital content except for software, including art works, photographs, music and literary texts. CC licenses do not deal with the FOSS issue, since ideas in the works referred to are transparent and are not compiled into forms that cannot be perceived. Some CC licenses do not allow modification or for-profit use and might not be regarded as “free”. However, CC licenses are successful in spreading the idea of freedom and openness to the greater public, which might not be familiar with recent software developments fostered by FOSS movements.

== Footnotes ==

* {{note|32}} If we look at SourceForge.net, the largest FOSS development website, we can see that the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]] and the [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]] are the three most adopted licenses. Of the 53,026 projects that are licensed under OSI-approved licenses, 36,962 projects are licensed under the GNU GPL, 5,817 projects are under the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]], and 3,813 projects are licensed under the [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FOSS Licensing}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Different stakeholders will have different uses for FOSS. A developer might use a program more intensively than an end-user, which means that the developer’s activities might be subject to more restrictions than an end-user. The following section tries to provide some scenarios as examples to explain the different legal issues that may arise for different stakeholders. 

== End-user (Individual/Business/Government) ==
{{TextBox|Abul is a public high school teacher. His school cannot afford expensive license fees for proprietary office applications. Although proprietary software companies offer special rates for schools, Abul wanted to find an alternative solution to reduce students’ dependence on proprietary software. His friend, Nazlee, a programmer who has participated in FOSS projects, introduced him to a FOSS office application. Abul and his colleagues then downloaded FOSS office solutions and taught students both proprietary and FOSS applications. He is satisfied with the performance and introduced Nazlee’s program to his colleagues. Gradually, the school administrative body began to use the FOSS solution for administrative work. }}

In this case, neither Abul (an individual) nor his school (a public government body) made any modification to the software that they downloaded from the Web. They were simply end-users. 

The situation for end-users is relatively simple. The end-user of a software program may be an individual, a government body, or a business entity. These individual persons or legal entities may have different reasons to use FOSS. Some may be trying to find a cheaper solution or a solution that suits their needs better; others may wish to use FOSS for better customization; still others may wish to reduce their dependence on proprietary companies. 

; Legal issues involved 
: The way end-users use FOSS solutions might not be very different from the way they use proprietary solutions. They download a copy of a FOSS solution or purchase a copy (usually in exchange for some support and services), install it in the computer (thus making a copy on the hard disk), run the program, and have its functions serve their needs. The rights that are of concern here are the right to make copies of the program and to run it. (The act of running a program may also count as an act of making copy, but it is stated differently in some FOSS licenses. For example, the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] has no restrictions on the running of the [[w:GPL|GPL]]-ed program but does regulate the act of making a copy.) These rights are granted by all FOSS licenses. Thus there are fewer legal disputes involving end-users. However, end-users do need to consider some issues. 
:* Issue 1: Technical Support Since an end-user might not be a computer whiz, she might have concerns regarding technical support when choosing a FOSS solution. Thus, instead of simply downloading a copy of the FOSS solution for free, she might choose to purchase a box of FOSS in a shop where a proprietary solution is also available, sometimes at approximately the same price. The difference is that when purchasing, let’s say, a commercial Linux distribution in the store, the end-user is not paying for the license fee, but for the service and support. Additional copies of the software and FOSS documentation may be distributed freely, e.g. to pupils, or installed on other computers; such additional users or installations are usually not covered by the support, unless explicitely included in the agreement. When the term of service expires, the end-user can choose to pay for another term of service, or ask other available providers for similar services. 
:* Issue 2: Customization When existing FOSS solutions do not fit their needs, end-users might need to ask individual developers or vendors to customize the solutions. In such cases, since end-users may not be technically savvy enough to detect possible infringements, they may wish to have a written clause in the contract ensuring that the vendor or developer will take on the entire responsibility for any possible copyright infringement, and will compensate for any possible losses that may be caused by allegations of infringement. The buyer is free to add these clauses to the contract when negotiating with the vendor or developer. 
:* Issue 3: Government Procurement Since FOSS licenses are different from traditional software licenses, governments should be particularly aware of the differences when they open a bid for software solutions or sign a contract with vendors. Existing government bid and contract templates may have been drafted under the traditional proprietary model of traditional copyright law, and have to be examined, or revised, if they fail to treat FOSS and proprietary software equally.

== Developer (Individual, Business) ==
Developers (individuals and business entities) need to be more careful with the terms and conditions of different licenses while using FOSS. Developers usually not only run and copy the software, but also create derivative works from the software, and distribute these derivative works together with the original program. Therefore, for developers to contribute to the development of a certain FOSS program, it is essential to have the rights to run the program, to make copies, to distribute the program and to prepare derivative works. 

These rights are granted by all [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]], for these essential rights are considered important both in the [[w:Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]] and the [[w:Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]]. Nevertheless, different FOSS licenses may have different restrictions on exercising these rights, especially on creating and distributing derivative works. Developers should pay particular attention to this, and consult their lawyers on their specific situation when needed. 

There are different considerations when a developer participates in different stages of software development. 

=== When Starting a New Project ===
{{TextBox|Abul’s colleague Jolly is the school librarian. The school library is not that large, but it is open to villagers. Jolly sought her friend’s help to write a program that would enable her to keep an accurate record of the books in the library. }}

* '''Legal issues involved — choosing a license of one’s own'''

; Developers 
: What does this project mean to me and to others? How do I want others to be involved? What do FOSS licenses say? What are the differences between FOSS licenses? 

: The situation is relatively simple if the developer is starting a new project without using any existing modules, since she will not have to look through the licenses of existing modules that she might have used. 

: However, starting a new project is not an easy task either. The different characteristics of the FOSS license she chooses will have a significant influence on the possible development path of the project. The developer should define her main concerns before choosing a license. 

: For example, if the developer is a supporter of copyleft, she may stick with the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] or the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]]. If the developer thinks she doesn’t need to require people to license their modified works under FOSS licenses, a [[w:BSD license|BSD-style license]] would be appropriate. Or when the developer thinks it is better to control the development in a firm and central line, she might not be interested in BSD style licenses. But if forking is preferred in the future development, BSD style licenses may be a better choice. 

; Developer
: Can I change my mind after licensing my project? 

: The copyright holder of a project can always decide to choose another license for the program, even when the previous versions have already been licensed under certain [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]]. This will not affect the rights of the recipients of the previous versions since license grants are irrevocable. The situation will be more complicated if contributions from the community have been incorporated into the newer version, which means that these other contributors may claim copyright to certain pieces of the code in the newer version. In this case, unless there is prior agreement, the license must be chosen by all contributors. 

; Developer
: I don’t like any of the existing [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]]. Can I start a new one? 

: Though there are already many [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]], it is possible that a developer will find that she does not like any of the available licenses. As long as the developer owns the code, she is entitled to choose any license for the project, including a new one that she drafts by herself. However, creating a new FOSS license requires legal knowledge and skill to avoid vagueness and loopholes. Also, there are already many FOSS licenses and the transaction cost for understanding these licenses is high. Creating a new license is not recommended unless a developer has strong reasons to do so.

=== When Modifying an Existing Module ===
{{TextBox|The office application Abul and his school are using has an English interface. It does not support the local language. Using an English interface might not pose a problem for high school students. However, it is difficult when Abul tried to teach villagers. He consulted Nazlee about the problem. Nazlee has constantly contributed to FOSS programs and is also quite familiar with the source code of the office application. She discussed this with a few friends and, as a team, they began to localize the application. }}

* '''Legal issues involved: Ascertain the license of the program to be modified'''

When a developer tries to modify an existing module, and when the modification is not solely for her own use but for further distribution (e.g., localizing a project), she needs to first identify the license of the module. 

; Developers:
: Under the license, what are the rights I am granted and what are the restrictions in exercising those rights? 

: For example, on the distribution of a FOSS work, some FOSS licenses (e.g., the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], the [[w:LGPL|LGPL]]) may require distributors to provide both object code and source code, or at least provide the information on how to access the [[w:source code|source code]]. On modifying a FOSS work, some FOSS licenses (e.g., [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], [[w:LGPL|LGPL]], [[w:BSD license|BSD]]) may require the modifier to provide documentation of the changes being made. On distributing the derivative work, [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] licenses require derivative works to be licensed under the same license as the original work, while other FOSS licenses allow the modifier to choose a different license ([[w:BSD license|BSD]], [[w:MIT license|MIT]]). 

: If Nazlee and her friends are trying to localize the dual-licensed [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], and they decide to use the one under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], then the localized OpenOffice would also be GPL-ed. Using the original license scheme (dual-licensing) the localizations are easily integrated in the original project and can then at least partly be maintained there. Using a more restrictive scheme means that the localizations probably must be maintained locally. Allowing additional licenses (e.g. to later be able to use part of the work in another project) is usually unproblematic.

: Some [[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]] (e.g., the [[w:MIT License|MIT License]]) may allow users to sublicense the original work. This means that when distributing the verbatim copy of the original work, within the scope granted by the original copyright holder, the distributor may choose a different license and become a licensor him/herself. In such cases, when a developer creates a derivative work and distributes it together with the original work, he/she can choose to become a licensor of both the original work and the derivative work, which simplifies the legal relations to one that exists only between the two parties. If a sublicense is not allowed, people who receive the modified work would have two licensors for this piece of work. The licensor of the original work will be the author of the original work, while the licensor of the derivative work will be the developer who prepared the derivative work.

=== When Integrating Different FOSS Modules into One Service ===
{{TextBox|Nazlee works in AA Software Inc. To better oversee the many different projects that the company is developing, the team built a project management system by integrating different FOSS modules. The management system is only for internal use now, but since it is pretty handy, the company also plans to distribute it commercially in the future. }}

[[w:free software licenses|FOSS licenses]] do not impose restrictions on modifications that are made for internal use. But when a public distribution is created based on these modifications, the developer must consider all the licenses of the modules being used. 

* '''Legal issues involved: Identify the licenses of the programs being integrated, and see if these licenses are compatible.'''

: When publishing something that integrates several different modules, it is essential to ascertain the licenses of each module. If they happen to be licensed under the '''same''' license, such as the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]], then the integrated system would be licensed under that license. The situation is similar when all modules are licensed under the [[w:BSD License|BSD License]]. But in this second case, because the BSD license is more permissive, AA would be able to choose another FOSS license or a proprietary license for the modified modules and the integrated system. (The permissive nature of the BSD license allows AA to &quot;narrow down&quot; the licence by adding further conditions, while the GPL does not allow this.)

: However, if some of the modules have '''different''' licenses, then AA will have to look at the compatibility of these licenses. When two licenses are ''compatible'', the two modules licensed under the two licenses can be combined into a larger work while complying with both licenses.{{ref|48}}

: When combining a [[w:GPL|GPL]]-ed program and [[w:BSD|BSD]]-ed (GPL-compatible) into a larger program, the larger program will have to be GPL-ed to meet both the requirement of the GPL-ed program and BSD-ed program. If some of the modules are GPL-ed but other modules are GPL-incompatible, AA must decide which module is more important for them and replace the other one with a module with a compatible license.{{ref|49}}

: The licenses used in different modules and the way they are combined together would determine how the integrated system can be licensed and distributed. 

* '''Other considerations – choice of law and choice of venue clauses '''

: Finally, for those who are able to choose licenses for their programs, either because they started their own programs or they are allowed to choose licenses for the derivative works they prepared, they should be aware that many OSI-approved licenses are developed by proprietary software companies. Some are designed to meet their company policy and strategy, and thus might not be a good choice for developers in general. Some technical issues, such as clauses on choice of law and of venue (which could be found in the [[w:Qt Public License|Qt Public License]], the [[w:Mozilla Public License|Mozilla Public License]], the [[w:Common Public License|Common Public License]], etc.), may become significant when a lawsuit is brought up.

== Vendor/Producer (Business) ==
{{TextBox|Nazlee and her friends have made the localized version of the FOSS office version available. AA Software Inc. is interested in this application. They have also developed some other small but useful programs for administrative work. They package the localized office together with their own programs (licensed under their proprietary license). The package is a big hit. A few months later, AA also decides to commercially distribute the project management system that they had integrated from different FOSS modules. }}

; Mere distribution
: In this situation, both FOSS and proprietary programs are distributed in one package. For the FOSS application, AA is merely a distributor, and must distribute it as its FOSS license requires. For proprietary programs, AA holds the copyright and is able to choose the license and ways of distribution. It is all right to put FOSS and proprietary applications into one distribution package, such as one CD-ROM, if the applications function separately and do not link together to create any derivative work. 

; Distribution of integrated systems
: In the case of an integrated system distribution, what is key are the licenses of the different integrated modules and the ways in which the modules are combined. As explained earlier, AA needs to first make sure that the licenses of the different modules allow AA to combine them. These licenses will also determine the ways by which AA can distribute the integrated system. 

; Other considerations – drivers and certifications
: One difficulty that FOSS vendors might encounter is that hardware vendors may not be aware of FOSS software and thus fail to provide drivers that will enable FOSS applications to work on the hardware. It is important to promote the idea of FOSS among hardware vendors. This will be easier when there is a larger group of FOSS users. 

Likewise, certification is sometimes needed for FOSS to work properly with specific proprietary software. A larger FOSS user group will encourage proprietary software companies to certify FOSS applications that might be used together with their programs. 

; Other considerations – FOSS used in embedded systems or devices
: FOSS is also used in embedded systems in electronic devices, such as cell phones, hand-held devices, digital cameras and DVD players. The use of FOSS may help device manufactures to lower their cost when developing new products. The distribution of the device is different from the distribution of the FOSS itself. With regard to the latter, the rules of specific licenses still apply.

The GPL version 3 mandates making available not only the source code for embedded devices, but also describing how to install a locally modified version of the software into the device, unless the device cannot be updated (e.g. because of having the software in ROM).

; Other considerations – Source code
: Many FOSS licenses insist on the source code being available. This must be the actual source code for the compiled program that has been distributed. As changes to the software can introduce subtle bugs making it unusable in the setting where it is used, it is not enough to provide the latest version of the source code. The simplest way not to have to keep track on every version is to always distribute the source code together with the compiled software (or keep them available together, if distributed by offering downloads).

== Government-sponsored Projects ==
FOSS movements and rapid FOSS developments have received attention not just from the FOSS community, but also from academics and policy-makers. In some Asian countries, governments work with PC manufactures/vendors to provide affordable PCs bundled with FOSS [[w:operating systems|operating systems]] and office applications.{{ref|50}} Governments also support FOSS development, generate FOSS-related projects and promote FOSS as a national technology and industrial policy.{{ref|51}} But long before governments began to notice the potential of FOSS and developed a clear position on it, some government-affiliated academic institutes have already been working on FOSS-related projects. 

The FSF-maintained FAQs about the GNU GPL also list questions about whether the United States Government could release a program under the GNU GPL or release improvements to a GPL-ed program.{{ref|52}} Situations may differ from country to country and from case to case under different government regulations in different countries. Most government regulations on government-sponsored projects are usually drafted under their domestic copyright and patent law and might be informed by a more protectionist mentality and thus be unfamiliar, or even unfriendly, to FOSS licensing and development models. 

Below are two cases of government-funded FOSS studies. The first one is about FOSS-related studies made in a government research institute without related government policy, while the second one is about a national FOSS project. 

== Government-funded FOSS Projects: Cases from the Asia-Pacific == 
=== A FOSS Project under a Government-affiliated Research Institute: Multi-Lingual Editor, Japan === 

[[w:Emacs|Emacs]] is a multilingual text editor first developed by [[w:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]] at [[w:MIT|MIT]]. After the [[w:GNU project|GNU project]] started in [[w:1984|1984]], the development of GNU Emacs was started and it was first released in [[w:1985|1985]], under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]]. 

The Japanese governmental research institute, Eletrotechnical Laboratory (ETL),{{ref|53}} began to work on the multilingual information processing and integration of [[w:Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and Mule (multilingual text editor based on Emacs and later merged into GNU Emacs as MULE) in the mid-[[w:1990s|1990s]], but there were various copyright issues. 

ETL was a government research institute, and the licensing model in the GNU GPL is very different from Japanese copyright law, so no one was able to decide whether ETL could assign the code to the FSF and release the code under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]]. As a result, ETL never officially released the code but released the trial versions instead. More negotiations between ETL and [[w:Free Software Foundation|FSF]] took place later, and resulted in a special agreement. The FSF agreed not to require ETL to assign the copyright of the modified code to the FSF, and ETL agreed to grant FSF the right to use the code. This was the first time that part of the code in Emacs did not belong to the FSF. 

In [[w:2001|2001]], ETL was reorganized into the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Although AIST is still a government-funded institute, it is an independent organization and its assets are not national property. It seemed that AIST would be able to release the code under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] officially. But, initially, it was still very difficult for the higher levels of AIST to make a final decision. It took them another year of internal negotiation to decide that AIST was entitled to release their works and choose the licenses of their works. It was also not easy to convince people about the advantage of adopting the GNU GPL. According to Dr Kenichi Handa, a senior researcher in AIST, it was never clear what convinced the AIST management to make the final decision. 

This happened before the Japanese Government had formed a clear position on FOSS development. During an open source conference among Asian countries in [[w:2003|2003]] where Dr Handa was invited to give a talk on the development of Emacs, Shuichi Tashiro, the leader of the Japanese FOSS project under the Ministry of Economic, Trade and Industry, said that the Japanese Government has made necessary regulatory revisions to give developers of government-funded projects the copyright (and thus the right to choose the license) so long as the law was applicable from the beginning of the project. 

In this case, we can see that when the government is not familiar with the FOSS licensing and developing model, related government regulations may create unnecessary difficulties for government-affiliated research institutes seeking to participate fully in FOSS development. It took AIST, formerly ETL, years to finally be able to officially release the code under the GNU GPL. Even though now there is a special regulation to facilitate the use of FOSS licenses for government-funded open source projects, as they are still considered exceptions. 

=== A National FOSS Project: Free Software Industrial Development Project, Taiwan ===
Under pressure from Congress, the Taiwanese Government began the planning of a national FOSS project in [[w:2002|2002]], and in [[w:2003|2003]] a significant budget had been allocated to a five-year FOSS project. The Ministry of Economics Affairs (MoEA) was assigned to structure, sponsor and oversee all of the sub-projects. 

Under general government regulations administered by the National Science Council (NSC), although the results can be copyrighted by the entity which carries out government-funded projects, applications of such results are still subject to certain regulatory principles. Unless it would be more beneficial for the national development of science and technology, the results have to be: 

# Licensed for a fee. 
# Licensed to Taiwanese institutes or firms. 
# Used or manufactured within Taiwanese jurisdiction. 

Though exceptions might be made for FOSS projects, the law had not been officially interpreted in this way, and no one wanted to risk violating the regulation. 

In addition, the national FOSS project was assigned to the MoEA, which has the more important task of protecting national interest and economic competitiveness. Thus their regulations are more protectionist/ restrictive than the general rule. These restrictive regulations were applied to the national FOSS project. Under MoEA regulations, only the third principle (used and manufactured within Taiwanese jurisdiction) can be exempted. This meant that the outputs of the national FOSS project had to be licensed for a fee, and it can be licensed only to Taiwanese institutes or firms. Such principles are inconsistent with the FOSS licensing model, making it difficult for all sub-projects under the national FOSS project to release their code. 

This issue was raised as soon as the five-year FOSS project started. Different government bodies met several times to find a solution. Because the FOSS licensing model was so alien to the models they were used to, the problem was not solved until mid-way into the second year ([[w:2004|2004]]) and the code developed in the first year was not officially released in time. 

This was particularly problematic since one of the sub-projects under the national FOSS project was integrating an existing FOSS program. At the same time, the sub-project intended to participate in and contribute to this particular FOSS project. When the community was about to incorporate all of the recent developments and release its newer version under the [[w:GNU GPL|GNU GPL]] in [[w:2004#March|March 2004]], they found it difficult to incorporate the code developed under the government-funded sub-project in Taiwan. 

It was not until after a negotiation held in [[w:2004#May|May 2004]] that different government bodies finally came out with a solution. The MoEA submitted the case to the Administrative Yuan (highest administration body) to obtain an official interpretation from the Government regarding whether FOSS projects meet the exception clause and are thus exempt from the principles. Meanwhile, the MoEA began to look into the possibility of revising its restrictive regulations. 

The official interpretation was finally made by the Administrative Yuan in [[w:2004#July|July 2004]], 18 months after the official launch of the national FOSS project. Under the new interpretation, government-funded FOSS projects met the exception clause of the general NSC rule and can be exempted from the principles that conflict with FOSS licenses. Although the MoEA regulation has not yet been modified, some code-generating FOSS projects are assigned to NSC and the general NSC rule, rather than the more restrictive MoEA rules . It is hoped that FOSS projects will be able to release the code under FOSS licenses thereafter. 

This case shows that while the government has started to recognize the importance of FOSS development, its regulatory and administrative structure might not be ready to accommodate FOSS. In the case of the Taiwan National FOSS Project, with the combined efforts of related government and project personnel, the problem was finally solved to a certain extent. But it had already caused some serious problems, especially in collaborating with international and local FOSS communities. As many countries now also recognize the importance of FOSS development, and are starting or planning to start their governmental FOSS projects, it is critical that the related legal structures are examined and updated to facilitate FOSS development.

This section is a derivative work of its Mandarin version co-authored by Rong-chi Chang and Chingyuan Huang, former colleagues of the OSSF, Institution of Information Science, Academia Sinica. 

; [[w:Copyleft|Copyleft]] 
: Proposed by [[w:free software|free software]] advocates, copyleft is an alternative framework conceived within copyright law which usually confers exclusive rights to copyright holders and thus limits access to the work by all others. Authors may want to “copyleft” their works to grant certain rights to people who are interested in distributing or modifying their works, provided these people will also “copyleft” all the derivative works. Although copyright and copyleft might represent very different ideas regarding the relationship between authors and their works, copyleft is not against copyright law. On the contrary, without the rights granted by the copyright law, authors will not have the power to copyleft their works. Please also refer also to the definition provided by the Free Software Foundation at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html . 

; [[w:Copyright|Copyright]] 
: A bundle of rights regarding the use of a creative expression (including literary works, music compositions, movies, paintings, software, and the like) that the law grants exclusively to the author. Copyright is applied to a work upon its creation. Except for the limitation set by copyright law, any use of a work without the copyright holder’s consent is regarded as an infringement. Note that copyright law protects only the expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves. 

; Copyright Holder 
: The individual or legal entity who is entitled to exclusive rights under copyright law. It is usually said that copyright law aims to protect authors of creative works. But since most of the rights protected are treated as property rights and may be transferred, many copyright holders are not the authors of the works themselves but their employers or those who have commissioned these works. 

; Derivative Work 
: Copyright law is applied to every work once it is created. With the consent of the copyright holder, one can use this (original) work to create derivative works. For example, a newer version of a program might contain all or part of the code of the earlier version. Thus the newer version is a derivative work of the earlier version. Translation of a document is also regarded as a type of derivative work. 

; Distribution/Redistribution :Distribution of the copies of a work is also an exclusive right granted to the copyright holder. In FOSS licenses, all receivers of copies of a program are allowed to make further distributions. The term redistribution may be used when emphasizing that the distributor has received the program from somewhere and is distributing further. 

; Fair Use 
: Copyright law seeks to maintain a balance between private and public interests. “Fair use” is developed to limit excessive copyright protection and to allow the general public greater access to copyrighted works. When a work is used without the consent of the copyright holder for purposes of criticism, comments, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research, such use might not be considered an infringement. Though copyright may differ in different jurisdictions, usually the following factors are considered by the court in deciding whether a case falls under fair use or is an infringement: 
:* The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes. 
:* The nature of the copyrighted work. 
:* The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. 
:* The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 

; First-sale Doctrine
: The first-sale doctrine is an exception of copyright law that is codified in Section 109 of the [[w:United states copyright law|US Copyright Act]]. Similar doctrines may be also be adopted by other countries. The doctrine allows the person who purchased a legally acquired copy of a copyrighted work to further distribute (including sell, rent or give away) the copy without permission from the copyright holder. But the first-sale doctrine does not apply to phono-records and computer software. 

; License 
: A license is a legal document that copyright holders may adopt to regulate how people can use their works. Users are often required to accept the terms and conditions of a license as a prerequisite to their use of the copyrighted works. 

; Multiple Licensing 
: The copyright holder of a work can have various ways of making use of his/her work available to others. The terms and conditions she would want users to accept may differ from case to case. For example, the copyright holder of an editor software may be willing to issue an academic license that is cheaper and more affordable for students, while commercial licenses are adopted when the program is sold to commercial entities. A copyright holder can also decide to license a work under both FOSS licenses and proprietary licenses to achieve different purposes. 

; Public Domain 
: The term public domain is used to describe all creative works that are not protected by copyright law and can therefore be used freely. Works that are in the public domain might be cultural heritage that came to existence before copyright law, or works that were once protected but whose copyright has expired, or works for which their copyright holder decides not to claim copyright. In the latter case, the disclaimer must be made explicitly. In some countries, a signed written document deposited with a national registrar may even be required. Works that are licensed under FOSS licenses are still copyrighted and do not fall into this category. 

; [[w:Source Code|Source Code]] 
: Source code is written in special kinds of languages designed for programming. A program in its source code form might not be easy for lay people to understand, but it is comprehensible to trained programmers. When the source code is converted to machine readable form, even programmers will have difficulty understanding and modifying the program. Therefore, access to the source code is a prerequisite for the development of FOSS and a principle embraced in all FOSS licenses. A more detailed explanation of “source code” can be found in the Glossary of the introductory primer, Free/Open Source Software, A General Introduction, which is available online at http://www.iosn.net/downloads/foss_primer_current.pdf

; Sub-license 
: When a copyright holder licenses her work to someone else, she can also choose to allow the licensee to sublicense the work. That is, when the licensee distributes the work, within the scope of rights granted by the licensor, the licensee is not only a (re)distributor but also a licensor of a sub-license between her and the other party (licensee of a sub-license). However, most FOSS licenses do not grant people the right to sub-license. For example, A is the copyright holder of X program. B receives a copy of X and distributes more copies. C receives the copy from B. If A does not grant B the right to sub-license, both B and C receive the license directly from A. If A grants the right B to sub-license program X, within the scope of the rights granted by A, B may start a new license and him/herself become a (sub)licensor of program X. 

; Warranty Disclaimer 
: Warranty is a guarantee made by the vendor against potential liabilities arising from the use of a product. All FOSS licenses come with a warranty disclaimer. Such clauses are designed to protect the author of FOSS programs, for these programs are licensed without royalty and changes might be added in its development. However, although FOSS programs themselves are royalty-free and disclaim warranty, vendors of FOSS programs can always provide their customers with a warranty and various kinds of supports for a fee. 
: Another reason why licenses of community distributions may not include warranty clauses may be because developers are expected to understand the code and fix the bugs, and are invited and expected to take on some responsibility as a member of the community. However, in commercial distribution, it is unreasonable to expect customers to be capable to read and change the code. In some countries, failure to provide minimum guarantee will lead to consumer protection issues</text>

== Original Author ==
Shun-ling Chen did her master degrees in law both at [[w:National Taiwan University|National Taiwan University]] and [[w:Harvard Law School|Harvard Law School]]. Her research interests and political commitments have been mainly about how self-organized social agencies are able to instigate driving forces for structural transitions. She has been working with various NGOs and sees FOSS as one of such community building processes. Until the summer of [[w:2004|2004]], she was the project co-lead of [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] Taiwan and served in the OSSF{{ref|54}} project as the project manager of its Law and Policy team. 

Built with FOSS modules, OSSF is a public platform that offers free (as in free beer!) tools and spaces for FOSS community to develop their projects. The OSSF is carried out by the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

{{book title|XForms|Welcome to the XForms Tutorial and Cookbook Wikibook!}}

[[File:XForms-cover.jpg|300px|right]]

XForms is a [[w:W3C|World Wide Web Consortium]] [[w:W3C_recommendation|recommendation]] for creating web forms and web applications.   XForms is easy to learn, provides a rich user experience and does not require you to learn JavaScript.

There are many different implementations of XForms and this cookbook is designed to work with any of them.  A list of implementations is available on the [http://www.w3.org/community/xformsusers/wiki/XForms_Implementations W3C web site].

This is a collaborative project and we encourage everyone who is using XForms to contribute their complete working XForms examples.  All example programs must conform to the creative-commons-2.5 share-alike with attribution license agreement [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/].

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note: many of the examples in this wikibook still use the &quot;nodeset&quot; attribute for binding rules, groups and repeats.  Most XForms systems (Orbeon and betterForm) now use the &quot;ref&quot; attribute and may no longer support the older &quot;nodeset&quot; attributes. XSLTForms 1.0RC does not allow @ref instead of @nodeset but builds since rev.559 do support @ref where @nodeset use to be used. We will be updating the examples accordingly.&lt;/font&gt;

# '''Instructors''': please sign our [[/Guest Registry/]] if you are using this book for learning or teaching XForms.
# '''Contributors''': please see our [[/Naming Conventions/]] to ensure your examples are consistent with the textbook.
# If you are looking for a specific example program, please feel free to use the [[/Examples Wanted/]] section.

If you feel these examples are useful please create links to this site.  This book has over 30 contributors.

:&quot;I want to learn film making.  Why can't I just grab a camera and begin filming?&quot;

:You can... but your movie will look like the movies from Troma Studios.

:Rent any of the movies directed by [[v:Lloyd Kaufman|Lloyd Kaufman]] such as '''''Sgt. Kabukiman''''' to learn what can go wrong. 

==Education - Teaching yourself to be a filmmaker==

&quot;Should I learn '''one''' step extremely well... or should I learn '''all''' the steps of film making?&quot;  This depends on where you will make your movies.   See [[../The Basic Basics/]] for a list of all the steps of making a motion picture.

===In Hollywood -- Specialization===

To work in Hollywood, you need to learn only '''one''' step but you must learn it very well.  An example is '''Cinematography'''.  It takes a lifetime to become good at cinematography so if you are going to become a cinematographer in Hollywood, you must specialize exclusively in cinematography and practice, practice, practice on every student film in Los Angeles.

;Recommended Education
:Read the trade journals for the field you want to specialize in.  That is, for cinematography, read [http://www.theasc.com/magazine ''American Cinematographer''] magazine.  For special effects, read [http://www.cinefex.com ''Cinefex''] magazine.  For acting, read [http://www.backstage.com ''Backstage West''].  (Note:  And, of course, to become a studio executive, you need to read ''Weekly Variety'' or [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com ''Hollywood Reporter''].)

===Theater Groups, A Group Effort===

If you are not in Hollywood (or Bollywood or Eiga Mura in Kyoto, etc.), you can form a film group (just like a theater group) and make your own motion pictures.  In a theater group, there is some specialization but, in general, each person helps in '''all''' departments.  A good example of a theater group is [http://www.rppfilms.com/index.php Renegade Possums Productions].

If you are going to be part of a local theater group that makes motion pictures, you need to learn more than one skill.

One important theater group is the high school or college drama department.  In the future, I hope that all high schools will produce an annual motion picture.  To do this, the drama instructor must be able to teach the kids the 20 different steps of making a motion picture. Wikiversity is starting a film making course to teach high school drama departments how to make motion pictures.  See [[v:Course:Basic Filmmaking for High School Drama Departments | Wikiveristy]] for the first lesson on script writing for high school drama departments.

;Recommended Education
:Start by getting everyone together and watch film dailies (unedited scenes showing how a scene was filmed) for television dramas to see how scenes are broken down into a series of shots and filmed efficiently.  Anyone can learn but you must practice to become efficient.  Once everyone sees the procedure, it is easy to mimic.  One source of film dailies is [http://www.starmovieshop.com/pages/disk2.htm Disk #02] from the Star Movie Shop which contains 24 '''unedited''' scenes so you can see how these scenes were broken down into a series of shots for filming. Once a scene is broken down into a series of shots, it is no longer such a frightening process.

===Film making Families, A Great Source of Slave Labor===

[[Image:XPepSquad-poster.jpg|left|100px|Steve Balderson's First Feature]]

The next smaller unit is the family.  The secret to their success is you don't have to pay relatives and they cannot quit.  Also, they don't leave in the middle of your movie to go to Hollywood.  (When you read about low-budget filmmaking, you will see that half of these productions loose at least one actor in the middle of their shoot.)  An excellent example is the '''Balderson family'''.  They have completed three motion pictures, their most famous one being ''Firecracker'' with Karen Black.  It takes them many years to make each motion picture in Wamego, Kansas.  To learn how they did this, purchase their documentary called [http://www.dikenga.com ''Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere''].  (The posters are from his movies.)

;Recommended Education
:If your family is going to make a motion picture, you need to learn '''all''' the skills of filmmaking, not just one or two.  The best place to start is to buy books on independent filmmaking.

===The Home Animation Studio===

The advantage of creating a motion picture via animation is you can skip the horrors of movie production and use your computer plus a few voice actors to create a motion picture. However, making your own animated movies means you have to learn '''all''' the steps of both animation and post production.

====2D Animation====
2D animation does not necessarily mean '''cartoons'''.  But to save drawing time, you can use many of the techniques of cartoon animation.

;Recommended 2D Animation Education
:Start by looking at [http://www.toonboom.com/products/toonBoomStudioExpress/ Toon Boom Studio Express].  There are easier 2D animation program but it is worth downloading the free 30-day trial of Toon Boom Studio Express which helps you get started with tutorials and templates. Also look at [http://www.e-frontier.com/article/articleview/1915/1/795?sbss=795 Anime Studio].

====3D Animation====
:Currently, creating a motion picture with digital actors using 3D software such as [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=7635018 Maya], [http://www.newtek.com/lightwave/ LightWave], [http://www.blender.org/ Blender], and [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=5659302&amp;siteID=123112 3D Studio Max] is surprisingly difficult because all the 3D software for doing character animation is still very primitive.   As an example, the skeletons of 3D animated actors do not have rib cages.  Therefore, the characters cannot breathe.  Watch [http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808410706/info ''Polar Express''] to experience what it feels like to watch 3D actors hold their breath for the entire movie.

;Recommended 3D Animation Education
:Watch movies which have been made with 3D animation programs.  Then start by getting the free educational version of Maya called [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=7639525 Maya Personal Learning Edition].  This disk is given away at most trade shows which is easier than downloading on slow computers.  Most importantly, go to the next [http://www.siggraph.org Siggraph Conference] to see all the fun toys for creating professional motion pictures with 3D animation.

====Digital Puppets====
Digital puppets are the inexpensive 3D characters developed for  Poser which are sometimes called &quot;Poser&quot; figures even though some also work with DAZ Studio.  These 3D figures are normally used for still artwork. The quality of these figures is absolutely amazing, far better than most characters in Maya, Lightwave and 3D Studio.  The problem with digital puppets is the lack of good animation software.  I think the animation portion of Poser is awkward but the new version has some interesting features.  DAZ Studio has very little animation capability. Note that these figures for Poser are incompatible with Maya, Lightwave and 3D Studio Max.

;Recommended Education
:Start by downloading the free [http://www.daz3d.com/studio DAZ Studio].  Look at [http://www.e-onsoftware.com/products/vue Vue] or [http://www.daz3d.com/program/bryce/55index.php Bryce 5.5] for the background scenery.  With Vue, start by looking at [http://www.e-onsoftware.com/products/?page=try Vue 6 Easel].  (Note: Bryce 5.5 is [http://www.daz3d.com/program/bryce/bryce5free.php free] from DAZ but is about 130 megs to download.  Poser 5 might still be free from eFrontier.)   Then look at the digital puppets from [http://www.runtimedna.com Runtime DNA].  I prefer the digital figures from artist Lady Littlefox ([http://www.lynescreations.com/koshini.htm Koshini], Ichiro, Krystal, Kiki) because they are good looking but not too realistic which would make them hard to animate.  If you are horny, young male, look at [http://www.runtimedna.com/mod/bcs/index.php?sku=DNA%2D026 LaRoo 2]. Clothing is optional.  You might also need a compositing program (so you can animate the human figures in DAZ Studio or Poser and then, to speed up production, create the background scenery as still images in Vue or Bryce and finally composite the images together with AfterEffects using a multiplane camera effect.)

===Rural Film Studio===

There is one kind of studio which is half way between a Hollywood film studio and a local theater group.  To work in these studios, you need to learn one skill very well as if you are working a studio in Hollywood.

The best example of a rural film studio is Robert Rodriguez's '''Troublemaker Studios'''.  When George Lucas moved away from Hollywood and was successful, people considered this a fluke.  Every time Pixar Studios creates wonderful stories, people are not sure if this is just the magic of Steve Jobs or the good, clean air of Northern California next door to Lucas.  But Robert Rodriguez in Austin, Texas proves that someone who is familiar with the filmmaking methods used in Hollywood can move to a remote location and produce more interesting movies than are made in Hollywood.

Start by looking at Robert Rodriguez' famous short Bedhead.  Can you do what Robert did when he was a kid?  If not, you need to learn more of the steps of making a motion picture.  Robert learned them all at an early age.  And be sure to read his book ''Rebel without a Crew'' which should be required reading at all film schools.

;Recommended Education
:To follow the path of Robert Rodriguez, start by buying a camcorder and practicing filming dramatic scenes.  To understand how to film a scene, look at lots of unedited scenes with scripted dialog.  Then practice editing scenes which you can get through the Wikiversity Film School.

==The Traditional Ways to Learn Film making==

If you want to learn film making the traditional way, you can becoming a Production Assistant or go to Film school.

===Become a PA===

You will learn a lot about film making by becoming a Production Assistant on motion pictures or even student films.  To do this, you must go to LA or to New York.  A typical situation is the [http://www.troma.com/jobs/internships internship with Troma Studios] in New York.  In Hollywood, read [http://www.backstage.com Back Stage West] each week for all jobs on student films in the LA area, not just acting.  You can find Backstage West each week at every newsstand in Hollywood.

:Note: There is no pay!!!   So bring a lot of money from home.  In Hollywood, you will need it.

===Film School===

Film school allows you to concentrate on film making 24 hours a day for four years.  It gives you the chance to interact with people who have a similar interest.  That is what makes film school special.  The problem is film school costs from $40,000 to $100,000 (including the cost of your student film.)  Before you go and spend that much money, it might be a good idea to visit a movie set for a couple days and try editing scenes from real television dramas or motion pictures to see if this is really what you want to do.

Either way, most of your learning will be done in the library rather than in the classroom or on the set. Film making encompasses literature and all the arts, and one must at least have a basic knowledge of these forms to understand the craft of film making (additionally, some film makers have studied other subjects in university).

==Teach Yourself The Technology of Film Making==

If you cannot afford to go to Hollywood or go to film school, you can teach yourself by using a personal computer and professional quality software.  Today, most of the tools used in Hollywood are available on your personal computer.  If you want to learn the technology of making a motion picture, all you have to learn to use the computer programs that the pros use. 

;Warning
:There are many classes offered in computer software such as Avid and Final Cut Pro editing programs.  If you want to learn to use a $50,000 computer system, it makes sense to go to a class rather than buy the software.  But now that Final Cut X costs about $300, it makes absolutely no sense to go to a class at [http://www.uclaextension.edu/index.cfm?href=/courseListings/CategoryListings.cfm&amp;heading_code=N00176&amp;dept=Entertainment%20Studies&amp;parent=none&amp;node_text=urlencodedformat('Entertainment%20Studies) UCLA Extension on Final Cut Pro] which costs $999.  And they don't even teach you to edit dramatic scenes with scripted dialog.  It makes more sense to buy the program and teach yourself.  Yes, it is true that using the tutorial for Final Cut Pro is a little like Medieval torture.  Yet, it does work.  Slowly you begin to master all the functions of the program.

:Similarly, it makes no sense to go to a local Junior College for a digital video class if all they give you is the same tutorial you get free from Apple.  Just buy the program and begin learning.  (See more about learning film editing below.)

If you want to master all of film making technology, there are 20 programs that you need to learn.  Fortunately, you can often download '''fully working demonstration programs''' as well as lots of free '''tutorials''' to help you learn.  You don't need to go to school for this.  You just need determination, a good computer and lots of time.

====Which Model To Buy====

For beginners, I recommend the iMac with the 24 inch screen or a laptop computer: either the MacBook or the MacBook Pro.  The Mac mini is an interesting option but it costs the same as a MacBook.  Note: You need to buy a complete hardware package.  This can be a bit confusing... so get help from someone who really knows.  This includes extra disk drives and lots of RAM.   I do not recommend the wireless keyboard for your first keyboard.

===Career Paths===

This section grew too large so it is now in its own page at [[Movie Making Manual/Education2|Teach Yourself A Career]].  This page will show you how you can learn on your own to learn a career in filmmaking.

==Graduation and Diploma==

When you are ready to go to Hollywood (or Bollywood), create a demo reel.  When you graduate from film school, you receive a diploma and your student film.  Most film studios don't think much of either student films or diplomas.  Neither one will get you a job.  They much rather look at your demo reel.

===Demo Reel===

If you want a job in film editing, film composing, 3D modeling and animation, DVD-Video authoring, acting, and sound effects, potential employers want to see a demo reel.  Long ago, this used to be video tape but now this means a DVD-Video disk.  You will need a DVD-Video authoring program such as [http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd iDVD] which is free with all new Macintosh computers.

;Film Editing Demo Reel
:To create a demo reel for film editing, you need unedited scenes.  eBay is occasionally a good source of original film dailies but make sure they are first generation so they can be digitized properly.  Currently, there are no other sources of digitized film dailies.  &quot;Highlander Uncut&quot; is no longer available and the Star Movie Shop is now closed to the public.  You can take the courses at the Wikiversity Film School where they loan you disks of film dailies.  These are the original Film Editing Workshop disks from the Star Movie Shop.

;Film Scoring Demo Reel
:To create a demo reel for film editing, you need edited scenes with the dialog and the sound effects but not the music.  I do not know of any source of edited scenes with the music removed.  Anyone know of any other source of great scenes with no music track?

== Slight inaccuracy ==

Perhaps I am being a little pedantic but C++ is considered a middle-level language (as is C) because of the low-level functionality that is accessible to both. This is almost implied in the existing statement: &quot;C++ is beginning to be grouped with lower level languages like C&quot; but I feel more clarity is perhaps needed?

[[User:64ByteKiller|64ByteKiller]] ([[User talk:64ByteKiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/64ByteKiller|contribs]]) 13:04, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

:It depends, the notion about how high or low a language isn't exact at all, it is best used as an indication in comparisons that to attempt to cram the language in a slot, X is higher or lower than Y makes more sense than strictly defining X as a low, meddle or high level language especially since these concept are always in flux. Add to that imprecision the use of virtual machines and bytecode it can get even more complicated.&lt;br&gt;
:In a world that where a large number of population (not strictly profession programmers, think as the target reader of the book) is more comfortable with languages like python or C# type languages (I said comfortable in terms of access, familiarity), that even Java seems to old new. Stating that they are increasingly seeing C and C++ at the equal level of capability is correct, even technically, since the thing that makes C++ specifically distinct from C is the inclusion on the OSs of the runtime library. The practical distinctions are becoming also eroded, today you can even have objects in C. Yet I would feel better mixing ASM and C than C and C++ (if attempting to cram them in a slot).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:48, 8 August 2012 (UTC)</text>

Many books have been written about hiking in the Canadian Rockies, particularly in Alberta and eastern British Columbia (technically the &quot;Rocky Mountains&quot; don't extend that far). This book is an attempt to organise and describe hikes in and around the Canadian Rockies, using other books only for specific and non-copyrighted information (i.e. Trail length, altitude, etc.) It will be primarily organised by area and then difficulty, so that one who wants to find one's self a hike one can do so with ease.

==Quick Reference==
#[[/Day Hikes/]]
#[[/Overnight Hikes/]]
#[[/Hike Index/]]
#[[/Bibliography/]]

==How to use this book==
This book is for anyone wanting to hike in the Canadian Rockies. Use the list below to sort first by day hike and overnight, then by area, then difficulty. I will eventually make an index of all the hikes. Also, all hikes i have done personally will be marked at the beginning of the description with a '''PD''' (personal description)

Please bear in mind that all hikes will doable without climbing equipment. Some scrambling may be required at certain times for the more advanced hikes.

===Rating Hikes===
Hikes will be rated in 4 major categories:
* '''Beginner''' - the mildest of hikes
* '''Intermediate''' - not particularly difficult, but more than a walk in the park.
* '''Advanced''' - These are the most difficult of hikes that don't include mountains.
* '''Mountain''' - These all involve conquering mountains, but because some are easier than others, they will be sub-rated Beginner, intermediate and advanced. NOTE: a beginner mountain is NOT a beginner hike. The easiest mountain is at the least an intermediate hike.

==Before Hiking==
If you are a new hiker, and are unsure of what to do or take along, read on. If you have experience in hiking, and are using this book only for new hikes, then you can ignore this section.
(NOTE: this applies mostly to day hiking. for overnight hiking, be sure you have all the proper gear.)

===Weather===
Weather can make or break a hike. Be sure to check local weather forecasts, and pack accordingly. Even if there is the slightest chance of rain, you should bring along rain gear, especially if you're planning a longer hike. Don't climb mountains in a thunderstorm, and be sure that you can get in and out of where you are going, especially in winter. Also, be aware that the higher you go, the colder it gets, no matter the temperature

===Clothing===
Clothing usually depends on the weather (see above) but a few staple items are key:
* '''Sturdy hiking boots''' - are recommended for all but the easiest of hikes.
* '''Warm jacket''' - usually a fleece jacket, cotton not recommended, but it's better than nothing.
* '''Windbreaker''' - this is only really necessary if you are going up high where there is a lot of wind exposure.
* '''Hat''' - sun hat for sun, toque or some other warm hat for winter and cold conditions (up high)
* '''Sunglasses''' - even if it's overcast it's always good to have these along. Especially if there's snow around.
* '''Gloves''' - only when it's cold, highly recommended in the winter.
* '''Daypack''' - for all your stuff! 

===Food===
It is always a wise idea to take along food to eat, just make sure you pack all garbage with you. Always, ALWAYS bring water along. Although some fresh springs and glacier runoff may be clean enough to drink, rivers can contain bacteria that can make you very sick. Some suggestions for food might include GORP (good old raisins and peanuts) and variations, chocolate, energy bars and fruit (all things with high energy, and relatively low fat).

===Wildlife===
====Dangerous Wildlife====
There is always a chance of meeting an unfriendly animal while hiking in the mountains. In most cases, the best way to prevent this is to stay away from areas marked for recent bear or cougar activity, and to travel in bigger groups (i.e. 6 or more people). Bear spray can be purchased at many stores. Most encounters can be avoided simply by making noise from time to time, calling out every minute or so.
=====What to do if you encounter a bear/cougar=====
If you encounter a grizzly bear (big, brown, with hump between the shoulders) stop where you are. Slowly walk backwards until out of sight, then turn and walk (don't run) back the way you came. Notify any hikers you pass of your encounter.
If in the rare case that a bear is aggressive and runs at you, do not turn and run. If you don't have pepper spray, lie on your stomach and cover the back of your neck with your hands. The bear will eventually become uninterested and leave.

If you encounter a cougar while hiking, place your backpack or (if you are hiking with children) or your head or shoulders, and make yourself look big. Back away slowly and return the way you came, notifying other hikers you pass. Cougars are generally not aggressive towards humans, and if you make lots of noise they generally will stay away.

====Non-Aggressive Wildlife====
Deer, elk, mountain goats and many species of birds and rodent wildlife frequent the Rockies. Although normally docile, males can become aggressive in mating season, and females can become aggressive if you happen between her and her young. Be cautious, but not paranoid. Always give animals distance, and approach cautiously. If the animal refuses to yield to you, it's best to go around.

====Pests====
Insects are always a nuisance. Mosquito repellent is highly recommended (except in the winter months). If you are hiking in areas with ticks, make sure you check yourself after the hike, especially around the sock line, collar and waist. Bees, wasps, and hornets are also sometimes a problem, so be sure to check your sugary beverage before drinking.

===Pets===
If you are planning to bring your dog along, make sure your dog doesn't tend to run after things. There are lots of things to chase in the mountains, including bears. If you trust your dog, then by all means, bring it along, your dog will love the mountains just as much as you!

==Hikes==
Ok, now that you are ready to hike, here is the list of hikes. They are organised by area, and then by difficulty. if you are looking for a specific hike, then use the index.

===[[/Day Hikes/]]===
===[[/Overnight Hikes/]]===

North eastern Kanaskis counts for the part of Kanaskis north of the Elbow River and the Elbow-Sheep wildland provincial park, and east of Exshaw. It includes Bow Valley Provincial Park, Barrier Lake,  and the Sibbald area. It also includes the section of Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park directly north of Bow Valley Provincial Park.

== Basic tonguing ==
Unless specified in music, notes should always be tongued. At this point you should know how to produce sound. If you do not, read the previous lesson. If you do, begin by producing sound a few times. As you begin to blow each note, move your tongue as if you were saying &quot;tu&quot; (pronounced &quot;too&quot;) or &quot;du&quot; (pronounced &quot;do&quot;). Practice this until you have a smooth sound. After this, play several notes. This is done by blowing a single stream of air separated by the sylables of &quot;tu&quot;. As you practice this remember a few things: When tonguing, use the tip of your tongue to produce a clearer sound, this also prevents the sound from sounding like &quot;lu&quot;. Also listen to the sound, if the sound stops completely, you tonguing is too heavy. If this happens, just don't say the syllables as heavily.

The objective of basic tonguing is to produce notes with a clearer-sounding attack. The tongue should act like a pressure release valve, attacking each note with a strong stream of air.

== Staccato (short) tonguing ==
From the basic tonguing, change the syllable to &quot;ta&quot; or &quot;da&quot;, and cut the air stream off after half of the notes value. Do not, just lower the amount of air you use, or you will produce a ''marcato'' effect. Also, do not use too much air, or you will get a ''rinforzando'' or ''accented note''.

== Tonguings to avoid ==
Do not use &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;ma&quot; or &quot;pa&quot;. These start with the lips closed, and cause the sound to be ambiguous at the beginning of a note, which is for the most part a bad sound.

For now, do not use &quot;ku&quot; or &quot;qu&quot; (pronounced &quot;Coo&quot;) or &quot;Gu&quot; (pronounced &quot;Goo&quot;). These tonguings will be used later with double tonguing, but get used to basic tonguing first.

Don't use &quot;la&quot;, &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;sa&quot; or &quot;za&quot;. These produce a vibrato like sound. &quot;Ha&quot; is used to produce a vibrato, but don't worry about that now.

'''Labeling family photos''' is a process of identification of persons and objects captured on family pictures. Identification lets a family historian get to know ancestors’ faces and record information about family members for future generations. 

Identification of paper photos can be relatively easy since identification notes can be written on the back side and therefore are an integrated part of picture content. On the other hand, writing names and additional information on the back side does not necessarily ensure identification clarity, and especially on group photos. 
{{cleanup-list}}
Now, in the information age, digital photography brings new challenges:
* Digital photos do not have a back side. It is unlikely that someone would want to spoil paper family photos by writing identification notes directly on an image. Similarly, placing labels that cannot be hidden, if necessary, on digital pictures can be hardly a solution for a family historian.
* Digital photos are shared through different means, including blogs and email, so identification labels should be distributed together with the pictures.
* Growing number of digital photos requires search capabilities so a specific person can be found quickly.

There are a plenty of photo annotation software programs that enable users to place identification labels on digital photographs in a variety of ways. They can be divided into the following categories: 

* Tools that let a user locate and put on a photo identification labels that are “imprinted” into the image and therefore become an integrated part of the picture. The photos can be shared through various means, such as email or blogs, together the identification labels. On the other hand, since the labels are treated as a part of the image, they cannot be used for search purposes.  In addition, there is no way to disjoint from the photo meaning the identification labels cannot be hidden so an original family picture view can be spoiled. 

* Tools that allow a user to place identification labels stored in an application’s internal database. Users can use search capabilities. However, when a picture is shared or published in the Web, identification labels are lost because they remain in the internal database and cannot be distributed with the photo. 

* Online tools that enable a user to upload an image and put identification labels online. They provide features for sharing through blogs and communities. However, if such picture is downloaded to a local computer, identification labels are lost and cannot be seen. 

* Desktop tools that store identification labels in the special metadata section of the same file. This ability enables distribution of the labels together with the file regardless of how exactly it is shared – email, blogs, or publishing on a Website – and search across them. On the other hand, the identification labels can be hidden in order to view an original pure photo. The main disadvantage is support for JPEG files only so identification labels cannot be placed on GIF, BMP, and PNG files.

'''PD'''

'''Distance''' - 1.6km

'''Elevation Gain''' - 732m

===Access===
The tralhead can be accessed by driving up the Smith-Dorrien--Spray Trail (Hwy. 742), Parking in whiteman's gap, at the Goat Creek parking lot.

==The Hike==
Cross the highway and walk up the road to the canal and across the brige. The trail starts behind the hut.

An enjoyable stroll turns into a steep climb following a watercourse, with some switchbacks nearing the treeline. as you emerge onto the scree be sure to note the location of the trail exit. You can make your way up the moutain directly, or hook right and follow the easier ridge. The Carin at the top is perched right on the edge, beware.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Qwilleranfan,

Great idea for a book! One thing: if you're taking the images (maps) from a government website, it's probably a good idea to leave a link to the site where it came from. I assume the Canadian government probably has public domain laws similar to those of the U.S., but I honestly don't know. 

You've inspired me to try to write some for Pennsylvania some day... thanks! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

== Renaming pages ==

G'day, I notice you've been accidentally creating pages for your hiking book outside of the book. To bring them into the book, just click on the &quot;move&quot; tab at the top of the page, and add the chapter path in front, e.g. &quot;Hiking in the Canadian Rockies/Day Hikes/Kananaskis/South Kananaskis/&quot;. This way, you don't have to copy all the text across. Later, if other people edit a page that needs renaming, you can preserve the edit history by moving the page, something you can't do (easily) with the copy-and-paste approach. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:13, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

[[Image:Teff pluim Eragrostis tef.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Teff]]
'''Teff''', also known as '''lovegrass''', is an important food grain in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Eritrea|Eritrea]], where it is used to make [[Cookbook:injera|injera]]. Teff is also grown on a small scale for human consumption in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], and as cattle feed in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of South Africa|South Africa]]. Teff is believed to have originated in Ethiopia between 4000 BCE and 1000 BCE. Teff produces up to two-thirds of the total food provision of Ethiopia. 

Teff is the world's smallest [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|cereal]], with each grain being less than 1/32&amp;nbsp;in (0.8&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter. It takes 150 grains of teff to make up the mass of a single grain of [[cookbook:wheat|wheat]]. Due to its small size, teff has a very large percentage of its mass made up of the bran and germ of the seed, with a relatively small endosperm. It is also difficult and expensive to remove the bran and germ of such a small grain, so almost all teff products and teff flour are made of [[cookbook:whole grain|whole grain]] teff. 

The grain has a high concentration of different nutrients. This grain has a very high calcium content, and contains high levels of phosphorus, iron, copper, aluminum, barium, and thiamine. Teff is high in [[Cookbook:protein|protein]]. It is considered to have an excellent [[cookbook:amino acid|amino acid]] composition (including all 8 essential amino acids for humans) and has lysine levels higher than wheat or [[cookbook:barley|barley]]. Teff is high in [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]]s and [[cookbook:fiber|fiber]]. It [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|contains no gluten]], so it is appropriate for those with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease.

===Applications&lt;Br&gt;===

Applications for computers are a necessity for everyone and even more important for those in academia. Computer application software is an interface between the user of the computer and the operating system of the computer. This software allows an infinite number of uses for a computer. Typical computer applications would include: word processors, spreadsheets, databases, media players, presentation software, and e-mail.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processors Word processors], next to e-mail, are likely the most used computer application by students. Word prcessors allow for assignments to be legible, formatted, spell-checked, and printed. It allows students to concentrate more on the content of their projects and focus less on the grammar and spelling.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet Spreadsheets] are a necessity for all business students. Spreadsheets are used to tabulate numbers and create graphs and charts. With the built-in calculation functionality it saves students the possible errors in manual calculations and a number changed on the sheet will change all the connected numbers in real time.

Many classes now also require [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint Microsoft Powerpoint] for in class presentations. Presentation applications like PowerPoint provide a relatively simple, professional format of project presentation. By creating individual slides, a student has full control over the visual and audio aspects of their presentation.  Again this allows for more concentration on the content and less focus on the presentation display. It also allows for quick, easy, and possibly frequent changes to content.

Many educational institutions such as colleges and universities now use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal web portals] for personalized access to course materials, grades, fees as well as other information.

The most ubiquitous application not only for students and academics, but for the world at large is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail E-mail] or Electronic Mail. Though many primary and secondary schools frown on free mail services. Many of them have set their firewalls set to prevent access to these services. The schools have purchased their own domains and created their own E-mail services for their students and faculty. E-mail allows for near instant letter communication with their professors, other students, and the school administration.



==LANGUAGES==
===Programming Languages History===
The first programming language developed was FORTRAN in November 1954 which progressed to FORTRAN I in October of 1956, FORTRAN II in 1957 and a form of FORTRAN is still used today. There have been several programming languages that were created from scratch. Fortran was the first one, then there was: B-O in 1957 which transformed into the better known COBAL in 1958, LISP arrived in 1958, APL in 1960, Snobol in 1962, JOSS in 1964 which has morphed into M ANSI ISO, Forth in 1968, sh in 1969, Prolog in 1970, ML in 1973 and B in 1981. ([http://www.levenez.com/lang/history.html#03 ref#1]). All other marketed languages can have their history traced back to one or more of these languages at some point in time.

===HTML===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML HTML] or &quot;Hyper Text Markup Language&quot; a programming language mostly used in the creation of Web Pages. A markup language simply denotes a form of programming in which there is text with extra information relating to that text. With HTML this is accomplished by using tags, which are commands in brackets like &lt;&gt;. Putting a B in the brackets before the text and a /b in brackets after the text will &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; that text. HTML gained wide acceptance in the creation of web pages because it is simple to use and understand. Most of the web is primarily text based.

===XML===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml XML]or &quot;Extesible Markup Language&quot; is an advancement over HTML. It has had a tremendous impact on the internet, surfing and the transmission of data. It allows two computers to communicate with each other. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29 RSS]or Really Simple Syndication allows for applications to update automatically when updated by the webmaster. This incredibly powerful feature has helped the expansion of blogs (web logs) which are frequently used as online diaries and vblogs (video web logs) which are blgs with a video component.

===JAVA===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 Java] is a programming language that allows interactive web pages. It is has its language taken from C and C++ but is much more simpler. With Java animation is also relatively easily done.

==OS==
===OS Classifications===
There are several types of Operating Systems which can be catagorized. &lt;b&gt;Multi-user&lt;/b&gt; operating systems two or more users to run programs at the same time. Mount Royal College uses a multi-user operating system for the school. It can handle hundreds, if not thousands of concurrent users. A &lt;b&gt;Multiprocessing&lt;/b&gt; OS can allow a single program to run on more than one CPU. &lt;b&gt;Multitasking&lt;/b&gt; OS's allows more than one program to be running at the same time. &lt;b&gt;Multithreading&lt;/b&gt; allows for different parts of the same program to be running concurrently. And finally, &lt;b&gt;Real Time&lt;/b&gt; operating systems have an instant response to input.

===Current Implementation===
Everyone is aware of operating systems and their function to translate applications into instructions that the computer can understand. However, operating systems are much more prevelant than most people suspect. They now persist not only in laptops or desktops, but in a wide variety of other devices. Operating systems have extreme versatility, especially with today's technologies. They also have large scaleability, which means that operating systems can be simplified greatly or have features even the programmers may not be aware of. Operating systems now are used on routers, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) and mobile phones as well as a multitude of other computers including laundry machines and refridgerators. This does make sense as the computer in a typical modern cell phone is now more powerful than a desktop computer from 20 years ago. It also allows for customization of cellphones such as individualized rings and wallpapers.

===Security===
Current operating systems have numerous 'holes' in their programming. These vulnerabilities make it possible for people to 'attack' and/or use your computer with, or more commonly without, your knowledge. Microsoft has well documented weaknesses, but that could have much to do with the number of users who are interested in the operating system, and the amount of attention it receives since it is the most common operating systemin the world. There are methods to close these holes. One of the newer abilities of well known operating systems is the ability to update the software either manually or automatically. These updates are normally downloaded to your computer from the internet and installed on your computer, basically changing the structure of the programming to make the operating system more secure. Another option is a program like Norton anti virus. It is one of the most common, but there are many other choices the consumer has the ability to choose from. Anti viruses protects your computer from outside dangers, such as hackers and scammers to viruses. A hacker can log onto your computer and see all your personal information, and possible have access to even your banking information. Viruses are common in today's world, they come from recieving files, downloading things off the internet, or even visiting certain sites. Virus programs work with your operating systems starting up when you start the computer and constantly check everything the computer does for anything that might be a threat.

==Hardware==
===Tape Drives===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive Tape drives] research began in 1949 by IBM. The whole process was to find a suitable replacement for punch cards. The necessities being the replacement should be compact, faster, cheaper and reusable. The big difference between a tape drive and a audio cassette tape is in the machinery. The drives themselves are much quicker and more accurate than a home cassette player. The tapes store data in a continuous string of bits, also known as, sequential data, and the need to find a particular part of the information that is being searched for requires a mechanically efficient and accurate machine. They are able to fast-forward and rewind to a particular spot on the tape with high speed and accuracy. This is the image of the large reel-to-reel machines seen in old television and movies, and are still used today for their cost effectiveness for backups. Backups are the recording of data from a computer hard drive to another secondary storage device. Although compact discs are gaining in popularity, tape drives are still widely available. The improvement in tape drives has been dramatic since their inception. The original tape drive, IBM 701 Tape Drive, could store 100 bpi (bits per inch), run at a speed of 70 ips (inches per second) and could be as long as 1400 feet. Since then tapes have evolved to run 200, 556, 800, 1600, and even 6250 bpi. They run at greater speeds than original, and have lengths up to 3600 feet. Tape drives were at their prime up until the 1990's. Then the flexibility, speed, and storage abilities of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Computer_Revolution/Hardware/Storage#hard_drive hard drives] overtook tape drives. As mentioned earlier, tape drives are still available, but are now relegated to inexpensive backups of vast amounts of data.

===Wireless Mouse===

The classical wired mouse, although it has changed connectors to the computer, is still the most used type of mouse. However, the new wireless technologies are allowing for wireless mice to become more prevelant.

Most wireless mice use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency radio frequency] (RF) technologies to communicate information to your computer. The RF technology used is frequently the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth Bluetooth] technology. It doesn't matter whether the mouse uses normal RF technology or the standards associated with Bluetooth. Each requires two main components: a transmitter and a receiver. Here's how they work:

1. The transmitter is housed in the mouse. It sends an electromagnetic (radio) signal that encodes the information (possibly by Bluetooth) about the mouse's movements and the buttons you click.

2. The receiver, which is connected to your computer, accepts the signal, decodes it and passes it on to the mouse driver software and your computer's operating system.

3. The receiver can be a separate device that plugs into your computer, a special card that you place in an expansion slot, or a built-in component. Many laptop computers now come with built-in Bluetooth capabilities.

One of the biggest advantages of radio frequency over another well tested technolgy for short distance wireless communications, infrared, is the lack of need for a line-of-site transmission. Radio frequencies work in a sphere from the transmitter.

An important note to wireless mice is the necessity of being &quot;paired&quot; with it's receiver. Pairing means that the devices are both operating on the same frequency, same channel, and use a common identification code. The reason pairing is so important is to filter out interference from RF devices and other sources.



==Networks==
===Backbones===

In 1987 the National Science Foundation (NSF) created the NSFNET (National Science Foundation NETwork)which was the first hight-speed network backbone in 1987. There were 170 smaller networks that were connected by a T1 line and was able to transmit at the incredible speed of 1.544 Mbps). This speed is fantastic due to the fact that most modems of the time operated at 300bps, if a computer had a modem. Although the National Science Foundation began the projoct it worked closely with IBM, MCI and Merit. In 1988, in cooperation, these companies developed a 45Mbps backbone. This is known as a T3 line.

Backbones are the basic infrastructure of the internet. They are high speed lines that directly connect large hubs, companies and academic institutes. Typically trunk line backbones are made of fibre optic cables. Many of these fibre optic cables are bundled together to increase capacity. The rating system for fibreobtic cables is designated with OC for optical carrier. For example an OC-3 has a transmitting capacity of 155Mbps whereas an OC-48 can transmit 2488Mbps (2.488Gbps). An OC-48 is about 44,430 times faster than a standard 56Kbps modem still available today. This huge network of backbones between countries governments, educational institutions, research institutions and companies operate their own backbones which interconnect. The entire network is a gigantic agreement between these institutions sprawling around the world allowing the freedom of intercommunication.


==A.I.==
===Diagnosis===

A form of artificial intelligence is being used more and more frequently in diagnosis. There are all types of areas where A.I. can determine whether the behaviour of different systems is correct. Initially, the easiest systems for computer intelligence to calculate whether systems are being run to specifications is other computers. Automobiles are a prime example of this. There are increasing numbers of sensors for every new model year in automobiles. A computer can be plugged in and, after copying the information recorded by the sensors, make a determination as to any problems that fall outside the normal range of use. It is important for computer system algorithms to be able to determine which part of a system is failing, where that part is located, the type of fault in the part and many systems now provide the steps to fix the problems. All diagnosis is based on observations which are taken by different sensors.

A major determinant to the effectiveness of A.I. to accurately diagnose problems is the base of knowledge it works with. The number of variables involved in even simple diagnoses like an automobile are large. Then for each variable there is a different weight applied to each. Then each weight can change over time. These calculations become more and more complex the more variable the subject. The initial knowledge usually comes from people who are experts in a particular field. However one of the major tasks of the creation of A.I. is the development of intuition which mankind is able to utilize.

In time it is likely that artificial intelligence will be able to diagnoses with a high degree of accuracy, not only technical systems with the necessary number of sensors, but organic matter as well. Walk into a doctors office and let the wall know how you are feeling. Next thing you know the room speaks to you and tells you both your diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.


==Databases==
===Data Mining===

Data Mining is a process that uses rules of association with the collection of vast amounts of data. It incorportates statistics, data collection and recognition of patterns and trends. The most common type of data mining today is the use of programs within programs that record computer habits, websites visited and much more information about both the user and computer. The analysis of the data provides profiles that are used by all kinds of organizations. Frequently the programs to do the data mining are included in purchased software and downloaded software. However it is also frequently installed on a computer through the use of a virus or worm or other such malicious tool.

There is no inherant danger to data mining. It is the use of the information that is most troubling. When such techniques can include information like credit card numbers and bank accounts there is an obvious troubling potential for the use of the date. What is meant by no inherant danger is the software data mining collection does not damage a computer, it just records what the computer is doing.

One of the major reasons for collecting such vast amounts of infomation is for resale. Different on-line merchants would like to know where and when each online shopper is spending their money. Then they can use that informatio to direct their marketing and timing to a more dedicated market.

The data that is mined, or collected, can come from a vast array of sources. As stated above, the most common form of data mining is the infection of a computer. It can also be extracted from POS (Point Of Sale) transactions, all kinds of data bases, online resources, articles, etc. Although this is an easy way to gather information there is also off-line sources and databases that can be included through the old-style manual data entry.

[edit] Data

Meta-Data is data about data; it describes how and when and by whom a particular set of data was collected and how it’s formatted. Meta-Data is essential for understanding information stored in data warehouse

[edit] Warehouse

Data warehouse is a special database of cleaned up data and Meta-data. Both the data and the Meta-Data are sent to the data warehouse.


==E-Commerce==
===Paypal===

Paypal is a third party e-commerce company. They are capable of debiting and crediting credit cards and bank accounts for those with an account. Although credit card or banking information is not required for all services Paypal provides, they are required for many of them. Paypal is one of the world's primary methods of online payment with more than 100 million accounts worldwide.

Paypal allows for online payments for individuals and businesses to transfer funds electronically and securely. There is powerful encryption software that is used to allow people to make these financial transactions. The funds that are transferred by paypal are held in a Paypal account until the person with control of the account specifies what are to be done with the balance. They can be credited to the credit cards or bank accounts set up with the paypal account, or can be used for other puchases and transactions through the paypal system.

Paypal is especially good for use on online auctions, purchases of goods and services, or to make donations. It is a secure third party operator which limits the amount of personal information that must be passed around for normal internet transactions. The only information that is given is a paypal account number and all financial transactions are accomplished by paypal. It can even sent cash.

There is now some competition to Paypal such as &quot;C2it&quot; and &quot;Certa Pay&quot; (A canadian company).


=== Repetitive Strain Injury ===
Also commonly known by &quot;RSI&quot;, Repetitive Strain Injuries are the result of repeated physical movements which can damage tendons, nerves, muscles and other soft body tissures. There is no limitation on the occupations which this sydrome is related to. It can be anybody form musicians, to computer techs, to factory workers.

When it comes to computers these injuries seem to be causing an epidemic directly related to the increase in computer use. Especially affecting the hands, arms, and shoulders. One of the main culprets of Repetitive Strain Injuries is the use of a mouse or trackballs. If there is an initial injury, draging the mouse slowly actually increases the damage. There is also a problem with the thousands of repeated keystrokes which work the same muscles in the same way over and over, causing the injury. The typing technique and body position is extremely important. Incorrect positioning leads to unnecessary stress on the tendons and nerves in the hand, wrist, arms, and even the shoulders and neck. Lack of adequate rest and breaks and using excessive force almost guarantee trouble.

What are the Symptoms?
  1) Tightness, discomfort, stiffness, soreness or burning in the hands, wrists, fingers, forearms, or elbows

  2) Tingling, coldness, or numbness in the hands

  3) Clumsiness or loss of strength and coordination in the hands

  4) Pain that wakes you up at night

  5) Feeling a need to massage your hands, wrists, and arms

  6) Pain in the upper back, shoulders, or neck associated with using the computer.

==Object Oriented Programming==

===Object Oriented Programming===

OOP (Object Oriented Programming)uses objects which are self-contained items that have a data type, a data structue, and can also have the data. For example an object might be road objects, vehicle objects, landscape objects which could be part of a driving simulation.

The object is self contained in that it only has necessary data sent to it, and the results are sent back. To change a current object takes a little more work. Especially if the source code is not available for the object, only the functionality. The objects have both functions and data and can be related to other objects.

One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that exhibits many of its features taken from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs extremely easier to modify.

To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming language (OOPL). Java, C++ and Smalltalk are three of the more popular languages, and there are also object-oriented versions of Pascal.

==Refresh Rate vs. Sampling Rate==

===Refresh Rate===
The refresh rate refers to monitors, televisions and other visual display devices. It is also known as: &quot;vertical refresh rate&quot;, or &quot;vertical scan rate for CRTs. It refers to the number of times in a second that a display is fully lit up. For a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) this is the number of times the ray draws from the top corner of the screen to the opposite bottom corner, in one second. It is measured in hertz. It is this phenomenon that causes the bar on a screen that is seen on a television show as the refresh rate is not enough to compensate for the intermediate frames taken by the camera.

This is in contrast to a frame rate, which is the number of frames shown per second. Whereas if a monitor has a 48Hz refresh rate and the show is at a 24 frame rate, then the screen will be lit up twice for each frame that appears on the screen.

===Sampling Rate===
The sampling rate for audio is the equivilant to the refresh rate for video. There are instances that the refresh rate is called the sampling rate interchangeably. In audio, this is the number of times a second that the sound input is recorded and saved. The sample rate of an audio recording is a good indicator of the overall sound quality. With the same measurement unit as the refresh rate, it is a noticeably higher number for a sampling rate for audio. Here are some rates and what they are commonly used for:

*8,000 Hz - [[telephone]], adequate for human speech
*11,025 Hz
*22,050 Hz - [[radio]]
*32,000 Hz - [[miniDV]] digital video [[camcorder]], [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] (LP mode)</text>

==Operating Systems==
&lt;Br&gt;
Boots up the comp
organizes files
preforms tasks (takes things out of the hards drive)
operating system to log in (Novell)
security (firewall)
==Turning on==
When booting up a computer there must be a basic operating system. There are multiple operating systems available for the consumers to choose from; starting with the most common windows, to server operating system, linux. Windows is made to be user friendly, even those who know little about computers can easily master the basic commands. Linux comes in many different forms, it is meant more for those who are already aware of how computers operate, with complex codes and hard to use commands.
==Basic functions==
Operating systems manage your files. They take your files and put them safely in your hard drive. It does the same function as you taking your papers and storing them in a filing cabinet till when you need them next.
==security==
Norton anti virus being the most common, but there are many other choices the consumer has the ability to choose from. Anti viruses protects your computer from outside dangers, such as hackers and scammers to viruses. A hacker can log onto your computer and see all your personal information, and possible have access to even your banking information. Viruses

==turning off==
When you turn off your computer it takes some time to file everything you have done since your last shut down. It will remember how your computer last looked.</text>

== Physics as a Subject ==

Physics is the study of how the Universe behaves in its component parts, which includes matter, energy, forces, motion, space, and time.  It is an experimental science in that experiments and observations are used to discard inaccurate ideas in favor of ones that match reality.  Ideas are loosely graded in quality as hypotheses, theories, principles, and laws, based on how firmly and widely they have been tested by observation.  No such idea is considered final or absolute truth.  They are always subject to revision or replacement by new observations and experiments, but many ideas have been tested for so long and in so many ways, we can confidently rely on them in engineering projects.

In this section we discuss key physical principles that relate to space projects. These principles are only a subset of physics as a whole.  We first look at them in ideal terms individually.   However realistic design work has to consider less than ideal conditions, such as friction or perturbing additional forces, and also uncertainties in how well we know any measured property.  This difference represents the difference between physical laws and practical engineering.

Physical principles are usually expressed as algebraic formulas and geometric relationships.  When known numerical values with proper units are inserted into these formulas, you can solve for an unknown value you wish to know.  The ability to calculate unknown values is enormously useful when designing or operating space projects.  As noted in the introduction to Part 1, the reader should have an adequate understanding of mathematics if they want to actually use these formulas themselves.

====To Learn More:====

It is not our purpose here to include an entire physics textbook, but rather a summary of the most important relationships that apply to space systems.  For more detail on physics in general, you can refer to one of the following sources:

==Units and Coordinates==

====Units====

In order to obtain the correct results from a formula, a consistent set of units and method of measuring physical quantities such as position in those units is necessary.  For example, adding two feet to three meters to get five of something does not produce a meaningful result because the units are different.  The '''[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf International System of Units]''', abbreviated from the French to '''SI''', is the preferred system of units for engineering and scientific work.  It is also known as the '''Metric System''' because the base unit of length is the &quot;Metre&quot; (or meter in English).  For historical reasons some values in space systems design are reported in US customary units, but these should be converted to SI values.  There are also units of convenience, such as '''gravities''' being a multiple of Earth's surface gravity.  It is convenient to express acceleration effects on humans in this way, relative to the Earth normal value.  It should always be recognized as a convenience, and converted to SI units when doing calculations by it's standard ratio of 1 gravity = 9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Physical quantities include both the numerical value and the units, and units must be carried through properly when doing calculations.

The base SI units are not defined in terms of other units, but rather by a description of how to measure them from nature, or by a physical artifact. These base units are currently the '''Meter''' for length, '''Kilogram''' for mass, '''Second''' for time, '''Ampere''' for electric current, '''Kelvin''' for thermodynamic temperature, '''mole''' for amount of substance, and '''candela''' for luminous intensity.  Efforts are underway to define these base units in terms of constants of nature, but they are not complete.  Derived SI units are the products of powers of the base units.  For example, the unit of force, called the '''Newton''', is 1 kilogram-meter times seconds&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Many of the derived units are named after famous physicists, but these named units are identical to the form expressed in base units.  Multiples and sub-multiples of units are indicated by prefixes which indicate integer powers of ten ranging from -24 to +24. Among the more common are '''kilo''', indicating 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 1000, and '''milli-''' indicating 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; or 0.001.

====Position====

In modern physics there is no absolute or preferred reference frame in the universe.  Therefore position is measured relative to a starting point known as the '''Origin''', which is given a value of zero. '''Altitude''' on Earth is measured relative to sea level in the direction opposite the local gravity direction. On bodies without an ocean to serve as a reference, an average ellipsoid based on the shape of the planet or satellite is defined as zero altitude. On gas giants, which do not have a visible solid or liquid surface, it is based on pressure.  On near-spherical bodies, '''Latitude''' and '''Longitude''' are measured relative to the points where the surface meets the axis of rotation, which are called the '''Poles''', and a point assigned values of zero in both coordinates called the '''Zero Point'''.  Units of '''Degrees''', which are 1/360th of a circle measure the location relative to the zero point.

Objects in space are generally moving in relation to each other in paths defined by gravitational forces.  When the paths are purely the result of gravity they are called '''Orbits''' and are measured by six parameters called '''Orbital Elements''' from which you can calculate position at a given time.  When absolute position is more useful, it can be measured in three dimensions relative to an origin, such as the center of the Sun, with axes defined relative to the stellar background. Alternately a radial distance and two angles relative to a reference plane can be used.  Most often the reference plane is that which contains the Earth's orbit around the Sun, known as the '''Ecliptic'''. In a Universe of three physical dimensions, it takes three values to define a position uniquely, either distance in three axes, or a radius and two angles. These values are known as the object's '''Coordinates''''.


==Motion==

'''Displacement''' is the change in position.  It has both amount and direction, such as &quot;three kilometers North&quot;.  '''Velocity''' is the rate of change in position per unit time.  When stated without a direction and purely as an amount it has a single value in units of meters per second.    Where x is position in the direction of motion, t is time, and the Greek letter delta (which looks like a triangle) indicates change in those values, then velocity v is given by the following formula:
  
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Acceleration''' is the rate of change in velocity, or the second derivative of position, with respect to time.  Thus acceleration a is:

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;   

The horizontal bar over v and a in the respective formulas indicates velocity is directional.  A value such as this when stated with both a magnitude and direction is called a '''Vector''', while a value without a direction is called a '''Scalar'''.  The direction can be given in terms of two angles, or the velocity can be expressed as components in the three (x, y, z) axes of a reference system, but either way a total of three values are required to state a velocity vector.  '''[http://physics.eou.edu/opensource/math/vecalg/vecalg.pdf Vector algebra]''' is somewhat different and more complex than simple algebra.

In accelerated motion, the velocity at any given instant is changing.  We can define an '''Instantaneous Velocity''' at a particular time, and an '''Average Velocity''' over an interval.  In a closed orbit the moving object returns to its starting point.  Thus for a full orbit, the net change in position is zero, and as a vector the average velocity is also zero.  If you measure the total length of the orbital path and divide by the time one orbit takes, you can obtain an average orbital speed as a positive scalar value. This illustrates how different vector and scalar values can be.  Acceleration can also change with time.  For example, the accelerating force due to gravity changes as the inverse square of distance.  Thus a falling object will increase in acceleration as it gets closer.  Under constant acceleration in a straight line we can determine change in position or distance d from:

:&lt;math&gt; d = \Delta x = 1/2 \times at^2&lt;/math&gt;

In circular motion, where v is the velocity and r is the radius, we can find the acceleration a from the following formula:  

:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac{v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

One use for this formula is finding a required velocity for a circular orbit from the acceleration of gravity (see under Forces below) and the radial distance from the center of the body.  Note there is no centrifugal force.  Gravity or a rotating structure provide an inwardly directed force to maintain circular motion of the object, but there is no outward one.

==Forces==

The 20th century theories of '''[[w:General_relativity|General Relativity]]''' and '''[[w:Quantum_mechanics|Quantum Mechanics]]''' are more accurate predictors of how objects behave in the realms of the fast and the small, but in many cases the simpler formulas of '''[[w:Classical_mechanics|Classical Mechanics]]''' are sufficiently accurate to use.  Examples where classical mechanics starts to be insufficiently accurate include long term changes in the orbit of Mercury, which being the closest planet to the Sun, moves the fastest, and GPS navigation, which relies on extreme accuracy of the orbits of the satellites and the effect of gravity on their signals to determine user position.  Isaac Newton formulated many of the basic ideas of classical mechanics in his '''[[w:Philosophiæ_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica|Principia]]''', published in 1687.  These include his three laws of motion, conservation of momentum and angular momentum, and the law of universal gravitation. 


===Newton's Three Laws===

These are laws in the mathematical sense, which Newton deduced from experiments performed by others before him.  They involve two opposing concepts: '''Forces''' which tend to create motion, and '''Mass''' which tends to oppose it via the property of '''Inertia'''. The relationship of forces to the motion they create is known as '''Dynamics'''.  Forces are vectors, having magnitude and direction, and multiple forces act as the vector sum of the component forces.  This also means single forces can be decomposed into components, such as vertical and horizontal components relative to an axis system, or perpendicular (normal) and parallel components relative to a surface.  Decomposition is done when it is useful in solving a problem.  The three laws are:


'''First: Inertia''' -  A body acted on by no net force moves with constant velocity (which may be zero) and zero acceleration:  

:&lt;math&gt;\sum \vec F_i = 0 \Rightarrow a = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is contrary to common earthly experience where friction acts to stop objects in motion.  

Objects moving freely in the vacuum of space demonstrate this Law more clearly since it is a frictionless environment.  An airplane in level flight has multiple forces acting on it (gravity, lift, thrust, and drag), but if the vector sum of all the forces is zero, it will continue moving at the same altitude and velocity in the same direction.  From the fact that buildings typically are not accelerating we can deduce there is no net force acting on them.  To put it another way, the sum of the forces is zero.  Since gravity acts to pull the building down, there must be an equal force from the bedrock acting to hold it up.  Applying this idea to every structural component of the building is a powerful way to determine the necessary design of those components - at each point where components connect, the forces must sum to zero, therefore you can calculate the forces which a particular component must withstand.


'''Second: Force''' - When a force does act on a body of mass m, the acceleration a is related to the magnitude of the force F by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;  \vec F = m \vec a &lt;/math&gt;.

The arrows above the symbols indicate they are vectors, meaning a quantity in a particular direction. Thus a force in a given direction produces an acceleration in the same direction.  Manipulating this simple formula has very wide ranging use in space systems.  Given any two of the values, we can find the third.  Summing across time, we can find total velocity change.

Since mass has units of kilograms, and acceleration has units of meters per second squared, then by the above formula force has units of kilogram-meter per second squared, which is called a '''Newton''' (abbreviated &quot;N&quot;) in the SI system of units, named after the scientist.  The force which the Earth exerts on a falling apple is coincidentally, given stories about the scientist and falling apples, about 1 Newton.  The force of gravity on an object is referred to as '''Weight'''.  Since most humans live where that force causes an approximately equal (within 0.2%) acceleration, we often confuse weight with mass.  They are proportional, but they have different units.  On another planet, the same object would have a different weight.  Weight does not disappear when in orbit - aboard the Space Station the force of the Earth's gravity is only 10% less than on the ground.  So-called &quot;zero gravity&quot; is more properly described as '''Free fall'''.  The astronauts inside the Station and the Station itself are both affected by the same force of gravity.  Thus the difference between the forces is zero, and the astronauts do not feel their bodies pressed against anything.  On Earth what you feel is parts of your body pressed against the ground or furniture, and internally pressing against other parts of your body.  This pressure is what you experience as &quot;weight&quot;. 

The product of mass times velocity is called '''momentum''' and given the symbol p since mass already uses the letter m. Force also equals the change of momentum with respect to time, since acceleration is the change in velocity with respect to time and we are just adding the multiplier of mass:

:&lt;math&gt; \vec F = \frac{d \vec p}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;.


'''Third: Reaction''' - Single forces do not act in isolation. At the most fundamental level the particles which carry the four forces of nature act on both the emitter and absorber of the particles. At the macroscopic level we live in, where forces are the combined action of many particles, we observe the dual action as for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction force.  Where the subscripts indicate the force of object A on object B and object B on object A:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{\mathrm ab} = - \vec{F}_{\mathrm ba}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore a body can never move itself by applying forces only to itself, because the reaction force would cancel it out.  You cannot lift yourself above the ground no matter how hard you try by applying forces to your own body.  A pole vaulter, however, can raise their body a considerable distance by applying force to the ground.  The reaction force of the ground through the pole then acts to raise their body.  Of great interest for space systems is that a rocket engine applies a great deal of force to expel gases in one direction, and the gas applies a reaction force in the opposite direction, which moves a vehicle.

Multiplying both sides of the above formula by units of time, and subtracting the left side from the right side, we obtain the sum of momentum (mass times velocity) changes is always zero.  This is known as the '''Law of Conservation of Momentum'''.  It is referred to as a physical law because it has never been observed to be violated, and conservation in the physics sense means a value which does not change.  It is found to be conserved both for linear and rotational motion.  The latter is referred to as '''Angular Momentum'''.  Thus the Earth would continue to rotate forever unless acted on by outside forces.  Such forces do in fact act, mainly tidal forces from the Moon.  So the Earth's rotation is slowing down measurably - the day is getting longer by 23 microseconds per year.  But since angular momentum is conserved, slowing the Earth's rotation means the Moon increases its angular momentum.  This increases the size of its orbit by a measurable amount (3.8 cm/year)

===The Forces of Nature===

There are only four fundamental forces responsible for all known motion in the Universe.  These are the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces. These forces interact via gravitons, photons, W and Z bosons, and gluons respectively.  For more detail see '''[[w:Fundamental_interaction|Fundamental Interaction]]'''.  The latter two are short range forces which mostly occur within atomic nuclei, so the two that concern space projects the most are gravity and electromagnetism.

====Gravity====
Gravitons, are the hypothetically postulated particles which should carry the gravitational force. Because gravitons never decay, their range is infinite, and the gravitational field of any object in the Universe affects every other object in the Universe. As a result the total '''gravitational field''' surrounding an object remains the same at any distance. The area of a sphere surrounding an object is 4 times pi times the radius squared. Thus the gravitational field per unit area decreases with the square of the radius r.  The rates of graviton production and absorption are both proportional to the mass of an object. So between any two objects the total gravitational force depends on the product of the two masses. Since the first object emits a number depending on it's mass M, and then the second object absorbs some of them according to it's second mass m. The rate of graviton production and absorption is measured as a universal constant G which applies to every object in the Universe, as far as we know:

:&lt;math&gt;G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2/kg^2&lt;/math&gt;

Gravity always acts to attract two objects to each other, in other words reduce the distance, therefore the force is given a negative value.  As a practical matter, since the field falls as the square of distance, objects sufficiently far away can be ignored to the extent you need to accurately calculate the total gravitational force on an object. The force acts on a line between each pair of objects and the total force is simply the sum of the individual forces accounting for the direction of each, and each is found by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Since force is also mass times acceleration, we can equate them and remove mass m from both sides of the equation, giving the acceleration due to gravity of an object with mass M as

:&lt;math&gt; \vec a = -\frac{GM}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

When restrained from accelerating, such as when you stand on the surface of the Earth, you experience the downward force as '''weight'''. Your mass does not change according to what object you are standing on, but the acceleration does, due to the object's different mass and radius. Therefore your weight will be different on other planets and satellites.

When unrestrained from accelerating, also known as '''free fall''', then the parts of your body, or for instance if riding in vehicle, all will accelerate at the same rate. They do not have any acceleration relative to each other, sometimes called '''Zero gravity''', but incorrectly since nowhere in the Universe there is truly no gravitational field. So in the case of unrestrained acceleration &quot;free fall&quot; is the more correct term, and &quot;zero apparent gravity&quot; will provide a better indication as to express how it appears to a human relative to their surroundings.

The local acceleration at the Earth's surface has a standard value of 9.80665 meters per second squared, but actually varies slightly depending on location (increases at the poles and decreases in the meridian, due to the changes in distance to the planet's center). This is given the symbol g, and accelerations are sometimes stated as multiples of standard Earth gravity to give an impression of how humans would experience it, but for calculation purposes meters/second squared should be used to avoid unit errors. Similarly weight should not be confused with mass. Weight is in reference to the local gravity field, while mass is the more correct unit to use at any location.

====Electromagnetism====

'''[[w:Photon|Photons]]''', the particles which carry the electromagnetic force, behave similarly to gravitons in that they do not decay as they travel, and obey an inverse square field law. Where gravity is the result of mass, electromagnetic force is the result of electric charge. Unlike gravity, charge comes in two types which we call '''positive''' and '''negative'''. The names are arbitrary, positive charges are not larger or higher than negative ones, but they have the property that like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract.  The electromagnetic force is found by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;F = k_\mathrm{e} \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where F is the force, k(e) is fixed value called '''Coulomb's constant''', q1 and q2 are the electric charges, and r is the distance between them.  Note the form of this equation is similar to the one for gravitational force. When both of the charges are positive, or both negative, their product is positive, and so is the force.  Positive forces act to increase the distance between charges.  When the charges are unlike, one positive and one negative, the product is negative, and thus the force acts to decrease distance.  Coulomb's constant, where C is charge in units of 1 Coulomb = 1 mole of elementary charges is

:&lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{e} = 8.987 \times 10^9 \ \mathrm{N  \cdot m^2 / C^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Elementary charges are those on a single electron or proton, and are always observed as integer multiples of those charges, never fractions.  Charges are additive by simple arithmetic, with negative charges canceling the fields of positive charges.  Since unlike charges attract each other, they tend to annihilate if they are antiparticles or form neutral atoms if they are protons within atomic nuclei and electrons.  So large quantities of matter tend to have low net charge.  Since mass is always positive, large quantities of matter always have large amounts of gravity.

Moving electric charges create a '''magnetic field''', including the imputed spin of the charge from elementary particles. Materials with aligned atomic spins can have a static magnetic field. A steady flow of electric charges is called a '''Current''', and also creates a field. Magnetic fields in turn affect the motion of electric charges creating a force F, where I is the current, l is the length of the wire, and B is the strength of the magnetic field:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I \boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{B} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The bold face symbols indicate these are '''vector''' values, having directions.  The force is perpendicular to both the direction of the wire/current and the magnetic field.  Natural magnetic fields, such as the Earth's, are assumed to be caused by electric currents within the metal core.

==A. Air-Breathing Engines== 

The next group of methods normally involve using a planet's (usually the Earth's) atmosphere as a supply of oxygen to support combustion with a fuel carried on the vehicle. They differ in the details of how the incoming air flow and combustion is managed.  It should be noted that some vehicle concepts, such as the National Aerospaceplane (NASP) of the 1990's, or the current British [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_%28spacecraft%29 Skylon] would integrate more than one method in a single engine. This is referred to as a '''Combined Cycle Engine'''.  The same general engine concepts could be used in a reducing atmosphere, such as Hydrogen or Methane, with Oxygen as the carried fuel, or in a sufficiently powerful nuclear engine with any atmosphere.  In the latter case the nuclear engine is used to drive a compressor or heat the incoming gas flow.

Fundamental to understanding the operation of air-breathing engines is the concept of mass conservation.  The mass of incoming air at the '''Inlet''' does not change in total amount going through the engine, although pressure and temperature vary.  The exception is the point where fuel is added, or in some types, where condensed air flow is removed.  Heat can be added or removed by combustion or heat exchangers, but otherwise the mass flow stays the same.  From that constant mass flow, changes in the other conditions of the gas flow can be calculated, and performance derived.

In practice, the flow through an engine can involve many fan blades and turbulence, so that computer simulations are not fully accurate.  Real engines also operate at extremes of temperature and stress.  Therefore engine development typically includes extensive testing on static test stands, in wind tunnels, and in flight attached to aircraft, to determine actual performance and durability.
  

====25 Fanjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Gas Flow by Fuel-Atmosphere Combustion

'''Description:''' The fanjet is the standard type of jet engine found on passenger aircraft and military aircraft. The original form of the engine, the turbojet, has a series of turbine compressor stages to compress the incoming air flow. This is followed by a combustor where fuel is added and burned, creating a hot gas. The gas is then expanded through a turbine which is connected by a shaft to the compressor. The expanded gas emerges at high velocity from the back of the engine. 

The modern fanjet adds a fan which is also driven by the turbine. All of the airflow goes through the fan, but only a part goes into the compressor. The air which does not go into the compressor is said to have 'bypassed' the compressor. The 'bypass ratio' is the ratio of bypass air to combustor air. Generally higher bypass ratio engines are more fuel efficient, in units of thrust divided by fuel consumption rate, because they increase the mass flowing through the engine. In general, engines that operate at higher speeds are designed with lower bypass ratios. This is due to more combustion needed to increase thrust against the higher inlet drag from the higher velocity.

Typical modern performance values are engine thrust-to weight ratios (T/W) of 6:1 for large subsonic engines, trending towards about 10:1 for high performance military jets. Fuel efficiency is measured in units of thrust divided by mass flow rate. In English units this is pounds divided by pounds per second, or just seconds, and is termed 'specific impulse'. In SI units this is Newtons per kilogram per second, which has the units of meters per second. In some propulsion systems, such as chemical rockets, the SI unit corresponds to the actual exhaust jet velocity. In the case of air- breathing propulsion it is not, the velocity result is just an indicator of engine efficiency. In English units the performance of subsonic engines is about 10,000 seconds, trending to about 7000 seconds for supersonic military engines. Fanjets and turbojets operate up to about 3.5 times the speed of sound (M=3.5). Extra thrust can be generated with an '''Afterburner''', which burns more fuel after the turbine stage of the engine.  This comes at the cost of lower fuel efficiency.

Although the maximum altitude and velocity of a fanjet is limited compared to Earth orbit velocity, the effect on payload can be much larger.  This is because compared to a conventional rocket, it can avoid most of the drag, pressure, and gravity losses near the ground. Conventional rocket payload is typically a small fraction of total mass, so small reductions in losses can produce large relative increases in payload.

'''Status:''' In common use on aircraft for aircraft propulsion. For space launch, the B-52 bomber and L-1011 aircraft have been used to carry the Pegasus three stage solid rocket to 35,000 ft altitude. The B-52 uses 8 fanjet type engines for propulsion. The Stratolaunch system is under development, using parts from two 747 aircraft with 6 high bypass fanjet engines, and carrying a large rocket.  Numerous paper studies have been made of using aircraft as carriers for rocket stages. 

'''Variations:'''

:* '''Carrier Aircraft''' - A conventional jet aircraft is used to carry a separate rocket to an altitude of roughly 9000 meters and velocity of 240 m/s, after which the rocket ignites and finishes reaching orbit.

:* '''Booster Jets''' - A set of military fighter engines are attached to a rocket as separate strap-on boosters, or a connected '''booster ring'''.  They can loft a rocket to about 15 km altitude and 480 m/s velocity, after which they either parachute land or do a powered vertical landing.

====26 Turbo-Ramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Gas Flow by Fuel-Atmosphere Combustion

'''Description:''' In this method a multi-stage fan compresses the incoming air stream, which is then mixed with fuel, burned and exhausted.  The compressor is driven by a gas generator/turbine. In a fanjet, the incoming air is compressed and heated by the compressor stages, then mixed with fuel and run through the turbine stages. At higher velocities the air gets hotter in compression since it has a higher incoming kinetic energy. This leads to a higher turbine temperature. Eventually a turbine temperature limit is reached based on the material used, which sets a limit to the speed of the engine. In the turbo-ramjet the compressor is driven by a gas generator/turbine set instead, which use on-board propellant for their operation. Since the gas generator is independent of the flight speed, it can operate over a wider range of Mach numbers than the fanjet ( to Mach 6 vs. to Mach 3). 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 
  

====27 Ramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' In this method, the incoming air stream is decelerated to subsonic velocity relative to the engine via a shaped inlet, mixed with fuel, then accelerated again out an exit nozzle. Conceptually it is the simplest form of jet engine, because it has no fans or turbines.  The incoming air is moving at the vehicle velocity entering the engine. After burning the fuel, the air is hotter and can expand to a higher velocity out the nozzle. This sets up a pressure difference that leaves a net thrust. Ramjets cannot operate at zero speed, but they can reach somewhat higher limits than an engine with rotating machinery (range Mach 0.5 to about Mach 8). 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:'''

:* '''Air Augmented Rocket''' - This is a form of combined cycle engine.  Since ramjets do not function at zero speed, an internal rocket chamber in the engine is used for initial thrust.  By entraining air flow, the thrust level can be augmented at lower speeds.  Once ramjet speeds are reached, the engine functions in ramjet mode, using the rocket chamber as a fuel injector.  At the upper end of ramjet function, the engine transitions back to pure rocket mode.

'''References:'''

* Wikipedia article: '''[[w:Air-augmented rocket|Air-augmented Rocket]]'''


====28 Scramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' This is similar to how a ramjet functions. The incoming air stream is compressed by shock waves, mixed with fuel, and expanded against the engine or vehicle body. The difference is the airstream remains supersonic relative to the vehicle. The ramjet requirement to slow the airstream to subsonic speed becomes inefficient at higher velocities.  Even though the gas is moving supersonically relative to the vehicle, the sidewise expansion can act on the vehicle if the slope of the nozzle is low enough. Thus the vehicle can fly faster than the exhaust gas moves. Scramjets may provide useful thrust up to about Mach 15, or 60% of Earth orbital speed.

The very high velocities lead to extreme heating of vehicle parts. High compression and expansion efficiency is needed to get a positive net thrust, since the energy added by the fuel becomes small relative to the kinetic energy of the air flow.  Thus development of working scramjets has proved difficult.  Scramjets also do not function at zero velocity, so some other method is needed to get to their starting point.  Therefore complete vehicles will need a combined engine system.

'''Status:''' Scramjet engine components and small scale versions have been tested with mixed success.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 


====29 Inverted Scramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Buoyant Scramjet 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Ramjet and scramjet vehicles would prefer Hydrogen as a fuel because it gives higher performance, and can be used for cooling vehicle parts heated by the high velocity in air.  Unfortunately Hydrogen is also very low density, which leads to relatively heavy vehicle structure due to large tanks.  This method inverts the problem by using a series of balloons or a lightweight pipe supported in the atmosphere.  They contain Hydrogen, and the vehicle carries Oxygen in its tanks. Oxygen is about 16 times denser than Hydrogen, so the tank size is much reduced. 

'''Status:''' This is only a concept at present.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 
  

====30 Laser-Thermal Jet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:'''  In this method a laser beam is focused on and absorbed by a heat exchanger on the vehicle, or creates a laser-sustained plasma.  The hot gas is then exhausted for thrust.  By not requiring fuel, it is potentially efficient. The drawback is it requires a very powerful laser to be feasible even for small vehicles.  Powerful lasers are currently expensive. Another limitation is the distance over which the beam can maintain focus.

'''Status:'''  Minimal experiments have been done in a laboratory.

'''Variations:'''

==B. Internally Fueled Engines (Rockets)==
 
Conventional rockets function by expelling a gas at high velocity in a desired direction.  By conservation of momentum (a physical law), the remainder of the vehicle will gain velocity in the opposite direction.  Rockets have been the principal method of space transport to date because they only require internally stored fuel, and can thus operate in a vacuum. Since they propel the vehicle, the fuels are also called '''Propellants'''.  Rockets can be sorted into types by how many propellants they have and what physical form the propellants are stored in.  The former category includes single fuel '''Monopropellant''', two fuel '''Bipropellant''', and the rarely used three fuel '''Tripropellant''' types.  The category includes gaseous, solid, liquid, and hybrid - part solid and part liquid.

Thrust is mass flow rate times exit or '''Exhaust Velocity'''. To get the most use from a finite amount of fuel, you want to minimize flow rate and maximize exit velocity.  Therefore the gas should be as hot as possible and have low molecular weight.  That in turn drives the choice of chemical reaction and fuels to use.  There are numerous fuel combinations that are possible, but a relatively few that have a combination of high energy and other desirable characteristics such as density, safety, and low corrosion.  There are several ways to get the gas hot: catalytic decomposition, combustion, or external heating.  The first two are grouped under '''chemical rockets''', and the latter are categorized by how the gas gets heated.  Chemical rockets generally use a combination of combustion chamber and expansion nozzle, as that is a very efficient way to direct the gas flow at high velocity.  Rocket engines will function with a surrounding atmosphere, but that impedes the gas flow, so they generate lower thrust.  The lost thrust can be approximated by the local exterior pressure times the area of the nozzle exit.

Rockets are generally less efficient than air-breathing engines in terms of momentum per fuel mass, since the latter can use oxygen from the air as part of the fuel. This increases the combustion energy per carried fuel mass. Air breathing engines also increase the mass flowing through the engine via the Nitrogen component of air, and additional un-combusted air flow using engine-driven fans.  Both rockets and air-breathing engines involve similar design principles, as they both use combustion and hot gas flow to get reaction forces.

'''History''' - The earliest reference to using expelled mass for reaction force is the Greek Archytus around 400 BC. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html NASA, '''Brief History of Rockets''', web page 15 Apr 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; This used external heating to generate steam.  The first known use of internal chemical energy is in 1232 AD in China by '''fire arrows''' using gunpowder as fuel.  The idea may have been transmitted to Europe by the Mongols, where experiments and use for fireworks occurred in the 13-15th centuries. Experiments began in the 18th century as a transport method rather than explosive device, although military use continued.  Notably, rockets used in a battle in 1812 were recorded in the US national anthem.

The use of rockets to reach space was proposed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1898. Robert Goddard built experimental solid and liquid fuel rockets starting in 1915. A book published by Hermann Oberth in 1923 influenced the formation of rocket societies where groups pursued their development. &lt;ref&gt;For a history of the rocket societies, see [http://www.amazon.com/Prelude-Space-Age-Societies-1924-1940/dp/0874749638 Frank Winter '''Prelude to the Space Age''', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; The German government pursued the development of rockets to deliver explosives by sub-orbital trajectories from 1937 to 1945. Subsequently the scientists and their hardware and data went to the United States and the USSR, where they helped develop sub-orbital ballistic missiles and orbital transport, both first flying in 1957. The first orbital rockets were essentially identical to ballistic missiles, but have since diverged.  By 1963 Liquid Hydrogen/Liquid Oxygen propellants were in use, which is still the highest energy fuel mix commonly used.  Liquid and solid chemical rockets are by far the most common space transport method, and are now built in a number of countries by both governments and private companies.

'''Design''' - The non-fuel mass of a rocket stage can be grouped into engines, tanks, and &quot;other&quot;. Rocket engines can produce 400-1000 N/kg of engine mass in thrust, which is many times larger than the 9.8 N/kg force of gravity.  For liftoff from the Earth, you want approximately 1.2-1.5 times the vehicle takeoff weight in thrust, so the engine component then has a mass of about 1.3-3% of the total vehicle. A large tank, such as the Shuttle External Tank, can weigh 4% of the fuel weight, but other tanks can range up to 10% of the fuel weight. 'Other' includes plumbing, parachutes, landing gear, heat shields, guidance systems, and such non-propulsion parts. It can range from 1% up to 10% of the total weight. 

Older materials and components required 15% of the total liftoff mass to be vehicle other than fuel, assuming a single flight operating life. Modern materials require about 10% of the total mass for a many flight operating life. Structures tend to get heavier at the rate of 10% for each factor of 10 in life. This comes from the fatigue life of materials under load cycles (flights) as a function of stress.  Lower stress and longer life requires thicker and heavier structural parts to distribute the load over. So a 100-use structure will be about 20% heavier than a one-use structure. 


====31 Solid Rocket==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:'''

'''Description:''' A solid rocket consists of a high-strength casing, a nozzle, and a precast solid propellant grain which burns at a pre-designed rate. The grain is a mixture of materials containing both fuel and oxidizer, so combustion can proceed without any external action once it is ignited. Modern solid propellants have a formulation close to the following: About 15% by weight organic fuel, usually a type of rubber, about 20% by weight aluminum powder (which acts as a metallic fuel), and about 65% ammonium perchlorate (NH3ClO4), which is the oxidizer. About 1-2% epoxy is added to the powders to hold them together. The epoxy, being an organic material, is also part of the fuel.  Solid propellants burn from the surface of the precast grain.  Therefore the shape of the grain at ignition, and shape as it burns away, determines the thrust level.

Advantages of solid rockets are short preparation time to launch and long term storage, compared to cryogenic fuels like liquid Oxygen. Disadvantages include relatively low exhaust velocity (2.6-3 km/s), and no easy way to turn it off or control it once ignited. They are often used as a booster first stage since the relatively dense fuel (1.35 g/cc) lowers the area of the vehicle. This is an advantage during the first two minutes of flight, where aerodynamic drag is important.  When aluminum is used in the propellant, part of the end product is aluminum oxide, which is an excellent abrasive.  Thus nozzle erosion is a significant effect that must be accounted for, in addition to the high temperatures.

Solid rockets are simpler in the sense of having few moving parts, but the entire motor casing that surrounds the fuel grain must withstand the operating pressure.  In liquid rockets with fuel pumps, the propellant tanks see hydraulic and acceleration loads, which are typically lower, and only the pumps and combustion chamber see the full operating pressure.

'''Status:''' In common use for rocket stages, particularly the strap-on booster stage.

====32 Hybrid Rocket==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description''': The hybrid rocket consists of a solid fuel grain and a liquid oxidizer. One combination is rubber for the fuel and liquid oxygen for the oxidizer. The fuel is in the form of a hollow cylinder or perforated block. The oxidizer is sprayed onto the fuel and the material is ignited. By not being self-supporting in combustion, the fuel part can be treated as non- hazardous when being made and shipped. Only when on the launch pad and the oxidizer tank is filled is there a hazardous combination. With only a single liquid to handle, the hardware is relatively simple in design. Hybrid rockets are intermediate in performance compared to solid and full liquid engines.

'''Type:''' Fuel/Oxidizer Combustion by Combustion Gas exhaust

'''Description:''' In a liquid rocket, the propellant ingredients are forced into a combustion chamber, where they burn, and which leads to a converging-diverging nozzle. The flow becomes sonic at the narrow part of the nozzle, then continues to accelerate in the diverging part of the nozzle, reaching about 1.5-2 times the speed of sound by converting temperature and pressure via expansion into a directed flow. A variety of propellant combinations have been used, including mono- bi-, and even tri-propellants.  Monopropellants typically use catalytic decomposition for heating.  The most common form of liquid rocket uses a separate fuel and oxidizer, which are mixed and burned in the combustion chamber.  Many bipropellant mixtures are possible, but the highest energy-to-mass ratio mix in common use is from 1 part Hydrogen to 6 parts Oxygen.  This produces mostly steam with a little leftover Hydrogen, which lowers the average molecular weight and thus increases the average molecule velocity.  This propellant mix can reach about 4.7 km/s exhaust velocity under the best conditions. 

Some propellant mixes will burn on contact, and so do not require an ignition source. These are called '''Hypergolic''' propellants.  Some liquid propellants are liquid at room temperature and can be stored for long periods in a tank.  These are referred to as '''Storable'''.  Others, including Hydrogen, Methane, and Oxygen, are only liquid at very low temperatures.  These are referred to as '''Cryogenic'''.

'''Status:''' This is the most common form of launch propulsion used to date to put things into Earth orbit. 

'''Variations:''' There are multiple combinations of liquid engine types that are possible and have been used.  They can be sorted by what propellant combination is used, how the propellants are delivered into the combustion chamber, and how the resulting hot gas is expanded out of it.

:* '''Variations by composition''' - The following tables list some oxidizers and fuels, and combinations thereof.  It is not an exhaustive list, and some ingredients have practical issues such as storage temperature, human toxicity, corrosiveness, or chemical instability.  Rocket propellants by their nature contain a lot of chemical energy, and that energy can cause unintended reactions.  Actual engine performance depends on factors such as chamber and exit pressures, so the table values should only be used for general comparisons. Kerosine is a mixture of compounds derived from petroleum, and Rocket Propellant 1 (RP-1) is a standardized type of Kerosine specified as a rocket fuel.  Therefore it does not have an exact formula, and it is given as an approximate average value.  It also does not have a well defined melting and boiling point, which is given as a range defined by distillation of its components.

:* '''Variations by fuel feed''' - Some engine designs use a pump to feed the propellants into the combustion chamber, others use a pressurized tank.  Large engines may use a combination of tank pressurization to prevent cavitation of the pump inlet and pumps to reach chamber inlet pressure.  The fuel must enter the chamber at a higher pressure than the combustion pressure in a steady state engine.  Non-steady state pulsed ignition engines are possible, but not generally used.  Steady state engined deliver more continuous thrust. Pumps require a lot of power to operate, and generally use the same fuel as the rocket.  In '''Gas Generator''' systems a portion of the fuel flow is used to create hot gas which drives a turbine to run the pump.  The hot gas is then vented.  In '''Staged Combustion''' systems, the hot gas is not completely burned, and is fed into the combustion chamber.  This is more efficient but also more complex.

:* '''Variation by nozzle type''' - Most rocket engines to date use a bell-shaped nozzle, where the gas flow is on the inside, surrounded by structure which directs the flow.  An alternate design called an '''Aerospike''' nozzle inverts this arrangement, with the structure on the inside in the form of a wedge or cone, and the gas flow surrounding it.  The outer edge of the gas flow is contained by the surrounding atmosphere.  Since that automatically adjust for pressure differences, it is a type of altitude compensating nozzle. The benefit to compensation is that nozzle exit area in an atmosphere represents a thrust loss.  A truncated cone can integrate better with some vehicle shapes, and the larger chamber and nozzle area can lower heat flux.

:* '''Variation by cooling type''' - The high energy combustion in liquid rocket engines can exceed the melting point of most structural materials.  Therefore methods to prevent this are needed in all but the smallest engines, which simply use high temperature alloys and radiate the heat away.   In one method, the fuel is run through channels in the rocket engine walls to keep it from overheating.  This also recovers some of the energy that would otherwise be lost. A method in recent development by '''[http://www.orbitec.com/propulsion.html Orbitec]''' injects a counterflow vortex of one propellant ingredient along the inside of the engine walls, which is mixed with the other ingredient at the back and the hot gases then flow in the forward direction down the core of the chamber.  The unburned ingredient protects the structure with a layer of cool gas.

====34 Gaseous Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' In this method the propellant is introduced in gas form to the chamber. It may be a mono-propellant (a single gas) or a bi-propellant combination.  Due to high tank mass this is usually used for small auxiliary thrusters.  By using direct pressure from the tank to make the propellant flow, it can be very simple. 

'''Status:'''

====35 Mechanically Augmented Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The velocity of the exhaust gases are increased by placing the thrusters on the end of rotating arms. This can add 2-3 km/s to the exhaust velocity based on structural limits. It requires some external energy input to maintain the rotation of the arms, since the thrust opposes their rotation.  Full electric thrusters generally have higher performance than this method, so they are preferred.

'''Status:''' Concept only, since there are better options.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Mathos, I see that you've done alot of work on the [[Intermediate Algebra]] book. I think that we can merge your book into [[Algebra]], and at the same time clean and reorganize [[Algebra]] in a way that makes more sense. I agree with you that [[Algebra]] is in bad condition, as it contains a number of cross-links with other books like [[Linear Algebra]], [[Abstract algebra]], and other books. I would like to separate out all the materials into their own books, to reduce cross-linking, and make things more organized. Here is my proposal:

The remaining books will be:

*[[Algebra I in Simple English]] (unchanged)
*[[Algebra]] (incorporating [[Algebra I - A Verbose Approach]] and [[Intermediate Algebra]])
*[[Linear Algebra]]
*[[Abstract algebra]] (possibly moved to [[Abstract Algebra]], to meet the same naming convention).

Also, I would like to separate out the material so that it goes more or less in a chronological order: Algebra &amp;rarr; Linear Algebra &amp;rarr; Abstract Algebra. This means that we will no longer be cross-linking chapters, and there will be no more redundant information in these books. Here is my proposed listing of topics for each book, (not in a particular order):

*[[Algebra]]
**Arithmetic review
**Polynomials, Quadratic Equation, etc
**Factoring Polynomials, Solving for X
**Functions, Equalities, Inequalities, Function combinations
**Conic Sections and Graphing
**Exponentials, Radicals, and Logarithms
*[[Linear Algebra]]
**Systems of Equations
**Matricies, Vectors
**Matrix Operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, determinent)
**Cramers Rule
**Submatricies (minors, adjoint, etc)
**Matrix Inverses
**Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
**Linear Transformations
**Vector Spaces (lead in to [[Abstract algebra]]...)
*[[Abstract Algebra]]
**Sets and Compositions
**Semigroups, Groups, Abelian Groups
**Rings, fields and modules 
**Isomorphisms, Homomorphisms
**Modules, Algebras

It is my hope that this reorganization will make all the books better: reduce duplicate information, forked content, and cross-linking; and create a single progression of ideas that is easy to follow. Much of your work on [[Intermediate Algebra]] would simply be moved, not changed, and it would be merged with the other material in the other books. If you don't have any big problems with this idea, let me know, because I would like to get started on it soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:11, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

Mathos, I noticed the page, [[American Studies/Cover]], that you created. If you no longer intend to use it in your book, may I suggest that you self-nominate it for deletion? Just tag it with &amp;#123;&amp;#123;delete|I, Mathos, the sole contributor, intend to delete this page.&amp;#125;&amp;#125; Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 21:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

Oh, I see; I was hoping it would delete itself. I thought we were supposed to make Cover pages, but then I realized that they'd have to click extra to get there. Thanks for the information! --[[User:Mathos|Jaden Mathos]] 04:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

Mathos, that's really neat. I like meeting people who have the same interests as me. =) Most people don't.

I'm not a junior in high school, but I was when I made my user page. It's actually a bit out-dated...I think I'll clean it up soon. But I still love all those books. And now that I'm in college, I've gotten to read a lot more. This is just my first semester, and I've read so much. I recommend &lt;i&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt;, if you haven't read it, and also &quot;Dream of the Rood.&quot; They're both Anglo-Saxon poetry, and they're both fascinating. Copies of &lt;i&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt; go for dirt cheap, and you can find &quot;Dream of the Rood&quot; online [http://faculty.uca.edu/~jona/texts/rood.htm here] or [http://www.google.com/search?q=Dream+of+the+Rood elsewhere].

I haven't gotten to read Neitzche yet, but I have read Immanuel Kant, who is just as cool. =) And I love Dante's &lt;i&gt;Inferno&lt;/i&gt;. 
Anyways, thanks for the friendly message. If you need anything, I'm usually here. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

==Invitation of a Wikibook Study==
Hi Mathos,

I'm inkeys. I'm a graduate student at Indiana University. My advisor and I, we are working on a Wikibook study. I read your wikibook of Abstract Algebra. We would like to learn more from your experience in writing or editing the book. We hope you will be interested in participating in this study. The formal invitation letter is attached below.

This is an invitation to participate in a case study related to the Wikibook project. The purpose of the study is to understand online authors’ self-efficacy, which involves the motivation to write a Wikibook, beliefs regarding one’s knowledge of the topic, previous experience and success in writing a Wikibook, and ability to help coordinate the Wikibook project and interact with other authors. If you agree to participate in this particular case study, please reply to this email (or cl17@indiana.edu) and we will schedule a one hour interview with you at your convenience by phone or by email. Your responses will be anonymous.

Your input to this project is greatly appreciated.
Thanks for your time and consideration,

''Improved Quality in Healthcare''
Computers are aiding healthcare advances in many different ways.  An example of which is the HELP system.  The HELP system stores useful information that can remind and aid physicians while solving clinical problems.  For complex problems, computer workstations can integrate patient records, research plans, and knowledge databases for physicians.  The HELP system was in place to study the significance of serving antibiotics two hours before surgery.  

In addition to alerting physicians to abnormal and changing clinical values, computers can post reminders for physicians. For complex problems, computer workstations can integrate patient records, research plans, and knowledge databases.  Physicians reminded by computer were twice as likely to give flu vaccine to patients at high risk during the winter in a 3-year trial by Indiana University investigators.  Winter hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and tests for respiratory ailments were reduced by 10 to 30 percent because the high-risk patients were vaccinated.  Computer alerts for physicians prevented serious kidney failure and preserved kidney function in patients. When indicators of kidney function rose in the patients, the computers alerted the physicians, who then stopped medications being given or adjusted doses more than 21 hours sooner than when there were no alerts. 

Use of highly interactive HIV workstations for physicians can result in up to 20-percent decrease in hospitalization of HIV patients, increased use of primary care, and improved quality of care. From any of the terminals at the hospital or from home by telephone dialup, clinicians can access the patient data base and the HIV knowledge data base for improved patient care.
Computers and databases can be used to compare expected results with actual results and to help physicians make decisions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Decreased Costs


When a physician orders a test by computer, it can automatically display information that promotes cost-effective testing and treatment.

Total costs at Wishard Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis decreased $594 per admission (projected hospital savings: more than $3 million) when physicians used computers to write all inpatient orders. The workstations were linked to a comprehensive electronic medical record system. Total charges per admission were $887 less when workstations were used to write all inpatient orders at the hospital; tens of billions could be saved nationwide. 
Physicians ordered 14 percent fewer tests per outpatient visit when using computer workstations at a large primary care facility in Indianapolis. Workstations showed prior test results, predictions of abnormal results, and test prices.

Several analyses have detected substantial quality problems throughout the health care system. Information technology has consistently been identified as an important component of any approach for improvement. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is a promising technology that allows physicians to enter orders into a computer instead of handwriting them. Because CPOE fundamentally changes the ordering process, it can substantially decrease the overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services. Studies have documented that CPOE can decrease costs, shorten length of stay, decrease medical errors, and improve compliance with several types of guidelines. The costs of CPOE are substantial both in terms of technology and organizational process analysis and redesign, system implementation, and user training and support. Computerized physician order entry is a relatively new technology, and there is no consensus on the best approaches to many of the challenges it presents. This technology can yield many significant benefits and is an important platform for future changes to the health care system. Organizational leaders must advocate for CPOE as a critical tool in improving health care quality.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Confidentiality, Privacy, and Security Improving the quality of care through the use of computerized medical information systems must not override the need to protect individual rights to privacy. Strong safeguards must protect confidentiality. Patient rights, provider rights, and other concerns are being addressed to prevent inadvertent disclosure or alteration of computerized medical records.&lt;/br&gt;

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - HIPAA&lt;br /&gt;
In order to ensure the privacy, accuracy, and quality of a patient's medical records, The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services is required to develop standards and requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information that identifies individual patients. This law was established in 1996 and paved the way for patient confidentiality. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html], HIPAA&lt;/ref&gt;

== '''&lt;big&gt;Computerized Medical Charting Software&lt;/big&gt;''' ==

&lt;br /&gt;
Computerized Medical Charting Software is similar to the software used for business client software. It is a tool to document patient health status and history electronically. The purpose of using Charting software is to eliminate: &lt;br /&gt;

* loose paper work binders&lt;br /&gt;
* sketchy handwriting that is difficult to translate&lt;br /&gt;
* Difficult patient information sharing i.e. Request for information of medical record&lt;br /&gt;

Computerized charting is programmed with security software that upholds the HIPAA standards. Every employee in a healthcare facility is assign a userid and password to gain access to patient information. In terms that are understood by the everyday user, any patient information that is stored to a healthcare facility's computers are restricted to a need-to-know basis.  
&lt;ref name=&quot;test2&quot;&gt;[http://www.virtualcharting.com/web/admin/vc/hipaa.asp], HIPAA standards.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Employees are trained and contracted to HIPAA standards and restrictions are enforced for each employee. Logs for each employee userid are maintained and stored through the computer information technology department at the facility. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==The Database Behind the Charting Software==
&lt;br /&gt;
Computerized charting has a database as the background tool used to gather and store information regarding the patient. The database has a collection of data of the patients history and is then stored in to a virtual filing cabinet for future and present access. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt; [http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/privacy-main.html], Medical DB.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
There are several components of a database that make up the criteria with in the user interface: &lt;br /&gt;
* A file can have many tables, each containing related information. 
* Tables can be linked by a common field and made up of records
* A record contains information from many fields
* A field is one piece of information with in a record
* A key field uniquely identifies a record
&lt;ref name=&quot;test2&quot;&gt; [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/technology/tutorials/office/access03/access_components.php], DB components.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All the data is created and maintained by a system called database management system (DBMS). A DBMS is software that is maintained by a Database Administrator (DBA) with the purpose of maintaining, editing, and adding. Popular DBMS is MySQL Workbench. It allows a DBA to graphically administer and visually design database structures. Tables are established with built in definitions and criteria.
Once created and put into a form the actual user based software will help the medical staff user to retrieve, edit, and print a patients chart from the network of computers in a medical office setting and/or hospital. The information is stored over a network to a data center also called a mainframe that has large computer memory. &lt;ref name=&quot;test3&quot;&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/glh10/ist110/topic/topic07/topic07_05.html], DBMS.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

The different types of charting available on some medical software include patient history, billing, insurance, and employee information. A popular free online medical software is Practice Fusion. It enables an administrator to assign multiple users to the program. It is also useful for allied health students for EMR practice.  &lt;ref name=&quot;test4&quot;&gt;[https://pfws.practicefusion.com/apps/ehr/], Charting Software.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

== '''&lt;big&gt;Multimedia Imaging in Healthcare &lt;/big&gt;''' ==
===== MRI – State of the Art Multimedia Imaging =====
Multimedia plays a key role in Healthcare for medical procedures. Advancements in healthcare have paved the way for Medical diagnosis for several diseases. In particular, Dementia and Alzheimer Disease (AD) cases rely on multimedia imaging as the main source of diagnostic testing on its patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the latest form of technology for patients that suffer from Dementia and AD. Medical studies performed on patients have been able to demonstrate the on-set of the diseases and their progression in the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22989783], MRI Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; MRI testing has proved to be an essential tool for early diagnosis of AD and Dementia. It is now known that MRI testing can help predict Hippocampus atrophy in the brain which is the leading cause of AD. &lt;ref name=&quot;test2&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15324364], MRI early diagnosis of AD.&lt;/ref&gt; MRI’s are especially useful for presenting the case to patients and have been involved in case studies that show the progression of the disease that will help the future of predicting and diagnosing patients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== '''Distant Learning in Healthcare''' ==
The growing number adults that are continuing education that is either required by the employer, OSHA, or for a career change has presented increasing situations where the adult can't seem to fit in the time to physically be in a class room enviroment, distant learning is now an essential tool in the Healthcare field. There are numerous websites and apps that offer teaching tools for medical staff. Some websites offer continuing education resources that allow a working individual to learn new technologies that apply to the career. Many colleges offer adults distant, fast-track, online learning by partnering up with online course management systems such as Blackboard &lt;ref name=&quot;test2&quot;&gt;[https://www.blackboard.com], Blackboard&lt;/ref&gt; to communicate, facilitate, and simulate assignments to the adult student. Many instructors invite students to use online study tools from other education websites such as Healthstream.com &lt;ref name=&quot;test4&quot;&gt;[http://www.healthstream.com/index.aspx], Healthstream&lt;/ref&gt;. Healthstream simulates learning exercises that pertain to the medical field. The site takes you step by step through a particular subject and then evaluates the student by offering a quiz to assess the level of skill that the student has. 
Medical organizations are also taking advantage of this tool for students that have to continue their education while in practice to update procedures with new knowledge.

&lt;u&gt;'''Nanosensor developed for health screening'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;/u&gt;A NASA Ames scientist, Dr. Jing Li, has been working for years on what could be the greatest phone accessory of our lifetime. It’s a small computer chip that is about the size of a postage stamp that houses 32 nanosensor bars. Each bar is composed of a different nano-structure material. So, becuause each sensor bar is unique it can respond to different chemicals in different ways, enabling it to not only differentiate between them, but also to monitor their relative levels, in real time. Right now, the nanosensor chip is located within a cell phone case and, it's thought, that a person would just breathe on the cell phone housing. 

Originally, this nanosensor technology was developed by NASA Ames for space applications. The first usage in 2008 was monitoring for fuel leaks around launch vehicles. So that’s where it began, but the Department of Homeland Security is now funding this project. Not only is the Department of Homeland security funding this project but, the Department of Defense is funding an implementation where soldiers could wear these to alert them of chemical threats. However, the mobile phone implementation is aimed at the general consumer market. 

The computer chip only draws 5 milliwatts, which means very little battery is used. The smartphone they tested it with can use the sensor for eight continuous hours on a single charge. Right now, the applicaton is primarily being developed to monitor carbon monoxyde as well as chlorine, ammonia and methane in homes. However, with a mobile phone application, the phone could automatically send data back to the Department of Homeland Security or other emergency services agencies, which would give them a big-picture look at a larger area and let them know if a mass evacuation is needed.

As  mentioned the most exciting potential use, though, is how it could diagnose and monitor people with medical conditions. For example, for diabetes patients there is a direct correlation between the level of acetone in their breath and the level of sugar in their blood. The nanosensor could be used as a completely non-invasive diagnosis and measurement method. Diabetic patients could possibly get a glucose reading right from their phone. Thus, turning their phone into a glucometer. Also, there is a correlation between nitrous oxide and lung cancer. Scientists have already trained dogs to accomplish this, but the nanosensor too has a &quot;nose&quot; for &quot;sniffing out cancer&quot;.  

Scientists and technologists believe the health applications are endless with this new nanosensor.

&lt;u&gt;'''Mobile application software for diabetes management'''&lt;/u&gt;

Recently, Telcare, Inc. unveiled its new &quot;MyTelcare Diabetes Pal&quot;, now available for free on the Apple App Store. Telcare is offering people with diabetes and their caregivers the world’s first iPhone app that automatically synchronizes with a wireless glucose meter. 

“Telcare’s free App is designed to empower every patient by eliminating the hurdles that have made the analysis of glucose readings so time consuming,“ said Telcare CEO, Dr. Jonathan Javitt, MD. He went on to say, “We want to increase patients’ understanding of their diabetes and help them and their caregivers properly manage the disease.” 

According to their press release, Telcare BGM™ (glucose meter) introduced the industry’s first FDA-cleared, cellular-enabled blood glucose meter. The new MyTelcare Diabetes Pal App allows patients and caregivers to use their iPhone to visualize every glucose reading sent by the Telcare glucose meter while keeping track of their medication medication, nutrition, activities, and notes. The application also enables patients who don’t have the Telcare BGM to manually enter their blood glucose data and track it over time. 

This is the first diabetic application software to automatically capture data from a blood glucose meter with no extra steps on the part of the patient. This is also the first app designed to share those results with health professionals and family members. For example, a doctor in his office can review the results of all diabetes patients in the practice and a mother sitting at her job can know how her child with diabetes is doing at school in &quot;real-time&quot;.

The MyTelcare Diabetes Pal App for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad allows people with diabetes and their caregivers to: 


Track from anywhere: This new app combines the power of cellular technology with the newest Apple development tools to synchronize blood glucose, medication and nutrition data from anywhere. With each blood glucose test taken with the Telcare BGM, the app is instantly updated with the newest BG number. For non-Telcare BGM users, the App provides a user-friendly way to update each blood glucose log.


Discover trends: With over ten professionally designed graphs and charts, users are able identify trends based on Time of Day, Prescription Adherence, Target Zones, Day of the Week, Standard Deviation, Before and After Meals, Before and After Activity, and more. Users are also able to generate and email a one page, physician-optimized report in approximately 5 seconds. All data can be exported to Microsoft Excel.


Share data with others: All data are automatically stored at http://www.mytelcare.com, Telcare’s HIPAA-compliant cloud server. Users are able to automatically share their data with health professionals, family members, and others who may be involved in their care. This feature is particularly important to the parents of children with diabetes and to the adult children of elderly people with diabetes. 

MyTelcare Diabetes Pal is available for FREE from the App Store at http://www.itunes.com/appstore or downloaded directly at http://bit.ly/yNeWix. The App is compatible with the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.

      <comment>/* The &quot;Mother&quot; of the MP3 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">

Computers have come a long way in the entertainment/music area. We have watched music evolve from the record album to the 8 track players to cassettes and now compact discs (CD's) and portable media players (PMP).  
We can either play CD's on the computer or download music from the internet. 
Years ago we used to use an engine called Napster to download music.  Now we have engines like 'Limewire' (file sharing software) where we do not have to pay to download music. 

We have the option to either rip songs from existing CD's onto new blank CD's or download music from the internet and burn songs onto a CD.  There are other options we can use which are downloading onto MP3 players or iPods. A portable multimedia player, or PMP is a hard disk or flash memory based electronic device, such as an &quot;MP3 player&quot;, which is capable of storing and playing files in one or more media formats. MP3 format is a compression system for music.  The MP3 format helps reduce the number of bytes in a song without hurting the quality of the song's sound. With MP3, a 32 megabyte (MB) song on a CD compresses to about 3 MB.  This lets you download a song in minutes rather than hours, and store hundreds of songs on your hard disc without taking up much space. The main attraction of portable media players is often their versatility: being able to load and play different formats of video (including MPEG, DivX, and XviD), audio (including MP3, WAV, and Ogg Vorbis), or digital images, (including BMP, JPEG, and GIF). Some even count some Handheld game consoles like sony's PSP and GamePark Holdings' GP2X as being a PMP for their media playing capabilities.
[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/mp31.htm| http://computer.howstuffworks.com/mp31.htm]

A portable video player is a type of portable media player which focuses on the playback of digital video. Some portable media players can store and display digital images. In this instance the Apple 5th-generation iPod could be considered a portable media player- as it is capable of playing back audio as well as displaying digital pictures and video. Also the Creative Zen Vision:M is another player that can play both audio and video, picks up FM Radio and records voice as well as the larger screened (2.5&quot; to 4&quot; respectively) Zen Vision. The Sony HMP-A1, released only in Japan and Europe, had these same capabilities as well as longer battery life. The Samsung Yepp YP-T8 also provided these capabilities, as well as voice, FM radio, and line recording. It also included a USB host capability for link up to other portable devices without the use of a PC. Some other examples of portable media players with these capabilities include the Archos Gmini series, aigo E-858, X2 MegaView series, the Neuros 442, the iriver series of media players, the Olympus m:robe, the acclaimed iStation v43, MP4 Star by Intechip Corp. and the Cowon A2. MSI developed and showcased the first solar powered player, the MSI MEGA 540, at CeBIT in Hannover, Germany [1]. Other portable media players combine a focus on recording capability with playback features, for example the Neuros Recorder 2 records as well as plays back several audio and video formats.

The bundled software used for transferring music, photos and videos is called iTunes.  As a music jukebox application, iTunes stores a comprehensive library of music on the user's computer and can play, burn and rip music from a CD.  The most recent version of iTunes has photo and video synchronization features. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player

The iPod is currently the world's best-selling digital audio player, and its worldwide mainstream adoption makes it one of the most popular consumer brands.  

It will be interesting to see what the future holds for music technology.


[[Category:The Computer Revolution]]

We have come a long way from playing music from the early days only on vinyl, 8 tracks, or cassette form. Now of days you can enjoy listening to music on CD’s through the computer using Windows Media Player by default or downloading them to your favorite MP3 Player. If Windows Media Player doesn’t want to play for any reason like in Windows 7 with the newer version of Windows Media Player 12 because of the darn wma server execution error, you can use any of the following players to play your music that include ACE Mega Codecs Pack, Banshee, ITunes, Nero, Overdrive Media Console, QuickTime Player, Real Player, Rhapsody, Winamp, and VLC Player to name a few. If you want to purchase a CD you can listen to it first before purchasing a disc you would hate spending $20 for it. You can use several sites on the internet to check them out. My favorite websites include YouTube, MySpace, Kazaa, Rhapsody, Napster, or ITunes. The best website to my knowledge for the past two years being visually impaired and works the best with accessibility software such as JAWS and Zoom Text is Kazaa. Even though it’s a paid subscription for $19.99 a month you get unlimited downloads of the entire collection to play through Windows Media Player or Winamp. Plus you can download unlimited ringtones of the tracks to your cell phone for free since it is a part of the subscription. I have thrown away my package to my cell company since they were charging 3.00 for 1 ringtones at a time.


Media Players are software programs for playing multimedia files, audio or video on your computer. Windows has various types of free downloadable devices you can choose from. You can create your own library of playlists by purchasing music through ITunes and transferring them to a cd. I like purchasing the music because you just buy the songs you really like. These playlists allow you to burn cd’s or watch dvd’s. You can also stream music on your computer (listening) while working on files or documents. I found that out this year when I wanted to listen to music but didn’t have a small radio or cd player. This is a nice feature and I don’t normally use media players. My husband has burned cd’s for our car cd player using this. But you have to be careful because of copyright laws, do not do this to sell music. It hurts the artists and record companies who are trying to sell their music.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Computer Revolution as a Business Tool ==
Computers are an indispensable tool for doing business. This is the plain truth that all businesses large or small must understand. When I was a kid, on allowance day, I'd cycle over to Mr. Lee's candy store and buy 25 cents of mixed candy. Mr. Lee knowing how much I preferred the sugar coated strawberries to those mini-tootsie rolls would fill the order (a little brown bag) top heavy with those delicious strawberries, a smattering of other sweets, and at the most one or two tootsie rolls. Unlike the competition up the street at the Blue Jeans candy store where no matter how you protested the order was always filled with goodies in equal amounts, Mr. Lee understood the business principle of customization. In fact, I'm sure that if Mr. Lee were doing business today, he would be keeping track of his customer's buying habits with a computer like so many successful businesses are doing. 

Consider this: When you shop at retailers like Superstore, Home Depot, Staples and so on, virtually all of the products on the shelf are there in an attempt to fit the shopper’s tastes. How do these retailers know the shopping habits of thousands people? Simple, they are tracking and recording purchases at the check out counter with a computer. More sophisticated software programs will record demographics like age, address, sex, occupation, and how much money you spend.

But computers don't just help record customer purchases. They are critical in managing inventories of literally thousands of products. This aids retailers in deciding how much and when to replenish there stocks; what is selling like hotcakes and what isn’t moving.

Perhaps most important of all, computers can track the flow of money. Accounting applications like Excel and Quicken allow retailers to keep record of debits and credits, profits and losses, charitable donations, and theft. They are useful for keeping the all important tax records too. Computers streamline business and keep costs down while enabling faster and more efficient service.

Anyway, my name is [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]], and I am a wikibookian. I would be willing to help you and your friends if you would like. Feel free to send me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]] if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

Good luck!. --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]] 03:45, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

== Help and Etiquette ==

I'm glad to hear about your project, wikibooks has hosted a number of collaborative teaching projects, such as [[Human Physiology]], [[CPCN]], and [[XML]]. The [[The Computer Revolution]] book is definately in need of some love and care, so I am happy that your class is working on it. 

As to etiquette (and I am sure i'm spelling that incorrectly), there isn't much to worry about, so long as your [[Wikibooks:Be nice|students are nice]]. If you need help, we have a (mostly complete) [[Help:Contents|help book]] available, to learn all the specifics about wikitext markup, page editing, etc. If you or anybody in your class need anything else, please don't hesitate to ask me anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:50, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

== Page moves ==

Hello Areil, how are things going?

I see that you've been moving some pages around, and while I hate to be the bearer of bad news, I have to inform you that you are moving them wrong. When you move a page, you should specify the destination address in &quot;wikistyle&quot;, not as a URL. For instance, you should move pages to:

[[The Computer Revolution/introduction/effect on society/health]]

and not to:

[[Http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The Computer Revolution/introduction/effect on society/health]]

I will fix the pages that you have already moved for you. If you have any questions, please let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

:You can make a link to a local page by using two square brackets: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Computer Revolution/introduction/effect on society/health]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; makes: [[The Computer Revolution/introduction/effect on society/health]].

:And you can rename a link to whatever you want it to be: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Computer Revolution/introduction/effect on society/health|HEALTH]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; makes: [[The Computer Revolution/introduction/effect on society/health|HEALTH]].

:If you want to make a sub-page off a given page, you can just say: [[/sub page/]], and the software will automatically make the link as if you had typed [[User:Areil123/sub page/]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

== Page Move Corrections ==

I fixed your bad page moves. When you move a page, DO NOT MOVE IT TO &quot;http://...&quot; This is wrong. Instead, just move it to the name of the page you want. For instance, do not move a page to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The Computer Revolution/page&lt;/nowiki&gt;, instead, move it to &quot;The Computer Revolution/page&quot;. The server will automatically fill in the rest. 

If you have any more questions, let me know. If you want a page moved, and you aren't sure how to do it correctly, send me a message, and I will do it for you. Also, when you leave a comment somewhere, you can sign your name to it by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;~~~~&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (four tildes). The server will automaticall replace that with your username. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

== Your Book ==

Sorry It has taken me so long to reply to you, I've been very busy lately. I have seen your book, and with the exception of a few problems with page links, the book looks good. I would like to point you to a page that the community and I have been writing: [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]. This is just a draft now, but I hope that you can learn things from it, and that eventually you can add your thoughts to it as well. Please let me know if you need anything else. Good luck with your project. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:33, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

:By the way, we have also started a page at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]], where you can list your class project, make comments about it, and ask for help. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:39, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Using images from Commons ==

G'day, I just found your local copy of a mitochondria image from Commons, [[:Image:Diagram of a human mitochondrion.svg]]. When an image is hosted on Commons, you can use it directly within your Wikibook without having to upload it here. Just put in the image name as if it was a local image, and the wiki software will do the rest for you. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:24, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== [[Realpedia]] ==

This book is up for deletion at [[WB:VFD#Realpedia]]. Since you're the primary contributor, please comment and vote on it's deletion. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:40, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

:I see that you're planning on using this for your family's homeschooling. But what is the book supposed to be? If it's going to be a random collection of facts (which is what it is now... albeit only 2 of them), then that's not a textbook. [[WB:WIW#What Wikibooks Includes|Wikibooks is for textbooks]]; if you need help to determine whether [[Realpedia]] is going to fit within our project's scope, please [[WB:SLN|ask]].
:Please lay out the scope of the book and at least a rudimentary outline so we know whether to delete it (if outside project scope) or not. The main issue is not the lack of content, but rather that there is no organization, no indication that it will be developed into a ''textbook'' and no indication of planning. Just because [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider|you're going to fill it with content]] doesn't mean we can keep it here. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:00, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

:: Everything is on-topic ''someplace''. The trick is finding that place.
:: I'm pretty sure that, contrary to popular belief, most books are written by collecting a bunch of random information that the author is interested in. Only afterward does the author shuffle the order of that information, and cut out things that don't seem to &quot;fit&quot; (saving them for the next book), to give the appearance of organization.
:: If, like most book authors, you can't create a rough draft of an outline ahead of time, then wikibooks is not the best place to start writing -- there are lots of other places that are better places to begin incubate your &quot;realpedia&quot;. I found it pretty easy to create a new wiki on one of the free wiki hosts ([[Wiki_Science/How_to_start_a_Wiki#Free_wiki_hosting]]). Perhaps you could consider creating a new wiki on one of those free hosts, and temporarily moving &quot;realpedia&quot; there. Later once you've filled it out a bit and have an outline, you could move some or all of it back to Wikibooks (if it's a book) or some other more appropriate wiki.
:: Is there any way I can help? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:00, 10 October 2007 (UTC)
:: p.s. I'm also encouraging all homeschoolers to check out http://nanowrimo.org/ . --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:00, 10 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

To complete the rotation, the dancer can perform another toe-heel half-turn, or another step, such as pokhid skladnye.

The step may also be performed towards the left.

== For Experienced Programmers ==

'''D''' is very similar to languages like C++ and Java. Therefore, if you have experience with those languages, you can probably pick up D by simply reading the [[/D Transition Guide/]].

== Status of this Text ==

This book will be a guide to people starting to program using the D programming language.  It is intended for a range of audiences, from people new to programming to the seasoned programmer. The book has been arranged so that you can follow the suggested chapter order, which will lead you through the concepts such that you can use them before finishing the book. Alternatively, you can select the chapters as you see fit, skipping over some things that you might already be familiar with.

This book does not include a comprehensive introduction to programming as there are many sources for that already, though it does have a [[/Short Introduction to Programming/|''refresher'']] on the topic.

The content of this book is based on the use of the Phobos standard library which comes with the DigitalMars dmd compiler.

Before contributing, please read the [[/Style Guide/]].

: The Table of Contents is almost done, so this book is now open for content.  If you want to write a page, first read the [[/Style Guide/]], then choose a page, replace the text in the list below with a link to the name you want like so:
&lt;pre&gt;[[/Chapter/]] or [[/Chapter/Section Title/|Section Title]]&lt;/pre&gt;
(The /'s are important), and put some note on the page to say you're going to handle it (to try to minimize duplication).

== Table of Contents ==

(These titles are not final, and beyond chapter 2 they're not even good titles.  Before making a page, please give it a good title)

Things to be added (in no particular order; feel free to add these yourself):
* Preprocessor-like functionality:
** Pragmas
** Conditional Compilation
* Mixins
** Probably in the (to-be-described) templates section
* Function Pointers and Delegates
** If the Advanced Functions chapter comes after Advanced OO, this fits there.
* Garbage Collection
** Not sure where to put this
* Scoped statements
** Not sure where to put this
* Type-casting
** Needs to be in multiple places
* Array literals
** Probably should be in [[/The Basics/Types and Math/]]
* Signals and slots
* Tuples
* 'scope' for object variables
* Sockets
* Threads
